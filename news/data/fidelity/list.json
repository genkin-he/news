It made for pretty grim reading: the loss of millions of office jobs will destroy demand, plunging the economy into a deflationary tailspin.</p>\n<p>Is that possible? Sure, in the sense that anything is possible. But when markets are being spooked by apocalyptic long-form blogposts, it's time to ask if we are in the midst of an AI doom bubble.</p>\n<p>The software sector got a slight boost on Tuesday when a new round of plug-ins from Anthropic highlighted the potential for AI upstarts to partner with legacy firms instead of replacing them.</p>\n<p>But, as is often the case, fear trumps hope, and both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq fell on Thursday.</p>\n<p>This was - perhaps surprisingly - after the announcement of another strong quarter from Nvidia - its 14th consecutive revenue beat. The <money>$4.5 trillion</money> chipmaker on Wednesday posted better-than-expected results for the January quarter and also forecast above-market estimates for current quarter revenue. Its share price initially rose, but then pulled back, likely because the good news was already baked in and concerns - such as rising competition and customer concentration - remain.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, two months into the year, the country with the best performing equity market by far is Korea. The benchmark KOSPI index may have slid slightly on Friday, but it's up more than 48% in the year to date. This eye-popping figure might suggest fevered speculation is at play, but that's not necessarily the case - and there is reason to believe it could still have room to run.</p>\n<p>Moving over to M&amp;A, the months-long battle between Paramount Skydance and Netflix to acquire Warner Bros Discovery appears to be over, with the former coming out on top with its revised <money>$31</money>-a-share offer.</p>\n<p>Turning back to anxiety, another major source of it this week was the ongoing standoff between <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location> and <location value=\"LC/ir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Iran</location> over <location value=\"LU/ir..tehran\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Tehran's</location> nuclear program. The two held indirect talks in <location value=\"LU/ch..geneva\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Geneva</location> on Thursday.</p>\n<p>While crude prices fell following claims that progress in the negotiations had been made, Brent crude was up again early on Friday, trading above <money>$71</money> a barrel. Discussions will resume in <location value=\"LU/at..vienna\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Vienna</location> next week, which means the waiting game continues.</p>\n<p>One party that may benefit from the geopolitical noise is OPEC+. The volatile headlines have weighed on prices, giving the producer group cover to stick to its \"balanced market\" narrative, despite many facts on the ground that suggest otherwise. OPEC+ is expected to announce a 137,000 barrel per day increase in output when it meets on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Speaking of energy, one would have needed a lot of it to stay up though all of President <person>Donald Trump's</person> State of the Union address on Tuesday, which clocked in at a record one hour and 47 minutes. It offered little in the way of new ideas for addressing Americans' affordability concerns, with the exception of a plan to boost Americans' retirement savings. The president also vowed to move forward with his tariff agenda even after a large portion of it was quashed by the <org>Supreme Court</org> last week.</p>\n<p>One notable takeaway from the speech was the president's claim that hyperscalers &quot;have the obligation to provide for their own power needs&quot; as they build out energy-hungry data centers to fuel the AI boom. The administration wants to avoid stressing the grid and pushing up consumers' electricity prices.</p>\n<p>But the pressure is already building, and whether or not companies cover their own power needs, ambitious AI expansion plans are likely to be hobbled by severe power-infrastructure bottlenecks.</p>\n<p>It's a reminder that instead of fretting about viral AI doomsday reports, we should probably spend a little more time considering the very real physical limitations that could slow down this technological revolution.</p>\n<p>For more commodities and markets news, check out Reuters Open Interest.

By automating the way we create, analyze, and share intelligence, it’s stripped away the manual ‘detective work’ of digging through emails and building static PDFs. We now have a modern way to share information with officers and identify cross-jurisdictional patterns in minutes, processes that used to take us days of phone calls and coordination.”\n\n</p><p>\nAs communities and policymakers renew focus on public safety at both the local and national level, technology that helps agencies operate more efficiently and collaboratively is more important than ever. Most law enforcement software is decades old and was not designed for real-time intelligence sharing across departments. Important leads often sit in email threads, stuck in a list serve, or never make it beyond one agency, slowing investigations and creating blind spots.\n\n</p><p>\n“Cops run on information, but there’s never been a true system for sharing it beyond individual inboxes,” said <person>Matt White</person>, CEO and Co-Founder of Multitude Insights. “Officers shouldn’t have to dig through emails or call neighboring departments to find out if someone else has seen the same suspect, vehicle, or pattern. These professionals are most effective when they’re out in the community, not stuck behind a computer. BLTN gives agencies one secure place to publish and search crime bulletins and other critical intelligence, so the right information actually reaches the people who need it, with zero effort.”\n\n</p><p>\nWorking in a complex government environment can come with unique challenges, and the team at Multitude Insights is perfectly built to meet those challenges. “Law enforcement is a highly regulated environment where security and legal discipline are critical,” said <person>Akihiko Izu</person>, COO and Co-Founder of Multitude Insights. “This discipline is core to how we built the company from day one, and this investment enables us to deepen both as we scale our platform for mission-critical customers.”\n\n</p><p>\nBLTN is Multitude Insights’ core platform that allows agencies to create bulletins, instantly share them with trusted partners nationwide, and automatically surface connections between related cases - helping departments collaborate in ways that previously weren’t possible.\n\n</p><p>\n“Multitude Insights has cracked the code for modern law enforcement technology. They deliver immediate value by using AI to dramatically cut down on time spent on paperwork, ensuring officers are out in the community, not stuck behind a computer,” said <person>Jason Shuman</person>, General Partner at <org>Primary Venture Partners</org>. “Crucially, they’ve also built a dynamic network effect. By streamlining collaboration and intelligence sharing, BLTN is not just improving single-agency operations—it’s enabling every participating community to solve crimes faster and more effectively.”\n\n</p><p>\n“Real-time data that drives proactive investigative tools are critical for modern law enforcement agencies to keep up with the overwhelming amount of information they receive daily,” said <person>Edward Davis</person>, Senior Advisor at <org>Commonweal Ventures</org> and former Police Commissioner of <location value=\"LU/us.ma.boston\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Boston, MA.</location> “As new technology becomes available to law enforcement, it is also available to criminals and terrorists. With help from the team at Multitude, police will continue to adapt and overcome. Technology saves lives.”\n\n</p><p>\n\"Law enforcement agencies need technology that enables seamless collaboration across jurisdictions. When intelligence can be shared and analyzed efficiently, officers can better connect the dots to keep communities safe,\" said <person>Craig P. Abod</person>, President of Carahsoft Technology. \"Multitude Insights is addressing a critical need in public safety—they're transforming information into actionable intelligence that crosses jurisdictional boundaries seamlessly.\"\n\n</p><p>\nAs agencies nationwide modernize their technology stacks and seek smarter ways to coordinate across jurisdictions, intelligence sharing is emerging as one of the most urgent and underbuilt areas in public safety. With new capital, expanding integrations, and growing agency adoption, Multitude Insights is playing a central role in shaping how law enforcement leverages modern technology to operate more efficiently, collaboratively, and proactively.

The debut of XTEND’s Seek &amp; Strike solution marked the first public demonstration of human-in-the-loop (HITL) supervision driving multi-drone collaboration and highlights XTEND’s ongoing commitment to providing scalable, adaptable solutions to meet the evolving needs of defense, law enforcement and private security markets.</p>  <p align=\"justify\">The demonstration featured an interoperable fleet of drones performing highly synchronized, variable tasks as a unified team. Operating under strict HITL architecture, it reinforced XTEND’s strategic identity as a software-first, XOS-driven platform company, while firmly establishing its position as pioneer in advanced multi-drone collaboration.</p>  <p align=\"center\"> Image: Picture2 <br/></p>  <p align=\"justify\">“XOS natively handles the heavy lifting of spatial cognition and autonomous data handoffs between Seeker and Effector; this cross-platform autonomous coordination entirely eliminates the friction of manual piloting,” said <person>Aviv Shapira</person>, Co-Founder and CEO of XTEND. “By reducing operator dependency and dramatically shortening deployment timelines, XOS enables us to scale efficiently across new customers, platforms, and geographies. Its modular, software-driven architecture supports rapid integration of additional robotic assets and third-party systems, creating a foundation for recurring software adoption and long-term expansion of the XTEND ecosystem.”</p>  <p align=\"justify\">During the Seek &amp; Strike demonstration, the operator used the XOS Mission Planner to seamlessly orchestrate a complex operation, defining AI-driven micro-tasks. A team of Seeker drones autonomously scanned a designated area, detecting and classifying potential targets with onboard edge-perception. Upon anomaly detection, the human operator visually confirmed the target, and XOS automatically handed off the data to a team of Precision Effector drones, which then executed a coordinated homing approach. Throughout the operation, the human operator maintained full control, with the ability to re-task and abort missions instantly, ensuring safety, adherence to rules of engagement, and ultimate decision-making authority.</p>  <p align=\"center\"> Image: Picture1 <br/></p>  <p align=\"justify\">As adversarial environments and security challenges grow increasingly complex, the traditional one-to-one ratio of operator-to-drone creates unsustainable cognitive bottlenecks. XTEND’s XOS platform enables the autonomous orchestration of drones, reducing the load for operators and ensuring more precise, rapid responses in dynamic, high-stakes environments.</p>  <p align=\"justify\">XTEND participated in <em>Disruptors in the Desert</em> alongside <org>Congressional and Department of Defense</org> leadership, engaging in discussions on how AI, orchestration, and interoperability will define the next era of <org>U.S. Department of War</org> (DoW) superiority.</p>  <p align=\"justify\">As announced on <chron>February 17</chron>, <org value=\"JFB.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >JFB Construction Holdings</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='JFB' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( JFB )</span> and XTEND entered into a definitive agreement to combine with XTEND in an all-stock transaction. The business combination is further supported by strategic investments from <person>Eric Trump</person>, Unusual Machines, <org>American Ventures, LLC</org>, <org>Protego Ventures</org>, and <org>Aliya Capital</org>. Following the closing of the business combination, the joint company is expected to be renamed XTEND AI Robotics and be listed on a U.S. national stock exchange under the ticker “XTND.”</p>  <p align=\"center\"> Image: Picture3 <br/></p>  <p align=\"justify\"><strong>About XTEND</strong></p>  <p align=\"justify\">XTEND is a leader in software systems and artificial intelligence-powered robotics, deployed in high-threat, complex operational environments where human exposure carries significant risk.

This is a premium to the five-year mean of 18x, which we think is warranted given the company's strong pipeline for store expansion. Q4 results were a bit underwhelming, particularly the 1.5% same-store sales growth, a notable deceleration from previous quarters. However, L did manage to alleviate some fears, noting a tough Y/Y comp (last year benefited from more promo activity) and an acceleration in growth through Q4 and into Q1. However, there is some weakness in certain categories like liquor and tobacco, which is weighing on overall growth. L guides for high-single-digit EPS growth, which we think could be a bit conservative given the somewhat consistent double-digit EPS growth over the past several years. L continues to open new stores (another year of about 70+), with a focus on discount banners as Canadians increasingly flock towards more value-oriented stores.

That said, we expect margins in the Hostess business to improve in FY 27 following recent restructuring actions. We are also constructive on margin expansion in coffee next year, supported by lower commodity costs and the recent removal of coffee tariffs. Core brands such as Uncrustables, <org>Cafe Bustelo</org>, Meow Mix, and Milk-Bone continue to perform well. Oversight from Elliott Management could help unlock incremental shareholder value.

            "description": "\n<p><location value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >SAN FRANCISCO</location>, <chron>Feb.  27, 2026</chron>  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Flux, the AI-powered platform for hardware design, today announced <money>$37M</money> of new investment, including a <money>$27M</money> Series B led by 8VC, with participation from existing investors including <org>Bain Capital Ventures</org>, Liquid 2 Ventures, and <org>Outsiders Fund</org>.</p>  <p>Flux also disclosed a previously unannounced <money>$10M</money> Series A led by <org>Outsiders Fund</org> and co-led by <org>Bain Capital Ventures</org>.</p>  <p>It’s yet more fuel for the <location>Silicon Valley</location> startup leading a grassroots revolution in hardware design.</p>  <p>Flux is the world’s first AI hardware engineer, trained on hundreds of thousands of real-world designs and fine-tuned for common design tasks. With nothing more than natural language prompts, Flux’s agentic AI works with users to plan circuit-board layouts, source components, and test designs. It outputs everything a manufacturer needs to produce a finished product. It even suggests ways to minimize costs and reduce supply-chain risks.</p>  <p>And it does all this in the web browser—no desktop application required.</p>  <p>“With Flux, you can have a brilliant idea one day and hold the finished product in your hand a few weeks later,” said Flux CEO <person>Matthias Wagner</person>.</p>  <p>More than 1 million makers, designers, and entrepreneurs have used Flux to design nearly 6.5 million devices, from wearables to robots to smart home controllers and drone navigation systems.</p>  <p><person>One Flux</person> customer built an IoT device that extracts data from construction machinery, taking the entire project from concept to production without hiring an electrical engineer.</p>  <p>Another is using Flux to design and ship custom electronics throughout <location value=\"LR/afr\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Africa</location>.</p>  <p>Yet another uses Flux to build IoT-enabled organ-on-chip platforms for drug discovery and biological barrier modeling.</p>  <p>With Flux, anyone can become a builder. In the past, designers had two options: They could hire electrical engineers to design PCB boards from scratch or buy OEM components off the shelf. But many smaller businesses can’t afford to hire, and don’t want to pay for OEM parts that do more than they need.</p>  <p>Flux gives them a third option: AI that delivers bespoke PCBs at near-material costs. Flux’s custom layouts reduce the need for complex multi-board integration, resulting in faster, cheaper production and easier maintenance in the field.</p>  <p>“We wrote Flux’s first check when they were only a few founders with an audacious vision to transform hardware design,” said 8VC partner Francisco Gimenez. “Seven years later, they’re redefining who can build electronic hardware. Their market is not simply electrical engineers designing PCBs. It’s the universe of makers from individuals to businesses to whole industries. We’re privileged to renew our support.”</p>  <p>Flux plans to use the new funding to extend its AI to even more complex electronic use cases.</p>  <p>“Historically, building hardware has been insanely difficult,” said Flux CEO Wagner. “When you’re working with atoms instead of electrons, everything costs more and takes longer. Those limitations have always kept hardware in the hands of an elite few. By bringing the cost of design down to near-zero, we’re giving millions of non-experts the ability to build for niche audiences—or make something for themselves. The electronics business has always been structured around giant manufacturers. Now, for the first time, Flux puts creators at the center.”</p>  <p><strong>About Flux:</strong><br/>Flux is the AI hardware engineer—a new kind of AI agent that goes from text prompt to manufactured board in a single browser tab. Flux is leading a paradigm shift in hardware design with its end-to-end, eCAD environment, which includes integrated workflows, reusable blocks, and modern collaboration tools. Headquartered in <location value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >San Francisco</location>, Flux is backed by investors including 8VC, <org>Bain Capital Ventures</org>, Liquid 2 Ventures, and <org>Outsiders Fund</org>, along with Figma board member <person>John Lilly</person> and Github founder <person>Tom Preston-Werner</person>.</p>  <p><strong>Media contact:</strong><br/>Meghana Patnana<br/><org>Firebrand Communications for Flux</org><br/>flux@firebrand.marketing<br/>415-848-9175</p>  Image: https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTY2Mjg1MiM3NDU4Nzk5IzIzMDYyMzM=  <br/> Image: https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/MzNlMzgyNjMtOTUwMC00ZGI5LWE1NDUtZDhjNjM1MDZiYzU2LTEzMTc3ODMtMjAyNi0wMi0yNy1lbg==/tiny/Flux.png <p> Image: Primary Logo </p>\nSource: Flux\n",

The increase in total revenue was due primarily to performance bonuses earned during the fourth quarter of 2025, as well as higher wholesale capacity services revenue resulting from additional service fees associated with the reimbursement of network-related costs.\n\n</p><p>\nRevenue was also impacted favorably by (1) an increase in Commercial IoT related revenue due to higher average subscribers and device sales, which was offset partially by a decline in Duplex and SPOT driven revenue due to subscriber churn; and (2) revenue recognized under our service agreement with Parsons Corporation as we moved beyond the proof of concept phase during 2025, which was offset by a decrease in revenue from XCOM RAN sales.\n\n</p><p>\n<i>Loss from Operations</i>\n\n</p><p>\nLoss from operations was <money>$0.4 million</money> during the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to a loss from operations of <money>$4.2 million</money> during the prior year's fourth quarter. This improvement was due to higher revenue (as discussed above) offset partially by an increase in operating expenses (as discussed below).\n\n</p><p>\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2025, higher cost of services, marketing, general and administrative (\"MG&amp;A\") expenses and cost of subscriber equipment sales were offset partially by lower stock-based compensation expenses. Higher cost of services resulted primarily from network operating costs to support the build out of our next-generation satellite and ground network infrastructure, a significant portion of which are reimbursed to us, and this consideration is recognized as revenue. Additionally, costs increased to support the development of XCOM RAN technology and new MSS products. MG&amp;A expense was higher than the prior year's fourth quarter due primarily to legal and professional fees.\n\n</p><p>\nThe cost of subscriber equipment sales increased during the fourth quarter of 2025 due to higher hardware sales as well as <money>$1.1 million</money> in expense related to tariffs on equipment imported and re-exported to foreign subsidiaries. These tariffs were previously recorded as recoverable duty drawbacks but are no longer deemed probable of being refunded.\n\n</p><p>\n<i>Net Loss</i>\n\n</p><p>\nNet loss was <money>$11.6 million</money> for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to net loss of <money>$50.2 million</money> for the fourth quarter of 2024. This improvement was due primarily to a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the paydown of the 2023 13% Notes recorded during the fourth quarter of 2024. Favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to the remeasurement of intercompany balances as well as a non-cash gain on the quarterly mark-to-market adjustment of our derivative asset gain were offset by higher interest expense resulting from our recognition of non-cash imputed interest related to the 2024 Prepayment Agreement (as defined in our periodic reports).\n\n</p><p>\n<i>Adjusted EBITDA</i>\n\n</p><p>\nAdjusted EBITDA increased to <money>$32.4 million</money> for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to <money>$30.4 million</money> for the same period in 2024. This 7% increase was due to an increase in revenue of <money>$10.8 million</money> offset partially by a <money>$8.8 million</money> increase in operating expenses (excluding adjustments for non-cash or non-recurring items).\n\n</p><p>\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information, refer to “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA.”\n\n</p><p>\n<b>ANNUAL FINANCIAL REVIEW</b>\n\n</p><p>\n<i>Revenue</i>\n\n</p><p>\nTotal revenue was <money>$273.0 million</money> during the twelve months ended <chron>December 31, 2025</chron>, including <money>$257.3 million</money> of service revenue and <money>$15.7 million</money> of revenue generated from subscriber equipment sales. Total revenue increased 9% from 2024, reaching a record high for the fourth consecutive year. This increase was due to higher service revenue and higher revenue from subscriber equipment sales.\n\n</p><p>\nService revenue increased <money>$19.6 million</money>, or 8%, during the twelve months ended <chron>December 31, 2025</chron>, compared to the same period in 2024 due to increases in wholesale capacity services. Revenue from subscriber equipment sales increased <money>$3.0 million</money>, or 24%, during the twelve months ended <chron>December 31, 2025</chron>, compared to the same period in 2024 due to a higher volume of Commercial IoT device sales.\n\n</p><p>\n<i>Income (Loss) from Operations</i>\n\n</p><p>\nIncome from operations was <money>$7.4 million</money> during 2025 compared to loss from operations of <money>$0.9 million</money> during 2024 due to higher revenue (as discussed above) offset partially by higher operating expenses (as discussed below).\n\n</p><p>\nHigher cost of services, MG&amp;A expense and cost of subscriber equipment sales were offset partially by lower stock-based compensation expenses. A non-cash loss on disposal of assets during the first quarter of 2025 also increased operating expenses. The drivers of higher cost of services, MG&amp;A expense and cost of subscriber equipment sales for the full year 2025 compared to 2024 are generally consistent with the quarterly increases noted above. Costs incurred to enhance and develop our XCOM RAN product and service offerings were also impacted by our recognition of certain non-cash amortized costs beginning in <chron>May 2024</chron>.\n\n</p><p>\nOperating expenses were partially offset by employee retention credits received in 2025 as a result of our eligibility under the provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act for 2021. The total credits of <money>$3.9 million</money> reduced operating expenses during 2025, of which <money>$2.7 million</money> was allocated to cost of services and <money>$1.2 million</money> was allocated to MG&amp;A expense, based on the employee costs incurred during the eligible period.\n\n</p><p>\n<i>Net Loss</i>\n\n</p><p>\nNet loss was <money>$8.7 million</money> for 2025 compared to <money>$63.2 million</money> for 2024. This improvement was due primarily to higher revenue (discussed above), net foreign currency gains due to the remeasurement of intercompany balances and non-cash gains on the quarterly mark-to-market adjustment of our derivative asset. This improvement was also due to a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the paydown of the 2023 13% Notes recorded during the fourth quarter of 2024. These favorable items were offset partially by higher operating expenses (discussed above) as well as higher interest expense resulting from our recognition of non-cash imputed interest related to the 2024 Prepayment Agreement.\n\n</p><p>\n<i>Adjusted EBITDA</i>\n\n</p><p>\nAdjusted EBITDA was <money>$136.1 million</money> in 2025, reaching a record high for the Company and representing a margin of 50%. This increase from 2024 was due to a <money>$22.6 million</money> increase in total revenue (for reasons previously discussed), offset partially by a <money>$21.9 million</money> increase in operating expenses (excluding adjustments for non-cash or non-recurring items) primarily due to investment in growth opportunities. Specifically, while we continue to enhance and develop our XCOM RAN product and service offerings, we incur costs, primarily for personnel, in advance of significant revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information, refer to “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA.\"\n\n</p><p>\n<i>Liquidity</i>\n\n</p><p>\nAs of <chron>December 31, 2025</chron>, we held cash and cash equivalents of <money>$447.5 million</money>, compared to <money>$391.2 million</money> as of <chron>December 31, 2024</chron>.\n\n</p><p>\nDuring 2025, net cash flows generated from operations were <money>$621.7 million</money>, capital expenditures were <money>$550.4 million</money> and net cash flows used in financing activities were <money>$16.2 million</money>. Cash and cash equivalents were also positively impacted by a <money>$1.2 million</money> change in foreign currency exchange rates. Operating cash flows during 2025 included <money>$430.6 million</money> received in connection with the Infrastructure Prepayment and other cash flows generated from the business. Capital expenditures were primarily associated with our commitments under the Updated Services Agreements related to the deployment of the replacement satellites and Extended MSS Network.\n\n</p><p>\nAdjusted free cash flow during 2025 was <money>$171.5 million</money> compared to <money>$131.9 million</money> during 2024. This increase primarily includes <money>$45.0 million</money> in accelerated service payments received during 2025 as well as higher service payments received pursuant to the Updated Services Agreements, offset partially by higher operating costs (as discussed above). Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information, refer to \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted Free Cash Flow\".\n\n</p><p>\nThe principal amount of our debt was <money>$410.0 million</money> at <chron>December 31, 2025</chron>, compared to <money>$417.5 million</money> at <chron>December 31, 2024</chron>. This decrease was due to scheduled recoupments of <money>$34.6 million</money> under the 2021 Funding Agreement, offset partially by the issuance of <money>$27.1 million</money> of debt under the 2023 Funding Agreement in <chron>August 2025</chron>.\n\n</p><p>\n(Capitalized terms not defined in this release have the meanings ascribed to them in our periodic reports)\n\n</p><p>\n<b>FINANCIAL GUIDANCE</b>\n\n</p><p>\nOur financial guidance for 2026 is as follows:\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\nTotal revenue between <money>$280 million</money> and <money>$305 million</money>\n\n</li>\n<li>\nAdjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 50%\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\n<b>CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION</b>\n\n</p><p>\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its results at <chron>9:00 a.m. Eastern Time</chron> (ET) on <chron>Friday, February 27, 2026</chron>.

These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” \"might,\" \"could,\" “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that could cause or contribute to such differences include, without limitation, those described under Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as may be further updated by subsequent filings with the <org>SEC</org>. Further, new risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risk factors, nor can we accurately assess the ultimate impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this press release to reflect actual results, future events or circumstances or changes in our assumptions, business plans or other changes.\n\n</p><p>\nThis press release contains measures such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted free cash flow, which are not recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to amounts reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are provided in this press release. For forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA margin, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable effort because estimating such GAAP measures and providing a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and requires a level of precision that is unavailable for these future periods and the information needed to reconcile these measures is dependent upon future events, many of which are outside of our control as described above. Forward-looking non-GAAP measures are estimated consistent with the relevant definitions and assumptions.\n\n</p><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl bwwidth100\">\n<tr>\n<td

Adjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash compensation expense, reduction in the value of assets, foreign exchange (gains)/losses, and certain other non-cash or non-recurring charges as applicable. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to manage the Company's business and to compare its results more closely to the results of its peers. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measurements, such as net loss. These terms, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"bwcellpmargin\">\n \n\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"bwcellpmargin\">\nThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measurement of its operating performance. The Company believes it best reflects changes across time in the Company's performance, including the effects of pricing, cost control and other operational decisions. The Company's management uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of its annual operating budget. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA also is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies in similar industries. As indicated, Adjusted EBITDA does not include interest expense on borrowed money or depreciation expense on our capital assets or the payment of income taxes, which are necessary elements of the Company's operations. Because Adjusted EBITDA does not account for these expenses, its utility as a measure of the Company's operating performance has material limitations. Because of these limitations, the Company's management does not view Adjusted EBITDA in isolation and also uses other measurements, such as revenues and operating profit, to measure operating performance.\n\n</p>\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"bwpadl0\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" />\n<td class=\"bwpadl0\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" />\n<td class=\"bwpadl0\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"bwpadl0 bwpadr0 bwvertalignt\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><p class=\"bwalignr bwcellpmargin\">\n(2)\n\n</p>\n\n</td>\n\n<td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" />\n<td class=\"bwvertalignt bwpadl0\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><p class=\"bwcellpmargin\">\nIn connection with the License Agreement with XCOM, the Company entered into a Support Services Agreement (the “SSA”).

            "description": "<p><chron>Feb 27</chron> (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures slid on Friday as growing AI unease dragged on tech stocks, with the Nasdaq on track for its steepest monthly drop since <chron>March 2025</chron>, and investors awaited key inflation data later in the day.</p>\n<p>Technology stocks saw immense turbulence this month due to AI concerns, even as investors fretted about the payoff from massive planning spending on artificial-intelligence technology.</p>\n<p>Brewing tariff uncertainty also stoked volatility after the <org>U.S. Supreme Court</org> last week voided most of the duties U.S. President Donald Trump imposed last year. In response, Trump announced a temporary global tariff of 10% that came into effect on Tuesday. </p>\n<p>Nvidia shares inched 0.1% lower in premarket trading after sliding more than 5% in the previous session despite strong earnings, a sign that risk sentiment for all things AI remained shaky.</p>\n<p>&quot;It's easy to feel anxious when the tech darlings that carried the market stumble,&quot;  said <person>Brian Jacobsen</person>, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management.  </p>\n<p>&quot;We are witnessing a true market rotation, where opportunities are broadening out beyond a handful of megacap tech stocks and flowing into value stocks, small-caps and industrial sectors.&quot; </p>\n<p>Zscaler lost 10.5% after the cloud security firm reported a wider net loss in the second quarter, while Intuit dipped 3.1% after the financial software company forecast third-quarter profit below estimates. </p>\n<p>Software shares were rocked earlier this year on fears of industrywide AI-led disruptions. Financial brokerages, data analytics and legal services, real estate services and trucking are also hit hard by brewing AI concerns. </p>\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq clocked losses in the last session, with the Nasdaq closing below its 50-day moving average for the 17th straight session. The closely followed moving average is seen as a proxy for the intermediate-term trend. </p>\n<p>However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was set to log 10 straight months of gains. </p>\n<p>In economic data, a January producer prices reading due before the bell could offer insights into the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate path. </p>\n<p>At <chron>07:31 a.m. ET</chron>, Dow E-minis lost 294 points, or 0.59%, S&amp;P 500 E-minis fell 27.75 points, or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 E-minis shed 98.25 points, or 0.39%. </p>\n<p>Most megacap and growth stocks inched lower. Chip stocks including AMD and Broadcom also declined. </p>\n<p>Netflix added 8.1% as investors cheered its decision to exit the fight for Warner Bros Discovery, which fell 1.4%. Paramount Skydance rose 7.5% after winning the race for some of the world's most prized TV and film assets. </p>\n<p>Block surged 20% after the payments firm said it would cut over 4,000 jobs, nearly half its workforce, as part of an overhaul to embed artificial intelligence across its operation. </p>\n<p>Dell climbed 12.1% after the PC-maker said it expects revenue from its key AI-optimized servers business to double in fiscal year 2027 and promised to return more cash to shareholders.</p>\n<p>Duolingo dropped 24.2% after the language-learning app forecast first-quarter and 2026 bookings below expectations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p> (Reporting by <person>Shashwat Chauhan</person> and <person>Ragini Mathur</person> in Bengaluru; Editing by <person>Pooja Desai</person>)</p>\n",
