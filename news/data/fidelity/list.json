            "description": "<p><chron>Feb 27</chron> (Reuters) - OpenAI's latest funding round valued the ChatGPT maker at <money>$840 billion</money> as Big Tech piled into the <money>$110 billion</money> blockbuster round, signaling the AI investment race is alive and well despite recent fears of a valuation bubble. </p>\n<p>The funding round - one of the largest private capital raises on record - includes a <money>$30 billion</money> investment from SoftBank, <money>$30 billion</money> from Nvidia, and <money>$50 billion</money> from <org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span>. It comes ahead of the AI startup's expected mega-IPO this year, and <location>Wall Street</location> expects more funding rounds before the debut.</p>\n<p>More investors are expected to join the round as it progresses, OpenAI said in a statement on Friday.</p>\n<p>FUNDING BOOST AS COMPETITION HEATS UP</p>\n<p>The infusion will help OpenAI secure advanced AI chips and the computing capacity it needs to maintain its lead position in the AI industry, especially as competition heats up from Anthropic and Alphabet's Google. </p>\n<p>It also exacerbates <location>Wall Street</location> concerns about  &quot;circular&quot; financing agreements, where firms invest in and sign supply deals with each other, inflating demand and revenue.</p>\n<p>After years of outsized gains, tech stocks have suffered sharp declines in 2026 as investors question whether AI investments will generate sufficient returns to justify lofty valuations.</p>\n<p>Nvidia was punished by shareholders this week after the chipmaker said it would pour money into the AI ecosystem, instead of returning cash to shareholders. Nvidia's investment in OpenAI gives the chip company a financial stake in one of its largest customers, tightening their already intertwined relationship.</p>\n<p>OpenAI said on Friday it would use Nvidia's latest Rubin systems, representing five gigawatts of computing capacity - enough energy to power millions of U.S. households.</p>\n<p>It was not immediately clear whether Nvidia's <money>$30 billion</money> investment replaced its earlier commitment announced in September under which Nvidia was set to invest up to <money>$100 billion</money> in the startup. </p>\n<p>OpenAI and Nvidia did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for clarification. </p>\n<p>With the latest injection, SoftBank's investment in OpenAI is set to be <money>$64.6 billion</money>, representing an ownership interest of about 13%, the Japanese conglomerate said.</p>\n<p>AMAZON PARTNERSHIP </p>\n<p>The new investment is crucial for OpenAI. </p>\n<p>The launch of Google's Gemini 3 in November has given the Alphabet-owned company a stronger footing, while Anthropic has cemented its lead in the enterprise AI market with its specialized coding tool.</p>\n<p>OpenAI, which is yet to turn a profit, is targeting roughly <money>$600 billion</money> in total compute spend through 2030, a source told Reuters last week. </p>\n<p>Along with the <money>$50 billion</money> investment, OpenAI and <org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span> have also struck a deal in which OpenAI will utilize two gigawatts of computing capacity powered by <org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon's</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span> in-house Trainium AI chips.</p>\n<p>The companies are also expanding their <money>$38 billion</money> cloud deal signed last year, with OpenAI saying it would spend an additional <money>$100 billion</money> on Amazon Web Services over the next eight years. As well, OpenAI will work with <org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span> to develop customized models for the e-commerce company's engineering teams.</p>\n<p><org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span> will start with an initial <money>$15 billion</money> investment, followed by another <money>$35 billion</money> in the coming months when certain conditions are met, the companies said. </p>\n<p>AWS will be the exclusive third-party cloud provider for OpenAI Frontier, the ChatGPT maker's enterprise platform for building and running AI agents. </p>\n<p>The partnership does not change OpenAI's relationship with Microsoft, with Microsoft Azure still the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI's APIs that provide access to OpenAI's models, the companies said. </p>\n<p>ChatGPT serves more than 900 million weekly active users, OpenAI said, adding that it has surpassed 50 million consumer subscribers. January and February are on track to become the largest months for new subscriber additions, it said.</p>\n<p>(Reporting by <person>Deborah Sophia</person> and <person>Akash Sriram</person> in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur, <person>Chizu Nomiyama</person>, <person>Nick Zieminski</person>, <person>Sayantani Ghosh</person>, <person>Rod Nickel</person>)</p>\n",

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We raise our 12-month target by <money>CAD8</money> to <money>CAD102</money> on an EV/EBITDA of 11.2x our 2026 EBITDA forecast, a premium to its five-year average forward EV/EBITDA of 10.0x. We lower our 2026 EPS view by <money>CAD0.33</money> to <money>CAD4.89</money> and lower 2027 by <money>CAD0.40</money> to <money>CAD5.27</money>. CCL Industries posted full-year sales growth of 5.8%, while adjusted basic EPS increased 7.4% to <money>CAD4.64</money>. The flagship CCL segment drove performance with sales advancing 8.4% and operating income surging 11.3%, reflecting sustained demand across key divisions. Broad-based strength emerged across the portfolio, with Checkpoint achieving 2.6% sales growth, Innovia delivering 12.2% operating income growth on flat sales, and Avery maintaining resilience despite tariff pressures. We expect secular growth in the Checkpoint segment from accelerating adoption of radio frequency identification (RFID) once apparel supply chain disruptions normalize, though RFID growth has moderated in the near term. Therefore, we forecast sales growth of 4.2% in 2026 and another 3.9% in 2027.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

As the regulations that govern battery storage and charging evolve, infrastructure solutions that centralize and standardize charging environments are becoming increasingly important.</p><p>Swobbee, a provider of battery swapping and charging infrastructure for electric micromobility, is expanding its network following the successful completion of a city-supported pilot project. Since launching operations in <chron>March 2025</chron>, the company has installed multiple battery swapping stations in <location value=\"LU/us.ny.mantan\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Manhattan</location> and <location value=\"LU/us.nj.jerity\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Jersey City</location>, offering delivery riders UL-certified batteries and 24/7 access to fully charged power without the fire risks linked to home charging. After the pilot demonstrated a safer, fire-compliant alternative to traditional e-bike charging, Swobbee received approval to scale across all five boroughs, with more than dozens of additional stations planned by the end of the year.</p><p>SINBON's advanced interconnect technology is supporting the expansion, enabling safe, efficient battery integration across the swapping network. Reliable power connectivity and traceable systems are essential to maintaining safety and operational stability. <person>Alex Shiung</person>, Associate Corporate Business Development Director with SINBON, commented: \"SINBON is committed to advancing electrification infrastructure that is both safe and scalable. Through our collaboration with Swobbee, we are contributing technical expertise that supports <location value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >New York City's</location> public safety goals while enabling cleaner micromobility solutions.\"</p><p>Swobbee oversees deployment and operations across the network, centralizing battery charging in controlled environments to reduce fire risks. Swobbee's model enables riders to instantly exchange depleted batteries for fully charged ones which eliminates charging downtime and reduces reliance on informal charging setups. Since onboarding customers in <chron>March 2025</chron>, users have completed approximately 150,000 battery swaps across <location value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >New York City</location> and <location value=\"LU/us.nj.jerity\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Jersey City</location> which reflects strong adoption among delivery riders. The system provides UL-certified batteries, 24/7 station access, and round-the-clock customer support, including in-person assistance in <location value=\"LU/us.ny.mantan\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Manhattan</location>, helping riders maintain consistent earning potential.</p><p><person>Thomas Duscha</person>, CEO of Swobbee, shared: \"<location value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >New York City</location> was actively looking for safer, UL-certified battery solutions and invited us to participate in the pilot project in 2024. The pilot demonstrated that battery swapping can significantly improve safety while making daily work easier for delivery riders. After its success, we received the green light to expand across all five boroughs.\"</p><p>Together, SINBON and Swobbee aim to provide a scalable, fire-safe infrastructure model that aligns with public safety priorities while supporting the city's growing micromobility ecosystem.</p><p><b>About Swobbee<br /></b>Swobbee is a <location value=\"LU/us.ny.berlin\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Berlin</location>-based climate technology company, founded in 2020 with the idea that battery charging needs to be safer and more efficient in terms of operation and resource consumption.

Some components,\nincluding domestic airfares and healthcare, which go into the\ncalculation of the Personal Consumption Expenditures price\nindexes, the inflation measures tracked by the U.S. central bank\nfor its 2% target, increased solidly last month.</p>\n<p>Economists continued to expect that the so-called core PCE\ninflation, excluding the volatile food and energy components,\nmaintained a strong pace of increase in January.</p>\n<p>&quot;Wider margins for producers could add some upside for\nconsumer costs in coming months as firms pass along higher costs\nfor services,&quot; said <person>Ben Ayers</person>, senior economist at Nationwide.\n&quot;Given still-buoyant core inflation and the recent firming of\njob gains, we expect the Fed to remain on pause during its\nupcoming March meeting.&quot;</p>\n<p>The PPI for final demand rose 0.5% last month after\nadvancing by a downwardly revised 0.4% in December, the <org>Labor\nDepartment's</org> <org>Bureau of Labor Statistics</org> said. Economists polled\nby Reuters had forecast the PPI gaining 0.3% after a previously\nreported 0.5% increase in December.</p>\n<p>In the 12 months through January, the PPI increased 2.9%\nafter rising 3.0% in December. The moderation in the\nyear-on-year producer inflation rate reflected last year's high\nreadings dropping out of the calculation. The report was delayed\nby the brief shutdown of the federal government early this\nmonth.</p>\n<p>A 0.8% jump in services drove the rise in the monthly PPI,\nreflecting a 2.5% increase in trade services, which measure\nchanges in margins received by wholesalers and retailers.\nMargins for professional and commercial equipment wholesaling\nsurged 14.4%, indicating businesses were passing on tariffs.</p>\n<p>Prices also rose for chemicals and allied products\nwholesaling, bundled wired telecommunications access services,\nhealth, beauty and optical goods retailing, and food and alcohol\nretailing. Transportation and warehousing services prices\nclimbed 1.0%, but the cost of services less trade,\ntransportation, and warehousing was unchanged.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>TARIFF-RELATED PRICE INCREASES</p>\n<p>&quot;The problem last month appeared to be tariff-related,&quot; said\n<person>Paul Ashworth</person>, chief <location value=\"LR/nam\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >North America</location> economist at Capital\nEconomics. &quot;If we exclude trade and transportation, other core\nservices prices were unchanged.&quot;\nThe  <org>U.S. Supreme Court</org> last Friday struck down President <person>Donald\nTrump's</person> sweeping tariffs, which he had pursued under a law meant\nfor use in national emergencies. However,  Trump swiftly imposed\na 10% global tariff for 150 days to replace some of the\nemergency duties, before raising the rate to 15%.</p>\n<p>U.S. stocks opened lower. The dollar was steady against a\nbasket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.</p>\n<p>Within services, airline fares increased 2.6% and the cost\nof portfolio management fees rose 1.5%. Prices for physician\ncare soared 0.8%, but the cost of hospital outpatient care fell\n0.9% while inpatient care increased 0.2%. The wholesale cost of\nhotel and motel rooms decreased 4.1%. These are among the\ncomponents that feed into the core PCE inflation.\nProducer goods prices fell 0.3%, with the cost of energy\ndeclining 2.7% amid a 5.5% drop in gasoline. Wholesale food\nprices decreased 1.5%, pulled down by a 10.5% plunge in fresh\nfruits and melons. The Trump administration has rolled back some\ntariffs on fruit and vegetables, including bananas, to lower\ncosts for consumers. Egg prices crashed 63.9%, but the cost of\nbeef and veal increased 1.1%.\nExcluding food and energy, goods prices vaulted 0.7%, the\nbiggest gain since <chron>May 2022</chron>, after rising 0.4% in December. Core\ngoods prices advanced 4.2% year-on-year, the largest gain since\n<chron>March 2023</chron>. Economists continued to believe that core PCE\ninflation increased by as much as 0.5% in January, which would\ntranslate to a year-on-year advance of 3.2%.</p>\n<p>Core PCE inflation rose 0.4% in December and increased 3.0%\nyear-on-year. The government will publish the delayed PCE\ninflation report for January on <chron>March 13</chron>.</p>\n<p>&quot;This report validates the pivot of the Fed away from labor\nmarket risks,&quot; said <person>Carl Weinberg</person>, chief economist at High\nFrequency Economics. &quot;Market participants who have not already\nmarked down their expectations for Fed rate cuts this year will\nbe busy adjusting their books today.&quot;\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by <person>Chizu Nomiyama</person> and\n<person>Andrea Ricci</person> )</p>\n",

            "description": "\n<p><chron>11:05 AM EST</chron>, <chron>02/27/2026</chron> (MT Newswires) -- CFRA, an independent research provider, has provided MT Newswires with the following research alert. Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We cut our 12-month target to <money>$90</money> from <money>$110</money> on lower revised EV/sales  of about 2.3x our 2027 sales estimate, as  growth prospects are offset by the early life cycle of the company and low visibility into sustainable profitability. While GAAP losses persist, we remain cautious about consensus views for profitability in 2027. We widen our 2026 loss  per share estimate to <money>$0.41</money> from <money>$0.34</money> and reduce 2027 to <money>$1.69</money> from <money>$1.80</money>. CRWV faces elevated execution risk from its aggressive <money>$30-$35 billion</money> capex plan in 2026. This is compounded by expected negative free cash flow in 2026 and 2027. While the <money>$66.8 billion</money> revenue backlog provides  visibility, CRWV's high leverage, near-term margin compression (Q4 operating margin at -6% vs. +15% prior year), and reliance on continuous external financing create significant financial risk. Mitigating factors include declining cost of capital (down 300 bps over last year), strong customer diversification progress, and the strategic NVIDIA partnership with <money>$2B</money> investment.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

Importantly, absent a one-time, non-cash charge related to stock-based compensation for employees, the Company would have more than doubled its profitability compared to fiscal 2024.\n\n</p><p>\nDuring fiscal 2025, in addition to our sales directly with customers, we continued to strengthen our distribution sales channel and sales through subcontractors who manufacture on behalf of our customers. By deepening these channels, we effectively open the door to a broad base of end customers. <org>Challenge Electronics</org> has developed numerous new products that will be introduced through its newly formed distribution sales channel, reinforcing our commitment to innovation and long-term growth.\n\n</p><p>\nWe are also actively expanding our global reach. The Surge division’s European sales operation is performing quite well, and we are optimistic about continued growth in that market in fiscal 2026. At the same time, our <org>Challenge Electronics</org> sales division is establishing a sales presence in <location value=\"LR/eur\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Europe</location>.\n\n</p><p>\nWe are also positioning the Company to participate in sales to high-growth markets. During the year, we initiated efforts to explore opportunities within the AI ecosystem, targeting potential customers whose applications require the types of electronic components we supply.\n\n</p><p>\nLastly, in response to geopolitical considerations, many customers across the industry have requested production capabilities outside of <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>. As a result, several of our manufacturing partners have established secondary facilities outside of <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>.\n\n</p><p>\nWe believe our strategic initiatives, combined with our strong financial performance, position us well for continued growth and value creation in the year ahead.”\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Results of Operations for the fiscal year Ended <chron>November 30, 2025</chron></b>\n\n</p><p>\nConsolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended <chron>November 30, 2025</chron> increased by <money>$5,108,966</money> or 16.4%, to <money>$36,320,105</money> as compared to net sales of <money>$31,211,139</money> for the fiscal year ended <chron>November 30, 2024</chron>. We attribute the increase to an increase in business with new customers as well as an increase in business with existing customers. We can also attribute the increase to an increase in business from the Company’s distribution channels. Net sales for the fiscal years ended <chron>November 30, 2025</chron> and <chron>November 30, 2024</chron> reflect <money>$941,564</money> and <money>$549,564</money>, respectively of tariff costs that the Company was able to pass on to its customers.\n\n</p><p>\nOur gross profit for the fiscal year ended <chron>November 30, 2025</chron> increased by <money>$1,551,477</money> to <money>$10,455,171</money> or 17.4%, as compared to <money>$8,903,694</money> for the fiscal year ended <chron>November 30, 2024</chron>. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to 28.8% for the fiscal year ended <chron>November 30, 2025</chron> compared to 28.5% for the fiscal year ended <chron>November 30, 2024</chron>. The increase can be attributed to the increase in sales to certain customers whose sales are at a higher gross profit margin. We work with electronic manufacturing service subcontractor customers who manufacture products for other customers who do not have their own manufacturing operations. The Company has agreements with these subcontractor customers to provide periodic cost reductions through rebates in the amount of 5%. These reductions only affect future shipments of our products, and do not affect existing orders. These reductions can have a negative impact on our profit margins since they reduce the amount of commissions we can earn. Even though this rebate can impact the Company’s gross profit margin, these subcontractor customers represent very significant potential growth for the Company, because they can help the Company become an approved supplier at the customers they manufacture for, and they purchase our components for these customers. We believe it would be very difficult for the Company to achieve business at these customers without the help of these subcontractor customers. During Fiscal 2025, the Company was impacted by tariff costs on certain products imported from <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>. The Company has been able to pass along a portion of these costs to its customers and will do so under potential tariffs imposed upon us. The Company has also moved some customer deliveries directly to <location value=\"LU/cn..hongkg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Hong Kong</location> in order to mitigate some of these costs.\n\n</p><p>\nSelling and shipping expenses for the fiscal year ended <chron>November 30, 2025</chron> was <money>$2,906,782</money>, an increase of <money>$166,788</money>, or 6.1%, as compared to <money>$2,739,994</money> for the fiscal year ended <chron>November 30, 2024</chron>. We attribute the increase to increases in sales and the resulting selling expenses such as commission expenses, the hiring of new salespeople which increased sales payroll, travel and entertainment and auto expenses, offset by decreases in freight out and printing expenses.\n\n</p><p>\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended <chron>November 30, 2025</chron> was <money>$6,223,384</money>, an increase of <money>$1,034,015</money>, or 19.9%, as compared to <money>$5,189,369</money> for the fiscal year ended <chron>November 30, 2025</chron>. The increase is due primarily to non cash stock based compensation of <money>$538,361</money> during the fiscal year ended <chron>November 30, 2025</chron>. As well as increases in officer salaries, other salaries and related payroll taxes, general insurance expenses as well as health insurance expenses, utilities and office expenses and professional fees, computer expenses and consulting expenses and pension expenses as well as increases in bank charges and bad debt expenses, offset by decreases in rent, directors fees and public company expenses.\n\n</p><p>\nThis press release should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, which can be found at www.surgecomponents.com and at www.sec.gov.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements</b>\n\n</p><p>\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements.

Hours earlier, <org>Paramount</org> beat out streaming giant Netflix in a months-long battle for control of the storied <location value=\"LU/us.ca.hollyw\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Hollywood</location> studio.</p>\n<p><org>Paramount's</org> bid is likely to raise concerns about job cuts in <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> that also dogged Netflix's bid. <org>Paramount</org> sees <money>$6 billion</money> in cost &quot;synergies&quot; in the deal, which is often code for massive layoffs and cutting, or sharply paring back, entire units. It can also mean reducing the number of suppliers and squeezing existing contractors for better terms after the two companies merge. None of that is good news for the <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> economy.</p>\n<p>While <org>Paramount</org> initially came in with what the <org>Warner Bros</org> board viewed as an inferior offer, it was highly successful in stirring up political opposition to Netflix's bid among Republicans in <location value=\"LS/us.wa\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location>. Now, Bonta and <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> Governor <person>Gavin Newsom</person>, both Democrats, are likely to be the biggest hurdles to <org>Paramount</org> after the media conglomerate won the fight by upping its offer price.</p>\n<p>State intervention to block the deal is &quot;very likely,&quot; TD Cowen analysts said in a note on Thursday, adding that &quot;approval from federal regulators seems likely given the political environment.&quot;</p>\n<p>Spokespeople for <org>Warner Bros</org> and <org>Paramount</org> did not immediately respond to requests for comment. </p>\n<p>Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, has gone out of his way to present himself as a leader among the political opposition to Trump. Bonta has sued the federal government repeatedly over Trump administration decisions on issues such as clean energy, pipeline projects and health funding.</p>\n<p>U.S. Senator <person>Adam Schiff</person>, a <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> Democrat, said on Thursday that &quot;what was true for Netflix is still true now for <org>Paramount</org>,&quot; calling for the deal to face &quot;the highest levels of scrutiny.&quot;</p>\n<p><location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> has challenged large mergers in the past. In 2019, it led a group of states challenging T-Mobile's acquisition of Sprint. While the states lost in court, <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> secured a settlement recouping its costs and getting temporary commitments to keep jobs in place and offer low-cost plans for consumers.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> also joined the <org>Federal Trade Commission</org> and several other states in a successful bid to block Kroger's takeover of rival grocery chain Albertsons.</p>\n<p>While <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> often works with federal enforcers, Bonta's office has also levied criticisms against some settlements that cleared the way for mergers.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location>, for example, is part of a coalition of 13 states opposing a <org>Justice Department</org> settlement allowing Hewlett Packard Enterprise's <money>$14 billion</money> acquisition of Juniper Networks.</p>\n<p>Over the past few years, Bonta's office has staffed up on competition enforcers under the leadership of antitrust head <person>Paula Blizzard</person>.

The increase was in line with economists' expectations. Construction spending slipped 0.4% year-on-year in December. The data was delayed by last year's government shutdown. </p>\n<p>Spending on private construction projects rose 0.5% in December after easing 0.2% in November. Investment in residential construction increased 1.5% after being unchanged in November. Spending on new single-family housing projects rebounded 1.5%. Spending on multi-family housing units, which account for a small share of the housing market, rose 0.1%.</p>\n<p>Renovations increased further. Despite December's acceleration, homebuilding remained sluggish amid higher mortgage rates, more expensive building materials because of tariffs on imports, and labor shortages.</p>\n<p>A decline in mortgage rates in recent weeks could spur construction, though building lots remain scarce. Residential investment has declined for four straight quarters.</p>\n<p>Spending on private nonresidential structures like offices and factories dropped 0.7% in December. Spending on nonresidential structures has contracted for eight consecutive quarters, despite a surge in the construction of data centers to support artificial intelligence. </p>\n<p>Investment in public construction projects decreased 0.5% after falling 0.2% in November. State and local government construction spending declined 0.7% in December, but outlays on federal government projects increased 1.6%.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p> (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by <person>Chizu Nomiyama</person>)</p>\n",
