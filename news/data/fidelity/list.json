LoanBud's Prequalification Platform moves SBA eligibility upstream by combining structured document intake with AI-assisted analysis to quickly identify whether a business is likely to qualify for SBA financing and to estimate potential loan capacity for qualified buyers.</p><p>\"Too often, financing is introduced after the deal momentum is already built, and that's when surprises show up,\" said Burke Purcell, CEO of LoanBud. \"The LoanBud Prequalification Platform brings structure, speed, and transparency to the front end of the process so brokers, sellers, and buyers can invest time and resources with greater confidence.\"</p><p>LoanBud's software combines structured intake, optical character recognition (OCR), and AI-assisted analysis to accelerate early-stage diligence. Sellers and brokers upload tax returns, financial statements and the confidential information memorandum (CIM). The platform extracts key data, flags missing items and inconsistencies, and helps LoanBud's SBA financing team complete an initial eligibility review more efficiently.</p><p>Product features include:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>Guided document checklist that keeps sellers and brokers on track and reduces back-and-forth.</li><li>OCR-powered extraction from tax returns, profit-and-loss statements, balance sheets and deal documents to accelerate early diligence.</li><li>AI-assisted CIM review that summarizes the business model, key risks and transferability considerations.</li><li>Automated first-pass financial spread and cash-flow normalization to support SBA sizing discussions.</li><li>Deal Readiness Report that flags gaps (missing financials, debt schedule issues, inconsistencies) with clear next steps.</li></ul><p>Most submissions receive an initial determination within one to two business days, along with structured feedback and key conditions, subject to buyer qualifications and lender underwriting. Updated financial statements may be requested periodically. Rather than waiting for a buyer to initiate underwriting, sellers can address financeability questions upfront, allowing listings to enter the market with more certainty and fewer unexpected issues.</p><p>The platform also provides brokers with a centralized workspace to manage listings end to end, including secure document uploads, real-time visibility into prequalification status and a structured workflow to keep deals moving. Once a business is prequalified, the broker receives a unique application URL to share with interested buyers. Buyers can then apply for financing tied to that specific business, and LoanBud routes the request through its SBA lender partner network.</p><p>To learn more or submit a business listing for prequalification, visit <b>LoanBud.io</b>.</p><p><b>About LoanBud<br /></b>LoanBud is a financial technology platform modernizing access to SBA financing for small business acquisitions, expansion, working capital, and owner-occupied commercial real estate.

An exceptionally hot summer drove APS to set three all-time peak demand records, with system peak demand rising over 5% to 8.6GW. Looking ahead, the pending 2025 APS rate case represents a critical catalyst, as PNW seeks a <money>$580M</money> sales increase and 10.70% authorized ROE while proposing a Formula Rate Adjustment Mechanism that would enable more timely rate updates to address historical regulatory lags, with new rates expected in the second half of 2026.

This expansion stems from rising consumer demand for flexible, debt-light payment methods and robust integration of BNPL services across digital checkout platforms. BNPL solutions are embedded in e-commerce ecosystems and retail environments alike, unlocking new buying power for consumers and boosting merchant conversion. Market dynamics also reflect growing point-of-sale adoption and strategic <span>fintech</span> partnerships strengthening service reach and appeal.</p><p><b>Request a Sample Now: </b>https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/35349</p><p><b><u>Rising Consumer Preference for Flexible Payments</u></b></p><p>The accelerating adoption of BNPL services is closely tied to shifting consumer payment behavior. Modern shoppers, especially Millennials and Generation Z, increasingly prefer interest-free installments and minimal upfront costs, providing a debt-light alternative to traditional credit cards. BNPL's seamless integration into online checkout flows and fast approval processes cater to mobile-first buyers and reduce friction at purchase points. Retailers embedding BNPL options have reported higher conversion rates and larger average basket values, reinforcing its appeal for both buyers and sellers. E-commerce expansion further fuels BNPL demand, especially in high-ticket categories like electronics and fashion, where consumers appreciate the ability to manage payments over time without incurring immediate financial strain. As digital wallets and in-app payment experiences evolve, BNPL is becoming a staple of online shopping journeys and in-store experiences via integrated point-of-sale solutions.</p><p><b><u>Key Highlights</u></b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>The buy now pay later market is valued at <money>US$ 48.7 billion</money> in 2026 and projected to reach <money>US$ 212.2 billion</money> by 2033, expanding at a CAGR of 23.4%.</li><li><location value=\"LR/nam\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >North America</location> leads with 31% market share, supported by deep U.S. e-commerce penetration and strong merchant integration across major retail platforms.</li><li><location value=\"LR/asp\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Asia Pacific</location> is the fastest-growing region, driven by <location value=\"LC/in\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >India's</location> expanding <span>fintech</span> ecosystem, <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China's</location> embedded digital credit infrastructure, and <location value=\"LR/asp\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Southeast Asia's</location> rising mobile-first consumer base.</li><li>The online channel dominates with 67% share, reflecting BNPL's seamless checkout integration and strong alignment with global e-commerce growth.</li><li>The POS channel is the fastest-growing segment, fueled by QR-based and tap-to-pay BNPL expansion across physical retail, healthcare, and hospitality environments.</li><li>Regulatory developments, particularly in the U.S. and <location value=\"LC/in\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >India</location>, are formalizing digital lending frameworks, strengthening consumer protection and long-term market credibility.</li></ul><p><b><u>Expansion Beyond Traditional Retail</u></b></p><p>While retail remains the dominant end-use segment, BNPL adoption is spreading into new verticals such as automotive services, healthcare financing, and experiential purchases. Automotive dealers and service providers are increasingly enabling installment payments for parts and services, and some healthcare providers are offering BNPL for elective procedures and out-of-pocket medical bills. This diversification broadens the market's addressable base and introduces BNPL to consumer segments previously underserved by short-term credit. Integration with digital identity wallets and super apps is another growth catalyst, promising BNPL accessibility at scale and improved user experiences. Partnerships between BNPL platforms and major e-commerce or payment ecosystems enhance reach and engagement, allowing more consumers to access flexible financing at the point of sale.</p><p><b><u>Key Highlight: PayPal &amp; Rainforest Launch Embedded PayPal Pay Later Integration</u></b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>In February, 2026, Rainforest announced the launch of a new embedded payments integration with PayPal, enabling vertical software platforms using Rainforest to seamlessly offer PayPal, Venmo, and PayPal Pay Later (Buy Now Pay Later) within their checkout experience. This integration allows merchants to provide BNPL alongside cards, Apple Pay, and bank-based payment methods through a single implementation.</li><li>The collaboration is designed to help software platforms transition transaction volume away from offline methods such as cash and checks into digital payment flows. By embedding PayPal Pay Later directly into platform checkouts, merchants can provide customers with greater payment flexibility while maintaining a unified and streamlined payment experience.</li><li>A key feature of the integration is its single API and consolidated reporting structure, which eliminates the need for separate onboarding or multiple systems to manage payment methods. Merchants benefit from simplified reconciliation and operational efficiency, while end customers gain access to trusted and convenient payment options within one seamless interface.</li><li>PayPal highlighted vertical software platforms as a strategic growth area, emphasizing that as commerce increasingly moves into software-driven environments, merchants require embedded solutions that deliver choice, convenience, and trust. The integration strengthens PayPal's presence in embedded finance while expanding the reach of its Buy Now Pay Later offering across new digital commerce ecosystems.</li></ul><p>This development signals a continued shift in the Buy Now Pay Later market toward embedded, platform-based distribution models, where BNPL is integrated directly into vertical SaaS ecosystems rather than offered solely through traditional e-commerce channels.</p><p><b>Request For Customization:</b> https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/request-customization/35349</p><p><b><u>Segmentation Insights: Online Dominates While POS Accelerates In-Store Adoption</u></b></p><p>The online channel leads the global buy now pay later market, accounting for approximately 67% of market share, driven by deep integration within e-commerce checkout ecosystems and seamless API embedding across merchant platforms. Digital-native providers such as Klarna, Afterpay, <org>Affirm, Inc.</org>, and Zip Co., Ltd. continue expanding partnerships with global retailers to reduce the nearly 70% average cart abandonment rate through instant credit approvals and frictionless installment displays at checkout. The point-of-sale (POS) channel is the fastest-growing segment, gaining traction across physical retail, healthcare billing, and hospitality through QR-based and tap-to-pay BNPL integrations.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 215,000 claims for the latest week. Last week's claims included the Presidents' Day holiday, which could have impacted the data. Still, claims were below the levels seen during the same period last year.</p>\n<p><org>The U.S. Supreme Court</org> last Friday struck down the tariffs, which Trump pursued under a law meant for use in national emergencies. Trump swiftly imposed a 10% global tariff for 150 days to replace some of the emergency duties, before raising the rate to 15% over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Economists said the latest moves created near-term uncertainty, but anticipated minimal economic impact. </p>\n<p>Lingering uncertainty from the since-invalidated import duties was blamed for a general hesitancy among businesses to increase hiring. A rapid adoption of artificial intelligence is adding another layer of caution, economists said.</p>\n<p>LOW HIRING IS THE MOST WORRYING ASPECT</p>\n<p>&quot;The low hiring rate is still the most concerning aspect of the labor market, but the trend in continued claims suggests employers aren't pulling back further,&quot; said <person>Nancy Vanden Houten</person>, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.</p>\n<p>The number of people receiving unemployment benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, dropped 31,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.833 million during the week ended <chron>February 14</chron>, the claims report showed. The so-called continuing claims covered the period during which the government surveyed households for February's unemployment rate. </p>\n<p>Continued claims rose modestly between the January and February survey weeks. The jobless rate eased to 4.3% in January from 4.4% in December. The Chicago Fed forecast the unemployment rate steady at 4.28% in February, which would round up to 4.3%.</p>\n<p>While the labor market is stabilizing, consumers remain anxious about their employment prospects. </p>\n<p>A survey from the Conference Board this week showed the share of consumers who viewed jobs as &quot;hard to get&quot; increased to a five-year high in February, though households also believed the availability of jobs had improved.</p>\n<p>The median duration of unemployment is near four-year highs, and jobs remain scarce for young college graduates, labor market data shows. Unemployed recent college graduates do not show in the claims data because they have limited or no work history, making them ineligible to file for jobless benefits.</p>\n<p>Continuing claims could be falling because some people have exhausted their eligibility, limited to 26 weeks in most states.</p>\n<p>&quot;The relationship between continuing claims and unemployment is far from airtight, given that the long-term unemployed, new entrants to the labor market, and those re-entering from inactivity, all are ineligible to claim,&quot; said <person>Oliver Allen</person>, senior U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. </p>\n<p>Allen added that the Conference Board survey's &quot;hard to get&quot; jobs measure was &quot;a very reliable indicator in the past,&quot; and pointed &quot;to the unemployment rate rising again soon.&quot;</p>\n<p>(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by <person>Chizu Nomiyama</person> and <person>Andrea Ricci</person> )</p>\n",

We believe that NVDA's growth is being supported by rising hyperscaler capex (over half of sales), but we think investors need to see greater signs of successful AI monetization from its customer base in a year where CEO Jensen Huang sees Agentic AI at an inflection point. The bar undoubtedly increases, as NVDA makes the case that compute equals revenue for their customers to justify the higher spend. We do expect sequential growth to slow in 2H (tougher comps) but think this is already discounted in shares, while Physical AI/Sovereign AI offers long term upside. We no longer assume NVDA will gain considerable traction in <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> while Rubin appears on pace to ramp in 2H.

            "description": "<p><location value=\"LU/us.ca.losang\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >LOS ANGELES</location>, <chron>Feb 26</chron> (Reuters) - For more than a year, <person>Elon Musk</person> has repeatedly said Tesla is months away from launching a driverless robotaxi service in <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> - once state regulators give their blessing.</p>\n<p>Tesla did nothing to secure that approval in 2025, according to previously unreported state <org>Department of Motor Vehicles</org> records and a state spokesperson. Tesla logged zero miles of autonomous test driving on California roads last year for the sixth year in a row, the records show.</p>\n<p>Documenting test miles is critical in <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California's</location> regulatory system for robotaxis, which requires companies to progress through a series of permits before being allowed to operate a driverless ride-hailing service such as Alphabet's Waymo.</p>\n<p>Much of Tesla's <money>$1.5 trillion</money> market value is tied to investors' belief that it will soon operate a vast fleet of robotaxis and sell millions of autonomous-driving software subscriptions. Operating driverless vehicles in <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> - the largest U.S. auto market - is a linchpin of those ambitions.</p>\n<p><person>Bryant Walker Smith</person>, a <org>University of South Carolina</org> law professor and autonomous-driving expert who has consulted for the California DMV, said Tesla is implying that \"they are ready and regulators are not,\" while the reality is that \"regulators are ready, and they are not.\"</p>\n<p>Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. On an earnings call in October, Musk told analysts that the company is &quot;paranoid about safety&quot; and that it takes a &quot;cautious approach&quot; to new markets. &quot;We probably could just let it loose in these cities,&quot; he said, &quot;but we just don't want to take a chance.&quot;</p>\n<p>So far, Tesla operates only a small pilot robotaxi service in <location value=\"LU/us.tx.austin\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Austin, Texas</location>, which has far fewer regulatory barriers than <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location>.</p>\n<p>In the <location value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >San Francisco Bay Area</location>, the company last July started operating what it called a \"robotaxi\" service that was not a robotaxi service at all. Instead, it is a chauffeur service with human drivers who use Tesla's \"Full Self-Driving\" driver-assistance software, which is not fully autonomous, according to the state regulator authorizing the service and Tesla's disclosures to customers.</p>\n<p>In order to operate fully self-driving vehicles in <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location>, like Waymo, Tesla would first need to obtain permits to test and operate driverless vehicles from the state's <org>DMV and Public Utilities Commission</org>, which regulates commercial ride-hailing.</p>\n<p>Tesla so far has only the entry-level DMV permit, which allows testing driverless vehicles only with a human safety monitor in the driver's seat. A DMV spokesperson said Tesla has not applied for any additional permits.</p>\n<p>Tesla would need to log at least 50,000 miles (80,467 km) of autonomous driving on public roads in <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> with a safety driver before applying for a different permit allowing testing without one, according to proposed DMV regulations expected to be finalized later this year.</p>\n<p>Tesla has not logged any miles with state regulators since 2019 and has documented only 562 miles in total since 2016. </p>\n<p>Waymo, by comparison, logged more than 13 million testing miles and secured seven different regulatory approvals between 2014 and 2023, when it received approval to charge passengers for rides in driverless robotaxis. Waymo is one of three companies with <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> permits to commercially operate driverless vehicles and the only one approved to operate a robotaxi fleet anything like what Musk envisions.</p>\n<p>In written comments last year, Tesla criticized some of the California DMV's proposed revisions to autonomous-driving rules, questioning the need for testing on state roads and minimum-mile requirements. The company also complained about &quot;overly burdensome reporting requirements&quot; for crashes and other system failures.</p>\n<p>Musk has often suggested <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> regulations are the main impediment to deploying robotaxis there. On an <chron>October 2024</chron> earnings call, he said <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> has \"quite a long regulatory approval process.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'd be shocked if we don't get approved next year,\" he added, \"but it's just not something we totally control.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(Reporting by <person>Chris Kirkham</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.ca.losang\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Los Angeles</location>; Editing by <person>Brian Thevenot</person> and <person>Matthew Lewis</person>)</p>\n",

            "description": "<p><location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >WASHINGTON</location>, <chron>Feb 26</chron> (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new applications for jobless benefits increased slightly last week and the unemployment rate appeared to hold steady in February amid a stable labor market.</p>\n<p>The weekly jobless claims report from the <org>Labor Department</org> on Thursday suggested the labor market remained in a &quot;low hire, low fire&quot; state, and supported economists' expectations that the Federal Reserve would not cut interest rates before Fed Chair <person>Jerome Powell's</person> term ends in May. </p>\n<p>The labor market is regaining its footing after hitting a soft patch last year amid uncertainty economists attributed to President <person>Donald Trump's</person> broad tariffs.</p>\n<p>&quot;The data show no sign of the layoffs we would expect in a weakening labor market during the early days of a hypothetical recession,&quot; said <person>Carl Weinberg</person>, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. &quot;That will jolly up traders who believe the Fed will not cut rates anytime soon, given a steady labor market and inflation above target.&quot;</p>\n<p>Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted  212,000 for the week ended <chron>February 21</chron>. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 215,000 claims for the latest week. Last week's claims included the Presidents' Day holiday, which could have impacted the data. Still, claims were below the levels seen during the same period last year.</p>\n<p><org>The U.S. Supreme Court</org> last Friday struck down the tariffs, which Trump pursued under a law meant for use in national emergencies. Trump swiftly imposed a 10% global tariff for 150 days to replace some of the emergency duties, before raising the rate to 15% over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Economists said the latest moves created near-term uncertainty, but anticipated minimal economic impact. </p>\n<p>Lingering uncertainty from the since-invalidated import duties was blamed for a general hesitancy among businesses to increase hiring. A rapid adoption of artificial intelligence is adding another layer of caution, economists said.</p>\n<p>LOW HIRING IS THE MOST WORRYING ASPECT</p>\n<p>&quot;The low hiring rate is still the most concerning aspect of the labor market, but the trend in continued claims suggests employers aren't pulling back further,&quot; said <person>Nancy Vanden Houten</person>, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.</p>\n<p>The number of people receiving unemployment benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, dropped 31,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.833 million during the week ended <chron>February 14</chron>, the claims report showed. The so-called continuing claims covered the period during which the government surveyed households for February's unemployment rate. </p>\n<p>Continued claims rose modestly between the January and February survey weeks. The jobless rate eased to 4.3% in January from 4.4% in December. The Chicago Fed forecast the unemployment rate steady at 4.28% in February, which would round up to 4.3%.</p>\n<p>While the labor market is stabilizing, consumers remain anxious about their employment prospects. </p>\n<p>A survey from the Conference Board this week showed the share of consumers who viewed jobs as &quot;hard to get&quot; increased to a five-year high in February, though households also believed the availability of jobs had improved.</p>\n<p>The median duration of unemployment is near four-year highs, and jobs remain scarce for young college graduates, labor market data shows. Unemployed recent college graduates do not show in the claims data because they have limited or no work history, making them ineligible to file for jobless benefits.</p>\n<p>Continuing claims could be falling because some people have exhausted their eligibility, limited to 26 weeks in most states.</p>\n<p>&quot;The relationship between continuing claims and unemployment is far from airtight, given that the long-term unemployed, new entrants to the labor market, and those re-entering from inactivity, all are ineligible to claim,&quot; said <person>Oliver Allen</person>, senior U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. </p>\n<p>Allen added that the Conference Board survey's &quot;hard to get&quot; jobs measure was &quot;a very reliable indicator in the past,&quot; and pointed &quot;to the unemployment rate rising again soon.&quot;</p>\n<p>(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by <person>Chizu Nomiyama</person> and <person>Andrea Ricci</person> )</p>\n",

By integrating Blitzy's advanced capabilities, BFS is not only transforming its internal workflows but also setting a new benchmark for speed, efficiency, and digital excellence in the industry,\" said <person>Gayatri Narayan</person>, President of Technology at BFS. </p><p><b>The Challenge of Adopting AI in the Enterprise</b></p><p>Enterprises are making significant investments in AI coding tools, with co-pilots representing 55% of all departmental AI spend. However, the results are not matching the investment. Only 26% of AI-generated code merges without significant rework. The gap between expectations and reality is driven primarily because co-pilots struggle with context across large, complex enterprise codebases. Builders FirstSource recognizes these limitations and is leveraging AI tools like Blitzy to close the gaps. </p><p><b>The Blitzy Difference</b></p><p>Blitzy's autonomous software development platform is purpose-built for enterprise-scale codebases with infinite code context. The platform ingests existing codebases and builds a deep contextual understanding down to the line-level dependency, across millions of lines of code. </p><p>Blitzy orchestrates thousands of specialized agents that collaborate for hours to days, planning, building, and validating premium quality code, that leverages the enterprise's existing services, components and standards. This is spec and test-driven development at the speed of compute. Blitzy autonomously delivers more than 80% of the project, leaving the remaining work for human engineers and their co-pilots. </p><p>\"Builders FirstSource understands that accelerating development at enterprise scale requires more than co-pilots, it requires a fundamentally new approach,\" said <person>Brian Elliott</person>, Co-Founder and CEO of Blitzy. \"Their results prove what's possible with an agentic SDLC: measurable productivity gains, faster time to market, and engineers freed to focus on innovation.\"</p><p><b>Results</b></p><p>In the first 3 months, BFS has already observed a 3-5x increase in development velocity in initial use cases. They now have 120 engineers trained on AI-native workflows, who will continue to unlock potential value through Blitzy. This acceleration is increasing the speed at which BFS is building digital solutions, which will allow them to better serve their customers and generate incremental revenue.</p><p><b>About BFS</b></p><p>Builders FirstSource is the nation's largest supplier of structural building products, value-added components and services to the professional market for new residential construction and repair and remodeling.

            "description": "<p><location value=\"LU/ca.qc.montrl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >MONTREAL</location>/<location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >BEIJING</location>/<location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >WASHINGTON</location>, <chron>Feb 26</chron> (Reuters) - Suppliers to U.S. aerospace and semiconductor firms face worsening rare earth shortages, with two turning away some clients, industry insiders said, weeks before U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping for a summit in <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location>.</p>\n<p>The shortages center on rare earths such as yttrium and scandium, niche members of the family of 17 elements, which play tiny but vital roles in defence technology, aerospace and semiconductors and are almost entirely produced in <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>.</p>\n<p>While <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location> has allowed many rare earth exports to resume since it imposed restrictions in April, shipments of these materials still rarely make it to the U.S. despite the October detente with <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location>, Chinese customs data show.</p>\n<p>That easing of trade tensions, premised in part on <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> pausing its critical mineral export restrictions, will be on the table when Trump and Xi meet in <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location> in March.</p>\n<p>A key pain point is yttrium, used in coatings that keep engines and turbines from melting at high temperatures. Without regular application of these coatings, engines cannot be used.</p>\n<p>Since Reuters first reported about yttrium shortages in November, prices have jumped 60% and are now about 69 times as high as a year ago. Some coatings manufacturers are also now starting to ration material, according to company executives and traders.</p>\n<p>Executives at two North American firms that buy yttrium to make coatings told Reuters they have needed to temporarily pause production due to shortages. One is also now turning away smaller and offshore customers in order to conserve supply for larger clients, which include certain engine makers.</p>\n<p>Another firm in the coating supply chain recently ran out of material and stopped selling products containing yttrium oxide, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.</p>\n<p>While shortages of yttrium and scandium have not weighed on production of jet engines or chips yet, a U.S. government official told Reuters some U.S. manufacturers now face &quot;shortages&quot; of certain rare earths from <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> exported 17 tons of yttrium products to the U.S. in the eight months after controls were introduced last April versus 333 tons in the eight months before the measures.</p>\n<p>A <org>White House</org> official said the Trump administration is committed to ensuring access to critical minerals for all U.S. businesses. </p>\n<p>&quot;This includes negotiating with <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> and monitoring compliance with President Trump's agreement with President Xi, as well as developing alternative supply chains as warranted.&quot;</p>\n<p>Reuters spoke with two U.S. government officials, 14 company executives and staff, traders and analysts across aerospace and semiconductors. All of them spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity except the analysts named in the story. The North American executives did not want to be named discussing internal production challenges in public. </p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China's</location> <org>Ministry of Commerce</org> did not respond to questions.</p>\n<p>PRODUCTION PRESSURE </p>\n<p>While low yttrium supplies have not hurt engine production, manufacturers remain concerned, said aerospace supply chain specialist <person>Kevin Michaels</person>.</p>\n<p>&quot;This is a watch item and a tangible example of how <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> is flexing its rare earth muscle,&quot; said Michaels, managing director at U.S. consultant AeroDynamic Advisory. </p>\n<p>Enginemakers are already struggling to meet demand for spare parts from airlines and higher production by planemakers <org value=\"BA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Boeing</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BA )</span> and Airbus.</p>\n<p>U.S. aircraft enginemakers <org>GE Aerospace</org>, RTX's Pratt &amp; Whitney and <org value=\"HON.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Honeywell</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='HON' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( HON )</span> declined comment.</p>\n<p>SCARCE SCANDIUM</p>\n<p>In addition to yttrium, U.S. semiconductor makers are running low on scandium, putting production of next-generation 5G chips at risk, said <person>Dylan Patel</person>, founder and CEO of research firm SemiAnalysis. </p>\n<p>With global production of only several tens of tons a year, scandium plays small but important parts in fuel cells, specialty aluminium aerospace alloys and advanced chip processing and packaging.</p>\n<p>Major U.S. semiconductor manufacturers all rely on scandium for making chip components that &quot;go into essentially every 5G smartphone and base station&quot;, Patel said.</p>\n<p>U.S. chipmakers have experienced delays in receiving new scandium export licenses from <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> in recent months and have reached out to <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location> for help, said two industry sources. </p>\n<p>Many of these firms had obtained scandium from third-country suppliers, another U.S. official said, but <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> requires license applicants to declare their end-users.</p>\n<p>&quot;Our thesis is that it is precisely the semi industry being targeted,&quot; the U.S. official said.</p>\n<p><org>The U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association</org> declined to comment.</p>\n<p>&quot;The U.S. currently has zero domestic scandium production and no operational alternative sources outside <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>,&quot; Patel said, adding that stockpiles are likely in months rather than years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p> (Reporting by <person>Allison Lampert</person> in <location value=\"LU/ca.qc.montrl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Montreal</location>; <person>Laurie Chen</person> and <person>Lewis Jackson</person> in <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location>; <person>Michael Martina</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location>; Additional reporting by <person>Fanny Potkin</person> in <location value=\"LC/sg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Singapore</location>, <person>Ernest Scheyder</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.tx.houstn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Houston</location> and <person>Melanie Burton</person> in <location value=\"LU/au..melbou\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Melbourne</location>; Editing by <person>Sonali Paul</person>)</p>\n",

With up to three times longer uptime and improved resilience to weather and wear, Coco 2 also increases daily order capacity while lowering cost per mile.</p><p>Coco 2 builds upon Coco's Urban Robotic Platform to lower the cost per mile and increase the range and reliability of delivery - making instant delivery affordable at scale for any business, on any delivery platform, and across a wide range of basket sizes.</p><p>Today, Coco powers autonomous delivery through <org>Uber Eats</org>, DoorDash, and Wolt, and serves more than 3,000 merchants and restaurants - from local favorites to national brands - demonstrating growing demand. Building on that momentum, Coco is on track to scale its fleet to thousands of robots globally by the end of the year.</p><p><b><i>Under the Hood: The Intelligence Behind Coco 2</i></b></p><p>By leveraging NVIDIA Omniverse libraries, open robotics simulation and learning frameworks <person>Isaac Sim</person> and <org>Isaac Lab</org> along with NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models - Coco creates physically accurate simulations and synthetic data, or computer-generated scenarios that mimic real streets, pedestrians, vehicles, and obstacles. This allows Coco's AI to safely practice navigating complex city streets and edge cases before ever leaving the warehouse.</p><p>Coco 2 robots run on NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX, a robotic computing platform that processes data much faster and more efficiently directly on the robot, without relying on cloud connections. This combination of NVIDIA accelerated computing and software creates a fully integrated driving system that lets Coco 2 see and understand its surroundings, anticipate movement, plan routes, and execute maneuvers smoothly and safely.</p><p>\"The era of physical AI has arrived, and scaling it requires a seamless loop between massive real-world data and high-performance edge computing,\" said <person>Amit Goel</person>, head of strategic partnerships at NVIDIA. \"By leveraging NVIDIA's full robotics stack, Coco is accelerating the deployment of autonomous systems that can safely navigate the complexities of our cities at scale.\"</p><p>As a result, Coco can now expand quickly into new cities, bringing modern, autonomous urban delivery to more neighborhoods and businesses.</p><p><b>About Coco Robotics</b></p><p><b>Coco Robotics is the world's largest urban robotics platform</b>, combining autonomous robots, real-world operations data, and advanced AI to power smarter, more efficient city logistics.
