View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260226055146/en/</p><p>\nThe contemplated acquisition was undertaken as part of ongoing lease negotiations with a leading hyperscale tenant and partners, where securing the additional acreage emerged as a key milestone in advancing discussions. This development is accompanied by continued site advancement, including initial land clearing, removal of out-of-service and abandoned pipeline infrastructure, relocation of active lines, and subsurface soil sampling to support civil engineering design. These activities are intended to optimize the developable footprint and maximize usable acreage for data center deployment.\n\n</p><p>\nBy seeking to consolidate this corridor, New Era is looking to enhance its ability to structure direct power solutions and optimize interconnection design as it advances development of its now 438-acre, master-planned TCDC campus, which is designed to scale to more than 1 gigawatt over time.\n\n</p><p>\nThe additional acreage would expand New Era’s capacity to:\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\nDirectly on next for major power offtake arrangements with nearby energy generation and transport infrastructure\n\n</li>\n<li>\nNegotiate more efficient and flexible interconnection structures\n\n</li>\n<li>\nReduce exposure to broader grid congestion and transmission constraints; and\n\n</li>\n<li>\nEnhance redundancy, reliability, and long-term expansion flexibility\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\nThe Company expects control of the corridor between operating generation assets and its campus footprint may potentially increase New Era’s negotiating leverage with power producers while improving development sequencing.

The integration enables dental patients to explore cosmetic treatment options, visualize results, book appointments, and arrange payments during convenient in-office or online interactions.</p>\n    <div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1\">\n                <p>\n\n                    <img src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2921298/IntelePeer__Logo.jpg\" title=\"www.intelepeer.ai\" alt=\"www.intelepeer.ai\" />\n\n                </p>\n    </div>\n<p>The partnership expands IntelePeer's comprehensive healthcare technology portfolio and represents a key step in the company's broader strategy to help Dental Service Organizations (DSOs) and dental clinics drive measurable revenue growth through intelligent workflow automation across the entire patient journey.</p><p>Your Social Smile's Pearl-AI Whites AI-driven smile simulator supports top-of-funnel cosmetic lead generation, conversion, and 24/7 patient engagement. IntelePeer's Agentic AI solutions automate patient outreach, intake, scheduling, self-service check-in, no-show reduction, waitlist fills, follow-up, and collections. Together, the combined platform enables dental organizations to capture more patient demand, reduce operational friction, and unlock new revenue opportunities without adding staff.</p><p>According to Your Social Smile, one dental practice using its visual simulation technology has seen an approximate 20% increase in sales conversion using the simulator, highlighting the direct financial impact of pairing visualization with automated engagement and follow–through.</p><p><b>From Visualization to Revenue<br /></b>Visual simulation tools help patients see and better understand the results of cosmetic treatments, such as whitening, veneers, or straightening.

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We lower our target price by <money>$2</money> to <money>$13</money> using a forward TEV/EBITDA of 6.8x that bears M&amp;A and execution. Our target is supported by a more conservative equity risk premium than the five-year historical average at 8.1x that we think is justified given uncertainties about whether PSKY will be successful or not in acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD 28 ***). We do have concerns that the WBD acquisition could destroy shareholder value through excessive leverage and integration failure. The proposed <money>$31.00</money> per share all-cash offer for WBD, backed by <money>$57.5 billion</money> in debt financing, represents an existential risk to PSKY's financial stability and strategic transformation. If the deal closes, the combined entity's total debt would exceed <money>$70 billion</money> (PSKY's current <money>$13.65B</money> plus WBD's existing debt plus new acquisition financing), creating a leverage ratio that would likely result in junk credit ratings, significantly higher borrowing costs, and severe constraints on financial flexibility for years.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

I will now turn the call over to our CEO Robin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><person>Robin Li</person> </strong>(Co-Founder and CEO)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello everyone. In Q4 <org value=\"BIDU.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Baidu</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BIDU' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BIDU )</span> General business total revenue was <money>RMB 26.1 billion</money>. Revenue from our core AI power business exceeded <money>RMB 11 billion</money>, accounting for 43% of <org value=\"BIDU.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Baidu</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BIDU' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BIDU )</span> General Business revenue in AI Cloud infrastructure subscription based revenue from AI accelerator infrastructurestructure grew 143% year over year, accelerating further from 128% in Q3. Meanwhile, Apollo Go maintained its robust momentum, delivering 3.4 million fully driverless operational rides in the quarter Total rides increased by over 200% year over year 2025 marked the third year of our journey in Genai and a pivotal year where AI became the new core of our portfolio. In 2025, we made substantial progress in scaling AI across our businesses, accelerating AI cloud growth, expanding robotaxi operations with improved unit economics and deepening AI integration into our mobile ecosystem. Looking at our portfolio through an AI native lens, momentum across our core AI powered businesses and continue to build in 2025 AI Cloud Infra gained strong traction through its highly efficient and cost effective training and inference capabilities. Revenue from AI Cloud Infra reached approximately <money>RMB 20 billion</money> in 2025, up 34% year over year, outpacing industry growth. Our AI application portfolio is among the most comprehensive in the industry, combining AI empowered flagship products with AI native offerings that unlock entirely new use cases. For the full year 2025, revenue from AI applications exceeded <money>RMB10 billion</money>. Apollo Go achieved a significant landmark. We delivered over 10 million fully driverless operational rides in 2025 alone. To date, Apollo Go has provided a total of over 20 million rides to the public. Cumulatively, with our accelerated global expansion, Apollo GO&#8217;s footprint has now reached 26 cities worldwide, reinforcing our leadership in autonomous ride hailing services. Lastly, our AI native marketing services including digital humans and agents sustained strong growth with revenue up 110% year over year. Collectively, these results demonstrate AI&#8217;s growing contribution to Baidu&#8217;s value creation and our ability to translate AI capabilities into scalable commercial impact. Now let me share the key highlights of the quarter starting with our proprietary AI chips. This quarter we announced the proposed spin off and separate the listing of kunlunxing. After more than a decade of steadfast investment in self developed AI chips, we are proud to see the market increasingly recognize their value and proven performance. This milestone validates our long term strategic vision and unlocks new opportunities for value creation. Our AI chips are built on a proprietary architecture developed in house from day one. They deliver stable high performance AI computing at scale with broad compatibility across different models and frameworks. This enables customers to deploy faster with lower integration costs. What distinguishes our AI chips is a proven track record of large scale real world deployments with leading enterpridess across diverse industries spanning financial services, telecommunications, energy and Internet sectors. Customers choose our chips for reliable performance, stable supply at scale, exceptional software compatibility and strong efficiency, especially in inference workloads. Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities for both <org value=\"BIDU.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Baidu</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BIDU' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BIDU )</span> and Kunlunxing as AI infrastructurestructure demand continues to accelerate. Next I will turn to our AI cloud infrastructurestructure. Our infrastructurestructure is among the most advanced in <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>, powered by a diverse mix of domestic and international high performance computing resources. In Q4, subscription based revenue from AI accelerator infrastructurestructure grew 143% year over year, achieving triple digit growth for the full year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automate operational compliance and safety checks through intelligent visual analysis. While known brands across coffee chains, quick service restaurants and fine dining are now using ETN to ensure high standard operations across their thousands of locations. Another example is FM Agent, our self-evolving agent designed to solve complex operational challenges by autonomously reasoning across data, rules and real-world constraints. It simulates countless scenarios to identify best solutions. We&#8217;ve seen strong validation both internally through our own cloud resource optimization and externally across industries like manufacturing, energy, finance and logistics, where efficiency improvement is a universal priority. On the organizational front, we recently established the <org>Personal Super Intelligence Business Group</org> or psig. Personal Super Intelligence Group Unified Baidu, <person>Wen Gu</person> and <location>Baidu Drive</location> are two flagship consumer-facing AI applications. Even before this organizational integration, the two teams had already collaborated at the product level to deliver innovations like Free Canvas and gemflow. This new group enables even deeper collaboration going forward as we accelerate the rollout of new applications to foster a robust growth curve driven by application layer innovation. Shifting to Physical AI Apollo Go represents our largest AI application in the physical world. 2025 was a year of accelerated scaling for Apollo Go, where we reinforced our leadership in operational scale and achieved significant progress in global expansion. We continue to expand fully driverless operations at pace delivering 3.4 million fully driverless operational rides in Q4 with weekly rides peaking at over 300,000. Total rides grew by over 200% year over year. Cumulative rides provided to the public have surpassed 20 million as of <chron>February 2026</chron>, firmly cementing our position as the world&#8217;s leading autonomous ride-hailing service provider. We entered 2026 with momentum across key international markets. In the UK, we advanced our partnerships with Uber and Lyft, moving forward with plans to pilot autonomous vehicles in <location value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >London</location> with testing expected to begin in the first half of 2026. This represents an important step in Apollo GO&#8217;s international expansion, extending our right-hand drive robo taxi capabilities from <location value=\"LU/cn..hongkg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Hong Kong</location> to another strategically important market In <location value=\"LC/ch\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Switzerland</location>. We initiated testing in St. Gallen. Following our market entry last quarter in the <location value=\"LR/mde\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Middle East</location>, we achieved progress in both <location value=\"LU/ae..abudha\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Abu Dhabi</location> and <location value=\"LU/ae..dubai\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Dubai</location>. In <location value=\"LU/ae..abudha\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Abu Dhabi</location>, we launched a fully autonomous ride-hailing services on <location>Yas Island</location>. In January with Autogo in <location value=\"LU/ae..dubai\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Dubai</location>, we secured the city&#8217;s first fully driverless testing permit from the Roads and Transport Authority. We also announced the next phase of our global partnership with Uber to bring our fully autonomous ride-hailing services to <location value=\"LU/ae..dubai\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Dubai</location> via the Uber platform. These are critical milestones that accelerate our progress across the Emirates. In <location value=\"LR/asp\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Asia</location>, we entered a new market, <location value=\"LC/kr\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >South Korea</location>, starting with the <location value=\"LU/kr..seoul\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Seoul</location> metropolitan area, further expanding our presence across the Asian region. Meanwhile in <location value=\"LU/cn..hongkg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Hong Kong</location>, we expanded our open road testing into Sunwen and initiated cross-district testing between Airport island and Tung Chung, bringing us closer to commercial readiness there. As of <chron>February 2026</chron>, Apollo GO&#8217;s global footprint reached 26 cities, demonstrating the scalability of our autonomous driving technology across diverse regulatory and operational environments. Looking ahead, we are focused on accelerating expansion to more cities globally while continuously improving operational excellence and unit economics. Our growing experience across diverse markets gives us confidence in our ability to scale further, and we expect more cities to achieve positive unit economics over time. Underpinning this expansion, safety remains our top priority and the foundation of everything we do. Our autonomous ride-hailing service is the safest globally with our fully driverless vehicles experience an airbag deployment accident only once every over 12 million kilometers. As we scale, we will continue strengthening safety standards and ensure sustained reliability. Ultimately, our mission is to harness AI to transform mobility, making it fundamentally safer, more affordable and more comfortable, and improving how billions of people move, work and live. In summary, with AI now firmly integrated across our portfolio, we believe we are well positioned to deliver sustainable value and shape the next phase of the AI era. With that, let me turn the call over to Henry to go through the financial results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><person>Henry He</person> (Chief Financial Officer)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you Robin and hello everyone. We are making progress on our key focus areas. Over the recent quarters, we&#8217;ve enhanced disclosure for greater transparency and driven operational efficiency improvements. This quarter we took a significant step to unlock value from our strategic AI chip investment through the proposed Kunlunxin spin-off and a separate listing, a milestone we are particularly pleased with. We&#8217;ve also announced a new <money>US$5 billion</money> share repurchase program and adopted a dividend policy for the first time. Additionally, we&#8217;ve sharpened our strategic focus on high potential AI applications by forming a <org>PSIG Business Group</org> integrating <org value=\"BIDU.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Baidu</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BIDU' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BIDU )</span>, WenKu and <location>Baidu Drive</location>. These actions reflect our consistent execution and ongoing focus on creating shareholder value. Looking at Q4 results, we saw positive momentum. <org value=\"BIDU.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Baidu</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BIDU' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BIDU )</span> General Business Total revenue increased 6% quarter over quarter, with non-GAAP operating profit expanding 28% sequentially to <money>RMB 2.8 billion</money>. Operating cash flow for <org value=\"BIDU.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Baidu</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BIDU' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BIDU )</span> turned positive in Q3 and remained positive in Q4, generating a combined <money>RMB 3.9 billion</money> across both quarters. In terms of our core AI powered business in Q4 revenue exceeded <money>RMB 11 billion</money>, accounting for 43% of <org value=\"BIDU.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Baidu</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BIDU' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BIDU )</span> General Business revenue. We are seeing strong momentum across several areas. AI Cloud Infra continues to gain market traction and outpace industry average. Our AI application portfolio is expanding rapidly with strong enterprise adoption. Combining AI Cloud Infra and AI application, our cloud revenue reached <money>RMB 30 billion</money> for the full year 2025 meanwhile, Apollo Go reinforces its position as a global leader in autonomous ride hailing with one of the industry&#8217;s largest footprints and the strongest growth momentum and AI native marketing services is growing fast. These results demonstrate our progress and we believe this is just the beginning. We have a robust pipeline of initiatives ahead and we are confident in our ability to create lasting shareholder value. Now let me walk through the details of our fourth quarter and full year 2025 financial results.

I have questions related to the model. So we have noticed very active model iteration reasons. How does management view the current competitive landscape? And then <org value=\"BIDU.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Baidu</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BIDU' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BIDU )</span> recently also released updated earning 5.0 and also make some organizational adjustments. So could management discuss the strategic rationale behind these moves and also how the company thinks about the relationship between the model evolutions and also the application in your overall AI strategy. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><person>Robin Li</person> (Co-Founder and CEO)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi Alissa, this is Robin. We did see very active model releases recently. The market is highly competitive and moving fast, but amid all the competition we&#8217;ve always believed that applications matter more than models because models ultimately create value through applications. That is why we always take an application driven approach with earning. Model improvements are guided by the most valuable and promising use cases and this has been consistent across every iteration of earning. As I just mentioned recently we released the updated version of Ernie 5.0. At the same time, we&#8217;ve been proactively making organizational changes to stay agile in this fast moving market. We restructured our model team into different focus areas. One team continues pushing frontier capabilities at the foundation model level to maintain technical leadership early has clear strengths in several key areas such as creative writing, omni model understanding and instruction following. We are confident we will keep improving erle&#8217;s performance across key application scenarios. Meanwhile, this high value application scenarios continuously provide ERNIE wi</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your next question comes from <person>Alex Yao</person> with JP Morgan. Please ask your question.<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>JP Morgan Analyst</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good evening management team and thank you for taking my question. I have one question about the Baidu AI Cloud. We noticed the Baidu AI Cloud revenue delivered a strong growth for the full year 2025. Can you elaborate and help us understand the key growth driver behind the robust revenue growth number and how shall we think about the AI Cloud revenue growth outlook in 2026? Thank you,<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><person>Robin Li</person> (Co-Founder and CEO)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>thank you Alex this is Dove for 2025. Our AI Cloud revenue which includes revenue from AI Cloud Infra and AI applications reached <money>RMB 30 billion</money> in 2025. Revenue from AI cloud infrastructure grew 34% year over year, outpacing the broader market within AI Cloud Infra. Subscription based revenue from AI accelerator infrastructurestructure grew 143% year over year in Q4 and has become the primary growth driver demonstrating strong momentum. We remain highly confident in sustaining strong growth momentum in 2026. Underpinning our growth is the accelerating enterprise AI adoption. We&#8217;re seeing demand growth in both training and inference workloads and we expect the demand of AI computing to keep expanding, creating significant opportunities ahead. Baidu&#8217;s full stack end to end AI architecture is a key differentiator in capturing such opportunity. At the foundation of this architecture is our industry leading AI infrastructurestructurestructure which achieves an excellent balance across performance, efficiency and cost. Our AI infrastructurestructurem is powered by a diverse mix of chips. We have built deep expertise in heterogeneous computing and unified scheduling which enables us to efficiently manage computing resources from different chip vendors and achieve industry leading performance and efficiency. In the meanwhile, our proprietary chip capabilities provide a significant competitive advantage. As Robin just mentioned, our self developed Kunlunxin AI chips deliver strong performance, compatibility and cost efficiency. They have been deployed at scale with leading enterprise customers across financial services, telecom, energy and Internet sectors and the market feedback has been very positive. Kunlunkin serves as a key component of our own cloud platform&#8217;s computing power, playing an important role in our overall AI infrastructure. As AI demand grows, the advantages of our AI infrastructure will become increasingly evident. Beyond AI infrastructure we just discussed, we are continuously evolving our best in class agent Infra to help enterprises rapidly build and deploy AI agents at scale. We keep bringing in the latest, most cutting edge capabilities. For example, we recently launched simplified open Cloud deployment on Baidu AI Cloud which streamlines the process so that even users with no coding experience can quickly deploy their own open cloud agents. Then, looking into 2026 as Enterprise AI deployments deepen further, we are confident that our cloud business will continue to grow faster than the industry. We expect AI Cloud and Infra to maintain strong momentum with AI accelerator infrastructure continuing to serve as a core driver propelling our overall cloud business toward a more sustainable and high quality growth model. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your next question comes from <person>Lincoln Kong</person> with GS. Please ask your question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Goldman Sachs Analyst</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you Management for taking my question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So actually this quarter we see this AI power business continue to deliver pretty solid growth. How does management view the current stage development for those AI power businesses? So when should we expect this share to exceed, say 50% of the <org value=\"BIDU.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Baidu</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BIDU' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BIDU )</span> General business? And what will be the key driver going forward for the AI powered business? Thank you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><person>Robin Li</person> (Co-Founder and CEO)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, let me start by sharing how we think about our core AI powered business. This includes AI cloud infrastructurestructure, AI applications like Baidu WenKu and <location>Baidu Drive</location>, and our robotaxibusiness, Apollo and our AI native marketing services including agents and digital humans. AI Powered Bins organizes our business according to the nature of Our products and services where AI is empowering each to create meaningful customer value and business impact. In Q4, AI powered business revenue exceeded <money>RMB 11 billion</money>. That&#8217;s like 43% of <org value=\"BIDU.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Baidu</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BIDU' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BIDU )</span> General business revenue. This percentage has been rapidly increasing over the recent quarters. And AI powered business is becoming the core driver of our overall revenue growth. Each of our AI powered businesses has clear strategic positioning and competitive advantage. First, it&#8217;s AI infrastructure AI cloud infrastructure. We see enterprises scale AI from pilots to production and our full stack end to end AI capabilities enable strong performance at competitive cost. AI</p>\n\n\n\n<p>cloud infrastructure revenue grow faster than the industry average in 2025 with subscription based AI accelerator infrastructurestructure revenue accelerating sharply in Q4. And second, it&#8217;s AI applications. We&#8217;ve always believed AI&#8217;s ultimate value will settle at the application layer. And we built one of China&#8217;s most comprehensive AI application portfolios. As AI capabilities continue to evolve and new use cases emerge, we see significant expansion potential in this business. And then third is the Robotaxibin Apollo Go. Apollo Go is scaling rapidly while expanding internationally. We lead globally in operating scale, safety record efficiency and cost structure. And the fourth is AI native marketing services. Like agents and digital humans. They improve engagement and conversion. And we&#8217;re seeing strong market adoption with great potential ahead. So, looking to the mid to long term, as enterprise AI deployment deepens, monetization capabilities of AI applications improve and physical AI applications such as autonomous driving continue to expand. And we&#8217;re confident in the growth trajectory of our AI powered business. These AI powered business aren&#8217;t isolated. They continuously reinforce each other through our full stack capabilities. And based on current visibility, we believe our core AI part business will become the majority of <org value=\"BIDU.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Baidu</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BIDU' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BIDU )</span> general business in the foreseeable future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your next question comes from <person>Wei Xiong</person>. Please ask your question. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>USB Analyst</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. Good evening, Management. Thank you for taking my questions. Could Management elaborate on the framework that you use to allocate capital, including shareholder returns, organic investment and potential strategic strategic opportunities? And also could management comment on the long term strategic positioning of kunlunxin within the <org>Baidu Group</org>? Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><person>Henry He</person> (Chief Financial Officer)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you. <person>Xiong Wei</person>, this is Henry. I believe many of you may have noticed our recent series of initiatives. These include enhancing our disclosures, improving operational efficiency, optimizing our organizational structure, advancing the proposed kunlunxin spin off and a separate listing, and also announcing our new share repurchase program and the first dividend policy. And recently, we&#8217;re also reforming the psig, the <org>Personal Superintelligence Group Business Group</org> integrating Baidu Wenku and <location>Baidu Drive</location> altogether. These moves reflect a coherent execution framework demonstrating our improved management execution and ongoing commitment to creating shareholder value. I think take our new share repurchase program as one example. We are very focused on providing clear and sustainable returns to shareholders. So in the recent in February the board has approved a new 5 billion</p>\n\n\n\n<p>US dollar share repurchase program which we plan to execute on a regular basis in a very disciplined and transparent manner. We are also introducing <org value=\"BIDU.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Baidu</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BIDU' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BIDU )</span> first Dividend policy. We believe the introduction of the policy alongside with a sizable buyback program will further strengthen our shareholder return profile and attract a broader range of investors, thereby further diversifying our investor base. As you mentioned, the proposed spin off and a separate list of Kunlanxing is another good example. We are making very good progress of the listing process. Kunlencheng is a result of over decades of investment and represents a critical infrastructure component of our full stack AI capabilities. We believe this spin off and a separate listing will receive strong market recognition and unlock significant value for <org>Baidu Asset Group</org>. So looking ahead, we firmly believe the company has tremendous value and we will continue unlocking it through various initiatives. We remain committed to deliver sustainable and consistent returns to our shareholders. So more initiatives will follow in due course. So stay tuned with us. Thank you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Operator </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your next question comes from <person>Gary Yu</person> with Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Morgan Stanley (Equity Analyst)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi. Thank you Management. My question is on Robo Taxi. And first of all, congratulations on the Robotaxi expansion into more countries, especially to my hometown <location value=\"LU/cn..hongkg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Hong Kong</location>. Can you share your overseas strategy in 2026 and what are your key competitive advantages there? And also with Waymo&#8217;s, recently valued at 126 billion, how is management thinking about unlocking Apollo Gold&#8217;s value? Would you consider a spin off? Thank you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><person>Robin Li</person> (Co-Founder and CEO)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi Gary, As I mentioned last quarter, I believe Robotaxi has reached a tipping point globally. Through continuous delivery of safe autonomous rides and positive word miles, we&#8217;re seeing more countries and regions creating supportive environments for Robotaxi operations. We believe the industry will accelerate in 2026. Apollo is clear global leader in this space. We&#8217;ve completed over 20 million cumulative rides. At peak period. Our weekly fully driverless rides exceeded 300,000. To date, <person>Apollo Gold</person> fleets have accumulated more than 300 million autonomous kilometers, including over 190 million fully driverless Atoms kilometers with an outstanding safety record. And we continue advancing our industry leading technology to make rides safer and more comfortable. We&#8217;re also accelerating international expansion to capture global opportunities. Today, our Global footprint spans 26 cities across different continents, covering both Left hand and right hand drive robotaxi markets. Our autonomous driving system works reliably anywhere across different traffic patterns and different urban environments. Notably, very few players have entered right hand drive robotaxi markets. While we&#8217;ve already established a presence and are making rapid progress. Moreover, we have a fundamental cost advantage. our fleet is the world&#8217;s first purpose built production vehicle designed from the ground up for Level 4 autonomous driving. At under <money>US$30,000</money> per vehicle, our fleet offers</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your next question comes from Miranda Zuang with <org>Bank of America Securities</org>. Please ask your question. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><org>Bank of America Securities Equity Analyst</org></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you management for taking my question. Wish you a happy year of health. So my question is about competition. We have seen that the consumer facing AI competition is intensifying recently, especially during the <chron>Chinese New Year</chron>. How do you assess the current competitive dynamics? Where do you see Baidu&#8217;s AI to see products such as the earning assistance differentiation and also positioning in this market? And lastly, how to think about the path to monetization. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><person>Julius Luo</person> (Executive Vice Preisdent)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is Julius. The AI2C product market is highly competitive. We have seen some competitors adopt very aggressive market strategies to rapidly scale their user base in the past <chron>Chinese New Year</chron>. However, as technology and products evolve rapidly, we still believe our core strategy should remain grounded in actual user needs. We are highly committed to continuously enhancing our existing products and services capabilities through AI innovations to better serve our users in our flagship consumer facing products, the Baidu App. Today we have build the Earning Assistant to strengthen our service capabilities across the entire user journey from information seeking to providing solutions and completing tasks. On information seeking, we have significantly enhanced how users assess information through Earning Assistant. For example, we have improved the answer accuracy and relevance through racial and Earning Assistant maintains low error rates with minimal hallucinations, delivering the highly trustworthy content to users. We have also integrated the multilingual AI Search API capabilities that can enable users to assess the broader information sources during conversations, improving the information richness and usability, especially for scenarios like traveling planning which is quite helpful. And in December Earning assistance MAU surpassed 200 million and with conversation rounds and engagements growing quite fast for task complexion, we are integrating the multi-channel platform agents to connect users with tools and real world services. This quarter alone we added nearly 100 service capabilities, especially in healthcare, travel, education and E commerce. For example, through the <org>Baidu Health</org> multi-channel platform integrated into earnings system, users can assess a range of healthcare capabilities spanning online to offline services. In E commerce, our multi-channel platform module saw a very strong GMV growth quarter over quarter. Meanwhile, we are taking a different approach with the standalone app positioning as a platform for innovations and experimentations. Our earlier multimodal AI features have gained good traction with the younger audiences and more recently we have added AI capabilities focus on the workplace productivity tapping into earning books ability to handle complex tasks in professional settings, we are seeing the promising early signals in these productivity scenarios. We take a measured approach to monetize the AI tools products, prioritizing the product excellence and the user experiences. Monetization will follow naturally as the products mature. Thank you for your question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Macquarie Analyst</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p> Good evening. My question is mostly focusing on the AI investment. How do you think about the AI related CAPEX over the next 12 to 24 months? How should we think about the return profile of these AI investments and expected impact on the ROIC over time? Broadly speaking, where do you see further efficiency opportunities to support margin cash flow improvements in the future? Thank you, Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><person>Henry He</person> (Chief Financial Officer)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is Henry first of all on capex and AI investment. Since we have launched earnings In March of 2023 we have invested over <money>100 billion RMB</money> in AI. Going forward, we will continue to maintain this level of the investment density. Second, we are very conscious about returns and understand investors focus on the return on capital invested. That&#8217;s why we have work to improve our financial performance and we have delivered a good result on key metrics over the past few quarters. For example, in Q4 gross profit for <org value=\"BIDU.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Baidu</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BIDU' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BIDU )</span> grew double digits sequentially and the non GAAP operating income for <org value=\"BIDU.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Baidu</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BIDU' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BIDU )</span> increased about 35% quarter over quarter. We also performed better on the margin profile both on margin and EBIT margin sequence. Importantly, operating cash flow for <org value=\"BIDU.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Baidu</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BIDU' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BIDU )</span> turned positive in Q3 and remained positive in Q4 with the second half operating cash flow reaching nearly <money>4 billion RMB</money>. Free cash flow for <org value=\"BIDU.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Baidu</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BIDU' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BIDU )</span> also turned positive in Q4. Thirdly, we have also found and explored alternative ways of supporting our financial needs including for example operational and financing leasing as well as we have access to the low cost interest backing borrowing. For example, some of these bank borrowings and the leasing facilities carry the interest rates as low as below 2%. So these approaches help us maintain a healthy long term financing structure while sustaining our AI investment and support our business growth. So in summary, we will continue to maintain our AI investment density while balancing investor focus on profitability and return timelines. We believe that even with significant AI investment, operating cash flow remain positive going forward as well.

            "title": "Musk touts California robotaxis but Tesla does nothing to get permits",
            "description": "<p><location value=\"LU/us.ca.losang\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >LOS ANGELES</location>, <chron>Feb 26</chron> (Reuters) - For more than a year, <person>Elon Musk</person> has repeatedly said Tesla is months away from launching a driverless robotaxi service in <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> - once state regulators give their blessing.</p>\n<p>Tesla did nothing to secure that approval in 2025, according to previously unreported state <org>Department of Motor Vehicles</org> records and a state spokesperson. Tesla logged zero miles of autonomous test driving on California roads last year for the sixth year in a row, the records show.</p>\n<p>Documenting test miles is critical in <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California's</location> regulatory system for robotaxis, which requires companies to progress through a series of permits before being allowed to operate a driverless ride-hailing service such as Alphabet's Waymo.</p>\n<p>Much of Tesla's <money>$1.5 trillion</money> market value is tied to investors' belief that it will soon operate a vast fleet of robotaxis and sell millions of autonomous-driving software subscriptions. Operating driverless vehicles in <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> - the largest U.S. auto market - is a linchpin of those ambitions.</p>\n<p><person>Bryant Walker Smith</person>, a <org>University of South Carolina</org> law professor and autonomous-driving expert who has consulted for the California DMV, said Tesla is implying that \"they are ready and regulators are not,\" while the reality is that \"regulators are ready, and they are not.\"</p>\n<p>Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. On an earnings call in October, Musk told analysts that the company is &quot;paranoid about safety&quot; and that it takes a &quot;cautious approach&quot; to new markets. &quot;We probably could just let it loose in these cities,&quot; he said, &quot;but we just don't want to take a chance.&quot;</p>\n<p>So far, Tesla operates only a small pilot robotaxi service in <location value=\"LU/us.tx.austin\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Austin, Texas</location>, which has far fewer regulatory barriers than <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location>.</p>\n<p>In the <location value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >San Francisco Bay Area</location>, the company last July started operating what it called a \"robotaxi\" service that was not a robotaxi service at all. Instead, it is a chauffeur service with human drivers who use Tesla's \"Full Self-Driving\" driver-assistance software, which is not fully autonomous, according to the state regulator authorizing the service and Tesla's disclosures to customers.</p>\n<p>In order to operate fully self-driving vehicles in <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location>, like Waymo, Tesla would first need to obtain permits to test and operate driverless vehicles from the state's <org>DMV and Public Utilities Commission</org>, which regulates commercial ride-hailing.</p>\n<p>Tesla so far has only the entry-level DMV permit, which allows testing driverless vehicles only with a human safety monitor in the driver's seat. A DMV spokesperson said Tesla has not applied for any additional permits.</p>\n<p>Tesla would need to log at least 50,000 miles (80,467 km) of autonomous driving on public roads in <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> with a safety driver before applying for a different permit allowing testing without one, according to proposed DMV regulations expected to be finalized later this year.</p>\n<p>Tesla has not logged any miles with state regulators since 2019 and has documented only 562 miles in total since 2016. </p>\n<p>Waymo, by comparison, logged more than 13 million testing miles and secured seven different regulatory approvals between 2014 and 2023, when it received approval to charge passengers for rides in driverless robotaxis. Waymo is one of three companies with <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> permits to commercially operate driverless vehicles and the only one approved to operate a robotaxi fleet anything like what Musk envisions.</p>\n<p>In written comments last year, Tesla criticized some of the California DMV's proposed revisions to autonomous-driving rules, questioning the need for testing on state roads and minimum-mile requirements. The company also complained about &quot;overly burdensome reporting requirements&quot; for crashes and other system failures.</p>\n<p>Musk has often suggested <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> regulations are the main impediment to deploying robotaxis there. On an <chron>October 2024</chron> earnings call, he said <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> has \"quite a long regulatory approval process.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'd be shocked if we don't get approved next year,\" he added, \"but it's just not something we totally control.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(Reporting by <person>Chris Kirkham</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.ca.losang\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Los Angeles</location>; Editing by <person>Brian Thevenot</person> and <person>Matthew Lewis</person>)</p>\n",

            "description": "<p><location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >WASHINGTON</location>, <chron>Feb 26</chron> (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new applications for jobless benefits increased slightly last week and the unemployment rate appeared to hold steady in February amid a stable labor market.</p>\n<p>The weekly jobless claims report from the <org>Labor Department</org> on Thursday suggested the labor market remained in a &quot;low-hire, low-fire&quot; state, and supported economists' expectations that the Federal Reserve would not cut interest rates before Fed Chair <person>Jerome Powell's</person> term ends in May. </p>\n<p>The labor market is regaining its footing after hitting a soft patch last year amid uncertainty economists attributed to President <person>Donald Trump's</person> broad tariffs.</p>\n<p>&quot;The data show no sign of the layoffs we would expect in a weakening labor market during the early days of a hypothetical recession,&quot; said <person>Carl Weinberg</person>, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. &quot;That will jolly up traders who believe the Fed will not cut rates anytime soon, given a steady labor market and inflation above target.&quot;</p>\n<p>Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted  212,000 for the week ended <chron>February 21</chron>. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 215,000 claims for the latest week. Last week's claims included the Presidents' Day holiday, which could have impacted the data. </p>\n<p>Still, claims were below the levels seen during the same period last year. <org>The U.S. Supreme Court</org> last Friday struck down the tariffs, which Trump pursued under a law meant for use in national emergencies. Trump swiftly imposed a 10% global tariff for 150 days to replace some of the emergency duties, before raising the rate to 15% over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Economists said the latest moves created near-term uncertainty, but anticipated minimal economic impact. </p>\n<p>Lingering uncertainty from the since-invalidated import duties was blamed for a general hesitancy among businesses to increase hiring. A rapid adoption of artificial intelligence is adding another layer of caution, economists said. AI is the leading cause of layoffs in the technology sector.</p>\n<p>Stocks on <location>Wall Street</location> fell amid wariness over the implications of AI. The dollar advanced against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields were lower.</p>\n<p>LOW HIRING IS THE MOST WORRYING ASPECT</p>\n<p>&quot;The low hiring rate is still the most concerning aspect of the labor market, but the trend in continued claims suggests employers aren't pulling back further,&quot; said <person>Nancy Vanden Houten</person>, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.</p>\n<p>The number of people receiving unemployment benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, dropped 31,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.833 million during the week ended <chron>February 14</chron>, the claims report showed. The so-called continuing claims covered the period during which the government surveyed households for February's unemployment rate. </p>\n<p>Continued claims rose modestly between the January and February survey weeks. The jobless rate eased to 4.3% in January from 4.4% in December. The Chicago Fed forecast the unemployment rate steady at 4.28% in February, which would round up to 4.3%.</p>\n<p>While the labor market is stabilizing, consumers remain anxious about their employment prospects. </p>\n<p>A survey from the Conference Board this week showed the share of consumers who viewed jobs as &quot;hard to get&quot; increased to a five-year high in February, though households also believed the availability of jobs had improved.</p>\n<p>The median duration of unemployment is near four-year highs, and jobs remain scarce for young college graduates, labor market data shows. Unemployed recent college graduates do not show in the claims data because they have limited or no work history, making them ineligible to file for jobless benefits.</p>\n<p>&quot;The relationship between continuing claims and unemployment is far from airtight, given that the long-term unemployed, new entrants to the labor market, and those re-entering from inactivity, all are ineligible to claim,&quot; said <person>Oliver Allen</person>, senior U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. </p>\n<p>Allen added that the Conference Board survey's &quot;hard to get&quot; jobs measure was &quot;a very reliable indicator in the past,&quot; and pointed &quot;to the unemployment rate rising again soon.&quot;</p>\n<p>Continuing claims could be falling because some people have exhausted their eligibility, limited to 26 weeks in most states.</p>\n<p><person>Andrew Stettner</person>, senior director for economic security at the <org>National Employment Law Project</org>, said a town hall for technology workers this past Sunday captured the AI anxiety.</p>\n<p>&quot;Software engineers talked about being laid off and out of work for 12 months or more,&quot; said Stettner, a former director of unemployment insurance modernization at the <org>Labor Department</org>.</p>\n<p>&quot;They saw AI as just the latest accelerant of rounds of technology layoffs at major companies like Amazon, but more importantly a rising threat for engineers to find any new job.&quot; </p>\n<p>(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by <person>Chizu Nomiyama</person> and <person>Andrea Ricci</person>)</p>\n",

With Enterprise Linux binary compatibility, RLC Pro bundles long term support and lifecycle management, FIPS 140-3 validation, indemnification, security and support SLAs and customer-driven, direct bug fixes as necessary features, creating a clear path from community-based to mission-critical enterprise production.</p>\n    <div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1\">\n                <p>\n\n                    <img src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2832135/CIQ_Logo.jpg\" title=\"Powering the next generation of software infrastructure (PRNewsfoto/CIQ)\" alt=\"Powering the next generation of software infrastructure (PRNewsfoto/CIQ)\" />\n\n                </p>\n    </div>\n<p>RLC Pro represents a fundamental shift in what can be expected from enterprise operating systems and redefines the Enterprise Linux standard. CIQ believes that long term support, FIPS validation and direct bug fixes should be bundled as base features, not sold as expensive add-ons. For the first time, organizations get the commercial accountability and vendor support production infrastructure demands, bundled into one solution as the base offering from CIQ.</p><p>This addresses a long-standing market gap. Today, enterprises choosing open source solutions accept operational risk, spending engineering resources hunting through GitHub for stability solutions and managing security vulnerabilities without vendor backing. Those who choose commercial solutions often pay additional subscription fees to unlock the features they need on top of base licensing costs. This is orders of magnitude more difficult and risky when maintaining the operating system. RLC Pro eliminates the difficulty and risk by making these capabilities standard, delivering the support enterprises need, leaning on CIQ for faster bug fixes, vulnerability patches and escalated support as part of the base offering.</p><p>RLC Pro transforms what enterprises can accomplish by providing:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li><b>Bundled long term support</b> enables platform teams to plan infrastructure on 3-5 year horizons without forced point-release upgrades. They can deploy once, maintain stability and focus engineering resources on business differentiation rather than operating system maintenance.</li><li><b>FIPS 140-3 validated packages</b> enable enterprises to deploy at scale in government, defense, financial services and healthcare by passing compliance audits without resource-intensive internal certification efforts.</li><li><b>Direct bug and security fixes</b> from CIQ's engineering team keep production systems running and SLAs met based on specific customer feedback. Engineers stop firefighting infrastructure issues and start shipping features faster.</li><li><b>Enterprise License Agreements</b> (ELAs) to cover your entire infrastructure: from core, to cloud and edge, RLC Pro has your back.</li></ul><p>Rocky Linux is one of the most widely deployed enterprise Linux distributions worldwide, with Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) telemetry showing more than 2.75 million actively deployed instances globally. As adoption has accelerated, so has enterprise demand for commercially backed support, long-term lifecycle guarantees and validated compliance capabilities. RLC Pro directly addresses that market need.</p><p>\"AI is driving a true inflection point for enterprise infrastructure,\" said <person>Gregory Kurtzer</person>, CEO of CIQ and Cofounder of Rocky Linux. \"RLC Pro brings together the infrastructure capabilities organizations need into a use-everywhere model that prioritizes efficiency, security and usability. We believe long term support, FIPS validation and direct, responsive engineering should be standard. When you hit a bug, we fix it. When you need a security remediation, we deliver it. And when you need a partner to ensure your infrastructure is running at its best, CIQ is there with you.\"</p><p>\"The real transformation here is what this enables enterprises to do,\" said <person>Bjorn Hovland</person>, President of CIQ. \"Deploy in regulated environments immediately. Plan infrastructure investments with confidence. Free engineering talent to build products instead of managing operating systems. RLC Pro doesn't just change how organizations consume Linux, it changes what they can accomplish with it.\"</p><p>RLC Pro is available today from CIQ and through <location>AWS Marketplace</location>, <location>Microsoft Azure Marketplace</location> and <location>Google Cloud Marketplace</location>. It will soon be available through the CIQ Portal, launching in the coming months.</p><p>To learn more about RLC Pro and CIQ's complete Enterprise Linux portfolio, read the CIQ blog post.
