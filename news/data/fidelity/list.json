Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>Our 12-month target price of <money>$137</money>, up by <money>$2</money>, reflects a combination of our relative valuation and DCF models. On a relative basis, we apply a 5.5x multiple of enterprise value to projected 2027 EBITDA, a slight premium to EOG's historical forward average. We think a modest premium is defensible due to the Encino deal, which, once integrated, should enable reductions to EOG's cost basis. This approach yields a value of <money>$130</money> per share. Meanwhile, our DCF model presumes 6.2% free cash flow growth per year for 10 years, a 2% terminal value, and a WACC of 7.4%, yielding a value of <money>$144</money> per share. We cut our 2026 EPS estimate by <money>$1.45</money> to <money>$9.50</money> and initiate our 2027 EPS estimate at <money>$11.63</money>. Encino is an important contributor for EOG, but at the moment, the company is incurring some cost pressures as it absorbs the deal. However, EOG's legacy well costs in the <location value=\"LU/us.mt.utica\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Utica</location> were 13% better than those of Encino's predecessor management team, and so we think it is a matter of time before EOG brings down those costs as well.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

While many other Western firms are very early in the exploration stage or 'paper' phase of developing processing capabilities, <u>one company</u> is already operational and processing metals.</p><p>Based in <location value=\"LU/us.oh.euclid\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Euclid</location>, Ohio, REalloys (ALOY) operates <location value=\"LR/nam\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >North America's</location> only facility that has converted heavy rare earths into the high-performance metals and alloys required for defense systems. By bridging the gap between raw oxides and finished magnets, they have moved beyond the industry's theoretical roadmaps to provide a functioning supply chain that feeds American factories and weapons programs today.</p><p>The company has non-binding agreements in place for long-term feedstock from <location value=\"LR/nam\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >North America</location>, Kazakhstan, Greenland, and <location value=\"LC/br\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Brazil</location> and processes it directly in <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location>, eliminating offshore detours. It is already supplying qualified metals and alloys under <u><org>U.S. Department of Defense</org> contracts</u> as sourcing rules tighten toward fully domestic material.</p><p><b>What the DoD Needs Urgently</b></p><p>The U.S. military is working with <u><org value=\"ALOY.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >REalloys</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='ALOY' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( ALOY )</span></u> for rare earth metals and alloys for use  in active programs. The company produces defense-grade metal and alloy domestically, to specifications already embedded in program supply chains. As sourcing rules change in 2027 and Chinese material becomes ineligible, that same material remains compliant without modification. <b><u>No other North American supplier</u> currently produces the same class of qualified heavy rare earth metals and alloys. And in our opinion it is unlikely they will have the capabilities to do so at scale for at least another 3 years.</b></p><p><u>Heavy rare earths</u> keep modern missile and aerospace systems operating under extreme conditions. Dysprosium and terbium are added to magnet alloys to preserve magnetic strength when temperatures rise or when vibration intensifies.</p><p>That makes heavy rare earths absolutely vital to things like precision-guided missiles and missile-defense interceptors. Dysprosium and terbium are non-negotiable inputs for these weapons systems.</p><p><b>Where REalloys Ranks in the Magnet War</b></p><p>Strip away the rhetoric, and the U.S. rare earth landscape collapses fast. Most companies are still upstream, with mines, oxides, separation pilots, and PowerPoint roadmaps. <org value=\"ALOY.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >REalloys</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='ALOY' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( ALOY )</span> is firmly downstream, where supply chains either function or fail.</p><p>They have an <u>executed commercial processing and long-term offtake agreement</u> with the <org>Saskatchewan Research Council</org> (SRC) tied to SRC's Rare Earth Processing Facility in Saskatoon. Under that agreement, <org value=\"ALOY.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >REalloys</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='ALOY' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( ALOY )</span>  secures 80% of annual production from the upgraded capacity, with supply structured on a cost-plus model. Heavy rare earth production from the upgraded facility is expected to begin in early 2027, positioning <org value=\"ALOY.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >REalloys</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='ALOY' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( ALOY )</span> as the only commercial-scale supplier of dysprosium and terbium oxides in <location value=\"LR/nam\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >North America</location>.</p><p>They are also committing approximately <u><money>US$21 million</money></u> to expand the facility to lift heavy rare earth processing capacity by about 300% and increasing light rare earth (NdPr) capacity by 50%. The design output is up to 30 tonnes of dysprosium oxide, 15 tonnes of terbium oxide, and 400 tonnes per year of high-purity NdPr metal, with NdPr increasing to 600 tonnes per year after the expansion is complete, with first production slated for early next year.</p><p>LOI's are in place for feedstock from  <location value=\"LC/kz\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Kazakhstan</location>, <location value=\"LC/br\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Brazil</location>, and <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>.</p><p>In <location value=\"LC/kz\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Kazakhstan</location>, they have secured a non-binding long-term offtake agreement with AltynGroup for rare-earth feedstock containing both light and heavy rare-earth elements, including dysprosium and terbium.</p><p>That raw material will feed directly into <org value=\"ALOY.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >REalloys'</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='ALOY' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( ALOY )</span> U.S. metals and alloy production rather than being routed offshore. </p><p>In <location value=\"LC/br\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Brazil</location>, the company has signed an <u>offtake memorandum with St George Mining</u> that outlines access to up to 40% of rare earth production from the country's Araxá project, subject to definitive agreements.</p><p>In <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>, they have a 10-year offtake arrangement (at LOI stage) under which it expects to supply <org value=\"ALOY.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >REalloys</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='ALOY' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( ALOY )</span> up to 15% of annual production from the Tanbreez project's rare earth concentrate.</p><p>The final destination is the <org>Department of Defense</org>. <br /><br />Their <location value=\"LU/us.oh.euclid\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Euclid, Ohio</location> facility is designed to separate rare earth oxides which are reduced into metal under controlled atmospheres and alloyed into magnet-grade compositions. Both light and heavy rare earths, including dysprosium and terbium, will be processed at this facility within the same metallurgical workflow. Output is produced as pre-alloyed metal, with chemistry set upstream and held to tight tolerances required for qualified magnet production. This places <location value=\"LU/us.oh.euclid\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Euclid</location> between separation and magnet manufacturing, at the point where rare earths become usable inputs rather than intermediates.</p><p>The material is bought through ordinary commercial supply relationships and moves directly into magnets and components supplied to the DoD.</p><p><b>America Rebuilds Under Strategic Threat</b></p><p>For the first time in decades, <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location> is rebuilding a rare-earth supply chain under active Chinese pressure.</p><p>It is doing so under deliberate Chinese pressure on the processed materials that keep weapons programs and factories running.</p><p><b>Almost no one outside <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> can reliably turn rare earth oxides into finished metal on an industrial scale.</b></p><p>That step turning rare earth oxides into usable metals is where most Western supply chains quietly gave up decades ago.</p><p><org>The Center for Strategic and International Studies</org> (CSIS) identifies rare-earth metallization and alloying as the least developed and most difficult capability to rebuild outside <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>. In its work on supply-chain resilience, CSIS describes metal and alloy production as an experience-driven bottleneck–one that cannot be recreated quickly, even with funding in place.</p><p>The CSIS makes this clear: rare-earth metallization is learned over long operating histories, not built on a schedule. Reaching stable, magnet-grade output can take many years and, in some cases, decades. Mines can be built, but metallization cannot be rushed.</p><p>While most Western efforts stop at oxides or pilot separation, <org value=\"ALOY.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Realloys</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='ALOY' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( ALOY )</span>  is operating at the conversion step CSIS identifies as the hardest to rebuild. At <location value=\"LU/us.oh.euclid\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Euclid</location>, oxide becomes metal, metal becomes alloy, and chemistry is held inside specifications already accepted downstream. <b>That work is happening now, inside an operating U.S. facility.</b></p><p>They operate at the conversion layer CSIS identifies as the hardest capability to rebuild outside <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>. <b>The separated rare earth oxides reduced into metal and alloyed to magnet-grade specifications at <location value=\"LU/us.oh.euclid\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Euclid</location> will be used downstream.</b> The process runs under controlled atmospheres, with chemistry set upstream and held within tight tolerances across repeated production runs.</p><p>That capability is rare because the U.S. abandoned it decades ago and it can't be rebuilt quickly. It requires operating history, not construction schedules. It exists here, inside an operating U.S. facility, feeding magnet and defense supply chains with usable material rather than intermediates.</p><p>This capability sets the limits of the rebuild, and of U.S. industrial and defense capacity.<br /><br />Here are other companies that are reliant on heavy rare earth elements and why they are so important to their businesses:<br /><b><br /><org value=\"MSFT.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Microsoft</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='MSFT' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( MSFT )</span> </b> has become a pivotal architect of the \"Circular Rare Earth Economy,\" <u>shifting its strategy</u> from simple procurement to large-scale urban mining.

Good morning and thank you for joining us today. 2025 was a pivotal year for <org value=\"TTEC.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >TTEC Holdings</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='TTEC' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( TTEC )</span>, one in which we met our financial commitments, improved our balance sheet and fortified our position as the leader in AI enabled. For the full year 2025 revenue was <money>$2,136,000,000</money> exceeding the high end of our guidance. Adjusted EBITDA was <money>$214 million</money> reflecting year over year growth of 5.6%. We generated <money>$83 million</money> in cash flow and reduced our credit facility borrowings by <money>$70 million</money>. This reflects our continued focus on strengthening our balance sheet. Before moving on to our business overview, I'd like to point out that our operating improvements and disciplined budget management were offset by a one time goodwill non cash impairment on a portion of our TTEC Digital segment in the fourth quarter. This was due to the decline in our market capitalization and the annual fair value assessment. While impactful from an accounting GAAP perspective, the impairment was a non cash expense and has no impact on our broader ability to execute our strategy or the value of our customer experience (CX) technology solutions. Now on to some highlights from the year we deepened our relationships with our largest clients, capturing an increased share of wallet as they expanded their use of our end to end consulting, technology and managed services portfolio. Sales of new lines of business launched in 2025 to our base were strong in both our Engage and digital segments, increasing year over year across the business. We attracted a substantial number of new clients with our AI forward and vertical solutions approach. Several of these clients are new to having a CX partner, a shift driven by data and AI landscape that has become too complex for clients to navigate alone. We grew our strategic technology partnerships as we collaborated on new client sales opportunities and innovative solution development. Our professional services with these technology partners grew 16% outside of our legacy Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) practices. We continue to increase the penetration of our AI enabled solutions with our embedded base and are integrating this innovation functionality in every new TTEC Engage and TTEC Digital Opportunity. We expect that we will achieve near 100% AI adoption with our current clients by the end of this year and importantly, we continue to invest in our global team of CX engineers, consultants, data analysts and associates earning great place to work certification in 15 countries, several more countries than last year. Before we move into the discussion of our segment performance, I'd like to share some thoughts on the current macro environment. Clearly there is an AI overhang casting a shadow over valuations for CX IT and SaaS based business services companies. We are fully cognizant that over time there will be an impact on lower value interactions which are part of the current <money>$400 billion</money> TAM. However, the opportunity is sufficiently large to support the companies serving the market today, let alone the new solutions that are emerging. Based on our experience, AI isn't eliminating the need for cx, it's making it more effective by automating routine transactions. It's enabling humans in the loop to focus on the high stakes interactions that define a brand. But even as we navigate the fastest tech adoption curve in history, we must remain mindful that the promise of AI is only as good as its execution. Success lies in balancing this rapid innovation with the operational realities required to deliver a seamless human centric experience. Our point of view is shaped by several market realities. One transformation requires a long Runway. It took almost 30 years from the Internet's debut to achieve total global integration, it demanded decades to build the infrastructure, technology tools and adoption to achieve worldwide ubiquity. 2. System sprawl is massive. Today, the average Fortune 1000 company operates hundreds of software applications and technology systems both in the cloud and on premise. Although not all of them are required for CX, less than a quarter of them are integrated. 3. Internal cultural adoption creates a bottleneck According to a recent <org>Bain Co.</org> Study, 88% of business transformations fail to achieve their goals because of lack of organizational readiness and employee alignment. Success requires businesses to rethink how they organize, empower, train and measure the effectiveness of their people and AI counterparts. And finally, technology is only as valuable as the end consumer's willingness to use and trust it. Just as the EV market shifted towards hybrid cars when consumers demanded the security of traditional engines alongside new tech, CX is entering a hybrid era where consumers appreciate the potential convenience and personalization of agentic AI but demand the trust and authenticity of a human in the loop for high value complex interactions. In this environment, enterprises are seeking guidance and expertise like never before. They're looking to architect modern data states, integrate disparate systems and redefine workflows. In some cases, rather than struggling to do it themselves in house, they choose to work with an end to end partner like ttech. This convergence of complexity and urgency is exactly where we excel. We don't just provide the technology or the people, we provide the strategic CX bridge that turns AI potential into operational reality. With 42% of general AI initiatives failing due to lack of depth, companies are shifting budgets to CX specialists like us who don't just know AI but have the precious final mile CX experience to move fast, remove risk and deliver brand differentiation. To achieve the full potential of our unique platform, we continue to build on our strong leadership foundation with new talent. I am pleased to announce several key appointments that will further accelerate our strategic roadmap. <person>Alfredo Rizzo</person>, a long standing leader within our TTEC Digital organization, has moved into the newly created role of Chief Technology Officer of ttec. Reporting directly to me. His deep institutional knowledge client Centric experience and AI first approach will be vital as he fast tracks our efforts to deliver next generation AI solutions at scale. Joining him is Ramkey Desi Raju, our new Chief Operating Officer at TTEC Holdings Digital. His deep domain expertise gained at IBM among others will help us further bridge the gap between operational excellence and technology enabled transformation, ensuring our digital initiatives continue to deliver measurable impact for our clients. Now I will Turn to a discussion of our business segments. Let's start with the Digital CX segment Engagement as planned, we delivered solid progress this quarter as we continue to advance our transformation agenda with a disciplined focus on profitable and sustainable growth. We're seeing encouraging traction across the business as clients increasingly turn to us for modern digital first CX solutions and operational excellence. We're expanding our role by introducing new vertical specific solutions, increasing cross sell of digital capabilities and consistently delivering on the priorities that matter most to our clients. At the same time, our new client pipeline reflects healthy momentum, attracting world class brands that are seeking AI forward CX solutions that deliver the highest quality interactions. We remain disciplined in our pursuit of operating leverage and margin expansion. Our digital first strategy is yielding significant efficiencies and our strengthened leadership team has energized our first frontline performance as well as continue to optimize our global delivery mix. We are focused on winning new business that meets our profitability expectations. In parallel, we're working to optimize a few underperforming contracts. While this creates a temporary revenue headwind in 2026, it secures a healthier client portfolio, superior margins and a more resilient growth profile. Ultimately, these deliberate actions ensure we are not just growing, but growing profitably and sustainably. Turning to TTEC Holdings Digital we continue to evolve our professional and managed services to meet the changing needs and priorities of the market. Clients are looking to us as experts to help them navigate their digital evolution. Because we specialize in building value through the strategic application of data, AI and automation, we're helping ensure that every innovation translates directly into disciplined, measurable business outcomes. While these engagements may begin smaller than traditional Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) migrations, they are highly strategic and sticky. They leverage our expertise in the application of AI, data analytics, consulting journey, orchestration and systems integration. Because of our fluency with all the major CX technologies, these engagements often benefit from the network effect where they expand into multi phase professional and managed services relationships. The shift is broadening our addressable market, increasing both our share of wallet and existing clients and attracting new ones. Our technology agnostic approach combined with our ability to rapidly pilot use cases across all major hyperscalers is positioning us as a trusted partner for complex multi platform CX transformations. As a result, we're seeing growing demand for adjacent services and strong momentum in professional services pipelines and bookings. Our partnership with a global travel and hospitality brand is one example of how our ability to combine consulting technology and analytic insight is driving sustainable growth. Our relationship began when this enterprise was facing a critical end of life Cliff with their on premise contact center technology. They brought us in to initially to mitigate risk and assess their path forward. Fast forward four years. That tactical engagement has evolved into a complete digital transformation that will persist well into the future. We've modernized their foundation by successfully migrating them to an integrated Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) and CRM platform. We've architected a modern data state with a clean unified data environment required for advanced CX and activated AI. By deploying generative AI functionality to personalize guest interactions at scale, we fundamentally moved this client from a high risk, high cost legacy environment to a high reward AI ready CX engine. Their CX operations are no longer a cost center. Today they are primarily a driver of revenue growth and long term customer loyalty. This is the blueprint that we're now scaling across multiple clients. Digital First Automation handles low complexity tasks, reserving human expertise empowered with AI for authentic empathetic white glove moments. It demonstrates what can happen when we change the conversation from managing cost to mastering outcomes. As a global consulting, technology and managed services company delivering solutions at the intersection of data, AI and customer experience, we are evolving our business to capitalize on the massive opportunity before us. Which brings me to our financial resilience. We expect to continue delivering EBITDA growth While revenue in each business segment is anticipated to be slightly down this year, as we codify the next generation of the CX playbook, we're proactively remixing our solutions, delivery models and commercial constructs regarding our stock price. It is our view that the current valuation does not reflect the differentiation and value in our business. Obviously, entire sectors have been put under similar pressure and are being treated as though they have no terminal value. Our strategy remains focused on the factors that we control and on building an enduring business for the long term. While we're collaborating with financial advisors and banking partners on our credit facility, the business performance continues to improve with stronger balance sheet and cash flow. These efforts will enhance our long term flexibility, supporting both our operations and innovation agenda. As we pivot to the year ahead, we remain focused on returning the company to its historic growth and margin profile. We are prioritizing high yield complex client engagements with ample opportunity for growth, expanding our role as a strategic end to end transformation partner, driving differentiation through vertical solutions and proprietary IP deepening our technology partnerships, continuing to improve efficiency through AI and automation and investing in specialized talent with deep vertical CX operational and technical expertise. These priorities are the critical path for continued success. By leveraging our unique end to end solutions and investing in our people, platform and strategic partnerships. We will continue to capture the demand for AI enabled CX solutions well into the future. I continue to appreciate and value the dedication and support of our board and talented teams across the globe. I'll now hand it over to Kenny.</p>\n\n<p><strong><person>Kenny Wagers</person></strong></p>\n<p>Thank you Ken and good morning. I will start with a review of our fourth quarter and full year 2025 financial results before providing context into our 2026 full year financial outlook. In my discussion of the fourth quarter and full year financial results, reference to revenue is on a GAAP basis while EBITDA operating income and earnings per share are on a non GAAP adjusted basis. A full reconciliation of our GAAP to non GAAP results is included in the tables attached to our earnings press release. On a consolidated basis for fourth quarter 2025 compared to the prior year period, revenue was 570 million, a slight increase over the prior year period of 567 million. Adjusted EBITDA was 62 million or 10.9% of revenue compared to 51 million or 9%. Operating income was 48 million or 8.4% of revenue compared to 35 million or 6.2%, and earnings per share was <money>$0.47</money> compared to <money>$0.19</money>. Foreign exchange had a 4 million positive impact on revenue and a 1 million negative impact on operating income in the quarter compared to prior year period primarily in our engaged segment. Now turning to our Consolidated full year 2025 financial results, revenue was <money>$2.14 billion</money> compared to the prior year of 2.21 billion, a decrease of 3.2%. Adjusted EBITDA was 214 million or 10% of revenue, an increase of 5.6% or 80 basis points over the prior year of 202 million or 9.2%. Operating income was 155 million or 7.3% of revenue compared to 136 million or 6.2% in the prior year and earnings per share was <money>$1.10</money> compared to <money>$0.71</money> in the prior year period. Foreign exchange had a 3 million positive impact on revenue and a 4 million positive impact on operating income over the prior year, primarily in our engaged segment. At the company and segment level, our full year financial performance was in line with the guidance expectations previously communicated with revenue exceeding the high end of full year guidance range, while profitability came in near the low end of guidance. Turning to our fourth quarter and full year 2025 segment results, in our Engage segment, fourth quarter revenue decreased 1.8% over the prior year period to 444 million. Operating income was 36 million or 8.1% of revenue, an increase of 62% or 320 basis points compared to 22 million or 4.9% of revenue in the prior year. Engaged fourth quarter revenue and operating income were in line with our expectations as healthcare seasonal volumes delivered 22 million of additional revenue compared to the prior year. As mentioned in our previous earnings, a significant portion of the investments related to the seasonal ramps and certain other growth clients were made in the third quarter resulting in fourth quarter, year over year profitability growth and margin expansion. The health care growth was offset by a decline in the public sector portfolio due to the loss of a large client we had previously communicated which was at lower margins and thus had a nominal impact on operating income. We are pleased with our Engage segment's fourth quarter financial results and the profitability improvement that not only drove significant growth in the quarter but more than offset the third quarter decline and resulted in overall second half margin improvement compared to the prior year. On a full year basis, the engaged 2025 revenue was <money>$1.67 billion</money>, a decrease of 4.6% compared to <money>$1.75 billion</money> in the prior year. Operating income was 101 million or 6.1% of revenue compared to 85 million or 4.9% in the prior year period representing an increase of 18.8% and margin expansion of 120 basis points. The Engage revenue exceeded the high end of our full year guidance. Our focus on increased profitability was reflected in the year over year operating income growth and margin expansion delivered despite the decline in revenue. The profitability improvement was a result of our deliberate actions taken over the last 18 months where we realigned our cost structure, improved operating efficiencies and effectiveness and continued to increase our offshore revenue mix. We also added new leadership which helped drive these accomplishments. The Engaged backlog for the next 12 months is 1.48 billion or 92% of our 2026 revenue guidance at the midpoint of the range, down from 96% in 2025. The engaged last 12 month revenue retention rate is 95% compared to 82% in the prior year. Now moving to our digital segment, fourth quarter revenue was <money>$125 million</money>, a 9.2% increase over the prior year of <money>$115 million</money>. Operating income was <money>$12 million</money> or 9.4% of revenue compared to <money>$13 million</money> or 11% in the prior year. The digital fourth quarter revenue increase was driven by product resale which drove <money>$15 million</money> of additional revenue over the prior year. The overall revenue Mix, however, drove a lower operating income and margin as recurring revenue declined 5.6% and professional services were slightly down 1.6% in the quarter compared to the prior year. On a full year basis, Digital's 2025 revenue was 469 million compared to <money>$459 million</money> in the prior year period, an increase of 2.2%. Operating income was <money>$54 million</money> or 11.5% of revenue compared to <money>$51 million</money> or 11.2% in the prior year. The full year digital revenue growth was largely attributable to product resale which nearly doubled compared to the prior year, increasing 24 million. This increase was due to multiple deals with clients that have yet to migrate to cloud based CX delivery solutions. We believe over time these product resale opportunities will diminish in the market. This revenue also included the sale of the IP software closed in the second quarter of 2025 for <money>$4 million</money>. Excluding the product resale, digital revenue declined <money>$14 million</money> or 3.2%. This reflects the ongoing market shift which is moving away from the traditional CCAS point solutions to partners that provide end to end transformative CX solutions to optimizing clients existing platforms. As a result of this shift, Digital Full year 2025 recurring revenue declined 4% compared to the prior year. Professional services were slightly down year over year by 1.5%. However, professional services related to our expanded partnership network grew 15.8% outside of the traditional CCaaS offerings. Although the revenue mix came in less favorable than forecasted, we are pleased with the full year Digital operating income growth and margin expansion over the prior year as cost and utilization management were high priorities. Our digital backlog for the next 12 months is at <money>$287 million</money> or 67% of our 2026 revenue guidance at the midpoint of the range, up slightly from 66% in the prior year. Before I discuss other financial metrics, I will address the non cash goodwill impairment charge and the related tax adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter. In ordinary course, we perform goodwill impairment analyses in accordance with GAAP on an annual basis during the fourth quarter unless a triggering event requires a more frequent analysis. During the annual goodwill impairment analysis, the Company elected to perform a quantitative evaluation of all of its reporting units. Based on this analysis which reflects upon financial projections and market based metrics, the fair value of our digital recurring reporting unit decreased below its carrying value and resulted in 193 million non cash impairment charge. This was primarily due to industry dynamics that are shifting our legacy recurring managed service offerings from point solutions related to contact center technology to optimizing existing environments through <person>AI LED</person> consulting, journey orchestration and data and analytics services. This type of impairment is a reality in the technology services sector where previously acquired technology related companies are impacted by changing market conditions. Our Engage and Digital Professional Services reporting units fair value remains in excess of their respective book values and are not impacted by the impairment. The tax impact of the digital impairment created a net incremental non cash charge of 12 million, further reducing the carrying value of the reporting unit and bringing the total impairment charge to 205 million. Please refer to our Form 10K for more details on the impairment and related tax impact. As Ken mentioned, while impactful from a GAAP reporting perspective, the impairment and the tax valuation allowance were a non cash expense and do not impact our broader strategies and capabilities nor the value of our CX technology solutions. These charges are normalized in our non GAAP reconciliation calculations. I will now share other 2025 metrics before discussing our 2026 outlook. Free cash flow was a positive 83 million in 2025 compared to a negative 104 million in the prior year which as previously discussed was impacted by the discontinuation of the accounts receivable factoring facility normalizing for the prior year. The year over year improvement was 86 million. This was due to a 79 million increase in cash flow from operations and reduced capital expenditures of 7 million. The significant increase in cash generation reflects our keen focus on improving profitability and working capital management. Capital expenditures were <money>$38 million</money> or 1.8% of revenue for the full year 2025, of which 60% was growth related. This compares the capital expenditures of <money>$45 million</money> or 2% of revenue in the prior year. The 2025 growth oriented spend was primarily driven by product development and technology and real estate investments in support of client growth and expansion. As of <chron>December 31, 2025</chron>, cash was 83 million with <money>$908 million</money> of debt primarily representing borrowings under our recently amended 1.05 billion revolving credit facility. The net debt position of 825 million represents a year over year decrease of 68 million. We ended 2025 with a net leverage ratio as defined under the credit facility of 3.58 times compared to 3.99 times at the end of the prior year. As demonstrated by our improved cash flow generation and reduction in net borrowings, deleveraging and strengthening our balance sheet remain top priorities. We are confident that our 2026 outlook provides the cash flow needed to further reduce our debt and invest in the business to meet our strategic objectives. Our full year normalized tax rate was 37.1% in 2025 compared to 40.9% in the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of income and the impact of valuation allowances globally. Now transitioning to our 2026 outlook, I will now provide some context supporting our full year financial guidance related to our engaged segment. We expect a decline in revenue of approximately 4% primarily due to the rationalization of certain clients and lines of businesses that are underperforming to our target profitability and the ongoing initiative of moving and growing our revenue to offshore locations. We expect the year over year revenue declines to be concentrated in the first half of the year while flattening out in the second half of 2026. Engage profitability is forecasted to continue its growth trajectory benefiting from the profit initiatives implemented over the last 18 months. Margin expansion will be further driven by the rationalization of certain client programs and lines of business where we have or will wind down unprofitable revenue. We also continue to prioritize our shift of existing and new business to offshore geographies. Although these actions negatively impact our top line growth in the near term, they are essential to further improve profitability and continue our drive towards historical margins. In our digital segment we are forecasting a revenue decline of 8.4% primarily driven by the decrease in product resale as fewer opportunities remain given the number of clients that we are transitioning to cloud based CX delivery solutions. Although the revenue decline is significant, these lower margin deals have less of an impact on profitability. Recurring revenue is expected to decline due to the managed services related to our traditional CCaaS partners. However, this is more than offset by growth in our digital professional service offerings. We continue to drive scale across our expanded partnership network, delivering on the new market demands where clients want more holistic end to end transformative CX solutions. This growth represents higher margin work and is more impactful to profitability. However, the revenue growth is less pronounced as a higher volume of this work is being delivered offshore. Turning to the midpoint of our 2026 guidance as outlined in greater detail in our fourth quarter and full year 2025 earnings press release GAAP revenue of <money>$2.03 billion</money>, a decrease over the prior year of 5%, adjusted EBITDA of <money>$230 million</money>, an increase of 7.6% over the prior year and 11.3% of revenue compared to 10% in the prior year. Non GAAP operating income of <money>$169 million</money>, an increase of 9% over the prior year and 8.3% of revenue compared to 7.3% in the prior year. Non GAAP earnings per share of <money>$1.19</money>, an increase of 9% over the prior year. Other relevant guidance metrics include capital expenditures between 1.8% and 2% of revenue, of which approximately 60% is growth oriented. A full year effective tax rate between 38 and 42%. We expect the phasing of our profitability to be more weighted in the second half of 2026, with approximately 52% of our revenue coming in the second half of the year based on our historical seasonal trends. Please reference our commentary in the Business Outlook section of the fourth quarter and full year 2025 earnings press release to obtain our expectations for the full year 2026 performance at the consolidated and segment level. In closing, we are pleased with our full year 2025 financial performance, increasing our profitability and expanding our margins across both segments despite an overall modest decline in revenue. We also significantly increased our free cash flow and reduced our borrowings. This was accomplished against the backdrop of an evolving market in both our Engage and Digital segments. We are committed to continuing this performance in 2026 by further increasing our EBITDA and operating income, expanding our margins and reducing our debt. We remain focused on higher value transformational engagements across both segments and have the discipline and confidence to deliver on our 2026 full year outlook. I will now turn the call back to Bob.</p>\n\n<p><strong>OPERATOR</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks Kenny. As we open the call, we ask that you limit your questions to one at a time. Operator, you may open. Thank you, Bob. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press Star and then the number one Please unmute your phone and record your name clearly. When prompted, your name and company name are required to introduce your question. To cancel your request, please press Star and then the number two. Our first question comes from the line of <person>George Sutton</person> from Craig-Hallum. Sir, your line is open.</p>\n\n<p><strong><person>George Sutton</person></strong></p>\n<p>Thank you. Ken, you said something interesting that you thought nearly 100% AI adoption by the enterprises you're working with by year end 2026. And I'm just curious if we could look at sitting here at the beginning of 26 versus the beginning of 27 and what kind of ongoing work do we have with those customers relative to helping them deploy the AI? Good morning, George. Well, first of all, understand that when we make that statement, what we're referring to in general is the AI that we are utilizing to enable our associates to do their job, AI that we're utilizing in our talent acquisition and recruiting, AI that we're using in quality assurance, AI that we're using overall to empower all of our platforms, AI that we're utilizing internally to make ourselves more efficient, et cetera. So ultimately our goal is that every single client of ours is taking advantage of everything from accent neutralization technology to our language translation technology where we can translate in real time from any language to any language, et cetera. Where I think you're probably going just because the term AI is so ambiguous, is AI as we utilize it not just only to assist the associate to be better, faster and more proficient, but also the ability to provide certain aspects of interactions that are self service. And so we are very diligently working with clients that are open to and interested on helping them with their, what we call their low value transactions versus interactions that add no real value in cross selling, upselling, building trust, building loyalty, maintaining retention, increasing wallet share, etc. And automating those with what we call an agent or human in the loop that can come in at any point in time to assist should there be a need to assist, or if it moves to something that's more complex or more higher value, et cetera. And so we're very focused in this area. We've been working with these technologies, as you know, for frankly before AI was there was even a hype cycle on AI. And now it's really just a matter of which clients are actually ready and willing to start to adopt some of the capabilities where we can provide this on the front end from a self service standpoint. Which leads us more to futuristically our goal of outcome based pricing. So we will achieve 100% by year end, which means that at minimum our clients are taking advantage of all of the internal tools that we utilize to make our people better and to make them to drive higher quality, more accuracy, et cetera. Understand. Thank you for the perspective. Thank you, George.</p>\n\n<p><strong><person>Maggie Nolan</person></strong></p>\n<p>Thank you. Our next question will be coming from <person>Maggie Nolan</person>. <person>William Blair</person>, your line is open. Thank you. Maybe to ask that a little bit differently. How do you expect the mix of revenue to shift between project based and reoccurring revenue over the next couple of years?</p>\n\n<p><strong><person>Ken Tuchman</person></strong></p>\n<p>That's a really good question, Maggie. I'm not sure that I actually can give you a number with any level of precision, I guess. Are you asking me, is that another way of saying what percentage of the business will be that we currently classify as digital versus engage or are you asking me, as it relates to the Engage business, what percentage of that business will have a more AI focus? So maybe if you could just give me a little bit more direction on your question. Yeah, the original thought was sort of there's probably likely a mix shift between digital and Engage. But the, the second question is extremely interesting as well. So any and all of the above. Well, look, our focus on digital is for the business to drive, on average, a 50% recurring revenue. And we're currently achieving that, maybe even a bit more than that. And so if that partially answers your question, that is certainly the focus as far as. I just want to make sure that I'm still tracking your question as it relates to Engage and how we see the future of where that business goes. We absolutely see the future over time where more and more technology is infused in Engage and where we are pricing our services as much more of a turnkey offering that is tied to solutions and definitive outcomes. The reality, Maggie, and I don't, as you know, I'm guilty of maybe over pontificating, so I apologize. But the reality is that what we find because of the size of the clients that we deal with, which tend to be in kind of that Fortune 500 category, is that when you get past all the AI hype, that it's going to eventually brush your teeth and do everything else. What our clients are realizing is that with the amount of systems that they have and the overall amount of silos that they have and the amount of systems that are not that don't actually even talk to each other, that there is only certain things that they can take advantage of with AI in order for it to be impactful. What we're doing is we're focusing on what we can provide them with technology that takes advantage of AI right now with their current situation, while we're also trying to demonstrate to them how we can help them build a modern data estate so that they can ultimately take advantage of far more AI. And again, I'm not here to give a lecture or whatever, but what the street is absolutely, positively missing is that the time that it's going to take for these large companies to synergize, so to speak, or create synchronicity of their data, it's not going to be measured in months, it's going to be measured in years. And that's not according to <person>Ken Tuchman</person>, that's According to the CIOs of virtually every major client that we have. So that's my way of saying that we're going to Attack the parts of their systems that we can and that they will allow us to have access to. But the reality is that the Hope that the HAL 9000 is going to take the human out of the loop is, I think, more distant than many people might be estimating. So I'm sorry if I drag that out too much, but hopefully I'm answering your question. Thanks, Ken.</p>\n\n<p><strong><person>George Sutton</person></strong></p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n\n<p><strong><person>Jonathan Lee</person></strong></p>\n<p>Thank you. Our next question will be coming from <person>Jonathan Lee</person> of <org>Guggenheim Partners</org>. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First question for me. You highlighted revenue headwinds from offshore mix shift. Can you help us size how much more of your current onshore revenue might still be at risk from that mix shift dynamic?</p>\n\n<p><strong><person>Ken Tuchman</person></strong></p>\n<p>Well, first of all, we don't view it necessarily as a negative. We view it as a positive. And it's actually a focus of ours and an imperative to work with our clients and work with especially our new clients in shifting to offshore. So currently 80% of our entire sales pipeline is all targeted to net new offshore. As it relates to the embedded base that we currently have that is onshore. I would say that it's actually a fairly limited number, and it's not because we wouldn't like it to be a higher number. But remember, we do a fair amount of public sector and federal work, healthcare work, and financial service work. And a lot of that work requires highly skilled, licensed employees and it is not legal for them to operate outside of <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location>. So what I would say is that it's really giving us other lines of business that we can focus on to move offshore. And there certainly are some clients that we currently have that are considering certain aspects of the business to potentially go offshore. But it's somewhat limited just due to the nature of the segments that are onshore and the regulatory aspect.</p>\n\n<p><strong><person>Jonathan Lee</person></strong></p>\n<p>Ken, thanks for that color. I think we were trying to size the current onshore revenue that might still be at risk. Well, I'm sorry, I thought I answered that. What I'm saying. You mean at risk to go offshore or what? At risk to go offshore? Not necessarily the net new portion of the work that you had highlighted earlier. Yeah, and what I'm saying is that the majority of the revenue that we have onshore, legally, we don't have the ability or the client doesn't have the ability to move offshore under the current regulations which have existed for many, many years. I'm sorry, I thought I answered that. So the answer is I can't give you an exact number, but what I can tell you is that the healthcare clients which Were that's a significant portion of our business and the federal and public sector business. The part that we do that's regulated cannot and will not be moved offshore unless the laws were to change. And my guess is that's not happening. Got it. Thanks, Ken. Just as a follow up, understand that you're obviously investing in AI. Can you help us understand how you're defending against enterprise clients that may be pushing you to pass on the AI efficiency savings to them. Thus far? That's actually not even. That's not so far. We're not actually encountering that. That's not to say that over time as AI more or less commoditizes that we won't feel that. But right now clients are in such need of advisory work on how to take advantage of AI and just our unique ability to integrate to their systems. Because for over 25 years we've done deep systems integration into all of our client CCAS systems, et cetera, that that's just not been a focus. But I think more importantly, maybe another way of putting it is we absolutely plan as we start to demonstrate to clients how we can take low value transactions that typically we don't even handle today. It's not part of our focus of our business and how we can help them automate them and how we can get rid of their IVR and install agentic capabilities on the front end to determine the purpose of the call, to gather information, et cetera. Our goal is absolutely to share some of the upside or the benefit of the cost. And it's frankly I would expect the whole industry to be doing that because it's a way for us to garner net new business by us showing the industry or the client base that we can have an impact on their cost to serve, and that is a huge focus of ours, is how can we demonstrate to them that we can deliver the highest possible quality at a lower cost to serve. And so if you're asking me are they pressuring us for that? No. If you're asking me are we volunteering that as it relates to when we're showing them aspects of areas that are currently not being handled in an AI way and that we believe can and will not diminish the loyalty or the relationship of the customer 100%. And what I want to just stress, and I know I sound like a broken record on this, but it's really important for people to understand this. This industry is still <money>$400 billion</money>. Every single analyst report that's come out, whether technically I'm not supposed to Use the analyst names, but you know who they are, the Gartners and the Forresters and so on and so forth. Every single one of them has said that net human contact center agents over the next 36 months will increase, not decrease. Now, do we think over time they will decrease? We absolutely do. And frankly, we're okay with that. And the reason why we're okay with that is we're a little <money>$2 billion</money> company. And when there's a <money>$400 billion</money> TAM, the AI could have a significant impact on the human aspect of it. And we as a company could still be multiples the size that we are. At the end of the day, there's really only five to eight players in the marketplace that are consistently being considered for the large deals that are out there. And those five to eight players make up well under <money>$50 billion</money>. So when you do the overall math that there's a <money>$400 billion</money> TAM, the reality is we have a long way to go. Because right now where the new business is coming from for the most part is captives that are letting air out of the tires, and they're starting to release business from their captives and captives right now is a <money>$300 billion</money> total addressable market. None of that includes the size of the AI and data analytics market that we're focused on, which we estimate is somewhere in the 500 to <money>600 billion dollars</money> range. So there's so much greenfield opportunity out there that we're embracing AI as absolutely something that's very positive for our business on a go forward basis. Thanks, Ken. Thank you.</p>\n\n<p><strong><person>Vincent Colicchio</person></strong></p>\n<p>Thank you. Our last question is from <person>Vincent Colicchio</person> of <org>Baritone Research</org>. Your line is open.</p>\n\n<p><strong><person>Ken Tuchman</person></strong></p>\n<p>Yeah. Ken, to what extent are you benefiting from consolidation or do you expect to benefit from consolidation given your expanded footprint and the increasing complexity of technology? So do you mean consolidation of clients, consolidating the number of partners that they have? Because if that's that is currently taking place and it's been going on for the last 18 months or 24 months, and we think that's going to, over time, accelerate as clients realize that the concept of having 10 vendors makes very little sense, especially when of the 10 providers out there, most of them do not have deep technological capabilities. And we believe that the majority of all new business out there is going to require somebody that has the ability to provide various different aspects of technology to help them become more modernized. So if the question is, do I think there's going to be more consolidation, I do. And I think that the marketplace is already really bifurcated to what I would call third tier type, second tier type companies out there that can only compete on price and lack capability and the scale players that have the right geographies that clients are looking for, but also have, more importantly, the right technology to apply. You did answer the correct question. And I'm assuming that some of the companies that lack scale can't keep pace in terms of their technology capabilities. And I think you answered that. Is there anything else I can add to that or. No. No, you answered the question. All right. Well, thank you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>OPERATOR</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you for your questions.

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We maintain our 12-month target of <money>$10</money>.

Following a weaker-than-expected Q4 earnings release, we are maintaining a Hold opinion on LCID shares. LCID posted Q4 adjusted EPS of -<money>$3.08</money> vs. -<money>$2.19</money>, well below the -<money>$2.67</money> consensus. Revenue rose 123% to <money>$523M</money> (<money>$60M</money> above consensus), due to  a 72% increase in total vehicle sales to 5,345 units. We continue to have major concerns regarding the company's unsustainable cash burn rate, pointing out that LCID's Q4 EBITDA of negative <money>$875M</money> represented a new record low despite record-high quarterly deliveries of 7,874 vehicles. After the stock's 65% decline in 2025 and considering its high short interest (~33% of the float) and the possibility of its major shareholder providing funding, we recommend remaining on the sidelines. However, our DCF implies negative value and the company's tangible book value was only <money>$2.19</money>/share at year-end 2025.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

The Questa One Agentic Toolkit transforms verification and design from isolated tool interactions into intelligent, domain-scoped multi-step, framework-agnostic workflows powered by agentic AI - autonomous systems operating within the verification domain under customer-defined governance boundaries that can reason, plan and execute complex tasks while maintaining configurable human oversight at critical decision points directly within engineers' existing environments.</p><p>\"Questa One sets a new standard for smart verification and the Questa One Agentic Toolkit builds on those connected and data-driven principles with agentic AI workflows that empower our customers to achieve trusted design and verification closure with AI acceleration – while maintaining the human expertise and judgment that builds quality and trust,\" said Abhi Kolpekwar, senior vice president and general manager, Digital Verification Technologies, <org>Siemens Digital Industries Software</org>. \"We own the engines and we understand verification at the deepest level. It isn't an afterthought or a wrapper; it's the EDA industry's most comprehensive verification solution enhanced with intelligent agentic AI workflows that work the way our customers expect and delivers the results they are demanding.\"</p><p><b>Working with Fuse EDA AI system and beyond<br /></b>The Questa One Agentic Toolkit works seamlessly with the Fuse™ EDA AI system, Siemens' agentic and generative framework for electronic design automation, providing customers who want a fully integrated Siemens experience with optimized performance and deep integration.</p><p>It is Fuse-preferred, with enhanced capabilities when used within the Fuse environment. Recognizing that customer choice is paramount, the framework-agnostic architecture protects existing investments and integrates with other agentic platforms without compromise. Whether teams use existing or emerging frameworks, Questa One agentic workflows adapt to their environment with standardized interfaces that work consistently across platforms.</p><p><b>The Siemens advantage: Engines, integration and openness<br /></b>These intelligent agentic workflows represent a fundamentally different approach than what's emerging from startups and point-solution providers. Siemens uniquely combines verification engine expertise with deep AI integration and customer choice through three differentiating pillars:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li><b>Engine-native intelligence: </b>Siemens creates both the industry-leading Questa One tools and the model context protocols (MCPs) that expose them to agentic frameworks. These workflows, built leveraging NVIDIA Llama Nemotron and NVIDIA NIM, understand verification state in real time and maintain comprehensive awareness and contextual intelligence relationships between designs, testbenches, test plans and specifications. This provides customers with autonomous goal decomposition, adaptive cross-run strategies and persistent expertise building.</li><li><b>Coding application and platform agnostic:</b> The solution works with main-stream AI coding applications - including GitHub Copilot, <person>Claude Code</person>, Cursor, Cline and Siemens' own Fuse - and can be used in CLI mode or IDEs (e.g. VS-Code). While optimized as Fuse-preferred for customers who want a fully integrated experience based on Siemens' toolset, these workflows remain completely agnostic, adapting to customer workflows rather than forcing adaptation.</li><li><b>Scalable, connected, data-driven foundation:</b> By leveraging the connected verification ecosystem that dynamically orchestrates between tools, including Questa One, Tessent™ software for DFT and the Veloce™ CS hardware-assisted verification and validation system, these agentic workflows bring AI-powered capabilities across the entire design and verification landscape.</li></ul><p><b>Intelligent workflows across design and verification<br /></b>The Questa One Agentic Toolkit launches with the following intelligent agents that demonstrate the potential of agentic AI:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>The <b>RTL Code Agent</b> generates synthesizable RTL code from natural language descriptions while simultaneously checking for coding violations and suggesting fixes aligned with industry standards, presenting engineers with clean, high-quality RTL for review.</li><li>The <b>Lint Agent </b>optimally configures lint analysis, reading existing RTL code to check for design errors and coding style violations. Designers then review results and are offered automated AI-powered design fixes or waivers to help to ensure the highest-quality RTL.</li><li>The <b>CDC Agent </b>optimally configures, then runs clock domain crossing verification on a design. Configuration fine-tuning suggestions are made based on results. This empowers designers to achieve the cleanest asynchronous designs after reviewing the results and enabling automated AI-powered design fixes or waivers.</li><li>The <b>Verification Planning Agent </b>analyzes design specifications and automatically generates comprehensive verification plans. Engineers review and approve each step while the AI handles structuring sections, creating detailed feature descriptions and defining scenarios and checking strategies.</li><li>The <b>Debug</b> <b>Agent </b>accelerates root cause analysis by intelligently correlating waveforms, assertions, coverage data and log files. It identifies suspicious signal transitions, suggests potential failure mechanisms and generates targeted debug scenarios for engineer reviews.</li></ul><p>These agents leverage the toolkit's MCPs to work directly with Questa One Verification IQ, Questa One SFV, <person>Questa One Sim</person> and other tools, backed by curated prompt libraries developed by domain experts.</p><p><b>Partner and customer</b><b> experiences with Questa One Agentic AI <br /></b>Early adopters are already seeing significant productivity improvements:</p><p>\"The increasing complexity of modern chip design and verification requires a new generation of intelligent, agentic workflows that can reason through intricate tasks while maintaining the highest levels of precision,\" said <person>Tim Costa</person>, general manager of Industrial and Computational Engineering, NVIDIA. \"By leveraging NVIDIA NIM and Nemotron reasoning models, Siemens is providing engineers with a powerful, AI-driven foundation to accelerate the development of the world's most advanced electronic systems.\"</p><p>\"The productivity gains delivered by the Questa One Agentic Toolkit were both immediate and significant,\" said <person>Akshay Aggarwal</person>, senior director of Engineering, MediaTek. \"Our engineers were able to become proficient within hours, despite limited prior exposure to the tool - completing tasks that typically require days, and mastering workflows that would usually take weeks of training. In combination with MediaTek's existing advanced in-house verification methodology, the Questa One Agentic Toolkit not only bridged the knowledge gap but fundamentally accelerated our operational processes.\"</p><p>\"Combining AI and verification, Questa One enabled our team to quickly adopt full agentic Formal Property Verification, and auto-fix issues with Lint Agent,\" said <person>Shalesh Thusoo</person>, founder and chief executive officer, Tsavorite Scalable Intelligence. \"With the Agentic Toolkit, we leverage these capabilities and their productivity gains at the optimal point in our development flow.\"</p><p><b>Availability<br /></b>The Questa One Agentic Toolkit is available now through an early access program.

            "title": "Omdia: Xiaomi Reclaims Wearable Band Crown for the First Time Since 2020",
            "description": "\n<p>    <location value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >LONDON</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nGlobal wearable device shipments climbed past 200 million units in 2025, growing 6% year on year according to Omdia. Xiaomi has reclaimed the top spot for the first time since 2020, capturing an 18% market share to become the world’s largest wearable vendor by annual shipments. Apple followed closely in second place with 17%, while Huawei secured third with 16%. The market is also seeing increased consolidation, with the top five vendors, including Samsung (9%) and Garmin (5%), with the top three in a tight race.\n\n</p><p id=\"news-body-cta\">This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260227981313/en/</p><p>\n“Wearables are moving from a hardware-driven race to an ecosystem-led competition,” said <org>Omdia Research</org> Manager <person>Cynthia Chen</person>. “With less than one percentage point separating the top three vendors, competitive advantage now depends on seamless cross-device integration and the ability to deliver monetizable, value-added data services.” Xiaomi’s rise reflects a structured multi-category strategy rather than reliance on a single flagship product. Its bands continue to anchor volume in the mass market, while its basic watches, supported by in-house chip development and deeper ecosystem integration, are enabling the brand to move up the value chain. Apple retains a strong premium position, leveraging 5G connectivity and advanced health features, including hypertension monitoring, to sustain high loyalty among its high-value users. Huawei has consolidated its mainstream presence through a broad portfolio, while intensifying its focus on professional sports and medical-grade health applications.\n\n</p><p>\nAI and subscription services are reshaping competition, transforming from nice-to-have features into essential revenue drivers of growth and profitability. Wearable bands are increasingly optimized for continuous health monitoring, with some vendors exploring screenless or reduced-screen designs to improve comfort and data continuity. “The wearables profit model is undergoing structural change,” said <org>Omdia Research</org> Director <person>Jason Low</person>. “Algorithms and services are becoming standalone profit centers, with advanced health insights, professional training plans, and AI-powered coaching generating recurring subscription revenue.” For vendors with a higher-priced portfolio, subscription services represent more than just additional revenue. They are becoming essential to maintaining profitability as hardware margins compress due to rising component costs. This recurring revenue model provides a critical buffer against the volatility of hardware pricing. Meanwhile, improved insights into health and sport tracking are designed to increase usage and stickiness, which, in turn, provides more data points for more tailored services.\n\n</p><p>\nLooking ahead, Omdia expects the global wearables market to deliver modest single-digit growth in 2026, reflecting not only continued expansion in shipment volume but also a gradual shift in industry value dynamics. Growth will increasingly be driven by on-device AI advancements and the rising demand for more professional-grade sports and health management. Meaningful upgrade cycles will rely on real breakthroughs in substantive health monitoring capabilities. For leading smartwatch vendors, such as Apple, Samsung, and Huawei, progress in key physiological metrics, particularly blood glucose and blood pressure monitoring, will become the primary catalyst for renewed growth. Among the three major categories, smartwatches are expected to show the strongest momentum, combining advanced sensing, AI analytics, and deeper ecosystem connectivity to serve as the most scalable platform for AI agent integration. At the same time, improving subscription and service monetization is strengthening profitability and enabling reinvestment in technology and ecosystem development. Over time, competitive advantage will depend less on shipment scale alone and more on the depth of AI capability and the strength of cross-device ecosystem integration.\n\n</p><table cellspacing=\"0\"

            "description": "<p><chron>Feb 27</chron> -  </p>\n<p>Everything <person>Mike Dolan</person> and the ROI team are excited to read, watch and listen to over the weekend.</p>\n<p>From the Editor</p>\n<p>Hello Morning Bid readers! </p>\n<p>Markets were jittery this week, as anxiety about the potential impact of the artificial intelligence revolution left investors nervous about their asset allocations and their future job prospects.</p>\n<p>This week's wave of worry was initially set off by a 7,000-word piece, &quot;The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis,&quot; published by research firm Citrini on Sunday. It made for pretty grim reading: the loss of millions of office jobs will destroy demand, plunging the economy into a deflationary tailspin.</p>\n<p>Is that possible? Sure, in the sense that anything is possible. But when markets are being spooked by apocalyptic long-form blogposts, it's time to ask if we are in the midst of an AI doom bubble.</p>\n<p>The software sector got a slight boost on Tuesday when a new round of plug-ins from Anthropic highlighted the potential for AI upstarts to partner with legacy firms instead of replacing them.</p>\n<p>But, as is often the case, fear trumps hope, and both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq fell on Thursday.</p>\n<p>This was - perhaps surprisingly - after the announcement of another strong quarter from Nvidia - its 14th consecutive revenue beat. The <money>$4.5 trillion</money> chipmaker on Wednesday posted better-than-expected results for the January quarter and also forecast above-market estimates for current quarter revenue. Its share price initially rose, but then pulled back, likely because the good news was already baked in and concerns - such as rising competition and customer concentration - remain.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, two months into the year, the country with the best performing equity market by far is Korea. The benchmark KOSPI index may have slid slightly on Friday, but it's up more than 48% in the year to date. This eye-popping figure might suggest fevered speculation is at play, but that's not necessarily the case - and there is reason to believe it could still have room to run.</p>\n<p>Moving over to M&amp;A, the months-long battle between Paramount Skydance and Netflix to acquire Warner Bros Discovery appears to be over, with the former coming out on top with its revised <money>$31</money>-a-share offer.</p>\n<p>Turning back to anxiety, another major source of it this week was the ongoing standoff between <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location> and <location value=\"LC/ir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Iran</location> over <location value=\"LU/ir..tehran\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Tehran's</location> nuclear program. The two held indirect talks in <location value=\"LU/ch..geneva\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Geneva</location> on Thursday.</p>\n<p>While crude prices fell following claims that progress in the negotiations had been made, Brent crude was up again early on Friday, trading above <money>$71</money> a barrel. Discussions will resume in <location value=\"LU/at..vienna\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Vienna</location> next week, which means the waiting game continues.</p>\n<p>One party that may benefit from the geopolitical noise is OPEC+. The volatile headlines have weighed on prices, giving the producer group cover to stick to its \"balanced market\" narrative, despite many facts on the ground that suggest otherwise. OPEC+ is expected to announce a 137,000 barrel per day increase in output when it meets on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Speaking of energy, one would have needed a lot of it to stay up though all of President <person>Donald Trump's</person> State of the Union address on Tuesday, which clocked in at a record one hour and 47 minutes. It offered little in the way of new ideas for addressing Americans' affordability concerns, with the exception of a plan to boost Americans' retirement savings. The president also vowed to move forward with his tariff agenda even after a large portion of it was quashed by the <org>Supreme Court</org> last week.</p>\n<p>One notable takeaway from the speech was the president's claim that hyperscalers &quot;have the obligation to provide for their own power needs&quot; as they build out energy-hungry data centers to fuel the AI boom. The administration wants to avoid stressing the grid and pushing up consumers' electricity prices.</p>\n<p>But the pressure is already building, and whether or not companies cover their own power needs, ambitious AI expansion plans are likely to be hobbled by severe power-infrastructure bottlenecks.</p>\n<p>It's a reminder that instead of fretting about viral AI doomsday reports, we should probably spend a little more time considering the very real physical limitations that could slow down this technological revolution.</p>\n<p>For more commodities and markets news, check out Reuters Open Interest.
