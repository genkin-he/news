            "description": "<p>(Reuters) -Federal Reserve liquidity facilities caught fire on Friday as month-end pressures pushed a key lending tool to a record level of usage.</p>\n<p>The Fed's Standing Repo Facility lent a total of <money>$50.35 billion</money> on Friday to eligible financial firms in two separate availabilities, the highest-ever usage since the tool was put in place in 2021 to provide fast loans collateralized with Treasury or mortgage bonds. At the same time, financial firms also parked a considerable amount of cash on Fed books, with the reverse repo facility seeing inflows of <money>$51.8 billion</money>.</p>\n<p>The level of volatility in markets was not a surprise as month- and quarter-ends are often buffeted by volatility as firms move cash around for a variety of reasons, with some firms paring lending and related activities. On Friday, a  number of key lending rates shot up well over the 4% top end of the fed funds target rate range.</p>\n<p>\"Ironically, the number of securities given to the Fed about equals the amount of cash received,\" said <person>Scott Skyrm</person>, of money market trading firm <org>Curvature Securities</org>. \"This was the first time the SRF functioned as designed.\"</p>\n<p>Analysts like Wrightson ICAP expect funding pressures to ease next week. And given how calendar dates traditionally influence money markets, SRF and reverse repo activity should ease relatively quickly.</p>\n<p>The unusually heavy use of the Fed liquidity tools comes after the central bank said on Wednesday it would soon stop drawing cash out of markets. The central bank said that the drawdown of its balance sheet, called quantitative tightening, or QT, will end on <chron>December 1</chron>.</p>\n<p>&quot;Our long-stated plan has been to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves are somewhat above the level we judge consistent with ample reserve conditions,&quot; Federal Reserve Chair <person>Jerome Powell</person> said at a press conference following the Federal Open Market Committee gathering. &quot;Signs have clearly emerged that we have reached that standard in money markets,&quot; he added.</p>\n<p>ANXIETY OVER SRF USAGE </p>\n<p>The Fed has shrunk its holdings from a peak of <money>$9 trillion</money> in the summer of 2022 to the current level of <money>$6.6 trillion</money>. It did so by allowing Treasury and mortgage bonds bought as part of COVID-19 pandemic stimulus to mature and not be replaced.</p>\n<p>The Fed's goal was to draw out enough liquidity to allow for firm control of the federal funds rate and normal volatility in short-term lending rates. Markets had expected QT to run into early next year. But a rise in money market rates, most notably an increase in the federal funds rate within its official range, was a signal to central bankers that they'd reached where they wanted to be.</p>\n<p>\"The decision to end asset runoff was one I supported,\" said Dallas Fed President <person>Lorie Logan</person>, who spoke Friday. \"Money market conditions indicate the Fed's balance sheet is now much closer to a normal size, following the expansion in response to economic and financial stresses during the pandemic and the subsequent runoff.\"</p>\n<p>Logan, who managed the implementation of monetary policy before coming to the Dallas Fed, also said that she had some concerns about how the SRF fared over recent days. The tool was meant to be a shock absorber for liquidity that users would turn to when private lending rates were above what the Fed offered. But that has not been happening, and even in periods of high short-term rates, SRF usage has been light.</p>\n<p>Logan said she was \"disappointed\" the SRF has gone largely untapped at times when it should have been an attractive source of funds.</p>\n<p>\"With rates averaging higher than they were just a few months ago, the likelihood of the SRF rate becoming economical on some days is higher,\" Logan said, adding \"dealers may now need to step up their readiness to access the SRF in response to rate moves.\"</p>\n<p>Speaking separately, Cleveland Fed chief Beth Hammack was also downbeat about how the SRF had fared.</p>\n<p>\"It is disappointing when we put tools out there\" that the major banks said they wanted and they don't really get used, Hammack said. When it comes to the future of the SRF and banks, &quot;I'd like to see them take advantage of it to help redistribute reserves throughout the system.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(Reporting by <person>Michael S.

            "description": "\n<p><chron>04:24 PM EDT</chron>, <chron>10/31/2025</chron> (MT Newswires) -- <org>The Toronto Stock Exchange</org> rose for a second-straight day Friday as CIBC's <person>Avery Shenfeld</person> guessed the <org>Bank of Canada</org> may move next week to sound &quot;a bit less definitive about whether they are done or not&quot; with rate cuts, while he also played down fears around rising federal deficits provided the government sees a &quot;credible path&quot; to lowering them ahead.</p><p>The resources-heavy S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index closed up 81.76 points to 30,260.74. Most sectors were higher, led by Health Care up near 3% and Info Tech up 1%. In contrast, Telecom was the biggest decliner, but only down 0.25%.</p><p>While the <org>Bank of Canada</org>, as expected, lowered its key benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.25% on Wednesday, a second-straight monthly cut, the general consensus among most market watchers was that the central bank in commentary around the decision indicated it was now on hold.</p><p>But Shenfeld, Chief Economist at <org>CIBC Capital Markets</org>, believes the planned appearance of BoC Governor, Tiff Macklem, for a 'Fireside Chat' at the The Logic Summit in <location value=\"LU/ca.on.tornto\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Toronto</location> on Monday to talk about the state of <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada's</location> economy may be worth keeping an eye on. The Governor's remarks will not be published, but audio and video webcasts will be available, according to the BoC's website.</p><p>Shenfeld said his guess is that Macklem &quot;might want to try to undo some of the hawkish market reaction to their rate announcement, by sounding a bit less definitive about whether they are done or not&quot;. Even if a steady 2.25% overnight rate is the most likely outcome, the central bank can't be so sure of that when the whole macro outlook is still  this uncertain, he added.</p><p>A day later, Tuesday, the federal government will deliver its long awaited and overdue fiscal budget amid concerns around rising deficits as <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> is stuck in an ongoing trade battle with <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location>, its largest trading partner. Shenfeld said a deficit in the <money>$80 billion</money> to <money>$90 billion</money> range for fiscal 2025-2026 &quot;shouldn't create any major waves in the bond market, provided the budget shows a credible path to lower deficits ahead&quot;.</p><p>Elsewhere, <person>Derek Holt</person>, Head of Capital Markets Economics at Scotiabank, in an early version of his regular 'The Global Week Ahead' column said the federal government might not have to go as high as expected with its deficits.</p><p>Holt said: &quot;The cloak of secrecy over a budget that <location value=\"LU/ca.on.ottawa\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Ottawa</location> initially did not wish to present this year will finally be lifted on Tuesday. A hot mess of numbers, some firm, some fiction, and sloganeering lies in store as <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> seeks to address two challenges: a moribund pre-Trump economy and the new realities that U.S. isolationism present. I admire PM Carney's understanding of the forces at work in the global economy and generally agree, but his chosen policy path may not be the only option and perhaps not the best.&quot;</p><p>Adding to that, Holt cited a &quot;parallel challenge&quot; in that the U.<org>S Supreme Court</org> commences its review of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) tariffs on Wednesday. Holt said: &quot;There are other options for applying tariffs, but eventually striking down use of the IEEPA would be a major blow to the Trump administration and, by corollary, raise the risk of overdoing it on fiscal stimulus in <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location>.&quot;</p><p>Of commodities, gold prices had fallen by late afternoon on Friday even as the dollar rose to a three-month high on a calming in international trade tensions following a one-year trade agreement between <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> and <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location>. Gold for December delivery was last seen down <money>US$6.00</money> to <money>US$4,009.90</money> per ounce.</p><p>But West Texas Intermediate crude oil closed higher ahead of a weekend OPEC+ meeting likely to end with another production hike into an already over-supplied market. WTI crude for December delivery closed up <money>$0.41</money> to settle at <money>$60.98</money> per barrel, while December Brent crude was last seen up <money>$0.04</money> to <money>$65.04</money>.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

While risks to the labor market are tilted to the downside, the FOMC mitigated those risks by cutting rates in September, Logan said.</p><p>&quot;The remaining risks to employment are ones we can monitor closely and respond to if they are becoming more likely to materialize, not ones that currently warrant further preemptive action,&quot; she said.</p><p>Schmid on Friday cited a largely balanced labor market and too-high inflation among reasons behind his voting decision.</p><p>&quot;I do not think a 25-basis point reduction in the policy rate will do much to address stresses in the labor market that more likely than not arise from structural changes in technology and demographics,&quot; Schmid said in a statement. &quot;However, a cut could have longer-lasting effects on inflation if the Fed's commitment to its 2% inflation objective comes into question.&quot;</p><p>Recently appointed Fed Governor <person>Stephen Miran</person> wanted a 50-basis-point cut on Wednesday.</p><p>During post-meeting remarks, Fed Chair <person>Jerome Powell</person> indicated uncertainty around a potential rate cut in December.</p><p>&quot;There were strongly differing views about how to proceed in December,&quot; he said. &quot;A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a forgone conclusion -- far from it.&quot;</p><p>The probability of the FOMC reducing its policy rate by another 25 basis points in December was at 63% on Friday, with the remaining odds in favor of a no-change scenario, according to the CME FedWatch tool.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>Our 12-month target of <money>$142</money>, up <money>$8</money>, reflects a combination of our EV/EBITDA and DCF models. On a relative basis, we apply a 7x multiple of enterprise value to projected 2026 EBITDA. The applied multiple is a slight premium to XOM's historical forward average, but predicated on structural cost improvements that should boost earnings power even with flat pricing. That approach yields a value of <money>$124</money> per share. Our DCF model, using free cash flow growth of 3% for 10 years, 2% thereafter, and discounted at a WACC of 6.7%, shows intrinsic value of <money>$161</money> per share. We lift our 2025 EPS estimate by <money>$0.05</money> to <money>$7.17</money> and 2026's by <money>$0.15</money> to <money>$8.53</money>. XOM continues to offer upstream growth drivers in the Permian and offshore <location value=\"LC/gy\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Guyana</location>, and its Energy Products and Chemicals segments generated sequential improvements. XOM's balance sheet remains a fortress, with net debt to capital under 10%.
