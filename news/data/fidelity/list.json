Together, these improvements bring Intervala’s total footprint to approximately 200,000 square feet.\n\n</p><p>\nIntervala’s enhanced manufacturing environment is purpose-built to support today’s most demanding electronics designs and fully integrated electromechanical systems, including fine-pitch and high-density component placement, highly complex assemblies, rigorous inspection, testing, and traceability, as well as low- to mid-volume production with stringent reliability requirements. These capabilities are increasingly critical as OEMs seek to deliver greater functionality in smaller, denser board footprints without compromising performance or compliance.\n\n</p><p>\nIn mission-critical infrastructure markets, customer partners are seeing the impact of Intervala’s approach firsthand. “Our customers are navigating unprecedented complexity - from AI-driven data center expansion to next-generation defense and medical systems,” said McKernan. “They need a manufacturing partner that can scale with confidence, execute with precision, and engineer for reliability from day one. This investment ensures we’re not just keeping pace with demand - we’re helping our customers gain a competitive edge with systems built to perform when it matters most.”\n\n</p><p>\nCollectively, these enhancements strengthen Intervala’s ability to deliver complex, high-reliability programs at scale. The company combines the advanced technology, scale, and cost advantages typically associated with large contract manufacturers with the flexibility, responsiveness, and partnership more often found in smaller providers, enabling OEMs to move forward with confidence as product complexity increases.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>About Intervala</b>\n\n</p><p>\nIntervala is a full-service electronics manufacturing services (EMS) provider delivering complex electronic and electromechanical products for customers in the aerospace and defense, medical and life sciences, industrial, and data center markets.\n\n</p><p>\nDistinguished by advanced engineering expertise and a customer-first mindset, Intervala provides full-system integration services including printed circuit board assemblies, electromechanical systems, and cable and harness assemblies.\n\n</p><p>\nWith decades of experience and a culture built on quality, agility, and trust, Intervala partners with its customers to design, build, and deliver reliable products for applications where failure is not an option.

            "title": "Arms Cyber Announces Integration with Veeam to Automate the Isolation of Ransomware-Infected Backups",
            "description": "\n<p><location value=\"LU/us.tn.breood\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Brentwood, TN</location>, <chron>Feb.  26, 2026</chron>  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Arms Cyber, the leader in stealth-based ransomware defense, today announced a new technology partnership with Veeam® Software, the <org>Data and AI Trust</org> company. The partnership focuses on a direct technical integration designed to automatically flag and isolate backup restore points containing ransomware threats, significantly reducing recovery times and eliminating the risk of restoring infected data.</p>     <p>   </p>  <p>As ransomware grows more sophisticated, attackers frequently target backup infrastructure or dwell silently in systems for weeks before detonating. This means the most recent backups often contain the dormant malware. When IT teams rush to restore operations, they inadvertently reintroduce the malware to the network, causing a &quot;reinfection loop&quot; that paralyzes recovery efforts.</p>  <p>   </p>  <p>The integration between Arms Cyber and Veeam Data Platform addresses this critical challenge directly. By leveraging the REST API capabilities, Arms Cyber can now act as a high-fidelity sensor for the backup environment.</p>  <p>   </p>  <p>When Arms Cyber detects a ransomware event on a protected workload, it instantly triggers the Veeam Incident  API. This action immediately marks relevant restore points in the Veeam console as compromised, alerting backup administrators and preventing the accidental restoration of infected data.</p>  <p>   </p>  <p>“The old paradigm of security teams handling detection while IT teams handle separate recovery tools is failing customers during real-world crises,” said <person>Bob Kruse</person>, CEO at Arms Cyber. “Our mission is to move beyond simple alerting by taking automated action. By integrating with Veeam, we aren't just telling you that you have ransomware; we are physically interlocking with your backup system to ensure you don't restore the infection. This is what true cyber resilience looks like.”</p>  <p>   </p>  <p>Availability The integration requires Veeam Data Platform v12 or higher and an active Arms Cyber subscription. For more information on deployment, visit https://www.tawk.to/partner-program/.</p>  <p>   </p>  <p>About Arms Cyber Arms Cyber delivers a revolutionary approach to defeat attacks others miss through a three-part strategy: Conceal, Deceive, and Restore — powered by stealth. By adding stealth to an organization's existing security posture, we keep critical data invisible to attackers, detect threats before they cause serious damage, and enable rapid recovery without compromise. The outcome: no ransom payouts, no public breaches, no costly downtime.</p>  <p><br/><br/><br/></p>  Image: https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTY2MDY0NCM3NDUyOTUyIzUwMDEzMDIwMQ==  <br/> Image: https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/NmU4ZGVjNWEtOTU1YS00ZTMwLTlhOWMtNDE0ZmNmOGRkNTQ3LTUwMDEzMDIwMS0yMDI2LTAyLTI2LWVu/tiny/armscyber.png <pre>armscyber\narmscyber\n4084311516\npr@armscyber.com\n</pre>\nSource: armscyber\n",

The bar undoubtedly increases, as NVDA makes the case that compute equals revenue for their customers to justify the higher spend. We do expect sequential growth to slow in 2H (tougher comps) but think this is already discounted in shares, while Physical AI/Sovereign AI offers long term upside.

            "description": "<p><location value=\"LU/ca.qc.montrl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >MONTREAL</location>/<location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >BEIJING</location>/<location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >WASHINGTON</location>, <chron>Feb 26</chron> (Reuters) - Suppliers to U.S. aerospace and semiconductor firms face worsening rare earth shortages, with two turning away some clients, industry insiders said, weeks before U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping for a summit in <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location>.</p>\n<p>The shortages center on rare earths such as yttrium and scandium, niche members of the family of 17 elements, which play tiny but vital roles in defence technology, aerospace and semiconductors and are almost entirely produced in <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>.</p>\n<p>While <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location> has allowed many rare earth exports to resume since it imposed restrictions in April, shipments of these materials still rarely make it to the U.S. despite the October detente with <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location>, Chinese customs data show.</p>\n<p>That easing of trade tensions, premised in part on <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> pausing its critical mineral export restrictions, will be on the table when Trump and Xi meet in <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location> in March.</p>\n<p>A key pain point is yttrium, used in coatings that keep engines and turbines from melting at high temperatures. Without regular application of these coatings, engines cannot be used.</p>\n<p>Since Reuters first reported about yttrium shortages in November, prices have jumped 60% and are now about 69 times as high as a year ago. Some coatings manufacturers are also now starting to ration material, according to company executives and traders.</p>\n<p>Executives at two North American firms that buy yttrium to make coatings told Reuters they have needed to temporarily pause production due to shortages. One is also now turning away smaller and offshore customers in order to conserve supply for larger clients, which include certain engine makers.</p>\n<p>Another firm in the coating supply chain recently ran out of material and stopped selling products containing yttrium oxide, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.</p>\n<p>While shortages of yttrium and scandium have not weighed on production of jet engines or chips yet, a U.S. government official told Reuters some U.S. manufacturers now face &quot;shortages&quot; of certain rare earths from <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> exported 17 tons of yttrium products to the U.S. in the eight months after controls were introduced last April versus 333 tons in the eight months before the measures.</p>\n<p>A <org>White House</org> official said the Trump administration is committed to ensuring access to critical minerals for all U.S. businesses. </p>\n<p>&quot;This includes negotiating with <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> and monitoring compliance with President Trump's agreement with President Xi, as well as developing alternative supply chains as warranted.&quot;</p>\n<p>Reuters spoke with two U.S. government officials, 14 company executives and staff, traders and analysts across aerospace and semiconductors. All of them spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity except the analysts named in the story. The North American executives did not want to be named discussing internal production challenges in public. </p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China's</location> <org>Ministry of Commerce</org> did not respond to questions.</p>\n<p>PRODUCTION PRESSURE </p>\n<p>While low yttrium supplies have not hurt engine production, manufacturers remain concerned, said aerospace supply chain specialist <person>Kevin Michaels</person>.</p>\n<p>&quot;This is a watch item and a tangible example of how <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> is flexing its rare earth muscle,&quot; said Michaels, managing director at U.S. consultant AeroDynamic Advisory. </p>\n<p>Enginemakers are already struggling to meet demand for spare parts from airlines and higher production by planemakers <org value=\"BA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Boeing</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BA )</span> and Airbus.</p>\n<p>U.S. aircraft enginemakers <org>GE Aerospace</org>, RTX's Pratt &amp; Whitney and <org value=\"HON.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Honeywell</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='HON' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( HON )</span> declined comment.</p>\n<p>SCARCE SCANDIUM</p>\n<p>In addition to yttrium, U.S. semiconductor makers are running low on scandium, putting production of next-generation 5G chips at risk, said <person>Dylan Patel</person>, founder and CEO of research firm SemiAnalysis. </p>\n<p>With global production of only several tens of tons a year, scandium plays small but important parts in fuel cells, specialty aluminium aerospace alloys and advanced chip processing and packaging.</p>\n<p>Major U.S. semiconductor manufacturers all rely on scandium for making chip components that &quot;go into essentially every 5G smartphone and base station&quot;, Patel said.</p>\n<p>U.S. chipmakers have experienced delays in receiving new scandium export licenses from <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> in recent months and have reached out to <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location> for help, said two industry sources. </p>\n<p>Many of these firms had obtained scandium from third-country suppliers, another U.S. official said, but <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> requires license applicants to declare their end-users.</p>\n<p>&quot;Our thesis is that it is precisely the semi industry being targeted,&quot; the U.S. official said.</p>\n<p><org>The U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association</org> declined to comment.</p>\n<p>&quot;The U.S. currently has zero domestic scandium production and no operational alternative sources outside <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>,&quot; Patel said, adding that stockpiles are likely in months rather than years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p> (Reporting by <person>Allison Lampert</person> in <location value=\"LU/ca.qc.montrl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Montreal</location>; <person>Laurie Chen</person> and <person>Lewis Jackson</person> in <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location>; <person>Michael Martina</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location>; Additional reporting by <person>Fanny Potkin</person> in <location value=\"LC/sg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Singapore</location>, <person>Ernest Scheyder</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.tx.houstn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Houston</location> and <person>Melanie Burton</person> in <location value=\"LU/au..melbou\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Melbourne</location>; Editing by <person>Sonali Paul</person>)</p>\n",

By <chron>February 2025</chron>,\n<location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> government had tightened controls on foreign\nproperty purchases.</p>\n<p>The housing scare fed into the broader push to give\nauthorities tools to vet who is behind incoming capital.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>FOREIGN INVESTMENT BILL SUBMITTED IN OCTOBER</p>\n<p>A foreign investment screening bill, long in the works and\nformally submitted to parliament in October, was initially\nconceived partly as a safeguard against any unwanted Chinese\ninvestment. But three of the sources said the focus had shifted\nfollowing Trump's revived <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> ambitions.</p>\n<p>&quot;We are very interested in working with American investors,\nbut not in a way where they try to push certain political\ngoals,&quot; said MP Aqqalu Jerimiassen from the Atassut party, part\nof <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> governing coalition.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> has long sought to diversify its economy,\nprimarily by courting investments in its mining sector. However,\nlimited infrastructure, including a lack of roads connecting the\nregion's 72 towns, extreme climatic conditions, and labour\nshortages, have hampered progress in attracting meaningful\nforeign capital.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/dk\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Denmark</location> has allocated extra money for infrastructure and\nother development initiatives, and the EU has proposed more than\ndoubling its funding. Still, <location>the Arctic</location> nation's economy remains\nstagnant, with growth at just 0.2% in 2025 and a significant\ndeficit in public finances.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>SOME SECTORS WILL NEED MANDATORY SCREENING</p>\n<p>First debated in November, the screening bill is set for\nfurther discussion in April and is expected to be passed that\nmonth. The draft requires foreign investors to disclose the\norigin of their funds and enables authorities to reject deals if\nthe political affiliations or intentions of the investors raise\nconcerns.</p>\n<p>&quot;If someone is working for Trump, we will find out with this\nscreening law. This is about our own security,&quot; Jerimiassen\nadded.</p>\n<p>The proposed bill does not single out specific countries but\nurges cooperation with allies, indicating that American and\nEuropean investors may face less scrutiny compared to Chinese\ncounterparts. However, it grants <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> the authority to\nreview foreign investments considered a threat to security.</p>\n<p>&quot;The purpose of the law is to prevent foreign investments\nfrom posing a threat to <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> security or public order,&quot;\nthe legislation states.

Using Vaxxas' needle-free delivery technology, the three-party consortium will develop a seasonal influenza vaccine for older adults and pandemic influenza vaccine for broader populations.</p>\n    <div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1\">\n                <p>\n\n                    <img src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1979527/SK_bioscience_Logo.jpg\" title=\"SK bioscience (PRNewsfoto/SK bioscience)\" alt=\"SK bioscience (PRNewsfoto/SK bioscience)\" />\n\n                </p>\n    </div>\n<p>This contract is one of three EU-funded framework contracts, valued at up to a total of €225M and aimed at strengthening next-generation vaccine commercialization and supply capabilities within <location value=\"LR/eur\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Europe</location>. HaDEA will provide up to €12.9 million to support Phase 1 research, including a Phase 1 clinical trial. Subject to successful technical validation and clinical outcomes, the Consortium could tender to progress through subsequent phases of the program to support Phase 3 and final-stage development.</p><p>The contract is particularly meaningful as it represents the first major global public funding secured following SK bioscience's acquisition of IDT, and continues the company's close collaboration with high-density microarray patch (HD-MAP) pioneer Vaxxas. It also establishes a pathway for entry into the highly regulated European market by combining influenza vaccine development capabilities with Vaxxas' HD-MAP technology.</p><p>Within the consortium, IDT serves as the European legal contracting entity and overall project lead, overseeing project management and coordination with European authorities. Upon commercialization, IDT is expected to function as a key manufacturing hub in <location value=\"LR/eur\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Europe</location>, including responsibility for drug substance production.</p><p>SK bioscience, leveraging its proprietary cell culture technology, will supply drug substance for both its licensed influenza vaccine, SKYCellflu, and a pandemic influenza vaccine currently under development. SK bioscience will also collaborate with Vaxxas for the clinical development, with Vaxxas manufacturing HD-MAP vaccines.</p><p>The patch-based influenza vaccines are designed to achieve a comparable immunogenicity response with lower antigen doses than traditional delivery platforms. With a short application time and room-temperature stability, they are expected to significantly enhance ease of administration and increase vaccine access critical to a public health vaccination response. According to modelling by <org>Avalere Health</org> on a US scenario, the potential impact of microarray patch (MAP) vaccines in a pandemic could be at least 35% fewer cases, and at least 30% fewer deaths by enabling a broader and faster response. Additionally, MAP vaccines could reduce US economic losses by at least <money>$200 billion</money> and global economic losses by at least <money>$921 billion</money> over two years.</p><p>Through this project, SK bioscience, IDT, and Vaxxas intend to actively target the premium European seasonal influenza vaccine market for older adults, while boosting their capabilities to support the region's preparedness to respond to potential public health crises.</p><p>Upon successful development, SK bioscience with its Consortium partners plan to pursue entry into major advanced markets, including <location value=\"LR/eur\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Europe's</location> Northern Hemisphere market, and explore additional business opportunities through exports to key markets such as Korea and <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location>, depending on global clinical outcomes.</p><p>According to global market research firm Datamonitor, the seasonal influenza vaccine market targeting older adults is estimated at approximately <money>USD 459 million</money>. As immune responses decline with age, this segment shows strong demand for premium products such as high-dose and adjuvanted vaccines, making differentiated formulations and technologies a direct determinant of market competitiveness.</p><p>\"With more than 100 years of experience in vaccine development and manufacturing, IDT Biologika has continuously evolved to meet the changing needs of patients and partners worldwide,\" said Dr. <person>Sally Choe</person>, Co-CEO of IDT Biologika. \"Our global customer focus drives us to not only ensure reliable, high-quality production, but also to actively shape innovative delivery solutions that can expand access and improve acceptance across broader populations. By working with SK bioscience and Vaxxas to advance needle-free patch technology for influenza vaccines, we are helping to develop new vaccination approaches designed to better protect people around the world against seasonal and pandemic influenza.\"</p><p>\"The successful tender reflects a shared ambition across the Consortium and the <org>European Commission</org> to invest in alternative vaccine delivery technologies that simplify vaccination and enhance preparedness,\" said Vaxxas CEO Mr. <person>David Peacock</person>. \"This tender positions Vaxxas and its Consortium partners at the forefront of global vaccination innovation. We are proud to see our technology recognised by governments worldwide as a critical component of future public health preparedness.\"</p><p><person>Jaeyong Ahn</person>, President and CEO of SK bioscience, said \"This project marks the first tangible business outcome following the acquisition of IDT, demonstrating how our combined global network and technological capabilities translate into performance.

Industry estimates suggest the U.S. above-ground storage tank inspection services market represents several hundred million dollars in annual spend, with long-term growth supported by mandatory inspection cycles across the energy, chemical, and industrial sectors.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Scalable, Technology-Enabled Inspection Model</b>\n\n</p><p>\nUnder the strategic collaboration, Aero Velocity will deploy its drone and robotics suite to capture high-resolution internal and external inspection-grade imagery, targeted robotic/UAV datasets where appropriate and photogrammetry/LiDAR-driven 3D digital twins to support HMT’s inspection operations. HMT will continue to lead inspection engineering, interpretation, reporting and certification, leveraging Aero Velocity’s datasets to enhance consistency and documentation.\n\n</p><p>\nThe agreement is expected to advance the tank inspection industry by providing the following benefits:\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\nLower costs – inspections may be performed faster, resulting in reduced out-of-service time;\n\n</li>\n<li>\nHigher quality – data collection designed to deliver repeatable, inspection-ready digital output; and\n\n</li>\n<li>\nEnhanced safety – use of drones to reduce the need for confined space entry by humans.\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\n“Industrial inspection is entering a new era in which safety and data quality are rising, while costs and business disruptions are falling,” said <person>Mark Hastings</person>, Chief Executive Officer of Aero Velocity. “The U.S. above-ground tank inspection market is large, highly regulated and recurring by nature. We built our industrial solutions business to capture inspection-grade data quickly and repeatably at scale. Combined with HMT’s industry leadership, this collaboration modernizes how tanks and other critical assets are documented—improving safety and lowering costs while giving operators better information to plan maintenance and manage risk.”\n\n</p><p>\n“Asset owners are increasingly demanding inspection programs that reduce downtime, while improving data quality and safety,” commented <person>Veronique Trudeau</person>, Chief Executive Officer of HMT. “Working with Aero Velocity strengthens our ability to deliver exceptional results to our customers in the form of high-quality, consistent datasets at scale, while offering safer execution, reduced costs and more efficient inspection planning.”\n\n</p><p>\nAero Velocity’s industrial solutions business combines UAV and robotic data capture with structured, inspection-ready deliverables designed to integrate into existing integrity management programs. Typical deliverables may include:\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\nHigh-resolution photo documentation sets with consistent labeling and coverage by asset zones;\n\n</li>\n<li>\nLiDAR/Photogrammetry-based 3D digital twins for navigation, measurement and visual review;\n\n</li>\n<li>\nTagged points of interest (e.g., corrosion indicators, coating breakdown, deformation, anomalies) to support inspection follow-up;\n\n</li>\n<li>\nSecure data packaging and transfer aligned with client documentation requirements; and\n\n</li>\n<li>\nRepeatable capture templates designed to support trend analysis over time.\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\nAero Velocity and HMT have already begun working together to provide cost-effective, safe inspections, data capture, and analysis to HMT’s industrial clients in the energy sector. The two companies plan to jointly market their services to existing and new customers through established sales channels and joint participation in industry conferences and trade expos throughout the year.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Strategic Growth Implications</b>\n\n</p><p>\nThe collaboration aligns with Aero Velocity’s broader industrial growth strategy focused on expanding recurring inspection services revenue, leveraging technology to improve margin profile and scalability, deepening penetration within energy and infrastructure verticals and building long-term strategic relationships with industry leaders.\n\n</p><p>\nMr. Hastings added, “We are excited about the opportunity to team with the clear industry leader in HMT. We expect this collaboration to be a cornerstone of our revenue growth in 2026 and beyond.”\n\n</p><p>\n<b>About Aero Velocity</b>\n\n</p><p>\nAero Velocity, based in <location value=\"LU/us.oh.cincin\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Cincinnati, OH</location>, designs and manufactures American-made, NDAA-compliant UAVs and operates a robust Drones-as-a-Service (DaaS) business.
