At a <location value=\"LU/us.tx.dallas\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Dallas</location> location, a sign warns customers: &quot;The US Treasury has stopped making pennies and we may experience shortages.&quot;</p>\n<p>Kroger, one of the largest U.S. grocery chains, told Reuters it is still assessing the impact of the penny shortage. Many of its 2,700 locations have displayed signs asking customers for exact change.</p>\n<p>Individual stores with other large chains have done the same, such as a CVS in <location value=\"LU/us.va.alxdra\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Alexandria, Virginia</location>, that posted a notice asking for exact change because of a &quot;penny shortage.&quot;</p>\n<p>Treasury did not respond to multiple requests for comment. </p>\n<p>Several countries, including <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location>, <location value=\"LC/au\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Australia</location>, <location value=\"LC/ie\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Ireland</location> and <location value=\"LC/nz\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >New Zealand</location>, have phased out their lowest-value coins, rounding cash transactions up or down to the nearest <money>five cents</money> while keeping electronic payments exact. The moves cut minting costs and simplified cash handling for retailers. </p>\n<p>In the U.S., phasing out pennies would require similar rounding practices at stores, adjustments to registers, and clear communication to consumers, but could deliver comparable savings and efficiency gains. </p>\n<p>Several states, including <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location>, <location value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >New York</location> and <location value=\"LS/us.il\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Illinois</location>, however, have consumer protection laws that require retailers to provide exact change on cash transactions, creating legal uncertainty as pennies disappear from circulation. Retail groups say those rules make it difficult to adjust prices or round totals without risking fines or customer complaints.</p>\n<p>LOOKING FOR CONSISTENT RULES</p>\n<p>While Trump's directive initiated the end to production, <org>Congress</org> retains authority over coinage, meaning legislation may still be required for a permanent discontinuation. The NRF has been lobbying the Trump administration and <org>Congress</org> to provide consistent guidance, particularly around rounding transactions.</p>\n<p>\"What's most helpful in the near term is clarity on rounding practices - whether retailers can round up or down on transaction totals or change,\" Jeon said. </p>\n<p>A group of trade organizations that include gas stations, convenience stores, travel centers and grocery stores warned in a <chron>September 30</chron> letter to congressional leaders that &quot;if these remedies are not addressed in short order, it will be challenging to legally engage in cash transactions with customers in growing swaths of the country.&quot; </p>\n<p>Love's Travel Stops, which operates more than 640 locations in 42 states, said the phaseout of penny production is affecting its retail operations. </p>\n<p>\"If one of our stores runs out of pennies, all change on cash transactions will be adjusted in the favor of the customer and Love's will cover the difference,\" a company spokesperson said. \"This is a temporary measure while we work toward a long-term solution.&quot;</p>\n<p>Months after Trump ordered a halt to production of pennies, the <org>Treasury Department</org> in May placed its final order for blank penny planchets. Several <org>Federal Reserve Bank</org> sites, which distribute coins to banks and credit unions, have already stopped fulfilling orders for pennies. </p>\n<p>Producing a penny currently costs more than its face value - about <money>3.69 cents</money> per coin in recent years. The government now projects savings of roughly <money>$56 million</money> annually by ending penny minting.</p>\n<p>There are about 114 billion pennies currently in circulation in <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location>, but they are greatly underutilized, the Treasury says. The penny was one of the first coins made by the U.S. Mint after its establishment in 1792.</p>\n<p>Supporters of the penny argue it helps keep consumer prices down and is a source of income to charities. For its critics, the coin is a nuisance that ends up being discarded in drawers, ashtrays and piggy banks.</p>\n<p>&quot;I can't even tell you the last time I carried pennies - even loose change - when I left the house,&quot; said <location value=\"LS/us.pa\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Pennsylvania</location> resident <person>Sandy Berger</person>, 45. &quot;I really don't think people will care to see them gone.&quot;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p> (Reporting By <person>Jarrett Renshaw</person>; Editing by Sergio Non and <person>Diane Craft</person>)</p>\n",

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We trim our 12-month target  by <money>$7</money> to <money>$33</money>, applying an EV/EBITDA multiple of 5.7x to our 2026 estimate, a discount to its three-year historical average multiple at 6.5x.

The company cited several near-term headwinds, including the negative EBITDA impact from broadband repositioning, the onboarding of new NBA sports rights (introduces upfront dilution), and the spin-off of VERSANT, which will affect both EBITDA and free cash flow in the short term. The broadband environment remains intensely competitive, and this is not expected to change soon. Business Services also faces elevated competition, particularly from fixed wireless alternatives, affecting growth and requiring ongoing investment. Finally, the shift toward simplified, transparent pricing and increased promotional activity (including free wireless lines) is causing revenue dilution.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

            "description": "<p>(Reuters) -Federal Reserve liquidity facilities caught fire on Friday as month-end pressures pushed a key lending tool to a record level of usage.</p>\n<p>The Fed's Standing Repo Facility lent a total of <money>$50.35 billion</money> on Friday to eligible financial firms in two separate availabilities, the highest-ever usage since the tool was put in place in 2021 to provide fast loans collateralized with Treasury or mortgage bonds. At the same time, financial firms also parked a considerable amount of cash on Fed books, with the reverse repo facility seeing inflows of <money>$51.8 billion</money>.</p>\n<p>The level of volatility in markets was not a surprise as month- and quarter-ends are often buffeted by volatility as firms move cash around for a variety of reasons, with some firms paring lending and related activities. On Friday, a  number of key lending rates shot up well over the 4% top end of the fed funds target rate range.</p>\n<p>\"Ironically, the number of securities given to the Fed about equals the amount of cash received,\" said <person>Scott Skyrm</person>, of money market trading firm <org>Curvature Securities</org>. \"This was the first time the SRF functioned as designed.\"</p>\n<p>Analysts like Wrightson ICAP expect funding pressures to ease next week. And given how calendar dates traditionally influence money markets, SRF and reverse repo activity should ease relatively quickly.</p>\n<p>The unusually heavy use of the Fed liquidity tools comes after the central bank said on Wednesday it would soon stop drawing cash out of markets. The central bank said that the drawdown of its balance sheet, called quantitative tightening, or QT, will end on <chron>December 1</chron>.</p>\n<p>&quot;Our long-stated plan has been to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves are somewhat above the level we judge consistent with ample reserve conditions,&quot; Federal Reserve Chair <person>Jerome Powell</person> said at a press conference following the Federal Open Market Committee gathering. &quot;Signs have clearly emerged that we have reached that standard in money markets,&quot; he added.</p>\n<p>ANXIETY OVER SRF USAGE </p>\n<p>The Fed has shrunk its holdings from a peak of <money>$9 trillion</money> in the summer of 2022 to the current level of <money>$6.6 trillion</money>. It did so by allowing Treasury and mortgage bonds bought as part of COVID-19 pandemic stimulus to mature and not be replaced.</p>\n<p>The Fed's goal was to draw out enough liquidity to allow for firm control of the federal funds rate and normal volatility in short-term lending rates. Markets had expected QT to run into early next year. But a rise in money market rates, most notably an increase in the federal funds rate within its official range, was a signal to central bankers that they'd reached where they wanted to be.</p>\n<p>\"The decision to end asset runoff was one I supported,\" said Dallas Fed President <person>Lorie Logan</person>, who spoke Friday. \"Money market conditions indicate the Fed's balance sheet is now much closer to a normal size, following the expansion in response to economic and financial stresses during the pandemic and the subsequent runoff.\"</p>\n<p>Logan, who managed the implementation of monetary policy before coming to the Dallas Fed, also said that she had some concerns about how the SRF fared over recent days. The tool was meant to be a shock absorber for liquidity that users would turn to when private lending rates were above what the Fed offered. But that has not been happening, and even in periods of high short-term rates, SRF usage has been light.</p>\n<p>Logan said she was \"disappointed\" the SRF has gone largely untapped at times when it should have been an attractive source of funds.</p>\n<p>\"With rates averaging higher than they were just a few months ago, the likelihood of the SRF rate becoming economical on some days is higher,\" Logan said, adding \"dealers may now need to step up their readiness to access the SRF in response to rate moves.\"</p>\n<p>Speaking separately, Cleveland Fed chief Beth Hammack was also downbeat about how the SRF had fared.</p>\n<p>\"It is disappointing when we put tools out there\" that the major banks said they wanted and they don't really get used, Hammack said. When it comes to the future of the SRF and banks, &quot;I'd like to see them take advantage of it to help redistribute reserves throughout the system.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(Reporting by <person>Michael S.
