Without regular application of these coatings, engines cannot be used.</p>\n<p>Since Reuters first reported about yttrium shortages in November, prices have jumped 60% and are now about 69 times as high as a year ago. Some coatings manufacturers are also now starting to ration material, according to company executives and traders.</p>\n<p>Executives at two North American firms that buy yttrium to make coatings told Reuters they have needed to temporarily pause production due to shortages. One is also now turning away smaller and offshore customers in order to conserve supply for larger clients, which include certain engine makers.</p>\n<p>Another firm in the coating supply chain recently ran out of material and stopped selling products containing yttrium oxide, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.</p>\n<p>While shortages of yttrium and scandium have not weighed on production of jet engines or chips yet, a U.S. government official told Reuters some U.S. manufacturers now face &quot;shortages&quot; of certain rare earths from <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> exported 17 tons of yttrium products to the U.S. in the eight months after controls were introduced last April versus 333 tons in the eight months before the measures.</p>\n<p>A <org>White House</org> official said the Trump administration is committed to ensuring access to critical minerals for all U.S. businesses. </p>\n<p>&quot;This includes negotiating with <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> and monitoring compliance with President Trump's agreement with President Xi, as well as developing alternative supply chains as warranted.&quot;</p>\n<p>Reuters spoke with two U.S. government officials, 14 company executives and staff, traders and analysts across aerospace and semiconductors. All of them spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity except the analysts named in the story. The North American executives did not want to be named discussing internal production challenges in public. </p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China's</location> <org>Ministry of Commerce</org> did not respond to questions.</p>\n<p>PRODUCTION PRESSURE </p>\n<p>While low yttrium supplies have not hurt engine production, manufacturers remain concerned, said aerospace supply chain specialist <person>Kevin Michaels</person>.</p>\n<p>&quot;This is a watch item and a tangible example of how <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> is flexing its rare earth muscle,&quot; said Michaels, managing director at U.S. consultant AeroDynamic Advisory. </p>\n<p>Enginemakers are already struggling to meet demand for spare parts from airlines and higher production by planemakers <org value=\"BA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Boeing</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BA )</span> and Airbus.</p>\n<p>U.S. aircraft enginemakers <org>GE Aerospace</org>, RTX's Pratt &amp; Whitney and <org value=\"HON.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Honeywell</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='HON' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( HON )</span> declined comment.</p>\n<p>SCARCE SCANDIUM</p>\n<p>In addition to yttrium, U.S. semiconductor makers are running low on scandium, putting production of next-generation 5G chips at risk, said <person>Dylan Patel</person>, founder and CEO of research firm SemiAnalysis. </p>\n<p>With global production of only several tens of tons a year, scandium plays small but important parts in fuel cells, specialty aluminium aerospace alloys and advanced chip processing and packaging.</p>\n<p>Major U.S. semiconductor manufacturers all rely on scandium for making chip components that &quot;go into essentially every 5G smartphone and base station&quot;, Patel said.</p>\n<p>U.S. chipmakers have experienced delays in receiving new scandium export licenses from <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> in recent months and have reached out to <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location> for help, said two industry sources. </p>\n<p>Many of these firms had obtained scandium from third-country suppliers, another U.S. official said, but <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> requires license applicants to declare their end-users.</p>\n<p>&quot;Our thesis is that it is precisely the semi industry being targeted,&quot; the U.S. official said.</p>\n<p><org>The U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association</org> declined to comment.</p>\n<p>&quot;The U.S. currently has zero domestic scandium production and no operational alternative sources outside <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>,&quot; Patel said, adding that stockpiles are likely in months rather than years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p> (Reporting by <person>Allison Lampert</person> in <location value=\"LU/ca.qc.montrl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Montreal</location>; <person>Laurie Chen</person> and <person>Lewis Jackson</person> in <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location>; <person>Michael Martina</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location>; Additional reporting by <person>Fanny Potkin</person> in <location value=\"LC/sg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Singapore</location>, <person>Ernest Scheyder</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.tx.houstn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Houston</location> and <person>Melanie Burton</person> in <location value=\"LU/au..melbou\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Melbourne</location>; Editing by <person>Sonali Paul</person>)</p>\n",

Our backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to realize from existing agreements with our customers for the sale of our battery energy storage systems and performance of services. The backlog is calculated by adding new orders in the current fiscal period to the backlog as of the end of the prior fiscal period and then subtracting the shipments in the current fiscal period. If the amount of an order is modified or cancelled, we adjust orders in the current period and our backlog accordingly, but do not retroactively adjust previously published backlogs. There is no comparable US-GAAP financial measure to backlog. We believe that the backlog is a useful indicator regarding the future revenue of our Company.</p>    <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Pipeline</strong>. Our pipeline represents projects for which we have submitted technical proposals or non-binding quotes plus letters of intent (“LOI”) or firm commitments from customers. Pipeline does not include lead generation projects.</p>    <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Booked Orders</strong>. Booked orders are orders where we have legally binding agreements with a Purchase Order (“PO”), or Master Supply Agreement (“MSA”) executed by both parties.</p>    <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</strong></p>    <p align=\"justify\">To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed in this earnings release non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit (loss), and adjusted EPS, which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the <org>SEC</org>. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures of the Company’s calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company believes adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit (loss), and adjusted EPS are useful measures in evaluating its financial and operational performance distinct and apart from financing costs, certain non-cash expenses and non-operational expenses.</p>    <p align=\"justify\">We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively may be helpful to our investors in assessing its operating performance. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures and their nearest GAAP equivalents. For example, the Company’s definitions of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Below is a description of the non-GAAP financial information included herein as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. You should review the reconciliations below but not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.</p>    <p align=\"justify\">Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (net loss) attributable to Eos adjusted for interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of debt and derivatives, debt extinguishment, and other non-cash or non-recurring items as determined by management which it does not believe to be indicative of its underlying business trends. Adjusted gross profit (loss) is defined as gross profit (loss) adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EPS is defined as GAAP net loss per common share as adjusted for non-cash stock-based compensation expense change in fair value of debt and derivatives and debt extinguishment per common share.</p>  <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. We present non-GAAP financial measures in order to assist readers of our financial statements in understanding the core operating results that our management uses to evaluate the business and for financial planning purposes. Our non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our financial performance over multiple periods.\n\n</p><p>\nThe non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are key performance measures that our management uses to assess our operating performance. These non-GAAP measures facilitate internal comparisons of our operating performance on a more consistent basis. We use these performance measures for business planning purposes and forecasting. We believe that these non-GAAP measures enhance an investor’s understanding of our financial performance as they are useful in assessing our operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business.\n\n</p><p>\nThe non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate these measures in the same manner. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. When evaluating the Company’s performance, you should consider adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS alongside other financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, including gross profit or loss, gross margin, net loss, and EPS.\n\n</p><p>\nThe non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. In this press release, we have provided reconciliations of adjusted gross profit to gross profit or loss, adjusted gross margin to gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to corresponding GAAP measures are not available on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the non-cash component of employee compensation expense, changes in our working capital needs, variances in our supply chain, the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be reflective, on a recurring basis, of our ongoing operations, and other such items without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to our results computed in accordance with GAAP. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Forward Looking Statements</b>\n\n</p><p>\nThis press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our actual results may differ from our expectations, estimates, and projections and, consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believe,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” and similar expressions (or the negative versions of such words or expressions) are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, our expectations with respect to financial results, revenue growth, future performance of our ultrasound business and Embedded opportunities (inclusive of co-development, revenue share/commercialization revenue, chip purchases, and/or chip licensing opportunities through the Embedded program), commercialization and plans to deploy our products and services, including expectations regarding the launches of our Compass AI software, our P5 and Apollo chips and fourth-generation technology, finalizing our first commercial HomeCare agreement, development of products and services, and the size and potential growth of current or future markets for our products and services. Forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to us. These forward-looking statements involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Most of these factors are outside our control and are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: our ability to grow and manage growth effectively; the success, cost, and timing of our product and service development activities; the potential attributes and benefits of our products and services; the degree to which our products and services are accepted by healthcare practitioners and patients for their approved uses; our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products, as applicable, and any related restrictions and limitations on the use of any authorized product; our ability to identify, in-license, or acquire additional technology; our ability to maintain our existing license, manufacturing, supply, and distribution agreements; the success, cost, and timing of our efforts to out-license our intellectual property to third parties; our ability to compete with other companies currently marketing or engaged in the development of ultrasound imaging devices, many of which have greater financial and marketing resources than us; changes in applicable laws or regulations; the size and growth potential of the markets for our products and services, and our ability to serve those markets, either alone or in partnership with others; the pricing of our products and services, and reimbursement for medical procedures conducted using our products and services; our estimates regarding expenses, revenue, capital requirements, and needs for additional financing; our financial performance; our ability to attract and retain customers; our ability to manage our growth effectively; our ability to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights; our ability to maintain the listing of our Class A common stock on the <org>New York Stock Exchange</org>; and other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or in subsequent filings that we make with the <org>Securities and Exchange Commission</org>. We caution that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. We caution you not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertake to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n\n</p><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl bwwidth100\">\n<tr>\n<td class=\"bwpadl0\"

The program honors organizations and technologies that demonstrate excellence, innovation and measurable market impact.\n\n</p><p>\nThe dual Gold recognition highlights Ooma AirDial’s role in helping organizations modernize fire, life-safety, elevator, and other mission-critical communications as telecommunications carriers continue to retire legacy copper networks nationwide.\n\n</p><p>\n“Critical communications infrastructure is undergoing a major transition as copper lines are phased out,” said <person>Jim Gustke</person>, senior vice president of marketing at Ooma. “These awards continue to validate Ooma AirDial’s ability to help organizations maintain reliability, visibility and compliance while transitioning to a more modern, resilient communications architecture.”\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Addressing a Growing Infrastructure Challenge</b>\n\n</p><p>\nOrganizations across commercial real estate, healthcare, education, government and other sectors continue to rely on analog devices originally designed for traditional Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) lines. As carriers accelerate copper retirement and support resources decline, many enterprises are facing increased risk, rising costs and reduced visibility into critical systems.\n\n</p><p>\nOoma AirDial was designed to help organizations transition away from legacy copper infrastructure without requiring replacement of existing endpoint devices, enabling a more controlled and predictable modernization path.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Award-Winning Innovation</b>\n\n</p><p>\nThe Merit Awards judges recognized Ooma AirDial for its combination of cloud-based management, real-time operational visibility, compliance-based architecture, and resilient connectivity architecture.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Key capabilities include:</b>\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\n<b>Remote Device Management</b> which provides centralized visibility into device status, connectivity and call activity across locations.\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Automated alerts</b> that notify teams of emergency calls and power events.\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Patented MultiPath™ technology</b> that simultaneously routes traffic over LTE and wired Ethernet.\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Support for life-safety compliance requirements</b> including NFPA 72 and ASME A17.1 environments.\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\nTogether, these capabilities help shift critical communications management from reactive troubleshooting to proactive monitoring and control.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Building on Industry Recognition</b>\n\n</p><p>\nThe Merit Awards add to a growing list of industry recognition for Ooma AirDial, now recognized as one of the most awarded POTS replacement solutions in the industry. In recent years, the solution has earned recognition from organizations including TMC, Channel Vision, UC Today, <org>Elevator World</org> and FacilitiesNet, reflecting continued market validation across communications and facilities management sectors.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Supporting the Ongoing Copper Transition</b>\n\n</p><p>\nWith copper network retirement accelerating across <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location>, many organizations are now reassessing how legacy voice lines support life-safety and operational systems. Solutions that provide centralized oversight, redundancy and predictable deployment models are becoming increasingly important for multi-site enterprises and public-sector environments.\n\n</p><p>\n“Ooma AirDial was built specifically to help organizations navigate this transition with confidence,” Gustke added. “As the copper sunset continues, visibility and reliability are becoming mission critical for enterprise communications.”\n\n</p><p>\nOoma AirDial is available today for organizations seeking to modernize legacy copper-dependent systems.

            "description": "\n<p><location value=\"LU/dk..cophgn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >COPENHAGEN</location>, <chron>Feb 26</chron> (Reuters) - A surge in property interest from U.S. buyers in Nuuk early last year prompted lawmakers to rush through curbs on foreign purchases and shifted the focus of <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> upcoming foreign-investment screening law, lawmakers and other people familiar with the matter said. </p>\n<p>In <chron>January 2025</chron>, around the time U.S. President Donald Trump renewed his efforts to assert greater control over <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>, lawyers and real estate firms in the capital began receiving multiple inquiries from U.S. buyers, six people familiar with the matter said. </p>\n<p>Until then, foreigners had shown little interest in property in the town of 20,000 people.</p>\n<p>&quot;The most aggressive ones wanted to buy everything available on the market,&quot; said a Nuuk-based lawyer, who requested anonymity.</p>\n<p>BALANCING NEEDS OF ECONOMY WITH POLITICS</p>\n<p>Trump's interest in <location>the Arctic</location> island has left its lawmakers in a dilemma, as they balance the need to attract capital to boost its stagnating economy with a wish to block out U.S. investors they suspect may carry hidden political motives. </p>\n<p>It was not clear who the investors were or whether they were linked to Trump's push for <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>, which is a semi-autonomous part of the Kingdom of <location value=\"LC/dk\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Denmark</location>.</p>\n<p>But the sudden interest alarmed lawmakers, who feared outside buyers could push residents out of Nuuk's already tight housing market, three of the sources said. By <chron>February 2025</chron>, <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> government had tightened controls on foreign property purchases.</p>\n<p>The housing scare fed into the broader push to give authorities tools to vet who is behind incoming capital. </p>\n<p>FOREIGN INVESTMENT BILL SUBMITTED IN OCTOBER</p>\n<p>A foreign investment screening bill, long in the works and formally submitted to parliament in October, was initially conceived partly as a safeguard against any unwanted Chinese investment. But three of the sources said the focus had shifted following Trump's revived <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> ambitions.</p>\n<p>&quot;We are very interested in working with American investors, but not in a way where they try to push certain political goals,&quot; said MP Aqqalu Jerimiassen from the Atassut party, part of <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> governing coalition. </p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> has long sought to diversify its economy, primarily by courting investments in its mining sector. However, limited infrastructure, including a lack of roads connecting the region's 72 towns, extreme climatic conditions, and labour shortages, have hampered progress in attracting meaningful foreign capital.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/dk\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Denmark</location> has allocated extra money for infrastructure and other development initiatives, and the EU has proposed more than doubling its funding. Still, <location>the Arctic</location> nation's economy remains stagnant, with growth at just 0.2% in 2025 and a significant deficit in public finances.</p>\n<p>SOME SECTORS WILL NEED MANDATORY SCREENING</p>\n<p>First debated in November, the screening bill is set for further discussion in April and is expected to be passed that month. The draft requires foreign investors to disclose the origin of their funds and enables authorities to reject deals if the political affiliations or intentions of the investors raise concerns.</p>\n<p>&quot;If someone is working for Trump, we will find out with this screening law. This is about our own security,&quot; Jerimiassen added.</p>\n<p>The proposed bill does not single out specific countries but urges cooperation with allies, indicating that American and European investors may face less scrutiny compared to Chinese counterparts. However, it grants <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> the authority to review foreign investments considered a threat to security.</p>\n<p>&quot;The purpose of the law is to prevent foreign investments from posing a threat to <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> security or public order,&quot; the legislation states. In addition, its goal is to enhance the security of &quot;<location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> and its allies, including <org>NATO</org> member states&quot;.</p>\n<p>Foreign investments in critical infrastructure, IT and classified data systems, raw materials and mining, hydropower, and government-owned companies will require mandatory screening under the proposed law.</p>\n<p>The legislation is limited to areas under <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> jurisdiction and does not extend to U.S. military activities on the island, which remain under <location value=\"LC/dk\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Denmark's</location> control.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> has said it has no intention of competing for influence in <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >GREENLAND</location> STILL WANTS AMERICAN CAPITAL, MP SAYS</p>\n<p>Last month, <person>Drew Horn</person>, a former senior aide in Trump's first administration, announced plans for a multi-billion-dollar data centre in <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> - the kind of project some lawmakers view as underscoring the need for clearer screening rules. </p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> government said it has not received any applications or formal requests related to the proposal.</p>\n<p>Horn, who now leads an investment and advisory firm, told Reuters the project had no political ties and that he had no concerns about passing any screening requirements in <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>.</p>\n<p>&quot;<location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> wants American capital, but we fear hidden political motives behind certain U.S. private investors,&quot; said one member of parliament, speaking anonymously due to the sensitivity of the issue.</p>\n<p>Negotiations between <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> and the U.S. over access and presence on the island are ongoing, with Trump still insisting on \"total access\" to the island.</p>\n<p>Business Minister Naaja Nathanielsen told Reuters the foreign investment screening law was not drafted in response to U.S. interest and that she continued to welcome American investment. </p>\n<p>However, if negotiations between the U.S. and <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> broke down, she said, &quot;then of course we would need to reevaluate our position.

            "description": "\n<p class=\"bwalignc\">\n<i>Integration enables organizations to manage vulnerabilities in a single location for faster remediation and a stronger security posture</i>\n\n</p>\n<p>    <location value=\"LU/us.ca.pleton\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >PLEASANTON, Calif.</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nContrast Security, ADR and Runtime Security leader,<b> </b>today announced an integration with ServiceNow Application Vulnerability Response (AVR). The integration gives joint customers better visibility into vulnerabilities and their context — including vulnerability type, details, and precise location in application code. Vulnerabilities and their context are presented exactly where these customers already work — in ServiceNow AVR — removing the need to toggle between platforms to get the data they need.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Why Contrast Security is Integrating with ServiceNow</b>\n\n</p><p>\nContrast Security and ServiceNow have joined forces to simplify and automate processes as well as provide organizations with a holistic view of their applications and APIs, from development to production.\n\n</p><p>\nAs application complexity and AI-generated code accelerate vulnerability volume, teams need more than raw findings. They need intelligent prioritization grounded in runtime reality.\n\n</p><p>\nApplication Security and Security Operations teams using ServiceNow AVR are looking to enhance their application-layer visibility to further strengthen vulnerability risk prioritization. By staying within the ServiceNow AI Platform and adding richer context, teams can make faster, more confident decisions.\n\n</p><p>\nKey benefits of the Contrast and ServiceNow integration include:\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\n<b>Reduced Manual Effort:</b> Automates the manual creation of tickets and updating of information across systems, freeing up security teams to focus on other critical activities.\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Faster Time to Remediation: </b>Rapidly address vulnerabilities that matter, directly in ServiceNow AVR. Contrast Security’s unbeatable accuracy exposes runtime vulnerabilities without false positives and passes data directly to ServiceNow AVR, saving significant time on risk assessment, investigation, and remediation.\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Enhanced Security Posture:</b> By streamlining vulnerability management, improving visibility, and accelerating remediation, organizations are empowered to strengthen their overall security posture and reduce risk exposure.\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\nContrast Security embeds itself within applications for always-on security. It pinpoints vulnerabilities with laser precision across all environments. Contrast Security then passes this data to a ticket in ServiceNow AVR, which notifies users to begin their review. As users make changes in ServiceNow, Contrast Security receives updates on that vulnerability to ensure both systems are always in sync.\n\n</p><p>\nThe results:\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistsquare\">\n<li>\nStreamlined vulnerability management within ServiceNow AVR.\n\n</li>\n<li>\nStrong data to prioritize risk directly within ServiceNow AVR, addressing the vulnerabilities that matter most.\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\n\"Customers need greater support with unaddressed vulnerabilities,” said <person>Faya Peng</person>, General Manager, Strategic Business Growth at Contrast Security. “The integration gives visibility and prioritization of risks that truly matter, directly in their workflow. With this integration, Contrast Security and ServiceNow are providing organizations with visibility into the application layer from development to production. Users can boost security posture by focusing on the risks that matter most, instead of wasting time on false positives and ticket creation.\"\n\n</p><p>\nServiceNow’s expansive Partner Ecosystem and Partner Program play a critical role in supporting the growing market opportunity for the ServiceNow AI Platform. The ServiceNow Partner Program recognizes and rewards partners for their varied expertise and experience to drive opportunities, open new markets, and help customers transform their business across the enterprise.\n\n</p><p>\nAs a Registered Build Partner,<b> </b>the certified integration provides a bidirectional sync of vulnerability data, creating a single source of truth for managing and remediating application vulnerabilities. The integration is now available in the <org>ServiceNow Store</org>.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>About Contrast Security</b>\n\n</p><p>\nContrast Security is the global leader in Application Detection and Response (ADR), empowering organizations to see and stop attacks on applications and APIs in real time. Contrast embeds patented threat sensors directly into the software, delivering unmatched visibility and protection. With continuous, real-time defense, Contrast uncovers hidden application layer risks that traditional solutions miss.

            "description": "\n<p class=\"bwalignc\">\n<i>Latest feature detects anomalous behavior in backup environments, identifying credential-based threats before they become catastrophic breaches</i>\n\n</p>\n<p>    <location value=\"LU/us.ma.burltn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >BURLINGTON, Mass.</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\n<org value=\"NABL.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >N-able, Inc.</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='NABL' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( NABL )</span> , a global cybersecurity company delivering business resilience, today expanded its Anomaly Detection capabilities in Cove Data Protection to combat the surge in identity-driven cyberattacks targeting backup environments. The new functionality delivers real-time alerts when suspicious or unauthorized changes to backup policies are detected – giving customers an early warning system against the credential-based tactics attackers use to disable or corrupt backups before deploying ransomware.\n\n</p><p>\nIdentity-based attacks have become a major driver of successful cyberattacks, with AI making these schemes even more convincing. With stolen or phished credentials, attackers can gain access to backup software and weaken backup policies. The 2025 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report found that roughly 88% of basic web application breaches involved stolen credentials, making it clear how widespread this tactic has become. Once inside, attackers – and sometimes well-intentioned employees - can alter retention policies, exclude critical data from backups, and delete protected devices. These are subtle changes that can go unnoticed for weeks or even months before the attacker triggers the final ransomware event.\n\n</p><p>\nTo give IT teams real-time visibility, Anomaly Detection introduces a vital layer of protection through event-based notifications that highlight these indicators of compromise. This capability notifies users of potential cyberattack signals or misconfigurations before they escalate, allowing organizations to take just-in-time action to safeguard their recovery posture and maintain data resilience. This new capability builds on last year’s Anomaly Detection feature, Honeypots, an always-on defense mechanism designed to detect brute-force attacks on backup infrastructure.\n\n</p><p>\n“It’s no longer just active systems under attack – backups are firmly in the crosshairs,” says <person>Neil Douglas</person>, CIO at Network ROI, a UK-based managed IT services provider. “If attackers gain access to the backup platform, they don’t always strike immediately. They can quietly manipulate backups, alter retention policies, or delete servers, then sit undetected for weeks (or even months). When they finally launch their attack, recovery can be impossible. In the past, we had no visibility into those subtle changes happening behind the scenes. Now, with real-time, event-based alerts for even the smallest alteration, we know the moment something suspicious occurs. That not only protects us from malicious actors but also guards against accidental misconfigurations. It’s a powerful step forward in strengthening our overall data resilience.”\n\n</p><p>\n“A new wave of threats is targeting businesses through stolen identities,” said <person>Chris Groot</person>, General Manager of Cove Data Protection. “Real-time alerts to backup policy changes give customers peace of mind by protecting them from risky changes that could affect recovery, whether that change was caused by attackers or employees. By catching these changes as they happen, organizations can stop identity-driven attacks and misconfigurations before recovery is compromised.\"\n\n</p><p>\nTo learn more about how Anomaly Detection can strengthen your organization’s data resilience, visit our blog.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>About N-able</b>\n\n</p><p>\nN-able protects businesses from evolving cyberthreats.

            "description": "\n<p><location value=\"LU/fi..helsin\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Helsinki, Finland</location>, <chron>Feb.  26, 2026</chron>  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the geopolitical landscape shifts and software becomes the definitive frontline of modern defence, Reaktor is significantly accelerating its investment in the Defence &amp; Security (DefSec) sector.</p>     <p>With Finland’s <org>NATO</org> membership opening doors to international collaboration, Reaktor has evolved its offering beyond premium digital consulting. We’re proud to announce Reaktor’s Intelligence Software Suite, which combines data-driven support for decision-making and controlled information sharing across security domains with a secure AI platform, fully compliant with <org>NATO</org> standards and addressing the challenges of international interoperability.</p>     <p>&quot;With over 10 years of experience working with defence clients, Reaktor’s Software Suite is shaped by real operational needs and tested in close collaboration with the end-users&quot;, shares Reaktor CEO <strong><person>Pekka Horo</person></strong>.</p>     <p>To support this new direction, we’re growing our core DefSec team with two heavyweight appointments: <strong>Simo Mäkipaja</strong> as the Chief Sales and Marketing Officer and <strong><person>Tor Gullan</person></strong> as Chief Growth Officer for Reaktor DefSec. Going forward, Gullan will lead the Solutions business of Reaktor DefSec and Mäkipaja will act as the deputy lead.</p>     <p><strong>The mission: Software as a force multiplier</strong></p>     <p>In an era of information overload, the winner isn’t the one with the most data, it’s who makes sense of it fastest. Reaktor’s offering focuses on turning &quot;information advantage&quot; from a buzzword into an operational reality.</p>     <p>Simo Mäkipaja joins Reaktor with over 25 years of experience in defence systems, C4ISR, and cybersecurity. A Master of Science from <org>Tampere University</org> of Technology and with a tenure of working for both large enterprises and scaleups operating in the international defence and security space, he brings the industry DNA to navigate the complexities of intelligence and command systems.</p>     <p>&quot;For 25 years, I’ve watched software go from a 'nice-to-have' to the central nervous system of defence&quot;, says Mäkipaja.</p>     <p>&quot;Finland’s expertise in situational awareness is world-class, but as a young <org>NATO</org> member, we’ve been quite modest. It’s time to take that Finnish engineering to the global stage.&quot;</p>     <p><person>Tor Gullan</person> joins Reaktor as a seasoned defence technology leader with a background spanning enterprise-level defence hardware, software, and systems integration. A former British Army officer, he brings experience from both client and supply sides.</p>     <p>&quot;In defence, technology must make us faster, not slower&quot;, says Gullan. &quot;Reaktor combines deep engineering credibility with a mission-centric focus. From <location value=\"LC/fi\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Finland</location>, our secure, EU-sovereign capabilities enable commanders on all levels to make faster, better-informed decisions alongside their allies.&quot;</p>     <p><strong>A three-pronged arsenal with non-negotiable reliability, trust, and compliance</strong></p>     <p>Finland’s unique position – sharing Europe’s longest border with <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia</location> while having a high national preparedness and comprehensive security mindset – makes it a natural hub for defence innovation.</p>     <p>&quot;Reaktor is now positioned to scale solutions that meet this 'Finnish standard' of security to <org>NATO</org> and EU partners, ensuring that the technology protecting our borders is as agile and interoperable as the people behind it&quot;, says Horo.</p>     <p>Reaktor’s Intelligence Software Suite combines three modular products, each solving a key challenge in modern defence:</p>     <p>Nebula Intelligence Management System enables a step-change in real-time, collaborative situational awareness. It connects to data from any source, manages data collection, and visualizes information through an intuitive interface.</p>     <p>Auriga AI Platform is an on-premise platform for running AI payloads on classified data. It is purpose-built to provide processing solutions for any kind of data. The solution also contains a large-scale storage solution for critical security needs, ensuring strong separation between different data pools.</p>     <p>Monocera Cross-domain solution replaces ageing, low-tech data diodes and gateways with a modern API-centric gateway to guard sensitive data while sharing key information. It uses cell-level filtering and data diode technology to safely transfer data between networks, between classification levels, and across networks for full interoperability.</p>     <p>Built for security and interoperability, these products bring decision advantage to users across the <org>NATO</org> and Allied domain, in any operational or strategic environment where reliability, trust, and compliance are non-negotiables.</p>     <p>   </p>  <p><strong><em>About Reaktor</em></strong><br/><em>Reaktor is a global technology company specialized in projects that cannot afford to fail.

We lift our FY 27 EPS  to <money>$8.15</money> from <money>$7.80</money> and  FY 28  to <money>$10.31</money> from <money>$10.00</money>. We believe that NVDA's growth is being supported by rising hyperscaler capex (over half of sales), but we think investors need to see greater signs of successful AI monetization from its customer base in a year where CEO Jensen Huang sees Agentic AI at an inflection point. The bar undoubtedly increases, as NVDA makes the case that compute equals revenue for their customers to justify the higher spend. We do expect sequential growth to slow in 2H (tougher comps) but think this is already discounted in shares, while Physical AI/Sovereign AI offers long term upside. We no longer assume NVDA will gain considerable traction in <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> while Rubin appears on pace to ramp in 2H. We think investors continue to underestimate NVDA's content growth potential but also acknowledge bottleneck risks from memory/power.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.
