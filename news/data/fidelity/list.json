            "description": "\n<p><chron>02:00 PM EDT</chron>, <chron>10/31/2025</chron> (MT Newswires) -- CFRA, an independent research provider, has provided MT Newswires with the following research alert. Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We increase our 12-month target by <money>$15</money> to <money>$110</money>, based on a 2026 P/E of 13.0x, a justified discount to APTV's 10-year forward P/E multiple of 23.8x. We raise our adjusted EPS estimates to <money>$7.90</money> from <money>$7.55</money> for '25, to <money>$8.45</money> from <money>$8.25</money> for '26, and introduce '27 at <money>$9.15</money>. Following APTV's big Q3 beat, we reiterate our Strong Buy on the shares, as APTV screens as one of the best earnings growth stories in the auto supplier space. We see EPS growth supported by its record new business awards of <money>$31B</money> in 2024 (its third straight year of $30B+ in new business wins), with EPS boosted by share count reduction from buybacks (its weighted average shares outstanding were down 12% Y/Y in Q3), which should help generate superior EPS growth relative to auto supplier peers. While shares are down slightly on the weaker-than-expected Q4 guidance, we believe these concerns are overblown, noting management's long history of providing conservative guidance, and like APTV's exposure to higher-growth segments of the industry.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to &#8220;go short&#8221; a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource.  Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading &#8211; either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>\n",

Both were trading higher intraday Friday.</p><p>Monthly oil prices have declined since August amid uncertainty driven by global conflicts and US trade policies, while supply of the key commodity climbed. The overall surplus averaged 1.9 million barrels a day from January through September, according to the <org>International Energy Agency</org>.</p><p>The Trump administration on <chron>Oct. 22</chron> announced sanctions on two of <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia's</location> largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, citing the country's &quot;lack of serious commitment to a peace process&quot; to end the war in <location value=\"LC/ua\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Ukraine</location>.</p><p>Russian crude is trading at a discount of <money>$13.4</money> per barrel against dated Brent free-on-board, compared with a <money>$12.55</money> discount two weeks ago, Kpler Senior Crude Oil Analyst <person>Muyu Xu</person> said via email. However, if <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington's</location> target is to completely cut off Russian oil exports, that seems unlikely, Xu told MT Newswires.</p><p>&quot;Sellers and traders will almost certainly find ways to circumvent the sanctions, while some buyers will be tempted to lift the cargoes if prices fall low enough,&quot; Xu said.</p><p>Indian Oil will continue purchasing Russian crude as long as the state-owned refiner complies with sanctions, Finance Director <person>Anuj Jain</person> said on an investor call.</p><p>Tensions between the US and <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> flared up recently after <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location> expanded export controls on rare earths, but the standoff eased as leaders of the two countries met in <location value=\"LC/kr\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >South Korea</location> on Thursday. US President <person>Donald Trump</person> reportedly said he would lower tariffs on <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> to 47% from 57%.</p><p>Rystad's Shah sees an &quot;extremely long&quot; fourth-quarter balance, driven by supply growth from both <org>OPEC</org> and non-<org>OPEC</org> producers and seasonal demand weakening. That &quot;puts a bearish shadow on benchmark prices,&quot; Shah said.</p><p>The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark policy rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday, in line with economists' expectations. During a post-meeting press conference, Fed Chair <person>Jerome Powell</person> mentioned the lack of official economic data because of the ongoing US government shutdown, which has dragged on for a month.</p><p>The Federal Open Market Committee's decision was seen as &quot;supportive for short- and medium-term demand and global growth sentiment,&quot; Rystad Energy Chief Economist <person>Claudio Galimberti</person> said in a note. That's offering a &quot;tailwind to commodities sensitive to economic activity.&quot;</p><p>Sparta's Goh sees support ahead for oil prices.</p><p>&quot;With prompt crude timespreads firmly in backwardation and oil demand to rise particularly in December with refineries back from maintenance season, Brent should remain comfortably above (<money>$60</money> per barrel) range.&quot;</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

Strong commercial momentum was broad-based, with Heat Transfer Systems orders surging 79.1% and Specialty Products orders up 84.4%, driven by strength in LNG, data centers, carbon capture, nuclear, and mining end markets.

            "description": "\n<p><chron>12:18 PM EDT</chron>, <chron>10/31/2025</chron> (MT Newswires) -- <org>The Toronto Stock Exchange</org> which was up 70 points in earlier trade, has given up earlier gains and is now down 34 points.</p><p>Healthcare, up 2.3%, is the biggest gainer, followed by financials, up 0.3%.</p><p>The biggest decliners are the mining and energy sectors, down 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively.</p><p>According to CIBC's <person>Andrew Grantham</person>, Canadian GDP was &quot;more trick than treat&quot;, with the economy contracting in August and only rebounding slightly in September. Grantham said the -0.3% reading for August was weaker than the consensus forecast and advance estimate (0.0%), and although that came off the back of an upwardly revised 0.3% gain in July (from 0.2%) the level of GDP in August is still below consensus estimates. He noted weakness in August was reasonably broad based by sector, led by transportation &amp; warehousing, wholesaling and manufacturing. However, there were some one-off factors at play, such as a flight attendants strike that impacted air transportation and drought conditions that impacted the utilities sector. Still, Grantham noted, a +0.1% advance estimate for September suggests the unwinding of some of these factors was not enough to offset August's decline.</p><p>RBC said the preliminary estimate that output rose 0.1% in September left the preliminary estimate of Q3 GDP growth at an annualized +0.4%, just slightly below its (and the <org>Bank of Canada's</org>) +0.5% base case assumption.</p><p>&quot;While that represents a modest rebound from the 1.6% (annualized) GDP decline in Q2, much of the downside surprise in August output reflected temporary factors not related to ongoing tariff disruptions. Manufacturing output edged lower to partially retrace a 1% increase in July, but a sharp pullback in air transportation was tied to a strike by airline staff in August, and electricity output fell sharply as drought conditions weighed on hydroelectric power generation,&quot; RBC added.</p><p>RBC continues to expect broader growth in overall GDP will remain slow, but positive in the near-term.  RBC expects growth to improve in 2026 in part supported by increased government deficit spending.</p><p><org>Bloomberg</org> reports that Canadian Prime Minister <person>Mark Carney</person> said his government will soon announce more than 20 investments in critical minerals projects, with a total value of about <money>C$2 billion</money>. The announcements will be made Friday at the <org>Group of Seven</org> energy ministers' meeting in <location value=\"LU/ca.on.tornto\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Toronto</location>, Carney said during a speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit in <location value=\"LC/kr\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >South Korea</location>.</p><p>Meanwhile, <org>CTV News</org> cited Carney saying <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada's</location> relationship with <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> is at a &quot;turning point&quot; following his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. It noted the meeting was hosted by <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> and lasted just 39 minutes, with the two leaders meeting on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit (APEC) in Gyeongju, <location value=\"LC/kr\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >South Korea</location>.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.
