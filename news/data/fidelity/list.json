            "description": "<p><location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >WASHINGTON</location>, <chron>Feb 26</chron> (Reuters) - The average rate on the popular U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell below 6% this week for the first time in 3-1/2 years, but the decline is likely temporary and on its own insufficient to significantly boost housing demand unless supply increases, said economists.</p>\n<p>The 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 5.98%, the lowest level since <chron>September 2022</chron>, down from 6.01% last week, mortgage finance company Freddie Mac said on Thursday. It averaged 6.76% during the same period a year ago.</p>\n<p>The housing market has become a hot-button political issue as President <person>Donald Trump</person>, under pressure to address cost-of-living concerns ahead of November midterm congressional elections, has floated a number of proposals to make homebuying more affordable.    </p>\n<p>The drop followed a decline in the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield after the <org>U.S. Supreme Court</org> on Friday struck down Trump's sweeping tariffs. In response, Trump imposed a 10% global tariff, before raising the rate to 15%. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage tracks the 10-year Treasury yield.</p>\n<p>&quot;As this week's decline stems from market volatility rather than fundamental economic data, more supportive economic data is needed to establish a consistent trend,&quot; said <person>Jiayi Xu</person>, an economist at Realtor.com, while others noted a lack of housing inventory would continue to be a challenge for buyers.</p>\n<p>Economists and policymakers say a dearth of properties for sale, especially starter homes, continues to weigh on the housing market. Many homeowners hold mortgages with rates below 5%, creating what has been called a rate-lock. The inventory of previously owned houses is also well below its pre-pandemic level. </p>\n<p>Still, some bankers and market-watchers said the 30-year mortgage rate falling below 6% was an important psychological threshold that could draw some sellers to list their homes, and give potential homebuyers more confidence to jump into the market at a time when seasonally the market typically heats up. Mortgage refinancing has risen as the 30-year rate has fallen.</p>\n<p>&quot;That headline alone could prompt many sidelined buyers to take another peek at the housing market,&quot; said <person>Kara Ng</person>, senior economist at Zillow. </p>\n<p><person>Matt Vernon</person>, head of consumer lending at Bank of America, said he would expect any movement in the market to happen gradually. </p>\n<p>&quot;In many cases, life events drive decisions more than rates alone, but lower rates could be the nudge some buyers and current homeowners have been waiting for,&quot; said Vernon, adding mortgage application volumes at Bank of America are up nearly 22% year over year. </p>\n<p>RATE-LOCK LIMITS HOME AVAILABILITY</p>\n<p>House prices increased 1.8% in the 12 months through December after climbing 2.1% in November, the <org>Federal Housing Finance Agency</org>, which oversees mortgage finance giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, said on Tuesday.    </p>\n<p>Trump last month ordered that agency to purchase <money>$200 billion</money> in mortgage bonds to help lower the cost of home loans.  </p>\n<p>Economists are skeptical that those mortgage purchases will significantly improve housing affordability.</p>\n<p>Minutes of the Federal Reserve's <chron>January 27-28</chron> policy meeting published last week, describing a briefing by a New York Fed official, noted that the administration's bond-buying plans had caused &quot;a notable decline in mortgage-backed securities yields.&quot; However, that is unlikely to materially boost mortgage refinancing &quot;because current mortgage rates are well above the weighted average rate of outstanding mortgages,&quot; the minutes noted. </p>\n<p> (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani, additional reporting by <person>Michael S.

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>After reviewing Q1 FY 26 earnings, we increase our 12-month target price by <money>CAD18</money> to <money>CAD151</money>, 14.8x our FY 27 (Oct.) EPS view of <money>CAD10.22</money>, above the peer average P/E of 13.1x, as superior credit quality and improving efficiency outweigh headwinds stemming from the asset cap on TD's two U.S. banking subsidiaries. We raise our FY 26 EPS estimate to <money>CAD9.37</money> from <money>CAD9.04</money> and increase FY 27's to <money>CAD10.22</money> from <money>CAD9.64</money>. While credit quality is weakening industry-wide, TD's recent results are encouraging. Gross impaired loans have risen only modestly in recent quarters.

EPS view of <money>CAD10.22</money>, above the peer average P/E of 13.1x, as superior credit quality and improving efficiency outweigh headwinds stemming from the asset cap on TD's two U.S. banking subsidiaries.

This new tool will help chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  and <org value=\"INTC.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Intel</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='INTC' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( INTC )</span> produce more powerful and efficient chips, by eliminating several costly and complex steps from the chip-manufacturing process, data from ASML shows.</p>\n<p>ASML plans to release this data, which represents a key milestone, at a technical conference in <location value=\"LU/us.ca.sanjse\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >San Jose</location> on Thursday, the company's chief technology officer, <person>Marco Pieters</person>, told Reuters on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>It has taken ASML years to develop the costly, next-generation tools as chipmakers have attempted to determine at what point it makes economic sense to begin to use them for mass production.</p>\n<p>But given that the current generation of EUV tools is approaching the technical limit of their ability to make complex AI chips, the next-generation machines - called High-NA EUV tools - are key for the AI industry to improve chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and help chipmakers deliver their AI chip roadmaps on time to meet surging demand.</p>\n<p>The new tools cost roughly <money>$400 million</money>, twice the cost of the original EUV machines.</p>\n<p>The High-NA EUV tools now experience limited downtime, have produced 500,000 dinner-plate-sized silicon wafers and can draw sufficiently precise patterns that make up the circuits on the chip, the ASML data shows, Pieters said. In combination, the three data points indicate the tools are ready for manufacturers.</p>\n<p>&quot;I think that it's at a critical point to look at the amount of learning cycles that have happened,&quot; he said, referring to the number of tests that have been conducted on the machines by customers.</p>\n<p>Despite their technical readiness, it will take two to three years for companies to conduct enough testing and development to integrate them into manufacturing.</p>\n<p>&quot;(Chipmakers) have all the knowledge to qualify these tools,&quot; Pieters said.</p>\n<p>Pieters also said the company has achieved roughly 80% uptime at the moment and plans to achieve 90% by the end of the year. The imaging data ASML plans to release is enough to convince customers to replace multiple steps with the older-generation tools with a single <org>High-NA</org> step, Pieters said. The 500,000 wafers the machines have processed have allowed the company to work out many of the kinks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(Reporting by <person>Max A.

            "description": "<p><location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >WASHINGTON</location>, <chron>Feb 26</chron> (Reuters) - Federal Reserve chair nominee <person>Kevin Warsh's</person> path to out-of-the-gate interest rate cuts in alignment with President <person>Donald Trump's</person> expectations could be narrowing amid emerging bullishness about the U.S. economy, growing CEO confidence in the outlook, and investors keying off a hawkish shift among the central bank's policymakers.</p>\n<p><org>The International Monetary Fund</org> said on Wednesday that with expected U.S. growth rising to 2.4% this year from 2.2% last year, the unemployment rate likely hovering near 4%, and inflation falling gradually, the Fed would have &quot;only modest scope to lower the policy rate over the coming year&quot; through a single quarter-percentage-point cut.</p>\n<p>A new Conference Board CEO survey, meanwhile, saw a sharp jump in the outlook for both the wider economy and within each leader's industry, with little sense that large rounds of layoffs were in the offing and firms passing through price increases from the Trump administration's import tariffs - a combination that could make it harder to justify rate cuts.</p>\n<p>Investors, meanwhile, have pushed back their bets on the timing of an initial Warsh-led rate cut, to the Fed's <chron>July 28-29</chron> meeting from the <chron>June 16-17</chron> gathering. Though his nomination has not been formally submitted to the <org>Senate</org>, Warsh is expected to be confirmed in time for the June meeting, with current Fed Chair <person>Jerome Powell's</person> leadership term ending in May.</p>\n<p>The improved outlook may be good for the economy, but it could leave Warsh in the same bind as Powell, with data and his colleagues pulling in one direction and the <org>White House</org> pulling in another.</p>\n<p>&quot;The Fed's reaction function has shifted slightly more hawkish,&quot; Natixis CIB economists <person>Christopher Hodge</person> and <person>Selin Aker</person> wrote in a note, concluding the central bank could only make two quarter-percentage-point rate cuts this year, rather than the three they previously expected.</p>\n<p>MIRAN SAYS BIG DROP IN RATES STILL POSSIBLE IN 2026</p>\n<p>The U.S. central bank's next meeting is scheduled for <chron>March 17-18</chron>, when its policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee is expected to hold the benchmark interest rate in the 3.50%-3.75% range. New quarterly economic and rate projections also will be released at the end of that meeting.</p>\n<p>In December, the only central bank official with a rate outlook close to the steep cuts Trump wants was Fed Governor <person>Stephen Miran</person>, the former head of the <location>Trump White House's</location> <org>Council of Economic Advisers</org>. Miran saw the Fed's policy rate falling to as low as the 2.00%-2.25% range in 2026. The median expectation among Miran's colleagues, by contrast, saw just one quarter-percentage-point cut as likely appropriate.</p>\n<p>Nearly three months later, and after a strong January employment report, Miran on Thursday told the &quot;Mornings with Maria&quot; program on Fox Business that he still feels rates could fall a full percentage point this year through four 25-basis-point cuts, ideally sooner than later.</p>\n<p>His outlook is partly based on his expectation for a &quot;profoundly disinflationary&quot; artificial intelligence boost to productivity, a &quot;supply shock&quot; that Warsh has also said should allow for lower rates.</p>\n<p>&quot;I really do not think that we have an inflation problem,&quot; despite recent inflation readings a point above the central bank's 2% target, said Miran, whose term as a Fed governor has technically expired, but who can continue to fill the job until a replacement is named. Absent some other departure from the Fed's seven-member <org>Board of Governors</org>, Miran's seat would be needed for Warsh to eventually come aboard.</p>\n<p>WARSH FACES POSSIBLE DILEMMA</p>\n<p>The minutes of the Fed's <chron>January 27-28</chron> meeting showed little support yet for relying on AI-optimism to recast monetary policy. Staff presentations suggested a small boost in the economy's potential may be developing - the &quot;supply shock&quot; Miran has mentioned, but only in a measured dose - though with demand still strong enough to sustain pressure on prices.</p>\n<p>The minutes also cited unexpected comments that several policymakers were open to the possibility that the next rate move could be a hike. In addition, Fed Governor <person>Christopher Waller</person>, who joined Miran in dissenting in favor of a cut at the meeting in January, said this week that if recent strong job growth is repeated, &quot;it may be appropriate to hold the FOMC's policy rate at current levels.&quot;</p>\n<p>The U.S. employment report for February is due to be released on <chron>March 6</chron>.</p>\n<p>A combination of sticky inflation, a steady unemployment rate, and continued economic growth would in many ways be a comforting outcome for the Fed. Policymakers generally agree that inflation will decline and anticipate the combination of slow job growth and low rates of layoffs will yield a roughly steady unemployment rate. As long as that outlook continues, and absent any sense that public expectations about inflation are starting to shift higher, there would be little motivation to do anything other than wait.</p>\n<p>Such an outcome could present a dilemma for Warsh, who has laid out arguments for why rates should fall and now will have to contend with a strong-willed and publicly demonstrative president who has taken the Fed chief nominee at his word. Trump said earlier this month that he had not asked Warsh to lower rates, but felt it was clear what his nominee would do.</p>\n<p>Trump has clashed with Powell repeatedly over the president's demands for deep rate cuts, but said of Warsh last month: &quot;I don't want to ask him that question. I think it's inappropriate ... I want to keep it nice and pure. But he certainly wants to cut rates.&quot;</p>\n<p>The president also told <org>NBC News</org> he had &quot;not much&quot; doubt rates would fall. &quot;We're way high,&quot; he said. Trump, who has linked his call for lower rates to hopes of financing federal government debt more cheaply and lowering costs for home mortgages, has voiced little concern about inflation that he feels has disappeared.</p>\n<p>However, with the economy currently growing beyond estimates of its potential and inflation showing little recent progress toward the Fed's target, there's no sense of urgency at the central bank to cut rates, particularly not as steeply as Trump or Miran have suggested.</p>\n<p>Trump's State of the Union speech to <org>Congress</org> earlier this week highlighted that paradox, as he trumpeted the good things that he believes have happened and those that are still to come. Many analysts agree a combination of fiscal stimulus in the form of tax cuts, ongoing deregulation, and the loose credit conditions supported by Fed rate cuts last year could spell upside for the economy - and make further reductions in borrowing costs all the less likely.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(Reporting by Howard Schneider;Editing by <person>Dan Burns</person> and <person>Paul Simao</person>)</p>\n",

            "description": "\n<p>    <location value=\"LU/us.fl.miami\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >MIAMI</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nSolSource Solutions (“<b>SolSource</b>”), a residential solar and storage finance company and TriBeam Financial (“<b>TriBeam</b>”), a technology-driven platform connecting large sales channels to low-cost capital providers, today announced the launch of <b>Propel</b>, a simplified third-party ownership (<b>TPO</b>) product designed to make financing residential solar and battery systems more predictable, transparent, and accessible.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>A New Approach to Residential Solar &amp; Storage Financing</b>\n\n</p><p>\nPropel combines SolSource’s TPO platform with TriBeam’s low-cost loan-origination capabilities in a single point-of-sale solution. Homeowners enter into long-term energy agreements (PPAs or leases) with SolSource that require prepayment of amounts due under the energy agreement. Homeowners may prepay with cash or with loans originated by independent capital providers through TriBeam’s platform.\n\n</p><p>\nLoan payments remain fixed, and under SolSource’s contract terms, homeowners have the option to obtain ownership of their solar and storage systems beginning after year five. Propel reduces friction and complexity, eliminates hidden fees, passes along the value of tax credits to the homeowner, and avoids price escalators that often increase the total cost to homeowners in traditional TPO models.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Strategic Partnerships</b>\n\n</p><p>\nSolSource is launching Propel with the help of several national partners:\n\n</p><p>\nEnphase Energy, a global energy technology company, is a strategic partner in the launch of Propel. Enphase will serve as the exclusive provider of inverter and battery hardware meeting domestic content requirements, as well as a provider of services including Enphase Care operation and maintenance services, the Solargraf design and proposal tool, and safe-harboring support. Enphase was the first company to successfully commercialize microinverters and has shipped more than 86.4 million microinverters, with more than 5.1 million Enphase-based systems deployed across over 160 countries.\n\n</p><p>\nGreentech Renewables, a division of CED and a leading solar distributor with more than 100 locations across major U.S. solar markets, will provide national distribution, logistics, and installer support. Greentech Renewables offers logistics and warehouse expertise and assists installers in the selection and coordination of their bill of materials.\n\n</p><p>\nTriBeam technology powers Propel through Concert Finance, a financing program that enables solar and home-energy point-of-sale financing for homeowners through TriBeam’s established dealer network. Concert further streamlines the dealer's experience and supports disciplined underwriting and compliance.\n\n</p><p>\nTogether with these partners, Propel is positioned to scale rapidly while maintaining a compliance-focused operating framework.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>SolSource Leadership Appointment</b>\n\n</p><p>\nSolSource has appointed <person>Chris Couture</person> as Chief Executive Officer to lead the company's national expansion. Couture brings deep expertise in residential solar and storage finance, having most recently served as Vice President and Head of Customer Financing at Enphase Energy, and previously as Vice President at <org>SunPower Corporation</org>, where he oversaw customer financing and asset management.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Executive Comments</b>\n\n</p><p>\n<b><person>Neil Auerbach</person></b>, Founder, Executive Chairman of SolSource Solutions and CEO of <org>Hudson Sustainable Group</org>, commented:\n\n</p><p>\n“The residential solar and battery storage market needs a simpler, lower-cost approach — without gimmicks such as hidden fees and escalators — to make the TPO model attractive to homeowners. Propel was built for that shift. By combining Hudson Sustainable Group’s multi-decade background in solar finance with TriBeam’s efficient capital platform, and with the support of industry leaders Enphase and Greentech Renewables, we’re able to deliver a straightforward, homeowner-centric solution that reduces friction and preserves long-term value. As an industry pioneer who supported the launch of numerous solar industry giants, I’m hopeful that Propel will set a new standard of excellence in TPO financing over the coming decade.”\n\n</p><p>\n<b><person>Chris Couture</person></b>, CEO of SolSource Solutions, said:\n\n</p><p>\n\"Propel is a product I believe the industry has genuinely needed for years — one that simplifies the TPO experience, eliminates hidden costs, and puts the homeowner first. The combination of SolSource and TriBeam’s financing platform, Enphase's hardware and services, and Greentech's distribution reach gives us everything we need to scale quickly and responsibly. I'm energized to lead this company and this team as we work to set a new standard for how residential solar and storage gets financed in this country.\"\n\n</p><p>\n<b><person>Alexi Evriviades</person></b>, CEO of TriBeam Financial, added:\n\n</p><p>\n“TriBeam was built to eliminate inefficiencies in point-of-sale finance. Propel brings together strong partners to deliver a streamlined financing solution that aligns the interests of homeowners, installers, and capital providers. Our platform connects large sales channels to low-cost capital while reducing overhead, allowing competitive pricing for consumers. We’re delighted to partner with SolSource, Enphase, and Greentech Renewables to bring this innovative product to market.”\n\n</p><p>\n<b>About SolSource Solutions</b>\n\n</p><p>\nSolSource is a residential solar and storage finance company dedicated to providing low-cost, transparent TPO financing solutions. Launched nationwide in early 2026, SolSource partners with leading technology providers and distributors to deliver a simplified TPO offering built on strong compliance and customer-service foundations.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>About TriBeam Financial</b>\n\n</p><p>\nTriBeam Financial operates a technology-driven point-of-sale lending platform connecting large sales channels to low-cost capital providers in the indirect consumer-lending space. While the platform accommodates multiple verticals, TriBeam’s current focus is residential solar and home-energy improvement lending.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>About <org>Hudson Sustainable Group</org></b>\n\n</p><p>\n<org>Hudson Sustainable Group</org> is a global renewable energy firm headquartered in <org>Miami, USA</org>, with offices in <location value=\"LU/jp..tokyo\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Tokyo, Japan</location>.

Early traction with large banks and global partners reinforces our confidence in Verity as a meaningful growth driver. Unity Central also continues to gain momentum with AI enhancements improving enterprise data management and one supply chain customer already live and expanding usage based on measurable ROI. With previous cost reductions now taking effect and improved operating efficiency, we remain focused on accelerating revenue growth and moving toward Adjusted EBITDA breakeven in the near term.

Among other provisions, the Notice stipulates that mining machine production enterprises are strictly prohibited from providing services such as the sale of mining machines within mainland <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>. In response to the Notice and to ensure full compliance, the Company is enhancing its internal control policies and undertaking rectification measures. Subsequent to the issuance of the Notice, the Company has ceased accepting new orders from customers in mainland <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>. The Company’s business model is designed to serve a global user base. Historically, our primary sales markets have consisted of overseas end users as well as domestic channel partners within mainland <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> whose purchases are primarily for export purposes. While management acknowledges that the cessation of domestic orders and the transition of sales channels will have a certain short-term impact on our operations, the Company plans to actively mitigate this by accelerating the expansion of its overseas sales channels and marketing infrastructure in conjunction with the launch of its new mining products which are scheduled to be launched in the second half of 2026. Consequently, management does not expect the Notice to have a material adverse impact on the Company’s overall business, financial condition, or results of operations in the long term.<br/><br/></li></ul>  <p align=\"justify\">Mr. Qiang Ding, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “During 2025, we launched multiple innovative industry-leading altcoin mining products, and these new ALEO, Dogecoin, XTM miners, as well as the innovative BYTE dual-miners, have been well-received by the market and contributed to our revenues during the year, with ALEO miners leading strong performance in Q1. As previously disclosed, our 2025 revenues were influenced by overall lower sales of mining machines following the initial surge of ALEO miners. This also had an impact on gross margins as we recorded inventory impairment charges as a result of cyclical volatility of altcoin prices and consequently, demand for mining machines.</p>  <p align=\"justify\">While our mining series underwent typical industry price-driven fluctuations, we strategically focused on strengthening our ETH treasury holdings. We advanced our ETH strategy through a dual-initiative approach designed to both optimize ETH accumulation and generate incremental returns on our ETH position. Collaborating with FalconX, we started to generate staking yields. Furthermore, through the launch of our Goldshell Stake platform, we entered into staking operation, diversifying our ETH holdings and further boosting returns. With 9,070 units of ETH in treasury holding and 2,600 units of ETH currently staked in both platforms as of <chron>February 23, 2026</chron>, we maintain a favorable long-term outlook on the appreciation potential of our ETH treasury, and plan to stake the bulk of our ETH holdings consistently over time to maximize staking yields.”</p>  <p align=\"justify\">Mr. Ding continued to comment on 2026 growth strategy, “Our 2026 business strategy remains centered around altcoin mining hardware and ETH strategy enhancements. We expect revenue in the first half of 2026 to be primarily driven by our existing product portfolio. During this period, we intend to continue investing into exploring new innovative altcoin projects and leverage our R&amp;D expertise to support the timely development and iteration of mining machines. Subject to market conditions and development progress, we plan to launch new altcoin mining machines in the second half of 2026. At the same time, we are adopting various cost-savings initiatives designed to improve our overall profitability. Following the divestiture of certain non-core assets and associated workforce reduction, we have restructured the organization to operate with a leaner corporate model and greater operating efficiency, positioning us for continued margin expansion.”</p>  <p align=\"justify\">“As a Web3 infrastructure provider, our business is anchored by a leading altcoin hardware platform and complemented by our comprehensive technical capabilities across the blockchain ecosystem. By leveraging our deep experience in developing proprietary technology stacks, encompassing wallet, payment, and staking architectures, we have cultivated the integrated platform capabilities.”</p>  <p align=\"justify\"><strong>CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION<br/></strong>The Company will host a conference call to discuss these financial results at <chron>8:00 pm</chron> U.S. Eastern Time on <chron>Thursday, February 26, 2026</chron> (corresponding to <chron>9:00 am</chron> Beijing Time on <chron>Friday, February 27</chron>, 2026).</p>  <p align=\"justify\"><strong><org>Participant Dial</org>-in Numbers:</strong></p> <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width:100%; border-collapse:collapse ;\"><tr><td style=\"max-width:33%; width:33%; min-width:33%;;text-align: justify ;  vertical-align: middle; vertical-align: top ; \">U.S. &amp; International (Toll)</td><td style=\"max-width:67%; width:67%; min-width:67%;;text-align: justify ;  vertical-align: middle; vertical-align: top ; \">+1 646-307-1963</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: justify ;  vertical-align: middle; vertical-align: top ; \"><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> (Toll-Free)</td><td style=\"text-align: justify ;  vertical-align: middle; vertical-align: top ; \">+86 400-030-0308</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: justify ;  vertical-align: middle; vertical-align: top ; \"><location value=\"LU/cn..hongkg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Hong Kong</location> (Toll-Free)</td><td style=\"text-align: justify ;  vertical-align: middle; vertical-align: top ; \">+852 800-960-994</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: justify ;  vertical-align: middle; vertical-align: top ; \"><location value=\"LC/sg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Singapore</location></td><td style=\"text-align: justify ;  vertical-align: middle; vertical-align: top ; \">+65 3159-1234</td></tr></table> <p align=\"justify\"><br/>Webcast: <br/>A simultaneous audio webcast including accompanying slides may be accessed via the following link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/ezs9gm6i/, or via the investor relations section of the Company’s website https://ir.intchains.com.

These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on the Company’s current expectations and projections about future events that the Company believes may affect its financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about: (i) our goals and strategies; (ii) our future business development, formed condition and results of operations; (iii) expected changes in our revenue, costs or expenditures; (iv) growth of and competition trends in our industry; (v) our expectations regarding demand for, and market acceptance of, our products; (vi) general economic and business conditions in the markets in which we operate; (vii) relevant government policies and regulations relating to our business and industry; (viii) fluctuations in the market price of ETH-based cryptocurrencies; gains or losses from the sale of ETH-based cryptocurrencies; changes in accounting treatment for the Company’s ETH-based cryptocurrencies holdings; a decrease in liquidity in the markets in which ETH-based cryptocurrencies are traded; security breaches, cyberattacks, unauthorized access, loss of private keys, fraud, or other events leading to the loss of the Company’s ETH-based cryptocurrencies; impacts to the price and rate of adoption of ETH-based cryptocurrencies associated with financial difficulties and bankruptcies of various participants in the industry; and (viii) assumptions underlying or related to any of the foregoing. Investors can identify these forward-looking statements by words or phrases such as “may,” “could,” “will,” “should,” “would,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “project” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent occurring events or circumstances, or changes in its expectations, except as may be required by law. Although the Company believes that the expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, it cannot assure you that such expectations will turn out to be correct, and the Company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from the anticipated results and encourages investors to review other factors that may affect its future results in the Company’s registration statement and other filings with the <org>SEC</org>.</p>  <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures</strong><br/>In evaluating Company’s business, the Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted income (loss) from operations and adjusted net income (loss), as supplemental measures to review and assess its operating performance. The Company defines adjusted income (loss) from operations as income (loss) from operations excluding share-based compensation expenses, and adjusted net income (loss) as net income (loss) excluding share-based compensation expenses. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and operational decision-making.</p>  <p align=\"justify\">The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net income, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. One of the key limitations of using adjusted net income is that it does not reflect all of the items of income and expense that affect the Company’s operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in Company’s business and are not reflected in the presentation of adjusted net income. Further, the non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.</p>  <p align=\"justify\"><strong>For investor and media inquiries, please contact:</strong></p>  <p align=\"justify\"><strong><org value=\"ICG.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Intchains Group Limited</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='ICG' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( ICG )</span></strong><br/>Investor relations<br/>Email: ir@intchains.com</p>  <p><strong><org>The Equity Group</org></strong><br/><person>Lena Cati</person>, Senior Vice President<br/>212-836-9611 / lcati@theequitygroup.com</p>  <p><person>Alice Zhang</person>, Associate<br/>212-836-9610 / azhang@theequitygroup.com</p> <table align=\"center\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

            "description": "\n<p><chron>04:24 PM EST</chron>, <chron>02/26/2026</chron> (MT Newswires) -- <org>The Toronto Stock Exchange</org> on Thursday set its sixth record close in seven sessions and its 17th of the year as TD Economics noted foreign direct investment in <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> has reached the highest level since 2007, but in a separate note acknowledged it expects tariff instability to remain a theme in 2026,</p><p>The resources-heavy S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index closed up 374.63 points, or 1.1%, at 34,501.96, even with commodity prices easing, and while U.S. markets were lower. According to Dow Jones Market Data, FactSet, going in today's session the TSX was month to date up 6.90%, and year to date up 2,414.57 points or 7.61%.</p><p>Most sectors were higher, but for rare occasion it was Industrials that led gainers alongside Info Tech, both up 2%. Health Care was the biggest loser, down near 1.3%.</p><p>Of commodities, gold edged off a month high by late afternoon Thursday as the price of the metal remains rangebound after correcting from its <chron>Jan. 29</chron> record close. Gold for April delivery was last seen down <money>US$10.10</money> to  to <money>US$5,216.100</money> per ounce, as it continues to trade around the <money>US$5,200</money> mark despite strong physical demand and a weak U.S. dollar. with the record high of <money>$5,354.80</money> remaining out of reach as the market consolidates after rising 62% in the six months preceding the record.</p><p>Also, West Texas Intermediate crude oil closed lower as talks between <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location> and <location value=\"LC/ir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Iran</location> resume in <location value=\"LU/ch..geneva\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Geneva</location>, while a report showed an outsized rise in U.S. oil inventories last week. WTI crude oil for April delivery closed down <money>US$0.21</money> to settle at <money>US$65.21</money> per barrel after trading as low as <money>US$63.60</money> during the session. <person>April Brent</person> oil was down <money>US$0.5</money> to <money>US$70.80</money>.</p><p>News around increasing foreign direct investment into <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> has boosted sentiment around the economy, and markets, in recent days.</p><p>TD Economist <person>Maria Solovieva</person> noted foreign direct investment into <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> totaled <money>$25.1 billion</money> in Q4, bringing full year 2025 to <money>$96.8 billion</money>, above <money>$91.6 billion</money> in 2024, marking the highest annual inflows since 2007. She noted merger and acquisition activity was the primary driver of the increase, while sector gains were concentrated in trade and transportation and management companies, followed by manufacturing.</p><p>Solovieva also noted U.S. direct investment into <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> totalled <money>$12.1 billion</money> in Q4 and <money>$52.5 billion</money> for the year, roughly in line with 2024. Foreign direct investment from countries other than the U.S. amounted to <money>$3.7 billion</money> in Q4 2025 and <money>$40.9 billion</money> in 2025, up modestly from <money>$39.4 billion</money> in 2024, with the <location value=\"LC/gb\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >United Kingdom</location> the largest non-U.S. source.</p><p>Against this, Solovieva noted Canadian direct investment abroad slowed to <money>$13.5 billion</money> in Q4, bringing full-year 2025 to <money>$79.4 billion</money>, well below 2024's <money>$123 billion</money> outflow and the lowest level since 2020.</p><p>In a separate note, TD's Chief Economist <person>Beata Caranci</person> said she expects tariff instability to remain a theme in 2026, even if last week's <org>U.S. Supreme Court</org> decision was significant in setting limitations around use of IEEPA and executive power.</p><p>&quot;Importantly, however,&quot; Caranci said, &quot;the judgement was met with a cautious response globally, since it doesn't alter the overarching intent and strategy of the Trump administration. Tariffs will remain a primary tool in redefining trade relationships, evidenced by the executive order citing alternative powers with sections 122 and 301 and section 232 remains a tool.&quot;</p><p>Even before the much-awaited decision, guardrails around the application of tariffs were becoming more evident, Caranci noted. According to her, only one third of Trump's tariff threats have turned into actual outcomes. &quot;A key distinction of what turns a threat into a reality is the existence of an executive order, but even this isn't a guarantee, she added.</p><p>&quot;For instance,&quot; Caranci said, &quot;tariffs were scheduled to rise on wood products from 25% to 50% on <chron>January 1st</chron> of this year. This was pushed out to 2027, with the administration citing a desire to have more time to reach productive negotiations with trade partners. This explanation, however, reveals an important limitation on rule breaking. The administration is sensitive to any tariff that immediately impacts household affordability ahead of mid-term elections. In this case, wood product tariffs would directly hit prices on bathroom vanities, cabinetry and similar items.&quot;</p><p>Caranci added: &quot;Applying the same logic, Trump's threat of tariffs on all Canadian goods was not realistic but was meaningful in defining the limits of a trade agreement <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> can reach with <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>. On the other hand, the threat of 50% tariffs on Canadian made aircraft had more credibility because it was targeted and does not immediately feed downstream to consumers.</p><p>&quot;So threats that are further upstream on manufacturers and wholesalers should be taken more seriously than on final consumer goods, at least in the near term.&quot;</p><p><org>The Canadian Press</org> is reporting that Canada-U.S. Trade Minister <person>Dominic LeBlanc</person> says he will meet with U.S. Trade Representative <person>Jamieson Greer</person> late next week in <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington, D.C.</location> The discussions come as both countries are preparing for the mandatory review of the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement on trade.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.
