Through this integration, Pedigree augments the system moving it into the field with mobile-first workflows that streamline communication, reduce manual processes, and improve operational visibility across multi-stop pickup and delivery operations.</p><p>Key capabilities include two-way messaging between drivers and operations teams, pickup and delivery job execution with real-time status updates flowing back into the CLI TMS, and secure mobile document capture for bills of lading, proof of delivery, and signed receipts. These workflows are designed to eliminate paper handling, accelerate billing, and improve customer responsiveness.</p><p>Unlike many technology integrations that require fleets to overhaul their existing systems, Pedigree's integration with CLI is intentionally modular and ELD-agnostic. LTL carriers can continue using their current ELD provider, or operate without an ELD dependency, while still benefiting from modern mobile workflows and real-time operational data.</p><p>\"Our goal is to help carriers modernize without disruption,\" said <person>Rocco Marrari</person>, VP of sales at Pedigree Technologies. \"This integration allows LTL fleets to improve communication, document handling, and workflow efficiency, without forcing unnecessary change or technology replacement.\"</p><p>The integration is designed specifically for terminal-based LTL operations, supporting multi-stop routes, linehaul coordination, and pickup and delivery workflows.</p><p>\"This integration between CLI and Pedigree Technologies brings together two companies with a shared focus on serving the unique operational needs of LTL carriers,\" said <person>Ben Wiesen</person>, president of Carrier Logistics. \"Through Pedigree's mobile-first workflows, CLI's solution extends out onto the road— creating stronger alignment between drivers, dispatch, and back-office operations.

It helps developers and system integrators understand real time behavior in a Radio Access Network (RAN) implementation and reveals optimization opportunities for efficient hardware resource usage. This enables deployment of optimized solutions with faster time to market, tested in a more cost-effective way to fine tune software to sync perfectly with an open RAN mobile site's hardware.</p>\n<p>Cirrus360's Declarative Digital Twin powered Gabriel™ platform tackles these challenges via AI Reasoning. It utilizes all available facts: descriptions of 5G/6G protocol using a RAN Domain Specific Language, RDSL™, RAN functions metadata, and hardware resources, to create a digital twin. \"<i>Our Declarative Digital Twin methodology, in conjunction with AI Reasoning in Cirrus360's cloud-based Gabriel™ platform, acts as a RAN testing specific AI assistant for system integrators</i>\", said Cirrus360 co-founder/CEO <person>Chaitali Sengupta</person>.</p><p>This milestone provides a clear example of how an open collaborative ecosystem can contribute to innovation. By offering access to real-world test environments and scenarios, Vodafone will help facilitate more efficient network evolution across the telecom landscape and support AI powered innovations such as Cirrus360's Gabriel™ platform. \"<i>We are building an integration and testing framework that will expedite testing and deployment readiness of new innovations in RAN silicon and AI driven features</i>\", said Kyriakos Exadaktylos, Head of OpenRAN at Vodafone. \"What's exciting about the Declarative Digital Twin approach is how it utilizes AI Reasoning to accelerate the progression and effectiveness of in-lab testing of RAN solutions\".</p><p>Cirrus360's Declarative Digital Twin platform was developed with funding from <org>US Department of Commerce</org>, <org>National Telecommunications and Information Administration</org> (NTIA), <org>Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund</org>. This funding award is in the R&amp;D focus area that invests in the development of new/improved testing methods.

IBC is reporting the performance of &quot;continuing operations&quot; at its Copper Alloy division, &quot;discontinued operations&quot; at its <location value=\"LS/us.ma\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Massachusetts</location> facility, and a combination of continuing and discontinued operations.)<sup>1</sup></i></p><ul><li><p><i>Sales of <money>$4.9 million</money> for the quarter improved by 36.6% year-over-year (YOY). Sales rose by 6.8% in the six months ended <chron>Dec. 31, 2025</chron>, over the comparable prior-year period.</i></p></li><li><p><i>IBC reported operating income of <money>$111,000</money>, reversing a YOY loss of <money>$428,000</money>. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (&quot;Adjusted EBITDA&quot;) of <money>$349,000</money> compared to (<money>$396,000</money>) in the comparable prior-year period. Gross profit rose 21.7% YOY and gross margin strengthened by 67% YOY in the quarter.</i></p></li><li><p><i>On a consolidated basis, operating income and Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter increased year-over-year, driven largely by lower costs in Discontinued Operations (the now shuttered Engineered Materials Division). IBC's consolidated loss of <money>$1.2 million</money> for the six-month period ended <chron>December 31, 2025</chron>, was lower compared to the same prior-year period, largely due to higher sales revenue in the current period and reduced costs related to the closure of the EM Division's <location value=\"LS/us.ma\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Massachusetts</location> plant.</i></p></li></ul> <p><strong id=\"dateline\"><location value=\"LU/us.in.fralin\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >FRANKLIN, IN</location> / ACCESS Newswire / <chron>February 27, 2026</chron> / </strong><org value=\"IAALF.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >IBC Advanced Alloys Corp.</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='IAALF' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( IAALF )</span> (&quot;<strong>IBC</strong>&quot; or the &quot;<strong>Company</strong>&quot;)<strong> (TSXV:IB)</strong> announces its financial results for the quarter ended <chron>September 30, 2025</chron>.</p><p>Stronger demand for IBC copper alloy products boosted revenue in the quarter YOY by 36.6% in IBC's Copper Alloys Division. Prior quarters saw softer demand largely due to market uncertainty in the application of the <org>U.S. Government's</org> planned copper tariffs. Now that these tariffs have been implemented, product demand appears to be strengthening. The Division also posted gains in the quarter in operating income, Adjusted EBITDA, gross profit, and gross margin over the comparable prior-year period.</p><p>Consolidated loss in the quarter of <money>$480,000</money> narrowed YOY from a loss of <money>$1.4 million</money> in the comparative period, largely driven by higher copper alloys sales revenue and reduced costs at the company's Engineered Materials division, which was closed in 2024.</p><p>&quot;We saw strong signs of demand recovery in our second fiscal quarter almost across the board in copper alloy products, and those gains appear to be continuing into the current quarter,&quot; said <person>Mark A. Smith</person>, CEO and Executive Chairman of IBC. &quot;Additionally, we continue to explore opportunities for sales of aluminum-scandium alloys, which we successfully began producing in <chron>October 2025</chron>. We see that market growing significantly as the prospect of the first-ever domestic scandium production in the U.S. appears increasingly likely to launch in the near future.&quot;</p><p><strong>Selected Results</strong></p><p>Unless otherwise noted, all financial amounts are calculated following IFRS.<sup>1</sup></p><table><tbody><tr><td

            "description": "\n<p>(The opinions expressed here are those of the authors.)</p>\n<p>By <person>Anna Szymanski</person></p>\n<p><chron>Feb 27</chron> -</p>\n<p>Everything <person>Mike Dolan</person> and the ROI team are excited to read,\nwatch and listen to over the weekend.</p>\n<p>From the Editor</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hello Morning Bid readers!</p>\n<p>Markets were jittery this week, as anxiety about the\npotential impact of the artificial intelligence revolution left\ninvestors nervous about their asset allocations and their future\njob prospects.\nThis week's wave of worry was initially set off by a 7,000-word\npiece, &quot;The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis,&quot; published by\nresearch firm Citrini on Sunday. It made for pretty grim\nreading: the loss of millions of office jobs will destroy\ndemand, plunging the economy into a deflationary tailspin.\nIs that possible? Sure, in the sense that anything is possible.\nBut when markets are being spooked by apocalyptic long-form\nblogposts, it's time to ask if we are in the midst of an AI doom\nbubble.\nThe software sector got a slight boost on Tuesday when a new\nround of plug-ins from Anthropic highlighted the potential for\nAI upstarts to partner with legacy firms instead of replacing\nthem.\nBut, as is often the case, fear trumps hope, and both the S&amp;P\n500 and the Nasdaq fell on Thursday.\nThis was - perhaps surprisingly - after the announcement of\nanother strong quarter from Nvidia - its 14th consecutive\nrevenue beat. The <money>$4.5 trillion</money> chipmaker on Wednesday posted\nbetter-than-expected results for the January quarter and also\nforecast above-market estimates for current quarter revenue. Its\nshare price initially rose, but then pulled back, likely because\nthe good news was already baked in and concerns - such as rising\ncompetition and customer concentration - remain.\nMeanwhile, two months into the year, the country with the best\nperforming equity market by far is Korea. The benchmark KOSPI\nindex may have slid slightly on Friday, but it's up more than\n48% in the year to date. This eye-popping figure might suggest\nfevered speculation is at play, but that's not necessarily the\ncase - and there is reason to believe it could still have room\nto run.\nMoving over to M&amp;A, the months-long battle between Paramount\nSkydance and Netflix to acquire Warner Bros Discovery appears to\nbe over, with the former coming out on top with its revised\n<money>$31</money>-a-share offer.</p>\n<p>Turning back to anxiety, another major source of it this\nweek was the ongoing standoff between <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location> and <location value=\"LC/ir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Iran</location>\nover <location value=\"LU/ir..tehran\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Tehran's</location> nuclear program. The two held indirect talks in\n<location value=\"LU/ch..geneva\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Geneva</location> on Thursday.\nWhile crude prices fell following claims that progress in the\nnegotiations had been made, Brent crude was up again early on\nFriday, trading above <money>$71</money> a barrel. Discussions will resume in\n<location value=\"LU/at..vienna\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Vienna</location> next week, which means the waiting game continues.\nOne party that may benefit from the geopolitical noise is OPEC+.\nThe volatile headlines have weighed on prices, giving the\nproducer group cover to stick to its \"balanced market\"\nnarrative, despite many facts on the ground that suggest\notherwise. OPEC+ is expected to announce a 137,000 barrel per\nday increase in output when it meets on Sunday.\nSpeaking of energy, one would have needed a lot of it to stay up\nthough all of President <person>Donald Trump's</person> State of the Union\naddress on Tuesday, which clocked in at a record one hour and 47\nminutes. It offered little in the way of new ideas for\naddressing Americans' affordability concerns, with the exception\nof a plan to boost Americans' retirement savings. The president\nalso vowed to move forward with his tariff agenda even after a\nlarge portion of it was quashed by the <org>Supreme Court</org> last week.\nOne notable takeaway from the speech was the president's claim\nthat hyperscalers &quot;have the obligation to provide for their own\npower needs&quot; as they build out energy-hungry data centers to\nfuel the AI boom. The administration wants to avoid stressing\nthe grid and pushing up consumers' electricity prices.\nBut the pressure is already building, and whether or not\ncompanies cover their own power needs, ambitious AI expansion\nplans are likely to be hobbled by severe power-infrastructure\nbottlenecks.</p>\n<p>It's a reminder that instead of fretting about viral AI\ndoomsday reports, we should probably spend a little more time\nconsidering the very real physical limitations that could slow\ndown this technological revolution.\nFor more commodities and markets news, check out Reuters Open\nInterest.

But when markets are being spooked by apocalyptic long-form blogposts, it's time to ask if we are in the midst of an AI doom bubble.</p>\n<p>The software sector got a slight boost on Tuesday when a new round of plug-ins from Anthropic highlighted the potential for AI upstarts to partner with legacy firms instead of replacing them.</p>\n<p>But, as is often the case, fear trumps hope, and both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq fell on Thursday.</p>\n<p>This was - perhaps surprisingly - after the announcement of another strong quarter from Nvidia - its 14th consecutive revenue beat. The <money>$4.5 trillion</money> chipmaker on Wednesday posted better-than-expected results for the January quarter and also forecast above-market estimates for current quarter revenue. Its share price initially rose, but then pulled back, likely because the good news was already baked in and concerns - such as rising competition and customer concentration - remain.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, two months into the year, the country with the best performing equity market by far is Korea. The benchmark KOSPI index may have slid slightly on Friday, but it's up more than 48% in the year to date. This eye-popping figure might suggest fevered speculation is at play, but that's not necessarily the case - and there is reason to believe it could still have room to run.</p>\n<p>Moving over to M&amp;A, the months-long battle between Paramount Skydance and Netflix to acquire Warner Bros Discovery appears to be over, with the former coming out on top with its revised <money>$31</money>-a-share offer.</p>\n<p>Turning back to anxiety, another major source of it this week was the ongoing standoff between <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location> and <location value=\"LC/ir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Iran</location> over <location value=\"LU/ir..tehran\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Tehran's</location> nuclear program. The two held indirect talks in <location value=\"LU/ch..geneva\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Geneva</location> on Thursday.</p>\n<p>While crude prices fell following claims that progress in the negotiations had been made, Brent crude was up again early on Friday, trading above <money>$71</money> a barrel. Discussions will resume in <location value=\"LU/at..vienna\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Vienna</location> next week, which means the waiting game continues.</p>\n<p>One party that may benefit from the geopolitical noise is OPEC+. The volatile headlines have weighed on prices, giving the producer group cover to stick to its \"balanced market\" narrative, despite many facts on the ground that suggest otherwise. OPEC+ is expected to announce a 137,000 barrel per day increase in output when it meets on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Speaking of energy, one would have needed a lot of it to stay up though all of President <person>Donald Trump's</person> State of the Union address on Tuesday, which clocked in at a record one hour and 47 minutes. It offered little in the way of new ideas for addressing Americans' affordability concerns, with the exception of a plan to boost Americans' retirement savings. The president also vowed to move forward with his tariff agenda even after a large portion of it was quashed by the <org>Supreme Court</org> last week.</p>\n<p>One notable takeaway from the speech was the president's claim that hyperscalers &quot;have the obligation to provide for their own power needs&quot; as they build out energy-hungry data centers to fuel the AI boom. The administration wants to avoid stressing the grid and pushing up consumers' electricity prices.</p>\n<p>But the pressure is already building, and whether or not companies cover their own power needs, ambitious AI expansion plans are likely to be hobbled by severe power-infrastructure bottlenecks.</p>\n<p>It's a reminder that instead of fretting about viral AI doomsday reports, we should probably spend a little more time considering the very real physical limitations that could slow down this technological revolution.</p>\n<p>For more commodities and markets news, check out Reuters Open Interest.

Its climate finance platform includes tailored capital solutions, impact investing products, and carbon procurement strategies designed to accelerate climate mitigation and adaptation at scale.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Management Commentary</b>\n\n</p><p>\n\"We're witnessing a fundamental transformation in how the world thinks about energy infrastructure and resources – what started as climate concerns has evolved into an urgent economic and national security imperative, particularly as AI and data centers reshape energy demand patterns,” said <person>Michael Sieg</person>, Founder and CEO of ThomasLloyd. “Our independent, vertically integrated platform, combining deep technical expertise with financial innovation and operational excellence, allows us to solve complex energy and decarbonization challenges that traditional players simply can't address at scale and with appropriate speed. The business combination with Roman DBDR would serve a dual purpose beyond raising capital – it accelerates our North American expansion and we believe establishes ThomasLloyd as the partner of choice for enterprises and governments seeking reliable, sustainable energy and technology solutions that can be delivered with exceptional speed and scale.”\n\n</p><p>\nVivienne Macalchlan, CFO of ThomasLloyd, says “Our strategic partnership with Roman DBDR and listing on Nasdaq would represent a pivotal step in ThomasLloyd’s journey, providing us with a robust platform from which we can take advantage of significant global market opportunities. Our successes, evolution and learnings over the last few years have allowed us to develop a well thought-through customer centric energy and decarbonization offering. With Roman DBDR as our partner, our team has a unique opportunity to drive, grow and optimize market share, revenue and margin in a more pronounced manner than before.”\n\n</p><p>\n“ThomasLloyd embodies the rare combination of visionary leadership, operational depth, and market timing that defines transformational investment opportunities,” said <person>Dixon Doll, Jr.</person>, Chairman and CEO of Roman DBDR. “Michael and his team have built something truly unique: a platform that doesn't just participate in the energy transition but actually drives it through innovative solutions and superior execution. ThomasLloyd’s ability to navigate complex, multi-jurisdictional projects while maintaining strong stakeholder relationships demonstrates the kind of institutional-quality management we believe public markets will reward.”\n\n</p><p>\n“This partnership embodies our conviction that the companies solving humanity’s most pressing infrastructure challenges will generate exceptional long-term value for shareholders,” added Dr. <person>Donald Basile</person>, Co-Founder of Roman DBDR. “ThomasLloyd’s unique positioning as an independent ‘one stop shop’ for best-in-class sustainable infrastructure development, financing and operations puts it in the driver’s seat as the global economy’s demands for smart energy resources and applications continue to grow at a rapid pace. We are excited to support ThomasLloyd’s vision for sustainable energy abundance.”\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Growth &amp; Market Overview</b>\n\n</p><p>\nThomasLloyd has achieved first-mover advantage in the global energy transition infrastructure sector, which a leading management consultancy quantifies as a <money>US$275 trillion</money> market opportunity – equivalent to 7.5% of global GDP annually between 2021 and 2050. Three irreversible structural drivers are converging in the Company's core North American and <location value=\"LR/asp\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Asia-Pacific</location> markets simultaneously: unprecedented energy demand growth from economic growth and population expansion, urbanization, and AI/data center development, energy transition for decarbonization, and national energy sovereignty and security imperatives driving demand for domestically deployable solutions. The Company's independent, decentralized sustainable energy solutions deliver superior economics with significantly lower capex and significantly faster deployment compared to traditional grid-based fossil fuel systems.\n\n</p><p>\nThis market position is supported by a fast-growing, robust commercial pipeline of potential investments across more than 40 projects in 10 countries. The pipeline comprises predominantly organic follow-on investments along with selected acquisitions in high-margin segments, focusing on synergistic, recurring offerings across renewable energy and hybrid solutions, biofuels, AI data centers, industrial decarbonization including heating and cooling, water scarcity solutions, and resource management. This approach serves to rationalize the fragmented, capital-constrained sustainable energy infrastructure sector to create massive opportunity for ThomasLloyd's scaled, vertically integrated platform to capture meaningful market share with strong revenue visibility and immediate execution capability.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Transaction Overview</b>\n\n</p><p>\nThe Proposed Business Combination, which has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both Roman DBDR and ThomasLloyd, is expected to provide in excess of <money>US$240 million</money> in gross proceeds, from a combination of funds from cash held in Roman DBDR’s trust account and an anticipated PIPE raise, before accounting for potential redemptions and transaction expenses. The Proposed Business Combination does not have a minimum cash closing condition and is expected to close in the second half of 2026, subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by Roman DBDR shareholders and other regulatory approvals.\n\n</p><p>\nIn addition, the Company has signed a binding term sheet with <org>B. Riley Principal Capital II, LLC</org> for a <money>US$200 million</money> equity line of credit to further support its growth strategy.\n\n</p><p>\nThe Proposed Business Combination values ThomasLloyd at a pre-money equity value of <money>US$850 million</money>, whereby the transaction value could increase up to <money>US$1.3 billion</money> via a <money>US$450 million</money> share price-based earnout, aligning management incentives for continued Company growth and reinforcing existing shareholders’ commitment to the Company. This would imply a pro forma equity value of the new public company of approximately <money>US$1.5 billion</money> including the earnout and assuming <money>US$240 million</money> in gross proceeds from a combination of funds from cash held in Roman DBDR’s trust account and an anticipated PIPE raise.\n\n</p><p>\nThomasLloyd’s existing management team will continue to lead the combined company following the completion of the Proposed Business Combination. ThomasLloyd’s existing shareholders will roll 100% of their equity holdings into the new public company. Additionally, ThomasLloyd’s management team, ThomasLloyd’s primary equity holders, Roman DBDR sponsor and certain affiliates of Roman DBDR’s sponsor have committed to customary post-closing lock-ups and will continue to be aligned with shareholder interests through the previously referenced program of share price-based earnouts.\n\n</p><p>\nAdditional information about the Proposed Business Combination, including a copy of the business combination agreement, will be provided in a report on Form 8-K to be filed by Roman DBDR with the <org>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</org> (“SEC”) and available at www.sec.gov.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Advisors</b>\n\n</p><p>\n<org>Cohen &amp; Company Capital Markets</org>, a division of <org>Cohen &amp; Company Securities, LLC</org>, is serving as exclusive financial advisor and lead capital markets advisor to ThomasLloyd. <org>B.

            "description": "<p><location value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >NEW YORK</location>, <chron>Feb 27</chron> (Reuters) - On paper, American consumers spent last year tightening their belts, and even retail heavyweights stumbled. But sit-down restaurants and some drive-through chains buzzed with patrons seeking a special treat or cheap comfort food.</p>\n<p>Their upbeat sales made the U.S. restaurant industry a rare bright spot for jobs, with restaurant payrolls ticking up 1% last year, adding about 108,000 jobs, according to the <org>Bureau of Labor Statistics</org>. </p>\n<p>In contrast, the overall U.S. economy added 181,000 non-farm jobs in 2025, marking the weakest annual payroll growth in 20 years outside a recession year.</p>\n<p>Success among restaurants was not evenly spread, though.</p>\n<p>Corporate filings show that eateries such as Brinker's Chili's, Yum Brands' <org>Taco Bell</org> and fast-growing coffee chain Dutch Bros lured customers by aggressively marketing bundled deals, leaning into digital innovation and limited-time offers, and focusing on high-margin, Instagrammable food. </p>\n<p>But previous darlings like Chipotle and Cava were hurt by what analysts call the &quot;slop-bowl fatigue&quot; -  growing weariness among younger consumers with high-priced, customizable grain or salad bowls. </p>\n<p><location value=\"LU/us.az.tempe\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Tempe, Arizona</location>-based Dutch Bros and its franchisees added roughly 8,000 employees in the last two years, a 33% increase, the company said. </p>\n<p>&quot;We have a healthy pipeline of growth,&quot; CEO <person>Christine Barone</person> told Reuters after the company's earnings in February. The brand, which serves customizable beverages, is a hit with younger consumers, Barone said.  </p>\n<p>A similar story is playing out at another chain that, like Dutch Bros, sells more treats than meals.</p>\n<p>Ice cream chain Whit's Frozen Custard has grown its payroll by up to 40% a year for the past two years, said owner <person>Bill Aseere</person>, to keep up with rapid growth. It now has stores in 93 locations across 10 states and some 15 to 20 employees per store. </p>\n<p>Amanda Wang, co-founder of fast-growing Chinese beverage chain Ningji Lemon Tea - part of a tidal wave of Chinese tea brands coming to the U.S. - said her chain's new restaurants in the U.S. were buoyed by demand among price-weary consumers for affordable indulgences. </p>\n<p>Tea &quot;offers that little bit of happiness,&quot; she said.</p>\n<p>As a whole, the restaurant industry grew payrolls even as it weathers depressed traffic and rising labor costs, analysts say, thanks in part to menu price increases. Menu prices at restaurants grew 4.1% in 2025 compared to grocery inflation of 2.3%, according to the <org>Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</org>. </p>\n<p>DIVERGING FORTUNES</p>\n<p>A deeper look at 2025 payroll data shows the difference in fortunes between types of restaurants: staff headcount at snack and non-alcoholic beverage restaurants grew 3.6% in 2025 and those at sit-down restaurants rose 1%. But fast-food payrolls grew only 0.4%, while cafeterias and buffet payrolls shrank 3.9%. </p>\n<p>&quot;At the end of the day, people want go out to eat and celebrate those big occasions,&quot; said <person>Chad Moutray</person>, an economist at the <org>National Restaurant Association</org>, referring to resilient spending at sit-down restaurants. </p>\n<p>&quot;Consumers might be pulling back from vacations, but they still prioritize eating out.&quot;</p>\n<p>The payroll data and Moutray's comments underscore what the industry calls the &quot;lipstick effect&quot; - consumers tightened their budgets, canceling expensive trips and postponing big-ticket purchases, but treated themselves to an indulgent meal, coffee or dessert.</p>\n<p>Brinker's reported 23% growth in its hourly restaurant staff between fiscal years 2024 and 2025, according to <org>SEC</org> filings, though it indicated that a growing share of its employees were part-time. </p>\n<p>Darden, the parent company of sit-down restaurants like Olive Garden and <org>LongHorn Steakhouse</org>, increased staff for fiscal 2025 by about 3.8%.</p>\n<p>Most national restaurant chains are franchised and do not report total employment figures among franchisees, but Chipotle and Starbucks, which operate the majority of their own stores, reported slight declines in total headcount for fiscal year 2025. </p>\n<p>While cascades of tariff announcements have forced other industries to raise prices and reroute sourcing, restaurant owners have only faced the tariffs impacting narrow categories like cup packaging and Chinese Sichuan peppers. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p> (Reporting by <person>Waylon Cunningham</person>; Editing by <person>Sayantani Ghosh</person> and <person>Nick Zieminski</person>)</p>\n",

This is a premium to the five-year mean of 18x, which we think is warranted given the company's strong pipeline for store expansion. Q4 results were a bit underwhelming, particularly the 1.5% same-store sales growth, a notable deceleration from previous quarters. However, L did manage to alleviate some fears, noting a tough Y/Y comp (last year benefited from more promo activity) and an acceleration in growth through Q4 and into Q1. However, there is some weakness in certain categories like liquor and tobacco, which is weighing on overall growth. L guides for high-single-digit EPS growth, which we think could be a bit conservative given the somewhat consistent double-digit EPS growth over the past several years. L continues to open new stores (another year of about 70+), with a focus on discount banners as Canadians increasingly flock towards more value-oriented stores.

We are also constructive on margin expansion in coffee next year, supported by lower commodity costs and the recent removal of coffee tariffs. Core brands such as Uncrustables, <org>Cafe Bustelo</org>, Meow Mix, and Milk-Bone continue to perform well. Oversight from Elliott Management could help unlock incremental shareholder value.

But first, Republicans in the deeply conservative state must settle on who they want to represent them in November's general election. </p>\n<p>Public opinion polls show Senator <person>John Cornyn</person>, in office since 2002, trailing two challengers - <location value=\"LS/us.tx\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Texas</location> Attorney General <person>Ken Paxton</person> and U.S. Representative <person>Wesley Hunt</person> - in <location value=\"LS/us.tx\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Texas'</location> most cutthroat contest.</p>\n<p>Unlike in <location value=\"LS/us.la\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Louisiana</location>, where Trump encouraged a challenge to the incumbent Republican senator, the president has let the Texans duke it out in a contest made personal with accusations of sexual affairs and political ineffectiveness.</p>\n<p>Republican candidates in the <org>Senate</org> and some House races are expected to attend Trump's event on Friday.</p>\n<p>CAN FORCED REDISTRICTING RESCUE REPUBLICANS?</p>\n<p>At the president's urging last year, <location value=\"LS/us.tx\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Texas</location> Republicans launched a redistricting fight aimed at improving the party's prospects in U.S. House races. With the new map in effect, Republicans could gain up to five more seats across the state. </p>\n<p>Hispanic voters in south <location value=\"LS/us.tx\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Texas</location> are key to the party's electoral success, said <location value=\"LU/us.tx.corsti\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Corpus Christi's</location> state Senator <person>Adam Hinojosa</person>, the first Republican to represent the <location>Rio Grande Valley</location> in the <org>Texas Senate</org> since 1874.</p>\n<p>&quot;We need the job opportunities, we need to make sure that our families are taken care of, we need to be able to afford all of the groceries and things to have a decent lifestyle,&quot; Hinojosa said in an interview.</p>\n<p>Crediting Trump's border policy and pro-oil agenda, Hinojosa said he thought the president's visit would help energize the Republican base.</p>\n<p>Trump has prioritized maximizing U.S. fossil fuel production by rolling back environmental regulations and streamlining permitting for energy projects, benefiting places like southern <location value=\"LS/us.tx\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Texas</location>.</p>\n<p>Even so, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 36% of people nationwide approved of Trump's handling of the economy while 56% disapproved. </p>\n<p>\"It's hard to know if he is perceptive to economic concerns,&quot; <person>Tiffany Ritchie</person>, 50, a self-declared independent in <location value=\"LU/us.tx.corsti\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Corpus Christi</location>, said in an interview, noting she voted for Trump for the first time in the 2024 presidential election. &quot;I would like to think he is, however, he is the kind of character who will just kind of throw anything against the wall and see if it sticks.\"</p>\n<p>Republicans are targeting two Democratic-held border districts: the <location value=\"LU/us.tx.brwnsv\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Brownsville</location>-area seat represented by <person>Vicente Gonzalez</person> since 2016, and the <location value=\"LU/us.tx.laredo\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Laredo</location>-area seat held by 11-term Representative <person>Henry Cuellar</person>.</p>\n<p>In December, Trump pardoned Cuellar and his wife, but has since backed local Republican judge <person>Tano Tijerina</person>, accusing Cuellar of an &quot;act of disloyalty&quot; for seeking re-election as a Democrat.</p>\n<p>\"If Donald Trump wants to remind South Texans how terrible the economy is, he can be our guest,\" <person>Madison Andrus</person>, spokesperson for the Democrats' campaign arm, said in a statement. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p> (Reporting by <person>Bo Erickson</person>, <person>Jarrett Renshaw</person> and <person>Nolan McCaskill</person>; Editing by <person>Colleen Jenkins</person> and <person>Chris Reese</person>)</p>\n",

            "description": "<p><location value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >NEW YORK</location>, <chron>Feb 27</chron> (Reuters) - On paper, American consumers spent last year tightening their belts, and even retail heavyweights stumbled. But sit-down restaurants and some drive-through chains buzzed with patrons seeking a special treat or cheap comfort food.</p>\n<p>Their upbeat sales made the U.S. restaurant industry a rare bright spot for jobs, with restaurant payrolls ticking up 1% last year, adding about 108,000 jobs, according to the <org>Bureau of Labor Statistics</org>. </p>\n<p>In contrast, the overall U.S. economy added 181,000 non-farm jobs in 2025, marking the weakest annual payroll growth in 20 years outside a recession year.</p>\n<p>Success among restaurants was not evenly spread, though.</p>\n<p>Corporate filings show that eateries such as <org value=\"EAT.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Brinker's</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='EAT' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( EAT )</span> <org value=\"EAT.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Chili's</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='EAT' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( EAT )</span>, <org value=\"YUM.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Yum Brands'</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='YUM' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( YUM )</span> <org>Taco Bell</org> and fast-growing coffee chain <org value=\"BROS.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Dutch Bros</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BROS' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BROS )</span> lured customers by aggressively marketing bundled deals, leaning into digital innovation and limited-time offers, and focusing on high-margin, Instagrammable food. </p>\n<p>But previous darlings like Chipotle and <org value=\"CAVA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Cava</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='CAVA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( CAVA )</span> were hurt by what analysts call the &quot;slop-bowl fatigue&quot; -  growing weariness among younger consumers with high-priced, customizable grain or salad bowls. </p>\n<p><location value=\"LU/us.az.tempe\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Tempe, Arizona</location>-based <org value=\"BROS.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Dutch Bros</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BROS' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BROS )</span> and its franchisees added roughly 8,000 employees in the last two years, a 33% increase, the company said. </p>\n<p>&quot;We have a healthy pipeline of growth,&quot; CEO <person>Christine Barone</person> told Reuters after the company's earnings in February. The brand, which serves customizable beverages, is a hit with younger consumers, Barone said.  </p>\n<p>A similar story is playing out at another chain that, like <org value=\"BROS.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Dutch Bros</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BROS' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BROS )</span>, sells more treats than meals.</p>\n<p>Ice cream chain Whit's Frozen Custard has grown its payroll by up to 40% a year for the past two years, said owner <person>Bill Aseere</person>, to keep up with rapid growth. It now has stores in 93 locations across 10 states and some 15 to 20 employees per store. </p>\n<p>Amanda Wang, co-founder of fast-growing Chinese beverage chain Ningji Lemon Tea - part of a tidal wave of Chinese tea brands coming to the U.S. - said her chain's new restaurants in the U.S. were buoyed by demand among price-weary consumers for affordable indulgences. </p>\n<p>Tea &quot;offers that little bit of happiness,&quot; she said.</p>\n<p>As a whole, the restaurant industry grew payrolls even as it weathers depressed traffic and rising labor costs, analysts say, thanks in part to menu price increases. Menu prices at restaurants grew 4.1% in 2025 compared to grocery inflation of 2.3%, according to the <org>Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</org>. </p>\n<p>DIVERGING FORTUNES</p>\n<p>A deeper look at 2025 payroll data shows the difference in fortunes between types of restaurants: staff headcount at snack and non-alcoholic beverage restaurants grew 3.6% in 2025 and those at sit-down restaurants rose 1%. But fast-food payrolls grew only 0.4%, while cafeterias and buffet payrolls shrank 3.9%. </p>\n<p>&quot;At the end of the day, people want go out to eat and celebrate those big occasions,&quot; said <person>Chad Moutray</person>, an economist at the <org>National Restaurant Association</org>, referring to resilient spending at sit-down restaurants. </p>\n<p>&quot;Consumers might be pulling back from vacations, but they still prioritize eating out.&quot;</p>\n<p>The payroll data and Moutray's comments underscore what the industry calls the &quot;lipstick effect&quot; - consumers tightened their budgets, canceling expensive trips and postponing big-ticket purchases, but treated themselves to an indulgent meal, coffee or dessert.</p>\n<p><org value=\"EAT.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Brinker's</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='EAT' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( EAT )</span> reported 23% growth in its hourly restaurant staff between fiscal years 2024 and 2025, according to <org>SEC</org> filings, though it indicated that a growing share of its employees were part-time. </p>\n<p>Darden, the parent company of sit-down restaurants like <org value=\"DRI.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Olive Garden</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='DRI' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( DRI )</span> and <org>LongHorn Steakhouse</org>, increased staff for fiscal 2025 by about 3.8%.</p>\n<p>Most national restaurant chains are franchised and do not report total employment figures among franchisees, but Chipotle and <org value=\"SBUX.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Starbucks</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='SBUX' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( SBUX )</span>, which operate the majority of their own stores, reported slight declines in total headcount for fiscal year 2025. </p>\n<p>While cascades of tariff announcements have forced other industries to raise prices and reroute sourcing, restaurant owners have only faced the tariffs impacting narrow categories like cup packaging and Chinese Sichuan peppers. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p> (Reporting by <person>Waylon Cunningham</person>; Editing by <person>Sayantani Ghosh</person> and <person>Nick Zieminski</person>)</p>\n",

Customers only pay a fraction of realized gains based on P&amp;L impact.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Chapter 1: Outcome Based Pricing (OBP)</b>\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\n<b>Introduction of OBP: </b>HighRadius, a provider of 190+ AI agents for Order-to-Cash, Accounts Payable, Record-to-Report, and Treasury introduces Outcome Based Pricing (OBP).\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Three Components of OBP: </b>Customers pay a) <money>$0</money> in Implementation fees, b) <money>$0</money> in Subscription fees until Go Live, c) HighRadius earns a fraction of the actual savings realized by the client.\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\n<b>Chapter 2: US GAAP &amp; ASC 606 Constraints</b>\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\n<b>Not Designed for Innovation: </b>The traditional ASC 606 model requires companies to standardize and recognize revenue based on contractual obligations. For a traditional SaaS subscription, the obligation is access to software over time. AI agents are designed to deliver quantifiable, real-time Business Outcomes that do not fit the traditional accounting framework.\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\n<b>Chapter 3: Controlled Group Experiment</b>\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\n<b>HighRadius’ stress-testing for Gain share model: </b>HighRadius did not arrive at Outcome-Based Pricing through theory alone. The model was stress-tested through a controlled 24-month experiment to see if alignment on Business Outcomes increased the probability of success. Stress-testing consisted of two main groups:\n<ul class=\"bwlistcircle\">\n<li>\n<b>Group 1 (MASC established): </b>Customers went through an alignment on Business Outcomes via a formal Mutually Agreed Success Criteria document (MASC) with measurable Baseline and Target metrics, and a client Exec has to sign-off for successful completion of the project.\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Group 2 (No MASC established): </b>Customers onboarded without MASC went through an implementation and enhancement loop leading to frustration on both sides.\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Final Verdict: </b>The answer was clear, buyers cared only about Business Outcomes being achieved. They didn't care about the vendor's implementation methodology.\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\n<b>Chapter 4: Tech Companies Vendor Lock-In</b>\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\n<b>Vendor Lock-in</b>: CFOs and CIOs have lost trust in the current subscription model with the risk of being locked in by the vendor’s long implementation cycles, no alignment on success criteria, ever changing requirements etc. With sunk cost investments and high switching costs, the customer is effectively held hostage, now officially called Vendor lock-in.\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>IT Services Change Order Scam</b>: The IT services industry as well as Professional Services arm of software companies have Professional Services revenue as Bonus goals. This is a complete conflict of interest to the customer. There is a lot of friction with budget overflows and change orders. With the elimination of implementation fees to <money>$0</money> in OBP, this conflict is fully eliminated and both parties have shared goals.\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Structural misalignment:</b> Vendors get paid for access, not outcomes. Less than 40% of software buyers report being satisfied with the value delivered relative to the cost they pay.\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Antidote to Vendor Lock-In</b>: Outcome-Based Pricing is the antidote. When the earnings are tied directly to the impact on a customer's P&amp;L, the dynamics of conflict is eliminated and both are incentivised for a shared goal.\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\n<b>Chapter 5: About HighRadius</b>\n\n</p><p>\nHighRadius provides a single Agentic AI platform for the <org>Office of the CFO</org>. It integrates 190+ agents that orchestrate end-to-end processes across Order-to-Cash, Close &amp; Reconciliation, Consolidation &amp; Reporting, Accounts Payable, B2B Payments, and Treasury.

PNTR was first granted in 2000, allowing <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> to join the <org>World Trade Organization</org>, a move that catapulted the country into becoming the world's biggest manufacturer.</p>\n<p>Since his <chron>inauguration day</chron> order, Trump imposed new tariffs on Chinese imports that reached as high as 145% last year, but that had been reduced to around 20% through a series of trade negotiations before the <org>Supreme Court</org> last week ruled Trump's emergency tariffs illegal. </p>\n<p>Trump's punitive <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> duties sit on top of the normal &quot;Most Favored Nation&quot; duties of about 2.5% that prevailed before he launched a trade war on <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> during his first term, imposing tariffs of about 25% on most Chinese imports.</p>\n<p>Revoking PNTR would raise the base MFN rates, adding to whatever punitive duties Trump imposes to replace the illegal emergency tariffs under other trade authorities. </p>\n<p>The USITC, which studies trade and competitiveness matters and rules on anti-dumping and anti-subsidy trade cases, said its report would focus on U.S. trade, production and prices in the industries that could be directly and most affected by increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to the higher non-MFN rates.</p>\n<p>The panel said it would also examine an alternative scenario where <org>Congress</org> revokes PNTR treatment with a five-year phase-in of a subset of tariffs on products important for national security.</p>\n<p>The USITC said the public was invited to file written comments on the implications of raising these tariffs on Chinese imports, through the close of business on <chron>April 13</chron>. Due to the accelerated timeline, the commission said it does not plan to hold a public hearing.</p>\n<p>(Reporting by <person>David Lawder</person>, <person>Daphne Psaledakis</person> and <person>Bhargav Acharya</person>; Editing by <person>David Ljunggren</person> and <person>Mark Porter</person>)</p>\n",

reference to certain non-IFRS measures including key performance indicators used by management and typically used by our competitors in the SaaS industry. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS. These non-IFRS measures are used to provide investors with alternative measures of our operating performance and liquidity and thus highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures, including SaaS industry metrics, in the evaluation of companies in the SaaS industry. Management also uses non-IFRS measures to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, the preparation of annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of executive compensation. The non-IFRS measures referred to in this press release include “Annual Recurring Revenue”, “Average Contract Value”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted Net Income”, “Adjusted Earnings per Share - Basic and Diluted”, “Working Capital” and “Free Cash Flow”.\n\n</p><p>\n<b><i>Key Performance Indicators</i></b>\n\n</p><p>\nWe recognize subscription revenues ratably over the term of the subscription period under the provisions of our agreements with customers. The terms of our agreements, combined with high customer retention rates, provides us with a significant degree of visibility into our near-term revenues. Management uses a number of metrics, including the ones identified below, to measure the Company’s performance and customer trends, which are used to prepare financial plans and shape future strategy. Our key performance indicators may be calculated in a manner different than similar key performance indicators used by other companies.\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\n<i>Annual Recurring Revenue:</i> We define Annual Recurring Revenue as the annualized equivalent value of the subscription revenue of all existing contracts (including Original Equipment Manufacturer contracts) as at the date being measured, excluding non-recurring revenues from implementation, support and maintenance fees. Our customers generally enter into annual or multi-year contracts which are non-cancellable or cancellable with penalty. Accordingly, our calculation of Annual Recurring Revenue assumes that customers will renew the contractual commitments on a periodic basis as those commitments come up for renewal. Subscription agreements may be subject to price increases upon renewal reflecting both inflationary increases and the additional value provided by our solutions. In addition to the expected increase in subscription revenue from price increases over time, existing customers may subscribe for additional features, learners or services during the term. We believe that this measure provides a fair real-time measure of performance in a subscription-based environment. Annual Recurring Revenue provides us with visibility for consistent and predictable growth to our cash flows. Our strong total revenue growth coupled with increasing Annual Recurring Revenue indicates the continued strength in the expansion of our business and will continue to be our focus on a go-forward
