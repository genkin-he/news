We now forecast GAAP EPS of <money>$7.25</money> for 2025 (from <money>$6.92</money>; includes one-time items from Q3), <money>$7.83</money> for 2026 (unchanged), and <money>$9.77</money> for 2027 (from <money>$9.87</money>). AWS concerns should ease with revenue growth accelerating to 20% Y/Y (from 17% in Q2), putting AWS at a <money>$132B</money> annualized run-rate business (vs. <money>$40B</money> in 2019). Further acceleration is likely amid heavy capex investments, a <money>$200B</money> backlog (excludes new wins from October), and the ramp of Project Rainier, a massive AI compute cluster built for Anthropic. Reflecting this, we lift our capex forecasts to <money>$126B</money> from <money>$117B</money> for 2025 and to <money>$140B</money> from <money>$126B</money> for 2026. In e-commerce, we see ample room for further efficiency gains, especially with automation/robotics. 22In digital ads, where growth has now accelerated for three quarters (from 17.7% in Q1 to 23.5% in Q3), we see AMZN's full-funnel advertising approach lifting more share gains.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We trim our 12-month target to <money>$255</money> from <money>$265</money>, valuing shares at 33.1x our 2026 EPS of <money>$7.70</money>. We raise our 2025 EPS estimate to <money>$6.97</money> from <money>$6.90</money>. RSG reported Q3 EPS of <money>$1.90</money>, beating consensus by <money>$0.12</money>, supported by 6% core pricing that outpaced cost inflation and solid operational execution. Revenue grew 3.3% Y/Y despite 0.3% volume declines, with collection services contributing 67% of total revenue and landfill operations delivering strong 13.9% net revenue growth. Labor disruption from the <org>Teamsters Union</org> dispute created headwinds but did not prevent margin expansion, as adjusted EBITDA margin widened 80 bps to 32.8%. The company expects revenue to approach the low end of its full-year guidance range. With recycled commodity prices averaging <money>$126</money> per ton (down <money>$51</money> from the prior year), we believe RSG's earlier targets appear less viable, explaining management's cautious guidance as pricing pressures from lower commodity values continue to weigh on near-term performance expectations.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

            "description": "\n<p>(Reuters) -The U.S. central bank should not have cut interest rates this week and should not do so again in December, Dallas Federal Reserve President <person>Lorie Logan</person> said on Friday, citing a 'balanced' labor market in no immediate need of support and inflation that looks likely to stay above policymakers' 2% goal for too long. </p>\n<p>&quot;This economic outlook didn't call for cutting rates,&quot; Logan said in remarks prepared for delivery to a Dallas Fed banking conference. &quot;I did not see a need to cut rates this week. And I'd find it difficult to cut rates again in December unless there is clear evidence that inflation will fall faster than expected or that the labor market will cool more rapidly.&quot;</p>\n<p>Logan's remarks follow the Fed's decision on Wednesday to lower its policy rate for a second time this year by a quarter of a percentage point to what is now a range of 3.75%-4.00%. Fed Chair <person>Jerome Powell</person> said the move was aimed at preventing the labor market from slowing further.</p>\n<p>Another rate cut in December, he said, is not a foregone conclusion, particularly given the lack of official economic data including measures of inflation and unemployment while the federal government shutdown continues. </p>\n<p>Logan, who does not have a vote on the Fed's policy-setting committee this year, said that private-sector data, state-level unemployment claims, and the Fed's own network of business and community contacts do give the central bank visibility into the economy, and the picture is far from troubling.</p>\n<p>Consumer spending has slowed but still exceeds the longer-run trend; stock-market gains are fueling demand from wealthier households; large companies are &quot;enthusiastically&quot; putting money into artificial intelligence and data centers; lower-income households and smaller companies are faring less well but still are stable, she said.</p>\n<p>&quot;The risks to the labor market do lie mainly to the downside,&quot; Logan said, adding that she has a close eye on recent layoff announcements, and noting that a sudden drop in the stock market and a longer-than-expected government shutdown could pose risks to spending and economic activity. &quot;The remaining risks to employment are ones we can monitor closely and respond to if they are becoming more likely to materialize, not ones that currently warrant further preemptive action.&quot;</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, she said, inflation - though not at an emergency level - is still too high and too slow to return to the Fed's 2% goal. &quot;Our obligation to the public is to deliver on this commitment,&quot; she said.</p>\n<p>Logan said she supported the Fed's decision this week to stop shrinking its balance sheet, saying that elevated money market rates show the balance sheet is much closer to its normal size. Indeed, she said, if the recent rise in rates on overnight repurchase agreements for Treasuries proves not to be temporary, the Fed will need to restart asset purchases to keep bank reserves ample.</p>\n<p>She reiterated her view that the Fed should stop targeting the fed funds rate, an outdated target in her view, and should move to targeting a repo rate like the tri-party general collateral rate.</p>\n<p>(Reporting by <person>Ann Saphir</person>; Editing by <person>Paul Simao</person>)</p>\n",

The release introduces generative AI features that transform how interior design and home remodeling professionals bring client ideas to life.</p>  <p align=\"justify\">With the new AI Hub, designers can:</p>  <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Convert images to 3D models: Upload a photo of any furniture and generate a ready-to-use 3D model in seconds, creating an effectively infinite catalog.</li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">AI-Enhance: Improve rendering quality with AI-assisted post-processing for more realistic visuals.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt; text-align:justify;\">AI-Restyle: Apply popular design styles or custom prompts to existing renderings, enabling instant variations without re-modeling.<br/><br/></li></ul>  <p align=\"justify\">“AI Hub is about giving designers superpowers,” said <person>Vikas Kaushal</person>, co-founder of Foyr. “Homeowners increasingly expect their Pinterest or retail inspirations to come to life exactly as they imagine them.

The company plans to introduce agentic AI workflows over the next six months, building on its generative AI foundation.</p>  <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Availability</strong></p>  <p align=\"justify\">The AI Hub is now available to all Foyr Neo users.

Fed Governor <person>Stephen Miran</person> also dissented, but in favor of a larger cut of a half point.</p>\n<p>A cut, however, &quot;could have a longer lasting effect on inflation if the Fed's commitment to its 2% inflation target comes into question,&quot; Schmid said.</p>\n<p>Though the ongoing federal government shutdown has stopped the flow of official data, recent reports suggest the Fed's preferred measure of inflation is increasing at about a 2.8% annual pace.</p>\n<p>Schmid said contacts in his midwestern district express &quot;widespread concern overcontinued cost increases and inflation. Rising healthcare costs and insurance premiums are top ofmind. In the data, inflation is spreading across categories, both goods and services.&quot; </p>\n<p>&quot;The economy is showing continued momentum,&quot; Schmid said. &quot;With inflation still too high, monetary policy should lean against demand growth...and relieve price pressures in the economy.&quot;</p>\n<p>Current policy, he said, is only &quot;modestly restrictive,&quot; while the labor market &quot;is largely in balance.&quot;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(Editing by <person>Chizu Nomiyama</person> )</p>\n",
