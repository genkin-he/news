            "description": "<p>(Reuters) -Bitcoin on Friday was on track for a monthly loss in October for the first time since 2018, snapping a seven-year streak of gains that had earned the month a lucky reputation among cryptocurrency traders. </p>\n<p>Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, is set for a nearly 5% decline this month, as the digital asset has struggled in recent weeks amid broader market jitters and muted investor risk appetite. </p>\n<p>Cryptocurrencies &quot;came into October, tracking gold, tracking stocks near all-time highs, and then as uncertainty hit people for the first time maybe this year, they didn't rotate back into bitcoin en masse,&quot; said <person>Adam McCarthy</person>, a senior research analyst at digital market data provider Kaiko.</p>\n<p>October saw the largest crypto liquidation in history after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff on Chinese imports and threatened export controls on critical software.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin fell as low as <money>$104,782.88</money> during the <chron>October 10-11</chron> period, after setting a fresh record high just days earlier above <money>$126,000</money>. </p>\n<p>&quot;That washout on the 10th, it really reminded people that this asset class is very narrow,&quot; said McCarthy. &quot;It's bitcoin and (ether), and even those can still have 10% drawdowns in 15, 20 minutes.&quot;</p>\n<p>A whirlwind October is set to end with spooked investors unsure of the global monetary policy path in the near term, as the U.S. Federal Reserve pushed back against market bets that it would continue to cut rates this year as the government shutdown blocks crucial economic data.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, several influential figures have expressed concerns about high valuations in equity markets. JPMorgan Chase CEO <person>Jamie Dimon</person> earlier this month warned of a heightened risk of a significant correction in the U.S. stock market within the next six months to two years.</p>\n<p>Despite its October decline, bitcoin is still up more than 16% so far this year. </p>\n<p>Cryptocurrencies have generally enjoyed a boost this year as Trump has embraced digital assets, which has led to the dismissal of a spate of lawsuits against prominent crypto platforms and a shift by Trump's financial regulators to create specialized rules to accommodate digital assets.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p> (Reporting by <person>Hannah Lang</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >New York</location>; Editing by <person>Lisa Shumaker</person>)</p>\n",

Both were trading higher intraday Friday.</p><p>Monthly oil prices have declined since August amid uncertainty driven by global conflicts and US trade policies, while supply of the key commodity climbed. The overall surplus averaged 1.9 million barrels a day from January through September, according to the <org>International Energy Agency</org>.</p><p>The Trump administration on <chron>Oct. 22</chron> announced sanctions on two of <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia's</location> largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, citing the country's &quot;lack of serious commitment to a peace process&quot; to end the war in <location value=\"LC/ua\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Ukraine</location>.</p><p>Russian crude is trading at a discount of <money>$13.4</money> per barrel against dated Brent free-on-board, compared with a <money>$12.55</money> discount two weeks ago, Kpler Senior Crude Oil Analyst <person>Muyu Xu</person> said via email. However, if <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington's</location> target is to completely cut off Russian oil exports, that seems unlikely, Xu told MT Newswires.</p><p>&quot;Sellers and traders will almost certainly find ways to circumvent the sanctions, while some buyers will be tempted to lift the cargoes if prices fall low enough,&quot; Xu said.</p><p>Indian Oil will continue purchasing Russian crude as long as the state-owned refiner complies with sanctions, Finance Director <person>Anuj Jain</person> said on an investor call.</p><p>Tensions between the US and <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> flared up recently after <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location> expanded export controls on rare earths, but the standoff eased as leaders of the two countries met in <location value=\"LC/kr\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >South Korea</location> on Thursday.

That &quot;puts a bearish shadow on benchmark prices,&quot; Shah said.</p><p>The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark policy rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday, in line with economists' expectations. During a post-meeting press conference, Fed Chair <person>Jerome Powell</person> mentioned the lack of official economic data because of the ongoing US government shutdown, which has dragged on for a month.</p><p>The Federal Open Market Committee's decision was seen as &quot;supportive for short- and medium-term demand and global growth sentiment,&quot; Rystad Energy Chief Economist <person>Claudio Galimberti</person> said in a note. That's offering a &quot;tailwind to commodities sensitive to economic activity.&quot;</p><p>Sparta's Goh sees support ahead for oil prices.</p><p>&quot;With prompt crude timespreads firmly in backwardation and oil demand to rise particularly in December with refineries back from maintenance season, Brent should remain comfortably above (<money>$60</money> per barrel) range.&quot;</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We trim our 12-month target  by <money>$7</money> to <money>$33</money>, applying an EV/EBITDA multiple of 5.7x to our 2026 estimate, a discount to its three-year historical average multiple at 6.5x. We lower our 2025 EPS estimate by <money>$0.10</money> to <money>$4.22</money> and cut 2026's by <money>$0.50</money> to <money>$4.29</money>. The company cited several near-term headwinds, including the negative EBITDA impact from broadband repositioning, the onboarding of new NBA sports rights (introduces upfront dilution), and the spin-off of VERSANT, which will affect both EBITDA and free cash flow in the short term. The broadband environment remains intensely competitive, and this is not expected to change soon. Business Services also faces elevated competition, particularly from fixed wireless alternatives, affecting growth and requiring ongoing investment. Finally, the shift toward simplified, transparent pricing and increased promotional activity (including free wireless lines) is causing revenue dilution.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We increase our 12-month target by <money>$15</money> to <money>$110</money>, based on a 2026 P/E of 13.0x, a justified discount to APTV's 10-year forward P/E multiple of 23.8x. We raise our adjusted EPS estimates to <money>$7.90</money> from <money>$7.55</money> for '25, to <money>$8.45</money> from <money>$8.25</money> for '26, and introduce '27 at <money>$9.15</money>. Following APTV's big Q3 beat, we reiterate our Strong Buy on the shares, as APTV screens as one of the best earnings growth stories in the auto supplier space. We see EPS growth supported by its record new business awards of <money>$31B</money> in 2024 (its third straight year of $30B+ in new business wins), with EPS boosted by share count reduction from buybacks (its weighted average shares outstanding were down 12% Y/Y in Q3), which should help generate superior EPS growth relative to auto supplier peers. While shares are down slightly on the weaker-than-expected Q4 guidance, we believe these concerns are overblown, noting management's long history of providing conservative guidance, and like APTV's exposure to higher-growth segments of the industry.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy &#8220;fractional shares,&#8221; which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to &#8220;go short&#8221; a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource.  Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading &#8211; either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>\n",
