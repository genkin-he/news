Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We raise our 12-month target by <money>$2</money> to <money>$146</money>, representing 23.9x our 2026 EPS estimate, a premium to EXPD's five-year historical forward average of 21.1x. We lift our 2026 EPS view by <money>$0.10</money> to <money>$6.11</money> and our 2027 EPS view by <money>$0.04</money> to <money>$6.54</money>. EXPD delivered mixed Q4 results with EPS falling 11.3% to <money>$1.49</money> (+2.4% vs. consensus) and revenue falling 3.3% to <money>$2.9B</money> (+0.8% vs. consensus), reflecting freight market bifurcation as ocean revenues plummeted 33% to <money>$611M</money> while airfreight grew 4% to <money>$1.1B</money>. Looking forward, the ocean freight market faces deteriorating conditions as the anticipated oversupply crisis materializes, while air cargo capacity constraints are expected to limit growth despite steady demand in 2026. Our sales forecast anticipates 1.0% revenue growth in 2026 as ocean market softness persists, followed by acceleration to 3.5% in 2027 and 3.4% in 2028, resulting in a 2.6% three-year CAGR through 2028. We maintain our view that financially strained consumers are likely to pull back on their spending habits.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

In 2025 alone, the number jumped to 135, with about 16% of them complaints about issues such as shipment delays and increased regulatory burdens. The rate of complaints nearly doubled in early 2026.</p>\n<p>The actual number of queries from exporters is likely to be  orders of magnitude larger as there are several private channels these companies can use, including contacting provincial and municipal commerce bureaux, many of which do not have public query platforms like the central government's commerce ministry.</p>\n<p>The official responses to the queries from Chinese exporters have been vague and formulaic, stopping short of confirming whether any individual product, from rare-earth magnets to medical materials, required a licence.</p>\n<p>The enforcement push is also legal and bureaucratic. Since <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> enacted its Export Control Law in <chron>October 2020</chron>, it has introduced or expanded export control measures 29 times, compared to just six times between 2015-2020.</p>\n<p>Recruitment documents show 45 commerce ministry posts available in this year's national civil-service examination could be assigned to export-control-related work, compared with 11 such vacancies in both 2022 and 2023. </p>\n<p>Dozens of provincial and municipal governments have organised compliance seminars and policy briefings over the past year, while <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location> has convened national export-control work conferences bringing officials from across the country to the capital.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing's</location> <chron>October 2025</chron> revision to its rare-earth export-control regime reflected lessons from the U.S. Foreign Direct Product Rule, which allows <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location> to assert jurisdiction over certain foreign-made goods produced with American technology.</p>\n<p>&quot;<location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China's</location> use of rare earths as leverage is completely learned from the West - especially the U.S.,&quot; said <person>Li Xing</person>, professor at the <org>Guangdong Institute for International Strategies</org>, a think tank in <location value=\"LU/cn..gngzhu\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Guangzhou</location>. </p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> dominates the processing of rare earths, the conversion of ore into refined oxides and metals used in electric vehicles, wind turbines and defence systems, a chokepoint deeper in the supply chain than mining itself. </p>\n<p>Its new licensing system reaches into processing and downstream incorporation.</p>\n<p>&quot;This is not just a supply chain shortage. This is economic warfare,&quot; said <person>Nick Myers</person>, chief executive of U.S. rare-earth startup Phoenix Tailings.</p>\n<p>PACE OF U.S. EXPORT CONTROLS SLOWS</p>\n<p>During Trump's first term and under President <person>Joe Biden</person>, <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location> rapidly expanded export controls targeting <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>.</p>\n<p>Annual <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>-related additions to the Entity List, which requires U.S. exporters to obtain licences, often reviewed under a presumption of denial, surged from 47 in 2018 to 227 in 2020, reaching a record 257 in 2024, according to a Reuters analysis.  </p>\n<p>Since Trump's return to office, that trajectory has reversed. <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>-related Entity List additions fell to 131 in 2025, roughly half the previous year's pace.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, the Pentagon briefly published, then withdrew, an updated Military End User list that would have added Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Baidu while removing a couple of memory chipmakers.</p>\n<p>The <org>White House</org> and the <org>U.S. Commerce Department's</org> <org>Bureau of Industry and Security</org> did not respond to requests for comment.

PNTR was first granted in 2000, allowing <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> to join the <org>World Trade Organization</org>, a move that catapulted the country into becoming the world's biggest manufacturer.</p>\n<p>Since his <chron>inauguration day</chron> order, Trump imposed new tariffs on Chinese imports that reached as high as 145% last year, but that had been reduced to around 20% through a series of trade negotiations before the <org>Supreme Court</org> last week ruled Trump's emergency tariffs illegal. </p>\n<p>Trump's punitive <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> duties sit on top of the normal &quot;Most Favored Nation&quot; duties of about 2.5% that prevailed before he launched a trade war on <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> during his first term, imposing tariffs of about 25% on most Chinese imports.</p>\n<p>Revoking PNTR would raise the base MFN rates, adding to whatever punitive duties Trump imposes to replace the illegal emergency tariffs under other trade authorities. </p>\n<p>The USITC, which studies trade and competitiveness matters and rules on anti-dumping and anti-subsidy trade cases, said its report would focus on U.S. trade, production and prices in the industries that could be directly and most affected by increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to the higher non-MFN rates.</p>\n<p>The panel said it would also examine an alternative scenario where <org>Congress</org> revokes PNTR treatment with a five-year phase-in of a subset of tariffs on products important for national security.</p>\n<p>The USITC said the public was invited to file written comments on the implications of raising these tariffs on Chinese imports, through the close of business on <chron>April 13</chron>. Due to the accelerated timeline, the commission said it does not plan to hold a public hearing.</p>\n<p>(Reporting by <person>David Lawder</person>, <person>Daphne Psaledakis</person> and <person>Bhargav Acharya</person>; Editing by <person>David Ljunggren</person> and <person>Mark Porter</person>)</p>\n",

State oil giant PDVSA is selling the crude produced under the contracts while they are suspended, they added.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LU/ve..caracs\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Caracas</location> and <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location> would review the contracts and may recommend revoking some of them, the sources said. The Venezuelan and U.S. governments are reviewing the credentials of the companies that signed them, the sources added. Some of the companies are little-known and the deals were signed while <location value=\"LC/ve\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Venezuela</location> was under U.S. sanctions.</p>\n<p>The contracts under review include projects that recently began producing oil in challenging areas such as <location>Lake Maracaibo</location>, big ventures that aim to expand output in the Orinoco Belt, <location value=\"LC/ve\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Venezuela's</location> main oil region, and small mature oilfields.</p>\n<p>Maduro's administration had little success securing investment through the production-sharing contract model as large oil players rejected a return to <location value=\"LC/ve\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Venezuela</location> after expropriations or avoided doing business with it due to U.S. sanctions.</p>\n<p>The players that took on production-sharing contracts included Chinese, U.S., South American and Venezuelan firms, as well as some companies registered in tax haven countries, and some obtained contracts in multiple areas, according to a list seen by Reuters.</p>\n<p>Some of the companies also outsourced the oilfields to contractors, two of the sources said.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >The United States</location> captured Maduro in January and took control of <location value=\"LC/ve\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Venezuela's</location> oil exports and sales. Since then, the <org>U.S. Treasury Department</org> has issued general licenses that allow companies to trade <location value=\"LC/ve\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Venezuela's</location> oil and to operate in the country's oil and gas sectors, but require specific clearance by the <org>Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control</org>.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/ve\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Venezuela's</location> <org>National Assembly</org> passed a reform to the country's hydrocarbon law in late January to facilitate foreign investment in the dilapidated oil industry.
