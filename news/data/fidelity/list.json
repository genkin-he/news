Following the earnings report and 2026 guidance, we maintain our Buy rating. We now increase our target price to <money>CAD283</money> from <money>CAD272</money>, valuing shares based on an average of 13x our 2027 EBITDA estimate and 22x our 2027 EPS view.

In our view, valuation is very attractive relative to peers as the EBITDA and earnings multiples are severely depressed. We are confident in WSP's offerings and its ability to generate compounding cash flows, particularly at its current valuation, due to recent deals like the USA Rare Earth agreement as well as strong free cash flow generation.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

Some components,\nincluding domestic airfares and healthcare, which go into the\ncalculation of the Personal Consumption Expenditures price\nindexes, the inflation measures tracked by the U.S. central bank\nfor its 2% target, increased solidly last month.</p>\n<p>Economists continued to expect that the so-called core PCE\ninflation, excluding the volatile food and energy components,\nmaintained a strong pace of increase in January.</p>\n<p>&quot;Wider margins for producers could add some upside for\nconsumer costs in coming months as firms pass along higher costs\nfor services,&quot; said <person>Ben Ayers</person>, senior economist at Nationwide.\n&quot;Given still-buoyant core inflation and the recent firming of\njob gains, we expect the Fed to remain on pause during its\nupcoming March meeting.&quot;</p>\n<p>The PPI for final demand rose 0.5% last month after\nadvancing by a downwardly revised 0.4% in December, the <org>Labor\nDepartment's</org> <org>Bureau of Labor Statistics</org> said. Economists polled\nby Reuters had forecast the PPI gaining 0.3% after a previously\nreported 0.5% increase in December.</p>\n<p>In the 12 months through January, the PPI increased 2.9%\nafter rising 3.0% in December. The moderation in the\nyear-on-year producer inflation rate reflected last year's high\nreadings dropping out of the calculation. The report was delayed\nby the brief shutdown of the federal government early this\nmonth.</p>\n<p>A 0.8% jump in services drove the rise in the monthly PPI,\nreflecting a 2.5% increase in trade services, which measure\nchanges in margins received by wholesalers and retailers.\nMargins for professional and commercial equipment wholesaling\nsurged 14.4%, indicating businesses were passing on tariffs.</p>\n<p>Prices also rose for chemicals and allied products\nwholesaling, bundled wired telecommunications access services,\nhealth, beauty and optical goods retailing, and food and alcohol\nretailing. Transportation and warehousing services prices\nclimbed 1.0%, but the cost of services less trade,\ntransportation, and warehousing was unchanged.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>TARIFF-RELATED PRICE INCREASES</p>\n<p>&quot;The problem last month appeared to be tariff-related,&quot; said\n<person>Paul Ashworth</person>, chief <location value=\"LR/nam\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >North America</location> economist at Capital\nEconomics. &quot;If we exclude trade and transportation, other core\nservices prices were unchanged.&quot;\nThe  <org>U.S. Supreme Court</org> last Friday struck down President <person>Donald\nTrump's</person> sweeping tariffs, which he had pursued under a law meant\nfor use in national emergencies. However,  Trump swiftly imposed\na 10% global tariff for 150 days to replace some of the\nemergency duties, before raising the rate to 15%.</p>\n<p>U.S. stocks opened lower. The dollar was steady against a\nbasket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.</p>\n<p>Within services, airline fares increased 2.6% and the cost\nof portfolio management fees rose 1.5%. Prices for physician\ncare soared 0.8%, but the cost of hospital outpatient care fell\n0.9% while inpatient care increased 0.2%. The wholesale cost of\nhotel and motel rooms decreased 4.1%. These are among the\ncomponents that feed into the core PCE inflation.\nProducer goods prices fell 0.3%, with the cost of energy\ndeclining 2.7% amid a 5.5% drop in gasoline. Wholesale food\nprices decreased 1.5%, pulled down by a 10.5% plunge in fresh\nfruits and melons. The Trump administration has rolled back some\ntariffs on fruit and vegetables, including bananas, to lower\ncosts for consumers. Egg prices crashed 63.9%, but the cost of\nbeef and veal increased 1.1%.\nExcluding food and energy, goods prices vaulted 0.7%, the\nbiggest gain since <chron>May 2022</chron>, after rising 0.4% in December. Core\ngoods prices advanced 4.2% year-on-year, the largest gain since\n<chron>March 2023</chron>. Economists continued to believe that core PCE\ninflation increased by as much as 0.5% in January, which would\ntranslate to a year-on-year advance of 3.2%.</p>\n<p>Core PCE inflation rose 0.4% in December and increased 3.0%\nyear-on-year. The government will publish the delayed PCE\ninflation report for January on <chron>March 13</chron>.</p>\n<p>&quot;This report validates the pivot of the Fed away from labor\nmarket risks,&quot; said <person>Carl Weinberg</person>, chief economist at High\nFrequency Economics. &quot;Market participants who have not already\nmarked down their expectations for Fed rate cuts this year will\nbe busy adjusting their books today.&quot;\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by <person>Chizu Nomiyama</person> and\n<person>Andrea Ricci</person> )</p>\n",

While GAAP losses persist, we remain cautious about consensus views for profitability in 2027. We widen our 2026 loss  per share estimate to <money>$0.41</money> from <money>$0.34</money> and reduce 2027 to <money>$1.69</money> from <money>$1.80</money>. CRWV faces elevated execution risk from its aggressive <money>$30-$35 billion</money> capex plan in 2026. This is compounded by expected negative free cash flow in 2026 and 2027. While the <money>$66.8 billion</money> revenue backlog provides  visibility, CRWV's high leverage, near-term margin compression (Q4 operating margin at -6% vs. +15% prior year), and reliance on continuous external financing create significant financial risk. Mitigating factors include declining cost of capital (down 300 bps over last year), strong customer diversification progress, and the strategic NVIDIA partnership with <money>$2B</money> investment.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

Importantly, absent a one-time, non-cash charge related to stock-based compensation for employees, the Company would have more than doubled its profitability compared to fiscal 2024.\n\n</p><p>\nDuring fiscal 2025, in addition to our sales directly with customers, we continued to strengthen our distribution sales channel and sales through subcontractors who manufacture on behalf of our customers. By deepening these channels, we effectively open the door to a broad base of end customers. <org>Challenge Electronics</org> has developed numerous new products that will be introduced through its newly formed distribution sales channel, reinforcing our commitment to innovation and long-term growth.\n\n</p><p>\nWe are also actively expanding our global reach. The Surge division’s European sales operation is performing quite well, and we are optimistic about continued growth in that market in fiscal 2026. At the same time, our <org>Challenge Electronics</org> sales division is establishing a sales presence in <location value=\"LR/eur\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Europe</location>.\n\n</p><p>\nWe are also positioning the Company to participate in sales to high-growth markets. During the year, we initiated efforts to explore opportunities within the AI ecosystem, targeting potential customers whose applications require the types of electronic components we supply.\n\n</p><p>\nLastly, in response to geopolitical considerations, many customers across the industry have requested production capabilities outside of <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>. As a result, several of our manufacturing partners have established secondary facilities outside of <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>.\n\n</p><p>\nWe believe our strategic initiatives, combined with our strong financial performance, position us well for continued growth and value creation in the year ahead.”\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Results of Operations for the fiscal year Ended <chron>November 30, 2025</chron></b>\n\n</p><p>\nConsolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended <chron>November 30, 2025</chron> increased by <money>$5,108,966</money> or 16.4%, to <money>$36,320,105</money> as compared to net sales of <money>$31,211,139</money> for the fiscal year ended <chron>November 30, 2024</chron>. We attribute the increase to an increase in business with new customers as well as an increase in business with existing customers. We can also attribute the increase to an increase in business from the Company’s distribution channels. Net sales for the fiscal years ended <chron>November 30, 2025</chron> and <chron>November 30, 2024</chron> reflect <money>$941,564</money> and <money>$549,564</money>, respectively of tariff costs that the Company was able to pass on to its customers.\n\n</p><p>\nOur gross profit for the fiscal year ended <chron>November 30, 2025</chron> increased by <money>$1,551,477</money> to <money>$10,455,171</money> or 17.4%, as compared to <money>$8,903,694</money> for the fiscal year ended <chron>November 30, 2024</chron>. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to 28.8% for the fiscal year ended <chron>November 30, 2025</chron> compared to 28.5% for the fiscal year ended <chron>November 30, 2024</chron>. The increase can be attributed to the increase in sales to certain customers whose sales are at a higher gross profit margin. We work with electronic manufacturing service subcontractor customers who manufacture products for other customers who do not have their own manufacturing operations. The Company has agreements with these subcontractor customers to provide periodic cost reductions through rebates in the amount of 5%. These reductions only affect future shipments of our products, and do not affect existing orders. These reductions can have a negative impact on our profit margins since they reduce the amount of commissions we can earn. Even though this rebate can impact the Company’s gross profit margin, these subcontractor customers represent very significant potential growth for the Company, because they can help the Company become an approved supplier at the customers they manufacture for, and they purchase our components for these customers. We believe it would be very difficult for the Company to achieve business at these customers without the help of these subcontractor customers. During Fiscal 2025, the Company was impacted by tariff costs on certain products imported from <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>. The Company has been able to pass along a portion of these costs to its customers and will do so under potential tariffs imposed upon us. The Company has also moved some customer deliveries directly to <location value=\"LU/cn..hongkg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Hong Kong</location> in order to mitigate some of these costs.\n\n</p><p>\nSelling and shipping expenses for the fiscal year ended <chron>November 30, 2025</chron> was <money>$2,906,782</money>, an increase of <money>$166,788</money>, or 6.1%, as compared to <money>$2,739,994</money> for the fiscal year ended <chron>November 30, 2024</chron>. We attribute the increase to increases in sales and the resulting selling expenses such as commission expenses, the hiring of new salespeople which increased sales payroll, travel and entertainment and auto expenses, offset by decreases in freight out and printing expenses.\n\n</p><p>\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended <chron>November 30, 2025</chron> was <money>$6,223,384</money>, an increase of <money>$1,034,015</money>, or 19.9%, as compared to <money>$5,189,369</money> for the fiscal year ended <chron>November 30, 2025</chron>. The increase is due primarily to non cash stock based compensation of <money>$538,361</money> during the fiscal year ended <chron>November 30, 2025</chron>. As well as increases in officer salaries, other salaries and related payroll taxes, general insurance expenses as well as health insurance expenses, utilities and office expenses and professional fees, computer expenses and consulting expenses and pension expenses as well as increases in bank charges and bad debt expenses, offset by decreases in rent, directors fees and public company expenses.\n\n</p><p>\nThis press release should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, which can be found at www.surgecomponents.com and at www.sec.gov.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements</b>\n\n</p><p>\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements.

            "description": "<p><chron>Feb 27</chron> (Reuters) - <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> has a lot to lose if Paramount Skydance buys Warner Bros Discovery and could stand in the way of a deal, while <org>Paramount's</org> deep political connections to the Trump administration are expected to smooth the path to federal regulatory approval. </p>\n<p>State Attorney General <person>Rob Bonta</person> said on Thursday that <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> is already investigating the deal and will be &quot;vigorous&quot; in its review. Hours earlier, <org>Paramount</org> beat out streaming giant Netflix in a months-long battle for control of the storied <location value=\"LU/us.ca.hollyw\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Hollywood</location> studio.</p>\n<p><org>Paramount's</org> bid is likely to raise concerns about job cuts in <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> that also dogged Netflix's bid. <org>Paramount</org> sees <money>$6 billion</money> in cost &quot;synergies&quot; in the deal, which is often code for massive layoffs and cutting, or sharply paring back, entire units. It can also mean reducing the number of suppliers and squeezing existing contractors for better terms after the two companies merge. None of that is good news for the <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> economy.</p>\n<p>While <org>Paramount</org> initially came in with what the <org>Warner Bros</org> board viewed as an inferior offer, it was highly successful in stirring up political opposition to Netflix's bid among Republicans in <location value=\"LS/us.wa\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location>. Now, Bonta and <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> Governor <person>Gavin Newsom</person>, both Democrats, are likely to be the biggest hurdles to <org>Paramount</org> after the media conglomerate won the fight by upping its offer price.</p>\n<p>State intervention to block the deal is &quot;very likely,&quot; TD Cowen analysts said in a note on Thursday, adding that &quot;approval from federal regulators seems likely given the political environment.&quot;</p>\n<p>Spokespeople for <org>Warner Bros</org> and <org>Paramount</org> did not immediately respond to requests for comment. </p>\n<p>Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, has gone out of his way to present himself as a leader among the political opposition to Trump. Bonta has sued the federal government repeatedly over Trump administration decisions on issues such as clean energy, pipeline projects and health funding.</p>\n<p>U.S. Senator <person>Adam Schiff</person>, a <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> Democrat, said on Thursday that &quot;what was true for Netflix is still true now for <org>Paramount</org>,&quot; calling for the deal to face &quot;the highest levels of scrutiny.&quot;</p>\n<p><location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> has challenged large mergers in the past. In 2019, it led a group of states challenging T-Mobile's acquisition of Sprint. While the states lost in court, <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> secured a settlement recouping its costs and getting temporary commitments to keep jobs in place and offer low-cost plans for consumers.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> also joined the <org>Federal Trade Commission</org> and several other states in a successful bid to block Kroger's takeover of rival grocery chain Albertsons.</p>\n<p>While <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> often works with federal enforcers, Bonta's office has also levied criticisms against some settlements that cleared the way for mergers.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location>, for example, is part of a coalition of 13 states opposing a <org>Justice Department</org> settlement allowing Hewlett Packard Enterprise's <money>$14 billion</money> acquisition of Juniper Networks.</p>\n<p>Over the past few years, Bonta's office has staffed up on competition enforcers under the leadership of antitrust head <person>Paula Blizzard</person>.

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>Our 12-month target price of <money>$137</money>, up by <money>$2</money>, reflects a combination of our relative valuation and DCF models. On a relative basis, we apply a 5.5x multiple of enterprise value to projected 2027 EBITDA, a slight premium to EOG's historical forward average. We think a modest premium is defensible due to the Encino deal, which, once integrated, should enable reductions to EOG's cost basis. This approach yields a value of <money>$130</money> per share. Meanwhile, our DCF model presumes 6.2% free cash flow growth per year for 10 years, a 2% terminal value, and a WACC of 7.4%, yielding a value of <money>$144</money> per share. We cut our 2026 EPS estimate by <money>$1.45</money> to <money>$9.50</money> and initiate our 2027 EPS estimate at <money>$11.63</money>. Encino is an important contributor for EOG, but at the moment, the company is incurring some cost pressures as it absorbs the deal. However, EOG's legacy well costs in the <location value=\"LU/us.mt.utica\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Utica</location> were 13% better than those of Encino's predecessor management team, and so we think it is a matter of time before EOG brings down those costs as well.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.
