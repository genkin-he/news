            "description": "\n<p><location value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >NEW YORK</location>, <chron>Feb.  26, 2026</chron>  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Market News Updates News Commentary - Quantum computing is starting to play a meaningful role in improving how drones operate, especially when it comes to planning and real-time decision-making. Drone missions involve thousands of moving parts — weather, airspace rules, terrain, battery life, payload weight, and changing objectives. Traditional computers process these variables step by step, which can slow things down as operations scale. Quantum computing, however, is designed to evaluate many possibilities at once, helping operators find faster, more efficient routes and better mission plans. For investors, that means lower operating costs, faster execution, and more productive drone deployments.   Active Companies in the <org value=\"QUBT.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Quantum Computing</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='QUBT' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( QUBT )</span>, Drone and UAV industries looking for the latest opportunities may include <strong><org value=\"ZENA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >ZenaTech, Inc.</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='ZENA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( ZENA )</span></strong> , <strong><org value=\"QUBT.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Quantum Computing Inc.</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='QUBT' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( QUBT )</span> </strong>, <strong><org value=\"RGTI.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Rigetti Computing, Inc.</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='RGTI' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( RGTI )</span> </strong>, <strong><org value=\"QBTS.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >D-Wave Quantum Inc.</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='QBTS' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( QBTS )</span> </strong>, <strong><org value=\"IONQ.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >IonQ</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='IONQ' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( IONQ )</span> </strong>.</p>  <p>The impact becomes even more important when managing fleets or swarms of drones. Coordinating dozens — or even hundreds — of autonomous aircraft creates incredibly complex optimization challenges. Quantum-enhanced algorithms can help determine which drone should go where, how to avoid collisions, and how to conserve energy in real time — all while adjusting to unexpected changes. That improves safety, increases uptime, and allows operators to scale operations without dramatically increasing overhead. In defense, logistics, and infrastructure inspection, that kind of efficiency can be a major competitive advantage and a differentiator in securing long-term contracts.</p>  <p>From an investment standpoint, this is where two high-growth industries intersect: drones and quantum computing. The global quantum computing market is projected to grow from around <money>USD 1.4 billion</money> in 2025 to nearly <money>USD 19.4 billion</money> by 2035, with sustained double-digit CAGR, according to recent forecasts. As enterprises and government agencies pour more into quantum R&amp;D and cloud-based access expands, the technology’s ability to solve complex optimization and AI problems will only strengthen. For investors, companies that successfully combine quantum-driven optimization with scalable drone platforms could offer differentiated performance, stronger contract wins, and exposure to two rapidly expanding markets.</p>  <p><strong>ZenaTech’s ZenaDrone Initiates Defense-focused Quantum Navigation System for GPS-Denied Drone Operations</strong><strong><em> - </em></strong><org value=\"ZENA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >ZenaTech, Inc.</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='ZENA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( ZENA )</span>  (FSE: 49Q) (BMV: ZENA) (&quot;ZenaTech&quot;), a technology solution provider specializing in AI (Artificial Intelligence) drone, Drone as a Service (DaaS), enterprise SaaS, and <org value=\"QUBT.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Quantum Computing</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='QUBT' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( QUBT )</span> solutions, announces that its drone subsidiary ZenaDrone has initiated the development of a quantum navigation system designed to enable secure drone operations in GPS-denied and satellite-compromised environments. The system will initially support ZenaDrone 1000, the company’s multifunction heavy-lift drone for use in defense applications including ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance), specialized cargo, and border patrol. Future scalability is also planned across the company’s IQ series drone platforms.</p>  <p>“The ability to operate autonomously in GPS-denied environments is an operational imperative for modern defense,” said <person>Shaun Passley</person>, Ph.D., <org value=\"ZENA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >ZenaTech</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='ZENA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( ZENA )</span> CEO. “We are committed to supporting U.S. defense and national security interests with technology that performs where conventional systems fail. We see quantum navigation as a cornerstone capability that will define the next generation of autonomous systems for defense, and we are making the strategic investments in the R&amp;D needed to enable our future leadership as the industry evolves.”</p>  <p>Quantum navigation systems are considered next-generation, self-contained and ultra-precise motion sensing systems that enable reliable navigation without GPS by using quantum physics–based principles and sensors. As defense operational landscapes evolve, defense missions increasingly face environments where GPS and satellite signals cannot be relied upon, whether due to jamming, spoofing, or other contested conditions. These navigation systems fuse quantum inertial measurement with AI-driven path correction, enabling sustained and accurate positioning over extended mission periods without reliance on external signals. Quantum navigation can also benefit commercial drones operating in GPS-challenged environments such as in dense urban corridors, indoor industrial facilities, underground sites, and long-range BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line-of-Sight) missions.</p>  <p>The Company’s R&amp;D team is at the initial stages of development focused on incorporating this capability into the ZenaDrone 1000, and management expects to advance through research and development, drone integration, and testing phases which will involve multifunctional teams in due time. The quantum navigation system is expected to be integrated into ZenaDrone’s defense and commercial drone platforms, enhancing capabilities for surveillance, critical infrastructure inspection, and defense missions.</p>  <p>The ZenaDrone 1000 is engineered as an advanced AI-powered VTOL heavy-lift platform optimized for defense use, offering ISR capabilities including real-time surveillance, tactical reconnaissance, and secure data collection, alongside cargo transport and mission-critical payload delivery. Its modular design allows rapid configuration for multi-mission operations in high-risk environments, from infrastructure monitoring to operational logistics support. <strong><em>Continued…</em></strong> <strong>Read this full release and additional news for ZENA by visiting: </strong>https://www.zenatech.com/newsroom/</p>  <p><em>In other <org value=\"QUBT.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Quantum Computing</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='QUBT' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( QUBT )</span>/UAV/Drone industry news of note:</em></p>  <p><strong><org value=\"QUBT.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Quantum Computing Inc.</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='QUBT' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( QUBT )</span> ,</strong> an innovative, quantum optics and integrated photonics technology company, recently announced the completion of acquiring <org>Luminar Semiconductor, Inc.</org> (&quot;LSI&quot;), a wholly owned subsidiary of Luminar Technologies, Inc.

            "description": "\n<p class=\"bwalignc\">\n<b><i>New white paper delivers a vendor-neutral framework spanning edge, 5G, APIs, cloud, and software-defined vehicles</i></b>\n\n</p>\n<p>    <location value=\"LU/us.ma.wakefi\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >WAKEFIELD, Mass.</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nThe <org>Automotive Edge Computing Consortium</org> (AECC) today released a new white paper, “AECC Industry Blueprint: Shaping the Future of Automotive Innovation.” This vital new document provides the automotive industry and the digital infrastructure ecosystem — including communications, computing and software — with a shared, vendor-neutral reference for deploying connected vehicle and mobility services at scale.\n\n</p><p>\nAs the automotive industry moves rapidly toward software defined vehicles, demand continues to grow for large scale data processing, highly reliable communications, and AI-enabled services that can meet strict latency and availability requirements. At the same time, it has become clear that architectures relying solely on centralized cloud infrastructures are no longer sufficient. The new white paper addresses this challenge by outlining a distributed edge, 5G, API, and cloud architecture designed to support emerging connected vehicle use cases in real-world deployment environments.\n\n</p><p>\nThe white paper reflects cross-working-group collaboration within AECC and represents AECC’s collective technical consensus. <org>The Architecture and Requirements Working Group</org> played a central role in its creation.\n\n</p><p>\nKey takeaways from the white paper include:\n\n</p><ol class=\"bwlistdecimal\">\n<li>\nA comprehensive reference architecture for enabling connected vehicle and mobility services using distributed edge and cloud computing.\n\n</li>\n<li>\nClear definition of roles and responsibilities across industry actors, including OEMs, network operators, edge, 5G, API and cloud providers, and service providers.\n\n</li>\n<li>\nA structured identification of gaps between current solutions and future technical and operational requirements.\n\n</li>\n<li>\nPractical insights informed by proof-of-concept activities that validate the proposed architectural approach.\n\n</li>\n</ol><p>\nThis publication builds on and consolidates several earlier AECC white papers. While previous documents focused on individual use cases or technical areas, this new white paper integrates those findings into a unified, end-to-end industry blueprint connecting challenges, requirements, architecture, and implementation learnings.\n\n</p><p>\n“Connected vehicle services are evolving quickly, and the industry needs a common architectural foundation to support deployment at scale,” said Dr. <person>Ryokichi Onishi</person>, AECC Board Chairperson. “This white paper reflects broad, cross-industry collaboration and provides a practical, vendor-neutral blueprint that supports both current deployments and future innovation.” AECC encourages OEMs, network operators, technology providers, and service developers to use this blueprint as a common reference when designing and deploying connected-vehicle and mobility solutions. Aligning on interoperable edge, 5G, API, and cloud architectures and collaborating to address the technical and operational gaps identified in the white paper are critical next steps for the industry.\n\n</p><p>\nThe white paper also outlines priorities for AECC, including continued proof-of-concept activities, further refinement of interface definitions, and deeper cross-industry collaboration to support real-world deployment.\n\n</p><p>\nAECC invites stakeholders to provide constructive feedback on the white paper and to engage through AECC working groups and proof of concept initiatives.\n\n</p><p>\nThe white paper is available on the AECC website.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Engage with the AECC Through Collaborative Initiatives</b>\n\n</p><p>\nOrganizations seeking to explore practical applications of connected vehicle services are invited to participate in the AECC’s Proof of Concept (PoC) program.

            "description": "\n<div class=\"xn-content\">\n<p><i>Long-standing industry-academic collaboration delivers first-of-its-kind intent-driven, AI-native RAN powered by a Large Telecom Model</i></p><p><span class=\"legendSpanClass\"><location value=\"LU/us.ma.boston\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >BOSTON</location> and <location value=\"LU/es..barcel\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >BARCELONA, Spain</location></span>, <span class=\"legendSpanClass\"><chron>Feb. 26, 2026</chron></span> /PRNewswire/ -- Northeastern University's <org>Institute for Intelligent Networked Systems</org> (INSI), SoftBank Corp. (SoftBank), Keysight Technologies, and zTouch Networks are demonstrating Autonomous Agentic AI-RAN (AgentRAN) at <org>Mobile World Congress</org> (MWC) <location value=\"LU/es..barcel\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Barcelona</location> 2026. AgentRAN is a first-of-its-kind system that coordinates a hierarchy of AI agents to translate high-level operator intents into real-time, autonomous 5G and 6G network configurations and services.</p>\n<p>The demonstration is the latest milestone in a collaboration anchored at <org>Northeastern University</org>, where INSI has served as a nexus for industry-academic partnerships at the frontier of intelligent wireless networks. Over the past few years, Northeastern has built deep research ties with SoftBank on AI-native architectures, leading to multiple publications, <org>AI-RAN Alliance</org> demonstrations, and innovation in next-generation wireless. INSI collaborates with Keysight on AI-RAN testing and spun off zTouch Networks to commercialize technology on open, GPU-accelerated RAN infrastructure. This demo brings those threads together for the first time around a shared vision: truly autonomous, AI-driven radio access networks.</p><p><b>How It Works</b></p><p>At the heart of the demo is AgentRAN, developed at Northeastern's <org>Open6G AI-RAN Alliance Lab</org>. Operators express goals in natural language – such as \"maximize throughput while prioritizing emergency traffic\" – and the AgentRAN Manager decomposes these intents into actions for specialized agents operating across the RAN stack. The agents are powered by the SoftBank's Large Telecom Model (LTM), a purpose-built foundation model trained on telecom-specific KPIs, configurations, and domain data—further optimized with high-fidelity training data generated using Keysight's RF digital twin channel emulation solutions with real world accurate 3D ray tracing capabilities (RaySIM, PROPSIM) for more accurate decisions than generic cloud models can deliver.</p><p>The Northeastern Open6G AI-RAN lab, using Keysight's PROPSIM, demonstrates multiple agentic scenarios, deployed on an end-to-end programmable private 5G AI-RAN infrastructure, managed and orchestrated by zTouch Networks' zTouch.OS. The demonstration shows the system's ability to detect changing conditions and adapt autonomously. Using Keysight's AI-RAN performance scoring solution, the system shows clear performance gains linked to the use of SoftBank's LTM, high fidelity training datasets generated by Keysight RF digital twin solutions, and zTouch Networks' zTouch.OS.</p><p><b>What the Partners Are Saying</b></p><p><b><i><person>Tommaso Melodia</person>, William L. Smith Professor at <org>Northeastern University</org> and INSI Director:</i></b><i> \"When Northeastern co-founded the <org>AI-RAN Alliance</org> alongside SoftBank, NVIDIA, and other industry leaders at MWC 2024, we set out to prove that AI can be woven directly into the fabric of the radio access network – not as an afterthought, but as its core operating principle. This demonstration is proof of this concept coming to life. Our open AI-RAN research infrastructure at INSI was purpose-built to bring together partners like SoftBank, Keysight, and zTouch Networks so we can move from ideas to working, validated systems faster than any one organization could alone. What you see here is a network that understands what an operator wants and figures out how to deliver it autonomously. This is the future of wireless, and it is being built through exactly this kind of deep, sustained collaboration.\"</i></p><p><b><i>Ryuji Wakikawa, Vice President and Head of the <org>Research Institute of Advanced Technology</org> at SoftBank Corp.: </i></b><i>\"This initiative demonstrates our Large Telecom Model working outside of our own infrastructure for the first time, which underscores the potential of this technology to transform the whole industry. We believe technology is only valuable when it is put to the service of society, and our team is glad to support the spread of this impact in other use-cases beyond our own.\"</i></p><p><b><i><person>Peng Cao</person>, Vice President and General Manager, <org>Wireless Test Group</org>, Keysight:</i></b><i> \"AI-native networks will only be as powerful as the data and validation frameworks behind them. Through this collaboration with <org>Northeastern University</org>, SoftBank, and zTouch Networks, Keysight is enabling the high-fidelity digital twin environments and performance intelligence needed to train, validate, and scale Large Telecom Models for real-world deployment. Together, we are helping the industry move forward with confidence toward an autonomous, trustworthy, AI-powered 6G era.\" </i></p><p><b><i>Salvatore D'Oro, zTouch Networks CTO:</i></b><i> \"We built zTouch Networks on a simple conviction: networks should understand what you need and deliver it autonomously - no armies of engineers, no months-long deployment cycles. This demonstration brings that vision to life. With zTouch.OS orchestrating an end-to-end AI-RAN infrastructure, operators can express an intent in plain language and watch the network configure itself in real time. Together with Northeastern, SoftBank, and Keysight, we're showing that truly autonomous, intent-driven wireless networks aren't a future promise - they're here.\"</i></p><p>The Agentic AI-RAN demonstration will be live at MWC Barcelona 2026, <chron>March 2-5</chron>, at the Keysight booth in Hall 5, Stand 5F41. Visitors can see the full intent-to-network pipeline in action and explore the AgentRAN dashboard, LTM integration, and real-time channel emulation firsthand.</p><p><b>About the Northeastern University INSI</b></p><p><org>The Institute for Intelligent Networked Systems</org> (INSI) at <org>Northeastern University</org> conducts cutting-edge research in wireless communications, networking, and systems.

Together, these improvements bring Intervala’s total footprint to approximately 200,000 square feet.\n\n</p><p>\nIntervala’s enhanced manufacturing environment is purpose-built to support today’s most demanding electronics designs and fully integrated electromechanical systems, including fine-pitch and high-density component placement, highly complex assemblies, rigorous inspection, testing, and traceability, as well as low- to mid-volume production with stringent reliability requirements. These capabilities are increasingly critical as OEMs seek to deliver greater functionality in smaller, denser board footprints without compromising performance or compliance.\n\n</p><p>\nIn mission-critical infrastructure markets, customer partners are seeing the impact of Intervala’s approach firsthand. “Our customers are navigating unprecedented complexity - from AI-driven data center expansion to next-generation defense and medical systems,” said McKernan. “They need a manufacturing partner that can scale with confidence, execute with precision, and engineer for reliability from day one. This investment ensures we’re not just keeping pace with demand - we’re helping our customers gain a competitive edge with systems built to perform when it matters most.”\n\n</p><p>\nCollectively, these enhancements strengthen Intervala’s ability to deliver complex, high-reliability programs at scale. The company combines the advanced technology, scale, and cost advantages typically associated with large contract manufacturers with the flexibility, responsiveness, and partnership more often found in smaller providers, enabling OEMs to move forward with confidence as product complexity increases.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>About Intervala</b>\n\n</p><p>\nIntervala is a full-service electronics manufacturing services (EMS) provider delivering complex electronic and electromechanical products for customers in the aerospace and defense, medical and life sciences, industrial, and data center markets.\n\n</p><p>\nDistinguished by advanced engineering expertise and a customer-first mindset, Intervala provides full-system integration services including printed circuit board assemblies, electromechanical systems, and cable and harness assemblies.\n\n</p><p>\nWith decades of experience and a culture built on quality, agility, and trust, Intervala partners with its customers to design, build, and deliver reliable products for applications where failure is not an option.

            "title": "Arms Cyber Announces Integration with Veeam to Automate the Isolation of Ransomware-Infected Backups",
            "description": "\n<p><location value=\"LU/us.tn.breood\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Brentwood, TN</location>, <chron>Feb.  26, 2026</chron>  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Arms Cyber, the leader in stealth-based ransomware defense, today announced a new technology partnership with Veeam® Software, the <org>Data and AI Trust</org> company. The partnership focuses on a direct technical integration designed to automatically flag and isolate backup restore points containing ransomware threats, significantly reducing recovery times and eliminating the risk of restoring infected data.</p>     <p>   </p>  <p>As ransomware grows more sophisticated, attackers frequently target backup infrastructure or dwell silently in systems for weeks before detonating. This means the most recent backups often contain the dormant malware. When IT teams rush to restore operations, they inadvertently reintroduce the malware to the network, causing a &quot;reinfection loop&quot; that paralyzes recovery efforts.</p>  <p>   </p>  <p>The integration between Arms Cyber and Veeam Data Platform addresses this critical challenge directly. By leveraging the REST API capabilities, Arms Cyber can now act as a high-fidelity sensor for the backup environment.</p>  <p>   </p>  <p>When Arms Cyber detects a ransomware event on a protected workload, it instantly triggers the Veeam Incident  API. This action immediately marks relevant restore points in the Veeam console as compromised, alerting backup administrators and preventing the accidental restoration of infected data.</p>  <p>   </p>  <p>“The old paradigm of security teams handling detection while IT teams handle separate recovery tools is failing customers during real-world crises,” said <person>Bob Kruse</person>, CEO at Arms Cyber. “Our mission is to move beyond simple alerting by taking automated action. By integrating with Veeam, we aren't just telling you that you have ransomware; we are physically interlocking with your backup system to ensure you don't restore the infection. This is what true cyber resilience looks like.”</p>  <p>   </p>  <p>Availability The integration requires Veeam Data Platform v12 or higher and an active Arms Cyber subscription. For more information on deployment, visit https://www.tawk.to/partner-program/.</p>  <p>   </p>  <p>About Arms Cyber Arms Cyber delivers a revolutionary approach to defeat attacks others miss through a three-part strategy: Conceal, Deceive, and Restore — powered by stealth. By adding stealth to an organization's existing security posture, we keep critical data invisible to attackers, detect threats before they cause serious damage, and enable rapid recovery without compromise. The outcome: no ransom payouts, no public breaches, no costly downtime.</p>  <p><br/><br/><br/></p>  Image: https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTY2MDY0NCM3NDUyOTUyIzUwMDEzMDIwMQ==  <br/> Image: https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/NmU4ZGVjNWEtOTU1YS00ZTMwLTlhOWMtNDE0ZmNmOGRkNTQ3LTUwMDEzMDIwMS0yMDI2LTAyLTI2LWVu/tiny/armscyber.png <pre>armscyber\narmscyber\n4084311516\npr@armscyber.com\n</pre>\nSource: armscyber\n",

The bar undoubtedly increases, as NVDA makes the case that compute equals revenue for their customers to justify the higher spend. We do expect sequential growth to slow in 2H (tougher comps) but think this is already discounted in shares, while Physical AI/Sovereign AI offers long term upside.

            "description": "<p><location value=\"LU/ca.qc.montrl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >MONTREAL</location>/<location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >BEIJING</location>/<location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >WASHINGTON</location>, <chron>Feb 26</chron> (Reuters) - Suppliers to U.S. aerospace and semiconductor firms face worsening rare earth shortages, with two turning away some clients, industry insiders said, weeks before U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping for a summit in <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location>.</p>\n<p>The shortages center on rare earths such as yttrium and scandium, niche members of the family of 17 elements, which play tiny but vital roles in defence technology, aerospace and semiconductors and are almost entirely produced in <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>.</p>\n<p>While <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location> has allowed many rare earth exports to resume since it imposed restrictions in April, shipments of these materials still rarely make it to the U.S. despite the October detente with <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location>, Chinese customs data show.</p>\n<p>That easing of trade tensions, premised in part on <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> pausing its critical mineral export restrictions, will be on the table when Trump and Xi meet in <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location> in March.</p>\n<p>A key pain point is yttrium, used in coatings that keep engines and turbines from melting at high temperatures. Without regular application of these coatings, engines cannot be used.</p>\n<p>Since Reuters first reported about yttrium shortages in November, prices have jumped 60% and are now about 69 times as high as a year ago. Some coatings manufacturers are also now starting to ration material, according to company executives and traders.</p>\n<p>Executives at two North American firms that buy yttrium to make coatings told Reuters they have needed to temporarily pause production due to shortages. One is also now turning away smaller and offshore customers in order to conserve supply for larger clients, which include certain engine makers.</p>\n<p>Another firm in the coating supply chain recently ran out of material and stopped selling products containing yttrium oxide, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.</p>\n<p>While shortages of yttrium and scandium have not weighed on production of jet engines or chips yet, a U.S. government official told Reuters some U.S. manufacturers now face &quot;shortages&quot; of certain rare earths from <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> exported 17 tons of yttrium products to the U.S. in the eight months after controls were introduced last April versus 333 tons in the eight months before the measures.</p>\n<p>A <org>White House</org> official said the Trump administration is committed to ensuring access to critical minerals for all U.S. businesses. </p>\n<p>&quot;This includes negotiating with <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> and monitoring compliance with President Trump's agreement with President Xi, as well as developing alternative supply chains as warranted.&quot;</p>\n<p>Reuters spoke with two U.S. government officials, 14 company executives and staff, traders and analysts across aerospace and semiconductors. All of them spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity except the analysts named in the story. The North American executives did not want to be named discussing internal production challenges in public. </p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China's</location> <org>Ministry of Commerce</org> did not respond to questions.</p>\n<p>PRODUCTION PRESSURE </p>\n<p>While low yttrium supplies have not hurt engine production, manufacturers remain concerned, said aerospace supply chain specialist <person>Kevin Michaels</person>.</p>\n<p>&quot;This is a watch item and a tangible example of how <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> is flexing its rare earth muscle,&quot; said Michaels, managing director at U.S. consultant AeroDynamic Advisory. </p>\n<p>Enginemakers are already struggling to meet demand for spare parts from airlines and higher production by planemakers <org value=\"BA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Boeing</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BA )</span> and Airbus.</p>\n<p>U.S. aircraft enginemakers <org>GE Aerospace</org>, RTX's Pratt &amp; Whitney and <org value=\"HON.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Honeywell</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='HON' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( HON )</span> declined comment.</p>\n<p>SCARCE SCANDIUM</p>\n<p>In addition to yttrium, U.S. semiconductor makers are running low on scandium, putting production of next-generation 5G chips at risk, said <person>Dylan Patel</person>, founder and CEO of research firm SemiAnalysis. </p>\n<p>With global production of only several tens of tons a year, scandium plays small but important parts in fuel cells, specialty aluminium aerospace alloys and advanced chip processing and packaging.</p>\n<p>Major U.S. semiconductor manufacturers all rely on scandium for making chip components that &quot;go into essentially every 5G smartphone and base station&quot;, Patel said.</p>\n<p>U.S. chipmakers have experienced delays in receiving new scandium export licenses from <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> in recent months and have reached out to <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location> for help, said two industry sources. </p>\n<p>Many of these firms had obtained scandium from third-country suppliers, another U.S. official said, but <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> requires license applicants to declare their end-users.</p>\n<p>&quot;Our thesis is that it is precisely the semi industry being targeted,&quot; the U.S. official said.</p>\n<p><org>The U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association</org> declined to comment.</p>\n<p>&quot;The U.S. currently has zero domestic scandium production and no operational alternative sources outside <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>,&quot; Patel said, adding that stockpiles are likely in months rather than years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p> (Reporting by <person>Allison Lampert</person> in <location value=\"LU/ca.qc.montrl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Montreal</location>; <person>Laurie Chen</person> and <person>Lewis Jackson</person> in <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location>; <person>Michael Martina</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location>; Additional reporting by <person>Fanny Potkin</person> in <location value=\"LC/sg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Singapore</location>, <person>Ernest Scheyder</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.tx.houstn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Houston</location> and <person>Melanie Burton</person> in <location value=\"LU/au..melbou\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Melbourne</location>; Editing by <person>Sonali Paul</person>)</p>\n",
