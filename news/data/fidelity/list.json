Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We raise our 12-month target to <money>$134</money> from <money>$127</money>, based on ~13x our FY 27 (Apr.) EPS estimate of <money>$10.31</money>. While we lower our FY 27 EPS from <money>$10.61</money>, our forecast remains above consensus' <money>$9.85</money>, and we trim FY 26 EPS modestly to <money>$8.87</money> from <money>$8.91</money>. The applied multiple sits modestly below SJM's 14x long-term average. We view SJM's Jan.-Q results as solid overall, though we remain disappointed by the continued challenges related to the Hostess acquisition. That said, we expect margins in the Hostess business to improve in FY 27 following recent restructuring actions. We are also constructive on margin expansion in coffee next year, supported by lower commodity costs and the recent removal of coffee tariffs. Core brands such as Uncrustables, <org>Cafe Bustelo</org>, Meow Mix, and Milk-Bone continue to perform well. Oversight from Elliott Management could help unlock incremental shareholder value. Overall, we see a reasonable path to $10+ EPS in FY 27, as we model approximately 16% growth to <money>$10.31</money> vs. <money>$9.85</money> consensus.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We lift our target price by <money>CAD1</money> to <money>CAD66</money>, about 25x our unchanged 2026 EPS of <money>CAD2.62</money> (2027 EPS initiated at <money>CAD2.85</money>). This is a premium to the five-year mean of 18x, which we think is warranted given the company's strong pipeline for store expansion. Q4 results were a bit underwhelming, particularly the 1.5% same-store sales growth, a notable deceleration from previous quarters. However, L did manage to alleviate some fears, noting a tough Y/Y comp (last year benefited from more promo activity) and an acceleration in growth through Q4 and into Q1. However, there is some weakness in certain categories like liquor and tobacco, which is weighing on overall growth. L guides for high-single-digit EPS growth, which we think could be a bit conservative given the somewhat consistent double-digit EPS growth over the past several years. L continues to open new stores (another year of about 70+), with a focus on discount banners as Canadians increasingly flock towards more value-oriented stores. We keep our Hold view.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice. Unauthorized reproduction is strictly prohibited.</p>\n",

This strategic funding initiative supports Rapidus’ plan to steadily progress from its current R&amp;D phase to mass production of 2nm (10⁻⁹ meters) logic semiconductors by 2027.\n\n</p><p>\nThrough this initiative, DNP will advance the development and mass production of EUV lithography photomasks and support Rapidus as it establishes a mass production system for 2nm &amp; next-generation semiconductors.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Background</b>\n\n</p><p>\nIn recent years, the rise in energy consumption, in line with increased data generation, has become a challenge, driving demand for next-generation semiconductors capable of improving device performance and reducing power consumption.\n\n</p><p>\nNext-generation semiconductors manufactured using EUV lithography enable the formation of finer patterns on silicon wafers compared to currently available technologies. This in turn is boosting expectations for the realization of higher performance and lower power consumption semiconductors.\n\n</p><p>\nAgainst this backdrop, in 2024 DNP was selected as a subcontractor for Rapidus under the <org>Post-5G Information and Communications System Infrastructure Enhancement R&amp;D Project</org>, led by the <org>New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization</org> (NEDO). Under this project, DNP has been advancing the development of manufacturing processes for 2nm generation EUV lithography photomasks.\n\n</p><p>\nLooking ahead, toward Rapidus’ goal of achieving mass production of 2nm-generation logic semiconductors in 2027, DNP aims to realize high-yield and short-lead-time production of EUV lithography photomasks for the 2nm generation at an early stage. Our investment will further strengthen the partnership between our two companies that has been cultivated to date.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Going Forward</b>\n\n</p><p>\nDNP positions EUV lithography photomasks as a key growth driver of its semiconductor-related business. We will continue to make proactive investments while advancing technology development with a view toward even finer 1.4nm generation and beyond. Through these efforts, DNP will contribute to the growth of Japan’s semiconductor industry.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>More Details</b>\n\n</p><p>\n<b>About DNP</b>\n\n</p><p>\nDNP was established in 1876, and has become a leading global company that leverages print-based solutions to engineer fresh business opportunities while protecting the environment and creating a more vibrant world for all. We capitalize on core competencies in microfabrication and precision coating technology to provide products for the display, electronic devices, and optical film markets.\n\n</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20260224169578r1&amp;sid=acqr8&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en\" style=\"width:0;height:0\" /><span class=\"bwct31415\" /></p><p id=\"mmgallerylink\"><span id=\"mmgallerylink-phrase\">View source version on businesswire.com: </span><span id=\"mmgallerylink-link\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260224169578/en/</span></p>\n<p>Source: <org value=\"DNPCF.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Dai Nippon Printing Co., Ltd.</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='DNPCF' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( DNPCF )</span></p>\n",

Adjusted operating profit increased 1% in underlying terms due to operating leverage on sales growth partially offset by investment and inflation, and decreased 2% in headline terms due to currency movements offsetting trading.</p><p>Pearson Professional Assessments sales increased 1% on an underlying basis driven by new contract launches partially offset by the pause in a contract delivered in 2024, which resumed in Q3, and headwinds in PDRI, which has been impacted by US federal government hiring and spend reductions.</p><p>In US Student Assessment, sales increased 2% on an underlying basis supported by scope increases with existing customers.</p><p>In Clinical Assessment, sales increased 8% on an underlying basis due to the continued traction of our products in the market, pricing and digital product growth.</p><p>In UK &amp; International Qualifications, sales increased 9% on an underlying basis driven by volume, pricing and strong International growth.</p><p>For Assessment &amp; Qualifications, we expect low to mid-single digit underlying sales growth in 2026. This will be driven by new contracts, products and pricing. 2026 priorities include expansion into adjacent markets, including high stakes test prep and formative assessments, along with key contract renewals and new wins. We will also continue to expand internationally, enhance operational excellence, and accelerate innovation, particularly through AI.</p><p><b>Virtual Learning</b></p><p>Virtual Learning sales grew 8% on an underlying basis, with strong performance in H2 driven by enrolment performance, favourable mix and funding. On a headline basis sales were up 4% with currency movements partially offsetting trading. Adjusted operating profit increased 29% in underlying terms, due to operating leverage on sales growth, and 23% in headline terms due to this partially offset by currency movements. </p><p>Enrolments for the 2025/26 academic year increased by 13% in the Fall semester, benefiting from targeted marketing investments to capture demand. We also successfully opened two new schools for the 2025/26 academic year bringing our total number of schools to 41 across 31 states and renewed all six of our long term school contracts.</p><p>For Virtual Learning, we expect even stronger underlying sales growth in 2026 than 2025, driven by a full year of enrolment growth. 2026 priorities include continuing to capture growing demand for US virtual schooling, further strengthening of our marketing and enrolment capabilities, targeted school expansion and the ongoing application of AI to personalise teaching and learning.</p><p><b>Higher Education</b></p><p>In Higher Education, sales increased 2% on an underlying basis and decreased 1% on a headline basis due to currency movements more than offsetting trading and portfolio changes. Adjusted operating profit was flat in underlying terms driven by operating leverage on sales growth offset by investment in the business and inflation, and decreased 3% in headline terms due to currency movements more than offsetting trading and portfolio changes.</p><p>In US Higher Education, underlying sales grew 3%, driven by enrolment growth and pricing in our core Courseware business, partly offset by expected declines in the K12 channel due to the transitionary period, with adoption share maintained. We delivered strong growth in Inclusive Access, up 19%, and achieved 2% growth in US digital subscriptions.  In addition, we continued to see strong monetisation of our <org>Study Prep</org> tool and sustained engagement with our AI-powered study tools. International Higher Education faced ongoing challenging trading conditions in mature markets, declining 7% for the full year.</p><p>For Higher Education, we expect underlying sales to grow more in 2026 than 2025, supported by continued product and platform innovation, pricing and Inclusive Access in our core US courseware business as well as improvement in the K12 channel. 2026 priorities include building on our Early Careers offerings, continuing to enhance access and integration across our Inclusive Access offerings in the US, while focusing internationally on emerging markets, digital expansion and content localisation.</p><p><b>English Language Learning</b></p><p>In English Language Learning, sales grew 1% on an underlying basis, driven by Institutional, and decreased 4% on a headline basis due to currency movements more than offsetting trading. Adjusted operating profit increased by 16% in underlying terms due to cost savings partially offset by inflation and was flat in headline terms due to currency movements offsetting trading.</p><p>PTE continued to perform well against a challenging market backdrop of tightening migration policies. While volumes declined 5%, sales remained flat and we continued to gain market share. Our Institutional business delivered a solid performance, with strength in key Latin American markets and <location value=\"LR/asp\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Asia</location>.  </p><p>For English Language Learning, we expect higher underlying sales growth in 2026 than 2025, driven by market share gains and pricing, with PTE returning to growth. 2026 priorities include continued strong operational performance, refreshing our Institutional product suite developing next‑generation solutions for institutional and government partners, and supporting enterprise customers with advanced upskilling capabilities.</p><p><b>Enterprise Learning &amp; Skills</b></p><p>In Enterprise Learning &amp; Skills, sales were up 6% on an underlying basis and 4% on a headline basis due to currency movements more than offsetting trading. Adjusted operating profit increased by 40% in underlying terms due to operating leverage on sales and increased 45% in headline terms due to trading performance and favourable currency movements.</p><p>Vocational Qualifications delivered a solid performance while Enterprise Solutions growth improved quarter-on-quarter as we build momentum in our enterprise approach and related sales capability, driven by the recently announced partnerships.</p><p>For Enterprise Learning &amp; Skills in 2026, we expect underlying sales growth to be driven by a solid performance in Vocational Qualifications and strategic account growth in Enterprise Solutions. 2026 priorities include addressing growing demand for trusted talent solutions that help employees work more effectively with AI, deepening value from our strategic partners and broadening our validated skills data to support workforce mobility at scale.</p><p><b>Financial Review </b></p><p><b>Operating result</b></p><p>Sales increased on a headline basis by £25m or 1% from £3,552m in 2024 to £3,577m in 2025 and adjusted operating profit increased by 2% on a headline basis to £614m in 2025 compared to £600m in 2024 (for a reconciliation of this measure see note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements).</p><p>The headline basis simply compares the reported results for 2025 with those for 2024. We also present sales and profits on an underlying basis which excludes the effects of exchange, the effect of portfolio changes arising from acquisitions and disposals and the impact of adopting new accounting standards that are not retrospectively applied, when relevant. Our portfolio change is calculated by excluding sales and profits made by businesses disposed in 2024 or 2025 and by ensuring the contribution from acquisitions is comparable year on year. For prior year acquisitions, the corresponding pre-acquisition period is excluded from the current year, and for current year acquisitions, the results for the current year are excluded. Portfolio changes mainly relate to the acquisition of eDynamic Learning and disposal of <person>Copp Clark</person> in 2025.</p><p>On an underlying basis, sales increased by 4% in 2025 compared to 2024 and adjusted operating profit increased by 6%. Currency movements decreased sales by £112m and adjusted operating profit by £26m, and portfolio changes increased sales by £7m and adjusted operating profit by £2m. There were no new accounting standards adopted in 2025 that impacted sales or profits.</p><p>Adjusted operating profit includes the results from discontinued operations when relevant but excludes charges for acquired intangible amortisation and impairment, acquisition related costs, gains and losses arising from disposals, the cost of major reorganisation and associated property charges, one off-costs related to the UK pension scheme and certain other one-off material items. A summary of these adjustments is included below and in note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.</p><div><table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\"

amounts previously accrued.</p><p>Product development impairment charges in 2025 relate to the impairment of product development assets as a result of courseware platform convergence. There were no such amounts in 2024.</p><p>Intangible amortisation charges in 2025 were £42m compared to a charge of £41m in 2024. This is due to increased amortisation from recent acquisitions partially offset by decreased amortisation from assets reaching the end of their useful economic lives.</p><p>UK pension discretionary increases in 2024 related to one-off pension increases awarded to certain cohorts of pensioners in response to the cost of living crisis. There were no such amounts in 2025.</p><p>Other net gains and losses in 2025 relate to the gain on disposal of <person>Copp Clark</person>, a business in our Higher Education division, a fair value gain relating to a previous disposal and costs relating to current and prior year acquisitions and disposals. Other net gains and losses in 2024 related to costs related to prior year acquisitions and disposals, partially offset by a gain on the partial disposal of our investment in an associate.</p><p>Property charges in 2025 are a gain of £25m relating to reversals of impairments of property assets that were previously impaired through property charges. Impairment reversals have arisen from new sublets on previously vacant space in corporate properties. There were no such amounts in 2024.</p><p>The reported operating profit of £507m in 2025 compares to a profit of £541m in 2024. The decrease has been driven by unfavourable foreign exchange movements, the product development impairment, investment  and inflation, partially offset by operating leverage on sales growth and cost savings, as well as a reduction in one-off pension charges and property related impairment reversals.</p><p><b>Net finance costs</b></p><p>Net finance costs increased on a headline basis from a net cost of £31m in 2024 to a net cost of £50m in 2025. The increase is primarily due to  increased net borrowing costs given increased average net debt following last year's share buy back and movements on derivatives.</p><p>Adjusted net finance costs reflected in adjusted earnings in 2025 was £57m, compared to a net cost of £45m in 2024. The increase is primarily due to increased net borrowing costs given increased average net debt following last year's share buy back and movements on derivatives.</p><p>In 2025, the total of items excluded from adjusted earnings was net income of £7m compared to net income of £14m in 2024. For a reconciliation of the adjusted measure see note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.</p><p><b>Taxation</b></p><p>The reported tax on statutory earnings in 2025 was a charge of £121m compared to a charge of £75m in 2024. This equates to an effective tax rate of 26.5% (2024: 14.7%), with the increase from prior year principally due to the release of the State Aid uncertain tax provision in the prior year.</p><p>The total adjusted tax charge in 2025 was £136m (2024: £136m), corresponding to an effective tax rate on adjusted profit before tax of 24.5% (2024: 24.4%). For a reconciliation of the adjusted measure see note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.</p><p>In 2025, there was a net tax payment of £2m (2024: £119m net tax payment). This includes a £97m receipt from HMRC in respect of the State Aid matter, with an additional £17m of associated interest also received in the period. The interest element is classified within interest received in the cash flow statement. This repayment is a result of the <org>Court of Justice</org> of the <org>European Union</org> handing down its decision on <chron>19 September 2024</chron> determining that the <location value=\"LC/gb\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >United Kingdom</location> controlled foreign company group financing partial exemption did not constitute State Aid, thereby resulting in a refund of the £97m of tax paid (plus £17m of interest) under the Charging Notices issued by HMRC in 2021. The balance excluding the State Aid repayment, principally relates to tax payments in the US and the UK, and decreased due to lower tax liabilities and installment payments for 2025.</p><p>A net deferred tax liability of £31m is recognised in 2025 compared to a net deferred tax liability of £11m in 2024. The overall amount increased mainly due to the ongoing utilisation of tax losses and other tax attributes. The current tax creditor principally consists of provisions for tax uncertainties.</p><p><b>Other comprehensive income</b></p><p>Included in other comprehensive income are the net exchange differences on translation of foreign operations. The loss on translation of £193m in 2025 compares to a loss in 2024 of £35m. The loss in 2025 arises from an overall weakening of the majority of currencies to which the Group is exposed, in particular the US dollar. A significant proportion of the Group's operations are based in the US and the US dollar closing rate at <chron>31 December 2025</chron> was £1:<money>$1.35</money> compared to the opening rate of £1:<money>$1.25</money>. At the end of 2024, the US dollar rate was £1:<money>$1.25</money> compared to the opening rate of £1:<money>$1.27</money>.</p><p>Also included in other comprehensive income at <chron>31 December 2025</chron> is an actuarial gain of £10m in relation to retirement benefit obligations. The gain arises largely from a decrease in liabilities driven by lower long-term inflation assumptions and updates to commutation factors. The gain in 2025 compares to an actuarial gain in 2024 of £5m.</p><p>Fair value losses of £7m (2024: losses of £2m) have been recognised in other comprehensive income and relate to movements in the value of investments in unlisted securities held at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).</p><p><b>Cash flow and working capital </b></p><p>Our operating cash flow measure is used to align cash flows with our adjusted profit measures (see note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements). Operating cash flow decreased on a headline basis by £91m from an inflow of £662m in 2024 to an inflow of £571m in 2025 due to an increase in working capital given high Q4 sales growth.</p><p>The equivalent statutory measure, net cash generated from operations, was an inflow of £731m in 2025 compared to an inflow of £811m in 2024. Compared to operating cash flow, this measure includes reorganisation costs but does not include regular dividends from associates. It also excludes capital expenditure on property, plant, equipment and software, and additions to right of use assets as well as disposal proceeds from the sale of property, plant, equipment and right of use assets (including the impacts of transfers to/from investment in finance lease receivable). In 2025, reorganisation cash outflow was £nil compared to £8m in 2024.</p><p>Free cash flow increased on a headline basis by £37m from £490m in 2024 to £527m in 2025. When compared to operating cash flow, free cash flow includes tax paid/received, net finance costs paid and net costs paid for major reorganisation. The increase year on year is mainly due to the receipt of monies in respect of the State Aid tax matter offset by the reduction in operating cash flow.</p><p>In 2025, there was an overall decrease of £210m in cash and cash equivalents from £543m at the end of 2024 to £333m at <chron>31 December 2025</chron>. The decrease in 2025 is primarily due to the net cash generated from operations of £731m being more than offset by dividends paid of £160m, share buyback programme payments of £352m, own share purchases of £72m, capital expenditure on property, plant, equipment and software of £134m, payments for the acquisition of subsidiaries of £167m, and payments of lease liabilities of £77m.</p><p><b>Liquidity and capital resources</b></p><p>The Group's net debt increased from £853m at the end of 2024 to £1,069m at the end of 2025. The increase is largely due to free cash flow of £527m being more than offset by the share buyback programme, dividend payments and cash outflows related to acquisitions. In <chron>May 2025</chron>, the Group repaid its €300m bond and closed out various related derivatives. In <chron>June 2025</chron>, the Group secured a new three-year, <money>$800 million</money> revolving credit facility (RCF). This facility can be utilised for general corporate purposes, enhancing our liquidity, and is in addition to the Group's existing RCF. At <chron>31 December 2025</chron>, the Group had drawn £0.3bn on its Revolving Credit Facilities.</p><p>At <chron>31 December 2025</chron>, the Group had approximately £1.3bn in total liquidity immediately available from cash and its RCFs maturing <chron>June 2028</chron> and <chron>February 2029</chron>. In assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern for the period until <chron>30 June 2027</chron>, the Board analysed a variety of downside scenarios, including a severe but plausible scenario, where the Group is impacted by a combination of all principal risks from H1 2026, as well as reverse stress testing to identify what would be required to either breach covenants or run out of liquidity. The severe but plausible scenario modelled a severe reduction in revenue, profit and operating cash flow from risks continuing throughout 2026 and 2027. In all scenarios, the Group would maintain comfortable liquidity headroom and sufficient headroom against covenant requirements during the period under assessment even before modelling the mitigating effect of actions that management would take in the event that these downside risks were to crystallise. The directors concluded that the likelihood of the reverse stress test scenario was remote.</p><p><b>Post-retirement benefits</b></p><p>Pearson operates a variety of pension and post-retirement plans. <org>The UK Group</org> pension plan has by far the largest defined benefit section. This plan has a strong funding position and a surplus with a very substantially de-risked investment portfolio including approximately 50% of the assets in buy-in contracts. We have some smaller defined benefit sections in the US and <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> but, outside the UK, most of the companies operate defined contribution plans.</p><p>The charge to profit in respect of worldwide pensions and retirement benefits amounted to £43m in 2025 (2024: £60m) of which a charge of £68m (2024: £81m) was reported in operating profit and income of £25m (2024: £21m) was reported against other net finance costs. In 2024, a charge of £13m related to one-off discretionary pension increases was excluded from adjusted operating profit, with no such amounts in 2025.</p><p>The overall surplus on <org>UK Group</org> pension plans of £484m at the end of 2024 has increased to a surplus of £514m at the end of 2025. The increase has arisen principally due to asset returns being higher than expected  and inflation over the period being slightly lower than was expected at the beginning of the year. In total, our worldwide net position in respect of pensions and other post-retirement benefits increased from a net asset of £450m at the end of 2024 to a net asset of £482m at the end of 2025.</p><p><b>Businesses acquired and disposed</b></p><p>On <chron>24 July 2025</chron>, the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of eDynamic <org>Holdings LP</org> ('eDynamic Learning'), a leading Career and Technical Education (CTE) curriculum solutions provider for cash consideration of £168m. For further details, see note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.</p><p>The cash outflow in 2025 relating to the acquisition of subsidiaries of £167m includes £4m arising from the payment of deferred consideration in respect of the prior year. The cash outflow in 2024 relating to acquisitions of subsidiaries was £39m, arising from the payment of deferred consideration in respect of prior year acquisitions, mainly Credly and Mondly, which were acquired in 2022. In addition, there was a cash outflow relating to investments of £5m (2024: £7m).</p><p>The Group disposed of <person>Copp Clark</person> in 2025 for consideration of £9m, resulting in a gain on disposal of £8m, which has been recorded within other net gains and losses. There were no disposals of subsidiaries in 2024 with cash outflows relating primarily to prior year disposals. In 2025, the cash inflow relating to the disposal of businesses was £8m (2024: outflow of £7m).</p><p><b>Dividends</b></p><p>The dividend accounted for in the 2025 financial statements totalling £160m represents the final dividend in respect of 2024 of 16.6p and the interim dividend for 2025 of 7.8p.  We are proposing a final dividend for 2025 of 17.4p bringing the total paid and payable in respect of 2025 to 25.2p.This final 2025 dividend, which was approved by the Board in <chron>February 2026</chron>, is subject to approval at the forthcoming AGM. For 2025, the dividend is covered 2.6 times by adjusted earnings.</p><p>The final dividend will be paid on <chron>8 May 2026</chron> to shareholders who are on the register of members at close of business on <chron>20 March 2026</chron> (the Record Date). Shareholders may elect to reinvest their dividend in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP). The last date for receipt of DRIP elections and revocations will be <chron>16 April 2026</chron>. A Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) is provided by our Registrar, <org>Computershare Investor Services</org>. The DRIP enables the Company's shareholders to elect to have their cash dividend payments used to purchase the Company's shares. More information can be found at www.computershare.com/Investor.</p><p><b>Share buyback</b></p><p>On <chron>27 February 2025</chron>, the Board approved a £350m share buyback programme in order to return capital to shareholders. The programme completed in 2025. During 2025, c32m shares have been bought back at a cash cost of £352m. The nominal value of the cancelled shares of £8m has been transferred to the capital redemption reserve.</p><p>On <chron>21 January 2026</chron>, a further £350m share buyback programme was announced. The programme commenced on <chron>21 January 2026</chron>. In the period from 21 January to <chron>25 February 2026</chron>, an additional c7m of shares have been repurchased.</p><div><table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\"

2025</chron></b></p><p><u><b>1.     Basis of preparation</b></u></p><p>The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in the 2024 Annual Report, which has been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards and have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the <org>International Accounting Standards Board</org> (IASB). There are no changes to accounting standards that have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended <chron>31 December 2025</chron>. The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) at fair value.</p><p>In assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern for the period to <chron>30 June 2027</chron>, the Board analysed a variety of downside scenarios, including a severe but plausible scenario, where the Group is impacted by a combination of all principal risks from by all principal risks in both 2026 and 2027, adjusted for probability weighting, as well as reverse stress testing to identify what would be required to either breach covenants or run out of liquidity. The net impact of the risks modelled in the severe but plausible scenario was to reduce free cashflow during the period under assessment by c41%.  </p><p>At <chron>31 December 2025</chron>, the Group had available liquidity of c£1.3bn, comprising central cash balances and the undrawn element of its <money>$1.8bn</money> Revolving Credit Facilities maturing <chron>June 2028</chron> and <chron>February 2029</chron>, but which have options to extend the maturities until 2030. Even under a severe downside case, the Group would maintain comfortable liquidity headroom and sufficient headroom against covenant requirements during the period under assessment. That is, even before modelling the mitigating effect of actions that management would take in the event that these downside risks were to crystallise. The directors concluded that the likelihood of the reverse stress test scenario was remote.</p><p>The directors have confirmed that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence and to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the assessment period to <chron>30 June 2027</chron>. The condensed consolidated financial statements have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis.</p><p>The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting assumptions. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas requiring a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the condensed consolidated financial statements, have been set out in the 2024 Annual Report. In 2025, the valuation of acquired intangible assets recognised on the acquisition of a business is also determined to be a key area of estimation.</p><p>The Group has also assessed the impact of the uncertainty presented by the volatile macro-economic and geo-political environment on the condensed consolidated financial statements, specifically considering the impact on key judgements and significant estimates along with other areas of increased risk including financial instruments, hedge accounting and translation methodologies. No material accounting impacts relating to the areas assessed were recognised in 2025. The Group has assessed the impacts of climate change on the condensed consolidated financial statements. The assessment did not identify any material impact on the Group's significant judgements or estimates, the recoverability of the Group's assets at <chron>31 December 2025</chron> or the assessment of going concern for the period to <chron>30 June 2027</chron>. The Group will continue to monitor these areas of increased judgement, estimation and risk for material changes.</p><p>The financial information for the year ended <chron>31 December 2024</chron> does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for that year has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The independent auditors' report on the full consolidated financial statements for the year ended <chron>31 December 2024</chron> was unqualified and did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph or any statement under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.</p><p><b>NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<br /></b><b>for the year ended <chron>31 December 2025</chron></b></p><p><u><b>1.     Basis of preparation </b><i>continued</i></u></p><p>This preliminary announcement does not constitute the Group's full consolidated financial statements for the year ended <chron>31 December 2025</chron>.

Accordingly, the financial information for 2025 is presented unaudited in the preliminary announcement.</p><p>Operating segments – In <chron>January 2025</chron>, the Group announced that Workforce Skills would evolve to become Enterprise Learning and Skills, incorporating our IT Pro business which was previously within Higher Education. Comparative figures for 2024 segment information have been restated to reflect this move between segments (see note 2).</p><p><u><b>2.     Segment information</b></u></p><p>The Group has five main global business units, which are each considered separate operating segments for management and reporting purposes. These five business units are Assessment &amp; Qualifications, Virtual Learning, English Language Learning, Higher Education and Enterprise Learning and Skills. In <chron>January 2025</chron>, the Group announced that Workforce Skills would evolve to become Enterprise Learning and Skills, incorporating our IT Pro business which was previously within Higher Education.

The measure includes the operating profit from the total business but excludes charges for acquired intangibles amortisation and impairment, acquisition related costs, gains and losses arising from disposals, the cost of major reorganisation and associated property charges, one off-costs related to the UK pension scheme and certain other one-off material items.</p><p>Costs of major reorganisation – In 2025, there are no costs of major reorganisation.  In 2024, there was a release of £2m relating to amounts previously accrued.</p><p>Product development impairment charges in 2025 relate to the impairment of product development assets as a result of courseware platform convergence. There were no such amounts in 2024.</p><p>Intangible charges – These represent charges relating to intangibles acquired through business combinations. These charges are excluded as they reflect past acquisition activity and do not necessarily reflect the current year performance of the Group.</p><p>UK pension discretionary increases – Charges in 2024 related to one-off pension increases awarded to certain cohorts of pensioners in response to the cost of living crisis. There were no such amounts in 2025.</p><p>Other net gains and losses – These represent profits and losses on the sale of subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and other financial assets and are excluded from adjusted operating profit in order to show the performance of the Group on a more comparable basis year on year. Other net gains and losses also includes costs related to business closures and acquisitions. Other net gains and losses in 2025 relate to the gain on disposal of <person>Copp Clark</person>, a business in our Higher Education division, a fair value gain relating to a previous disposal and  costs relating to current and prior year acquisitions and disposals. Other net gains and losses in 2024 related to costs related to prior year acquisitions and disposals, partially offset by a gain on the partial disposal of our investment in an associate.</p><p>Property charges – In 2025, a gain of £25m relates to reversals of impairments of property assets that were previously impaired through property charges. Impairment reversals have arisen from new sublets on previously vacant space in corporate properties. There are no such charges in 2024.</p><p>Adjusted operating profit should not be regarded as a complete picture of the Group's financial performance. For example, adjusted operating profit includes the benefits of major reorganisation programmes but excludes the significant associated costs, and adjusted operating profit excludes costs related to acquisitions, and the amortisation of intangibles acquired in business combinations, but does not exclude the associated revenues. The Group's definition of adjusted operating profit may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies.</p><p><b>NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

income statement presentation does not reflect the economic substance of the underlying assets and liabilities. Also excluded are interest costs relating to acquisition or disposal transactions as it is considered part of the acquisition cost or disposal proceeds rather than being reflective of the underlying financing costs of the Group. Foreign exchange, fair value movements on investments classified as FVTPL and other gains and losses on derivatives are excluded from adjusted earnings as they represent short-term fluctuations in market value and are subject to significant volatility. Other gains and losses may not be realised in due course as it is normally the intention to hold the related instruments to maturity. Interest on certain tax provisions is excluded from our adjusted measure in order to mirror the treatment of the underlying tax item.</p><p><b>NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Based on the most recent financial information available for the constituent entities in the Group, the Pillar Two effective tax rates in most of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates are above 15%. There are a limited number of jurisdictions where the transitional safe harbour relief does not apply, including jurisdictions that may not meet the 16% effective tax rate threshold required to qualify for the effective tax rate safe harbour test in FY25. However, the Group does not expect a material exposure to Pillar Two income taxes in those jurisdictions.</p><p>In 2025, a repayment of £97m was received from HMRC in respect of State Aid. This repayment is a result of the <org>Court of Justice</org> of the <org>European Union</org> handing down its decision on <chron>19 September 2024</chron> determining that the <location value=\"LC/gb\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >United Kingdom</location> controlled foreign company group financing partial exemption did not constitute State Aid, thereby resulting in a refund of the £97m of tax paid (plus interest) under the Charging Notices issued by HMRC in 2021.</p><p><u><b>5.     Earnings per share</b></u></p><p>Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders of the company (earnings) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the company and held as treasury shares.

EBITDA was above the midpoint of our guidance and we produced a solid 21% EBITDA margin. We converted over 80% of EBITDA to cash – a further demonstration of our consistent improvement in working capital management and operational efficiency. After paying over €370 million to our shareholders in 2025, we returned our balance sheet to a net cash position in December.</i></p>  <p align=\"justify\"><i>“From this solid financial base, we will deliver on our commitment to be one of the most shareholder friendly companies in our peer group. We are targeting returns to shareholders of approximately €650 million between January and <chron>August 2026</chron>, a nearly €280 million increase versus 2025. We have adopted a balanced distribution framework, limiting warrant dilution through buybacks, growing distributions through a targeted interim dividend payment of €1.75 per share in August</i><sup><i>b</i></sup><i>, and maintaining a defensive balance sheet.</i></p>  <p align=\"justify\"><i>“Reflecting on our 2025 results, I am pleased with the many milestones we have achieved. After reaching zero net debt at the end of 2024, we paid a substantial dividend to shareholders for the first time in a decade in 2025. We significantly narrowed the profitability gap with our primary peer to the lowest level since we embarked on the New Vallourec Plan in early 2022. Finally, our consistent improvement in profitability and financial resilience was recognized with Investment Grade credit ratings across all three rating agencies. </i></p>  <p align=\"justify\"><i>“Our focus in 2026 turns to profitable growth through targeted R&amp;D and capital investments to solve the energy challenges of today and tomorrow. In doing so, we will remain committed to our core principles of value over volume and operational excellence. We are investing in value-added capacity enhancements, including our new high-torque threading line in the US and advanced coating capabilities like our Cleanwell® solution. Meanwhile, we are progressing our ambitions in New Energies, with a recently-announced partnership with XGS Energy in the advanced geothermal arena, and a memorandum of understanding with Baker Hughes in the hydrogen space. We are seeing particularly strong momentum in geothermal markets as the industry searches for ways to deliver clean baseload power to meet rapidly growing energy demand, which is accentuated by rapid growth in artificial intelligence and energy</i><i>‑</i><i>intensive data centers. </i></p>  <p align=\"justify\"><i>“In the US, our assets remain highly-utilized and recent booking activity remains strong. Industry pricing has softened slightly, but we are encouraged by the downward trend in imports due to Section 232 tariffs and the resilience of our customers’ activity. In International markets, commercial activity remained subdued in the second half of 2025. In the <location value=\"LR/mde\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Middle East</location> we are seeing signs of acceleration – especially in markets with higher levels of unconventional activity.</i></p>  <p align=\"justify\"><i>“We see potential for activity to increase in the second semester and beyond as the oil market rebalances, gas-related activity increases and the acceleration of depletion necessitates investments to maintain and grow production.”</i></p>  <p align=\"justify\">The consolidated financial statements are included in the pdf version of the press release.</p>  <p align=\"justify\"><b>Key Quarterly Data</b></p> <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

We are growing more concerned about the aggressive accounting practices (slowing growth amid buybacks reducing cash levels) and ongoing carousel of management turnover, especially at the CFO level. This is on top of additional concerns tied to the increasing competitive landscape (e.g., Amazon.com Inc.) and recent deceleration in growth. Still, we like secular growth opportunities tied to TTD, its attractive margin profile, and see valuation as attractive. We like prospects for the programmable ad space as advertisers look to find more effective data-driven targeting strategies. We see TTD benefiting from several growth catalysts, including connected TV (CTV), expansion of its international business, and a growing retail media opportunity.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.
