Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We keep our <money>$250</money> target, on a P/E of ~24x our CY 27 EPS view of <money>$10.31</money>, above peers/below historical. We lift our FY 27 EPS  to <money>$8.15</money> from <money>$7.80</money> and  FY 28  to <money>$10.31</money> from <money>$10.00</money>. We believe that NVDA's growth is being supported by rising hyperscaler capex (over half of sales), but we think investors need to see greater signs of successful AI monetization from its customer base in a year where CEO Jensen Huang sees Agentic AI at an inflection point. The bar undoubtedly increases, as NVDA makes the case that compute equals revenue for their customers to justify the higher spend. We do expect sequential growth to slow in 2H (tougher comps) but think this is already discounted in shares, while Physical AI/Sovereign AI offers long term upside. We no longer assume NVDA will gain considerable traction in <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> while Rubin appears on pace to ramp in 2H. We think investors continue to underestimate NVDA's content growth potential but also acknowledge bottleneck risks from memory/power.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

            "description": "\n<p><location value=\"LU/be..brussl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >BRUSSELS</location>, <chron>Feb.  26, 2026</chron>  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Aikido Security today unveiled Aikido Infinite, the industry’s first continuous AI penetration testing solution that autonomously validates and remediates vulnerabilities. Infinite reduces risk at every release by testing software changes as they move through deployment, confirming exploitability, and fixing vulnerabilities within the same workflow. With Infinite, Aikido is defining a new approach to software security: self-securing software.</p>  <p>Traditional penetration testing relies on manual or point-in-time assessments, often delivered weeks after software has already shipped. In a recent survey of 500 security and engineering leaders conducted by Aikido, 76% reported deploying significant production changes weekly or faster, yet only 21% validate security on every release. Meanwhile, 85% report that security findings are outdated by the time final reports are delivered.<br/><br/>While newer tools have introduced faster, AI-driven testing, these solutions are often riddled with false positives, do not truly operate autonomously, and stop short of remediation. Aikido Infinite closes this gap. Security teams can expand their capacity with elite hacking agents dedicated to finding security holes in every single piece of code that is pushed, 24/7.</p>  <p>“For years, organizations have been working around the limitations of traditional testing and DAST because there was nothing better available,” said Willem Delbare, co-founder and CEO of Aikido. “Software delivery is now continuous, but security testing isn’t. Infinite completely changes that. This is the beginning of self-securing software.”</p>  <p>Each software change triggers agentic pentesting agents that discover risk, validate exploitability, apply remediation where safe, and retest to confirm risk reduction. Instead of relying on periodic engagements, teams gain a continuous feedback loop that operates alongside deployment, not after it. This level of exhaustiveness would be difficult to replicate even with the largest in-house security teams, whose resources do not scale in proportion to the expanding attack surface and pace of change.</p>  <p>“As software delivery cycles shorten and change becomes constant, point-in-time security models no longer reflect how modern systems operate,” said <person>Katie Norton</person>, Research Manager, DevSecOps and Software Supply Chain Security at IDC. “We are beginning to see early signs of a more autonomous security approach, where exploitability validation and remediation are embedded directly into the software lifecycle. Aikido Infinite reflects this shift by combining continuous testing with remediation capabilities inside a unified platform.”</p>  <p>Infinite utilizes two main resources for its attack. First, Aikido's code-to-runtime platform gives it deep context from the organization's source code, application architecture, and internal logic flows. Then, agents autonomously pursue every possible route of attack across the application’s total surface area, identifying undocumented endpoints, hidden logic paths, complex multi-step edge cases, and architectural anomalies that are often unknown by testers today or too time-consuming for manual testers to address. Aikido Infinite learns from every finding on each deployment, providing a continuous feedback loop that developers can then use to improve code security even before commit.</p>  <p>Built on Aikido’s model-agnostic architecture, Infinite combines advanced AI with proprietary exploit validation and controlled runtime execution. Aikido Infinite is the company's flagship product and the realization of the company’s vision for building self-securing software, shifting security from a reactive process to an embedded, continuous loop. Infinite builds on Aikido Attack, the company’s on-demand AI penetration testing offering that deploys hundreds of specialized agents to hunt vulnerabilities like hackers, validate exploitability, and provide built-in remediation.</p>  <p>Aikido’s AI pentesting capability is already uncovering complex vulnerabilities in apps and frameworks that had previously gone undetected by experts. When combined with in-house expertise, teams achieve a previously unattainable improvement in security posture.</p>  <p>For more information, please visit https://www.aikido.dev/.</p>  <p><strong>About Aikido Security</strong><br/>Founded in Ghent, <location value=\"LC/be\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Belgium</location>, Aikido Security is building self-securing software for modern development teams. Aikido's unified security platform secures code, cloud and runtime, helping teams to reduce risk without slowing down development.

Gross margin was slightly below ACM’s long-term business model target range of 42% to 48% due in part to product mix, competitive dynamics for a few semi-critical products, and inventory-related charges.

These supplemental measures exclude the impact of stock-based compensation, which ACM does not believe is indicative of its core operating results. In addition, non-GAAP net income attributable to <org value=\"ACMR.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >ACM Research, Inc.</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='ACMR' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( ACMR )</span> and basic and diluted earnings per share exclude the effect of stock-based compensation and unrealized gain (loss) on short-term investments, which ACM also believes are not indicative of its core operating results. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided below under “Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Financial Measures.”</p>  <p align=\"justify\">ACM believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in assessing its operating performance. ACM uses these financial measures internally to evaluate its operating performance and for planning and forecasting of future periods. Financial analysts may focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on the non-GAAP financial measures. ACM also believes it is in the best interests of investors for ACM to provide this non-GAAP information.</p>  <p align=\"justify\">While ACM believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be reported by competitors, and they may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to differences in calculation methodologies. The non-GAAP financial measures are not an alternative to GAAP information and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures. They should be used only as a supplement to GAAP information and should be considered only in conjunction with ACM’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.</p>  <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p>  <p align=\"justify\">Certain statements contained in this press release are not historical facts and may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

With this acquisition, if completed, we will strengthen our armamentarium to reverse oncology drug resistance – by implementing therapeutics that specifically target resistance mutations that arise from targeting the EGFR receptor. Importantly, our established clinical consortia on the <location>West Coast</location>, anchored at <org>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center</org> in <location value=\"LU/us.ca.losang\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Los Angeles</location>, provides us with the clinical infrastructure and expertise to rapidly initiate and execute Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies for both compounds.”\n\n</p><p>\n<org value=\"KAPA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Kairos Pharma</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='KAPA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( KAPA )</span> believes the scientific rationale for combining a pan-EGFR inhibitor with a c-MET inhibitor in non-small cell lung cancer as demonstrated with these two assets is compelling and well-validated clinically. MET amplification represents one of the most important resistance mechanisms in EGFR-mutant NSCLC, and the ability to address both pathways with highly selective, brain-penetrant molecules represents a significant therapeutic advance. The Company anticipates that CL-273's wild-type-sparing profile and broad coverage of EGFR mutations, combined with CL-741's potent and selective c-MET inhibition, upon acquisition, will position it to develop best-in-class monotherapies as well as a differentiated combination regimen. Mechanistically, dual inhibition of EGFR and MET pathways can overcome compensatory signaling that drives resistance, deepens tumor responses, and extends progression-free survival in this difficult-to-treat patient population.\n\n</p><p>\nKinase inhibitors for cancer treatment were estimated to be valued at <money>$60.7B</money> in 2025. Of these, EGFR inhibitors represented 32.5% of the market in 2025 (<i>Future Market Insights</i>).\n\n</p><p>\nCL-273, developed using a proprietary AI-driven drug discovery platform, targets the EGFR mutated lung cancer treatment, a market valued at <money>$16.2B</money> in 2026 (<i>Future Market Insights</i>). EGFR mutations are present in approximately 10-15% of NSCLC cases in Western populations and up to 50% in Asian populations (<i>CoherentMI</i>), creating a substantial addressable patient population for targeted therapies.\n\n</p><p>\nCL-741 addresses the cMet inhibitor market which is experiencing rapid growth, valued at more than <money>$2B</money> and projected to reach over <money>$10B</money> by 2030 with a CAGR in excess of 17% <i>(Biospace</i>). The c-MET metastatic NSCLC market represents a high-value niche with significant unmet medical needs, with c-MET amplification being a critical resistance mechanism for EGFR-targeted therapies. C-MET alterations, including MET exon 14 skipping mutations and MET amplification, is a driver of multiple cancer types inclusive of gastric, liver, and renal cancer.\n\n</p><p>\n\"Our proprietary AI-driven drug design platform has enabled the discovery of a highly efficacious, wild-type-sparing, pan-mutant EGFR inhibitor. This molecule offers a 4-to-5-fold broader safety margin than current competitive inhibitors,\" stated <person>Nikolay Savchuk</person>, Ph.D., CEO of Celyn Therapeutics. \"By partnering with <org value=\"KAPA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Kairos Pharma</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='KAPA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( KAPA )</span> and leveraging their clinical consortia at <org>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center</org>, we are positioned to rapidly advance CL-273 and CL-741. This collaboration combines Kairos’s operational expertise with our innovative pipeline to create an optimal pathway for patients fighting EGFR-mutant and c-MET-driven lung cancers.\"\n\n</p><p>\nClinical studies have demonstrated that combination treatment with EGFR and MET inhibitors for EGFR-mutant, MET-amplified NSCLC patients is able to achieve progression-free survival of approximately 7 months, representing a significant advance over single-agent therapy (<i>SAVANNAH trial</i>).\n\n</p><p>\nCL-273 is an investigational, reversible, wild-type-sparing pan-EGFR small-molecule inhibitor specifically engineered for EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Preclinical data demonstrate that CL-273 maintains broad-spectrum activity against classical EGFR mutations including Exon 19 and 21 deletions and Exon 20 insertions, atypical mutations, and resistance-associated variants that bypass currently approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).\n\n</p><p>\nA defining feature of CL-273 is its exceptional selectivity index. By sparing wild-type EGFR, studies to date have shown CL-273 offers a 4–5 fold wider therapeutic window, suggesting significantly improved safety and tolerability over existing therapies. Designed for high brain and lung permeability to address metastatic disease, CL-273 possesses favorable ADME properties and has successfully completed GLP toxicology studies. The program is currently pre-IND, with first-in-human clinical trials projected to commence in 2026.\n\n</p><p>\nCL-741 is an orally available, small-molecule, type IIb c-MET kinase inhibitor designed to be highly selective for c-MET with broad coverage of activating and acquired resistance mutations in solid tumors. The compound was discovered as a drug-like lead with potent activity across multiple c-MET resistance mutants and is being developed for c-MET-driven advanced solid tumors, with a primary focus on non-small cell lung cancers harboring MET exon 14 skipping alterations and MET amplification.\n\n</p><p>\nThe acquisition of both CL-273 and CL-741, if the acquisition is successfully completed, are anticipated to enable <org value=\"KAPA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Kairos Pharma</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='KAPA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( KAPA )</span> to pursue a differentiated dual-target strategy addressing both primary EGFR mutations and MET-mediated resistance mechanisms. MET amplification is one of the most common mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs.\n\n</p><p>\nDeveloping CL-273 and CL-741 together provides a rational combination therapy approach for EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who either harbor baseline MET amplification/overexpression or acquire MET-driven resistance on EGFR-TKI therapy. Combined EGFR and MET inhibition has already demonstrated meaningful clinical response rates and survival benefit with other agents in this setting. Pairing CL-273 with CL-741 could deepen and prolong responses, reduce outgrowth of MET-mediated escape clones, and potentially expand the addressable population of MET-dependent, EGFR-mutant tumors.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>About <org value=\"KAPA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Kairos Pharma, Ltd.</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='KAPA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( KAPA )</span></b>\n\n</p><p>\nBased in <location value=\"LU/us.ca.losang\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Los Angeles, California</location>, <org value=\"KAPA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Kairos Pharma Ltd.</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='KAPA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( KAPA )</span> is at the forefront of oncology therapeutics, utilizing structural biology to overcome drug resistance and immune suppression in cancer.

Despite only limited drilling in the 1980s, we are impressed by the exceptional grade-thickness gold hits of up to 60 gram-metres, which we consider highly anomalous given the shallow and sparse nature of that program.

Without regular application of these coatings, engines cannot be used.</p>\n<p>Since Reuters first reported about yttrium shortages in November, prices have jumped 60% and are now about 69 times as high as a year ago. Some coatings manufacturers are also now starting to ration material, according to company executives and traders.</p>\n<p>Executives at two North American firms that buy yttrium to make coatings told Reuters they have needed to temporarily pause production due to shortages.

Although the capacity milestone was reached 5 weeks later than initially planned, the Company accelerated operational execution throughout the second half of the year, achieving production records across all operations. While full year’s revenue was below expectations, execution accelerated significantly with record fourth quarter revenue and year-over-year shipments increasing 659%.</p>    <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Indensity<sup><strong>™</strong></sup></strong><strong> Launch </strong><br/>The Company continued to advance its technology and market positioning with the launch of Eos Indensity™, a next-generation stackable energy storage architecture engineered to deliver up to 1 GWh of storage per acre, or roughly four times the density of many incumbent battery technologies. Indensity applies Spatial Intelligence configurations to provide both horizontal and vertical site layouts, enhancing site flexibility, safety, and adaptability to meeting diverse load profiles. On an installed $/kWh basis, Indensity is designed to be cost competitive with incumbent storage technologies while delivering long-duration performance and non-flammable chemistry advantages.</p>    <p><strong>Commercial Growth</strong></p>    <p align=\"justify\">In 2025, Eos continued to build momentum, laying the groundwork and establishing strategic commercial relationships with leading entities across the energy, infrastructure, and hyperscale sectors. The Company ended the year with a backlog of <money>$701.5 million</money>, booking over <money>$240 million</money> in new orders in the fourth quarter across 8 customers and 9 projects representing nearly 1.1 GWh of contracted volume. Demand was broad based across commercial and industrial, distributed generation portfolios, and large front of the meter utility scale projects. The 9% increase from the end of the third quarter includes shipments, new order bookings, and backlog adjustments.</p>    <p><strong>Strengthened Balance Sheet </strong></p>    <p align=\"justify\">In the fourth quarter, the Company significantly strengthened its liquidity and capital structure through the completion of a convertible senior notes offering and a concurrent registered direct common stock offering, generating approximately <money>$580.5 million</money> and <money>$458.2 million</money> in proceeds.</p>    <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Key outcomes: </strong></p>    <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Retired <money>$200 million</money> of the 2030 convertible notes</li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Reduced annual interest expense by approximately <money>$3 million</money></li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Added approximately <money>$474 million</money> of new net cash</li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Extended all corporate debt maturities to 2030 and beyond<br/><br/></li></ul>    <p align=\"justify\">Given the Company’s current cash position and ongoing margin improvements, management has concluded that substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern no longer exists.</p>    <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Earnings Conference Call and Webcast</strong><br/>Eos will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2025 results on <chron>February 26, 2026</chron>, at <chron>8:30 a.m. ET</chron>.

Forward-looking statements are based on our management’s beliefs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, them. Because such statements are based on expectations as to future financial and operating results and are not statements of fact, actual results may differ materially from those projected.</p>    <p align=\"justify\">Factors which may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: changes adversely affecting the business in which we are engaged; our ability to forecast trends accurately; our ability to generate cash, service indebtedness and incur additional indebtedness; our ability to raise financing in the future; risks associated with the credit agreement with Cerberus, including risks of default, and dilution of outstanding common stock; consequences for failure to meet milestones and contractual lockup of shares; our customers’ ability to secure project financing; the amount of final tax credits available to our customers or to Eos pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act, including potential impacts from any repeal or modifications of the legislation; the timing and availability of future funding under the <org>Department of Energy Loan Facility</org>; our ability to continue to develop efficient manufacturing processes to scale and to forecast related costs and efficiencies accurately; fluctuations in our revenue and operating results; competition from existing or new competitors; our ability to convert firm order backlog and pipeline to revenue; risks associated with security breaches in our information technology systems; risks related to legal proceedings or claims; risks associated with evolving energy policies in <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location> and other countries and the potential costs of regulatory compliance; risks associated with changes to the U.S. trade environment; our ability to maintain the listing of our shares of common stock on NASDAQ; our ability to grow our business and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with customers and suppliers and retain our management and key employees; risks related to adverse changes in general economic conditions, including inflationary pressures and increased interest rates; risk from supply chain disruptions and other impacts of geopolitical conflict; changes in applicable laws or regulations; the possibility that Eos may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; other factors beyond our control; and other risks and uncertainties.</p>    <p align=\"justify\">The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are also subject to additional risks, uncertainties, and factors, including those more fully described in the Company’s most recent filings with the <org>Securities and Exchange Commission</org>, including the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Further information on potential risks that could affect actual results will be included in the subsequent periodic and current reports and other filings that the Company makes with the <org>Securities and Exchange Commission</org> from time to time.

Our backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to realize from existing agreements with our customers for the sale of our battery energy storage systems and performance of services. The backlog is calculated by adding new orders in the current fiscal period to the backlog as of the end of the prior fiscal period and then subtracting the shipments in the current fiscal period. If the amount of an order is modified or cancelled, we adjust orders in the current period and our backlog accordingly, but do not retroactively adjust previously published backlogs. There is no comparable US-GAAP financial measure to backlog. We believe that the backlog is a useful indicator regarding the future revenue of our Company.</p>    <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Pipeline</strong>. Our pipeline represents projects for which we have submitted technical proposals or non-binding quotes plus letters of intent (“LOI”) or firm commitments from customers. Pipeline does not include lead generation projects.</p>    <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Booked Orders</strong>. Booked orders are orders where we have legally binding agreements with a Purchase Order (“PO”), or Master Supply Agreement (“MSA”) executed by both parties.</p>    <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</strong></p>    <p align=\"justify\">To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed in this earnings release non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit (loss), and adjusted EPS, which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the <org>SEC</org>. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures of the Company’s calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company believes adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit (loss), and adjusted EPS are useful measures in evaluating its financial and operational performance distinct and apart from financing costs, certain non-cash expenses and non-operational expenses.</p>    <p align=\"justify\">We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively may be helpful to our investors in assessing its operating performance. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures and their nearest GAAP equivalents. For example, the Company’s definitions of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Below is a description of the non-GAAP financial information included herein as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. You should review the reconciliations below but not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.</p>    <p align=\"justify\">Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (net loss) attributable to Eos adjusted for interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of debt and derivatives, debt extinguishment, and other non-cash or non-recurring items as determined by management which it does not believe to be indicative of its underlying business trends. Adjusted gross profit (loss) is defined as gross profit (loss) adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EPS is defined as GAAP net loss per common share as adjusted for non-cash stock-based compensation expense change in fair value of debt and derivatives and debt extinguishment per common share.</p>  <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

Our non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our financial performance over multiple periods.\n\n</p><p>\nThe non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are key performance measures that our management uses to assess our operating performance. These non-GAAP measures facilitate internal comparisons of our operating performance on a more consistent basis. We use these performance measures for business planning purposes and forecasting. We believe that these non-GAAP measures enhance an investor’s understanding of our financial performance as they are useful in assessing our operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business.\n\n</p><p>\nThe non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate these measures in the same manner. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. When evaluating the Company’s performance, you should consider adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS alongside other financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, including gross profit or loss, gross margin, net loss, and EPS.\n\n</p><p>\nThe non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. In this press release, we have provided reconciliations of adjusted gross profit to gross profit or loss, adjusted gross margin to gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to corresponding GAAP measures are not available on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the non-cash component of employee compensation expense, changes in our working capital needs, variances in our supply chain, the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be reflective, on a recurring basis, of our ongoing operations, and other such items without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to our results computed in accordance with GAAP. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Forward Looking Statements</b>\n\n</p><p>\nThis press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our actual results may differ from our expectations, estimates, and projections and, consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believe,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” and similar expressions (or the negative versions of such words or expressions) are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, our expectations with respect to financial results, revenue growth, future performance of our ultrasound business and Embedded opportunities (inclusive of co-development, revenue share/commercialization revenue, chip purchases, and/or chip licensing opportunities through the Embedded program), commercialization and plans to deploy our products and services, including expectations regarding the launches of our Compass AI software, our P5 and Apollo chips and fourth-generation technology, finalizing our first commercial HomeCare agreement, development of products and services, and the size and potential growth of current or future markets for our products and services. Forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to us. These forward-looking statements involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Most of these factors are outside our control and are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: our ability to grow and manage growth effectively; the success, cost, and timing of our product and service development activities; the potential attributes and benefits of our products and services; the degree to which our products and services are accepted by healthcare practitioners and patients for their approved uses; our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products, as applicable, and any related restrictions and limitations on the use of any authorized product; our ability to identify, in-license, or acquire additional technology; our ability to maintain our existing license, manufacturing, supply, and distribution agreements; the success, cost, and timing of our efforts to out-license our intellectual property to third parties; our ability to compete with other companies currently marketing or engaged in the development of ultrasound imaging devices, many of which have greater financial and marketing resources than us; changes in applicable laws or regulations; the size and growth potential of the markets for our products and services, and our ability to serve those markets, either alone or in partnership with others; the pricing of our products and services, and reimbursement for medical procedures conducted using our products and services; our estimates regarding expenses, revenue, capital requirements, and needs for additional financing; our financial performance; our ability to attract and retain customers; our ability to manage our growth effectively; our ability to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights; our ability to maintain the listing of our Class A common stock on the <org>New York Stock Exchange</org>; and other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or in subsequent filings that we make with the <org>Securities and Exchange Commission</org>. We caution that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. We caution you not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertake to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n\n</p><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl bwwidth100\">\n<tr>\n<td class=\"bwpadl0\"

By <chron>February 2025</chron>,\n<location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> government had tightened controls on foreign\nproperty purchases.</p>\n<p>The housing scare fed into the broader push to give\nauthorities tools to vet who is behind incoming capital.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>FOREIGN INVESTMENT BILL SUBMITTED IN OCTOBER</p>\n<p>A foreign investment screening bill, long in the works and\nformally submitted to parliament in October, was initially\nconceived partly as a safeguard against any unwanted Chinese\ninvestment. But three of the sources said the focus had shifted\nfollowing Trump's revived <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> ambitions.</p>\n<p>&quot;We are very interested in working with American investors,\nbut not in a way where they try to push certain political\ngoals,&quot; said MP Aqqalu Jerimiassen from the Atassut party, part\nof <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> governing coalition.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> has long sought to diversify its economy,\nprimarily by courting investments in its mining sector. However,\nlimited infrastructure, including a lack of roads connecting the\nregion's 72 towns, extreme climatic conditions, and labour\nshortages, have hampered progress in attracting meaningful\nforeign capital.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/dk\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Denmark</location> has allocated extra money for infrastructure and\nother development initiatives, and the EU has proposed more than\ndoubling its funding. Still, <location>the Arctic</location> nation's economy remains\nstagnant, with growth at just 0.2% in 2025 and a significant\ndeficit in public finances.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>SOME SECTORS WILL NEED MANDATORY SCREENING</p>\n<p>First debated in November, the screening bill is set for\nfurther discussion in April and is expected to be passed that\nmonth. The draft requires foreign investors to disclose the\norigin of their funds and enables authorities to reject deals if\nthe political affiliations or intentions of the investors raise\nconcerns.</p>\n<p>&quot;If someone is working for Trump, we will find out with this\nscreening law. This is about our own security,&quot; Jerimiassen\nadded.</p>\n<p>The proposed bill does not single out specific countries but\nurges cooperation with allies, indicating that American and\nEuropean investors may face less scrutiny compared to Chinese\ncounterparts. However, it grants <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> the authority to\nreview foreign investments considered a threat to security.</p>\n<p>&quot;The purpose of the law is to prevent foreign investments\nfrom posing a threat to <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> security or public order,&quot;\nthe legislation states. In addition, its goal is to enhance the\nsecurity of &quot;<location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> and its allies, including <org>NATO</org> member\nstates&quot;.</p>\n<p>Foreign investments in critical infrastructure, IT and\nclassified data systems, raw materials and mining, hydropower,\nand government-owned companies will require mandatory screening\nunder the proposed law.</p>\n<p>The legislation is limited to areas under <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location>\njurisdiction and does not extend to U.S. military activities on\nthe island, which remain under <location value=\"LC/dk\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Denmark's</location> control.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> has said it has no intention of competing for\ninfluence in <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >GREENLAND</location> STILL WANTS AMERICAN CAPITAL, MP SAYS</p>\n<p>Last month, <person>Drew Horn</person>, a former senior aide in Trump's first\nadministration, announced plans for a multi-billion-dollar data\ncentre in <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> - the kind of project some lawmakers view as\nunderscoring the need for clearer screening rules.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> government said it has not received any\napplications or formal requests related to the proposal.</p>\n<p>Horn, who now leads an investment and advisory firm, told\nReuters the project had no political ties and that he had no\nconcerns about passing any screening requirements in <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>.</p>\n<p>&quot;<location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> wants American capital, but we fear hidden\npolitical motives behind certain U.S. private investors,&quot; said\none member of parliament, speaking anonymously due to the\nsensitivity of the issue.</p>\n<p>Negotiations between <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> and the U.S. over access and\npresence on the island are ongoing, with Trump still insisting\non \"total access\" to the island.</p>\n<p>Business Minister Naaja Nathanielsen told Reuters the\nforeign investment screening law was not drafted in response to\nU.S. interest and that she continued to welcome American\ninvestment.</p>\n<p>However, if negotiations between the U.S. and <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>\nbroke down, she said, &quot;then of course we would need to\nreevaluate our position.

The program honors organizations and technologies that demonstrate excellence, innovation and measurable market impact.\n\n</p><p>\nThe dual Gold recognition highlights Ooma AirDial’s role in helping organizations modernize fire, life-safety, elevator, and other mission-critical communications as telecommunications carriers continue to retire legacy copper networks nationwide.\n\n</p><p>\n“Critical communications infrastructure is undergoing a major transition as copper lines are phased out,” said <person>Jim Gustke</person>, senior vice president of marketing at Ooma. “These awards continue to validate Ooma AirDial’s ability to help organizations maintain reliability, visibility and compliance while transitioning to a more modern, resilient communications architecture.”\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Addressing a Growing Infrastructure Challenge</b>\n\n</p><p>\nOrganizations across commercial real estate, healthcare, education, government and other sectors continue to rely on analog devices originally designed for traditional Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) lines. As carriers accelerate copper retirement and support resources decline, many enterprises are facing increased risk, rising costs and reduced visibility into critical systems.\n\n</p><p>\nOoma AirDial was designed to help organizations transition away from legacy copper infrastructure without requiring replacement of existing endpoint devices, enabling a more controlled and predictable modernization path.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Award-Winning Innovation</b>\n\n</p><p>\nThe Merit Awards judges recognized Ooma AirDial for its combination of cloud-based management, real-time operational visibility, compliance-based architecture, and resilient connectivity architecture.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Key capabilities include:</b>\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\n<b>Remote Device Management</b> which provides centralized visibility into device status, connectivity and call activity across locations.\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Automated alerts</b> that notify teams of emergency calls and power events.\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Patented MultiPath™ technology</b> that simultaneously routes traffic over LTE and wired Ethernet.\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Support for life-safety compliance requirements</b> including NFPA 72 and ASME A17.1 environments.\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\nTogether, these capabilities help shift critical communications management from reactive troubleshooting to proactive monitoring and control.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Building on Industry Recognition</b>\n\n</p><p>\nThe Merit Awards add to a growing list of industry recognition for Ooma AirDial, now recognized as one of the most awarded POTS replacement solutions in the industry. In recent years, the solution has earned recognition from organizations including TMC, Channel Vision, UC Today, <org>Elevator World</org> and FacilitiesNet, reflecting continued market validation across communications and facilities management sectors.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Supporting the Ongoing Copper Transition</b>\n\n</p><p>\nWith copper network retirement accelerating across <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location>, many organizations are now reassessing how legacy voice lines support life-safety and operational systems. Solutions that provide centralized oversight, redundancy and predictable deployment models are becoming increasingly important for multi-site enterprises and public-sector environments.\n\n</p><p>\n“Ooma AirDial was built specifically to help organizations navigate this transition with confidence,” Gustke added. “As the copper sunset continues, visibility and reliability are becoming mission critical for enterprise communications.”\n\n</p><p>\nOoma AirDial is available today for organizations seeking to modernize legacy copper-dependent systems.

            "description": "\n<p><location value=\"LU/dk..cophgn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >COPENHAGEN</location>, <chron>Feb 26</chron> (Reuters) - A surge in property interest from U.S. buyers in Nuuk early last year prompted lawmakers to rush through curbs on foreign purchases and shifted the focus of <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> upcoming foreign-investment screening law, lawmakers and other people familiar with the matter said. </p>\n<p>In <chron>January 2025</chron>, around the time U.S. President Donald Trump renewed his efforts to assert greater control over <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>, lawyers and real estate firms in the capital began receiving multiple inquiries from U.S. buyers, six people familiar with the matter said. </p>\n<p>Until then, foreigners had shown little interest in property in the town of 20,000 people.</p>\n<p>&quot;The most aggressive ones wanted to buy everything available on the market,&quot; said a Nuuk-based lawyer, who requested anonymity.</p>\n<p>BALANCING NEEDS OF ECONOMY WITH POLITICS</p>\n<p>Trump's interest in <location>the Arctic</location> island has left its lawmakers in a dilemma, as they balance the need to attract capital to boost its stagnating economy with a wish to block out U.S. investors they suspect may carry hidden political motives. </p>\n<p>It was not clear who the investors were or whether they were linked to Trump's push for <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>, which is a semi-autonomous part of the Kingdom of <location value=\"LC/dk\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Denmark</location>.</p>\n<p>But the sudden interest alarmed lawmakers, who feared outside buyers could push residents out of Nuuk's already tight housing market, three of the sources said. By <chron>February 2025</chron>, <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> government had tightened controls on foreign property purchases.</p>\n<p>The housing scare fed into the broader push to give authorities tools to vet who is behind incoming capital. </p>\n<p>FOREIGN INVESTMENT BILL SUBMITTED IN OCTOBER</p>\n<p>A foreign investment screening bill, long in the works and formally submitted to parliament in October, was initially conceived partly as a safeguard against any unwanted Chinese investment. But three of the sources said the focus had shifted following Trump's revived <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> ambitions.</p>\n<p>&quot;We are very interested in working with American investors, but not in a way where they try to push certain political goals,&quot; said MP Aqqalu Jerimiassen from the Atassut party, part of <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> governing coalition. </p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> has long sought to diversify its economy, primarily by courting investments in its mining sector. However, limited infrastructure, including a lack of roads connecting the region's 72 towns, extreme climatic conditions, and labour shortages, have hampered progress in attracting meaningful foreign capital.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/dk\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Denmark</location> has allocated extra money for infrastructure and other development initiatives, and the EU has proposed more than doubling its funding. Still, <location>the Arctic</location> nation's economy remains stagnant, with growth at just 0.2% in 2025 and a significant deficit in public finances.</p>\n<p>SOME SECTORS WILL NEED MANDATORY SCREENING</p>\n<p>First debated in November, the screening bill is set for further discussion in April and is expected to be passed that month. The draft requires foreign investors to disclose the origin of their funds and enables authorities to reject deals if the political affiliations or intentions of the investors raise concerns.</p>\n<p>&quot;If someone is working for Trump, we will find out with this screening law. This is about our own security,&quot; Jerimiassen added.</p>\n<p>The proposed bill does not single out specific countries but urges cooperation with allies, indicating that American and European investors may face less scrutiny compared to Chinese counterparts. However, it grants <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> the authority to review foreign investments considered a threat to security.</p>\n<p>&quot;The purpose of the law is to prevent foreign investments from posing a threat to <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> security or public order,&quot; the legislation states. In addition, its goal is to enhance the security of &quot;<location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> and its allies, including <org>NATO</org> member states&quot;.</p>\n<p>Foreign investments in critical infrastructure, IT and classified data systems, raw materials and mining, hydropower, and government-owned companies will require mandatory screening under the proposed law.</p>\n<p>The legislation is limited to areas under <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> jurisdiction and does not extend to U.S. military activities on the island, which remain under <location value=\"LC/dk\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Denmark's</location> control.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> has said it has no intention of competing for influence in <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >GREENLAND</location> STILL WANTS AMERICAN CAPITAL, MP SAYS</p>\n<p>Last month, <person>Drew Horn</person>, a former senior aide in Trump's first administration, announced plans for a multi-billion-dollar data centre in <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> - the kind of project some lawmakers view as underscoring the need for clearer screening rules. </p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> government said it has not received any applications or formal requests related to the proposal.</p>\n<p>Horn, who now leads an investment and advisory firm, told Reuters the project had no political ties and that he had no concerns about passing any screening requirements in <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>.</p>\n<p>&quot;<location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> wants American capital, but we fear hidden political motives behind certain U.S. private investors,&quot; said one member of parliament, speaking anonymously due to the sensitivity of the issue.</p>\n<p>Negotiations between <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> and the U.S. over access and presence on the island are ongoing, with Trump still insisting on \"total access\" to the island.</p>\n<p>Business Minister Naaja Nathanielsen told Reuters the foreign investment screening law was not drafted in response to U.S. interest and that she continued to welcome American investment. </p>\n<p>However, if negotiations between the U.S. and <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> broke down, she said, &quot;then of course we would need to reevaluate our position.

            "description": "\n<p class=\"bwalignc\">\n<i>Latest feature detects anomalous behavior in backup environments, identifying credential-based threats before they become catastrophic breaches</i>\n\n</p>\n<p>    <location value=\"LU/us.ma.burltn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >BURLINGTON, Mass.</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\n<org value=\"NABL.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >N-able, Inc.</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='NABL' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( NABL )</span> , a global cybersecurity company delivering business resilience, today expanded its Anomaly Detection capabilities in Cove Data Protection to combat the surge in identity-driven cyberattacks targeting backup environments. The new functionality delivers real-time alerts when suspicious or unauthorized changes to backup policies are detected – giving customers an early warning system against the credential-based tactics attackers use to disable or corrupt backups before deploying ransomware.\n\n</p><p>\nIdentity-based attacks have become a major driver of successful cyberattacks, with AI making these schemes even more convincing. With stolen or phished credentials, attackers can gain access to backup software and weaken backup policies. The 2025 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report found that roughly 88% of basic web application breaches involved stolen credentials, making it clear how widespread this tactic has become. Once inside, attackers – and sometimes well-intentioned employees - can alter retention policies, exclude critical data from backups, and delete protected devices. These are subtle changes that can go unnoticed for weeks or even months before the attacker triggers the final ransomware event.\n\n</p><p>\nTo give IT teams real-time visibility, Anomaly Detection introduces a vital layer of protection through event-based notifications that highlight these indicators of compromise. This capability notifies users of potential cyberattack signals or misconfigurations before they escalate, allowing organizations to take just-in-time action to safeguard their recovery posture and maintain data resilience. This new capability builds on last year’s Anomaly Detection feature, Honeypots, an always-on defense mechanism designed to detect brute-force attacks on backup infrastructure.\n\n</p><p>\n“It’s no longer just active systems under attack – backups are firmly in the crosshairs,” says <person>Neil Douglas</person>, CIO at Network ROI, a UK-based managed IT services provider. “If attackers gain access to the backup platform, they don’t always strike immediately. They can quietly manipulate backups, alter retention policies, or delete servers, then sit undetected for weeks (or even months). When they finally launch their attack, recovery can be impossible. In the past, we had no visibility into those subtle changes happening behind the scenes. Now, with real-time, event-based alerts for even the smallest alteration, we know the moment something suspicious occurs. That not only protects us from malicious actors but also guards against accidental misconfigurations. It’s a powerful step forward in strengthening our overall data resilience.”\n\n</p><p>\n“A new wave of threats is targeting businesses through stolen identities,” said <person>Chris Groot</person>, General Manager of Cove Data Protection. “Real-time alerts to backup policy changes give customers peace of mind by protecting them from risky changes that could affect recovery, whether that change was caused by attackers or employees. By catching these changes as they happen, organizations can stop identity-driven attacks and misconfigurations before recovery is compromised.\"\n\n</p><p>\nTo learn more about how Anomaly Detection can strengthen your organization’s data resilience, visit our blog.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>About N-able</b>\n\n</p><p>\nN-able protects businesses from evolving cyberthreats.
