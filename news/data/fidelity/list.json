            "description": "<p><location value=\"LU/ca.qc.montrl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >MONTREAL</location>/<location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >BEIJING</location>/<location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >WASHINGTON</location>, <chron>Feb 26</chron> (Reuters) - Suppliers to U.S. aerospace and semiconductor firms face worsening rare earth shortages, with two turning away some clients, industry insiders said, weeks before U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping for a summit in <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location>.</p>\n<p>The shortages center on rare earths such as yttrium and scandium, niche members of the family of 17 elements, which play tiny but vital roles in defence technology, aerospace and semiconductors and are almost entirely produced in <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>.</p>\n<p>While <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location> has allowed many rare earth exports to resume since it imposed restrictions in April, shipments of these materials still rarely make it to the U.S. despite the October detente with <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location>, Chinese customs data show.</p>\n<p>That easing of trade tensions, premised in part on <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> pausing its critical mineral export restrictions, will be on the table when Trump and Xi meet in <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location> in March.</p>\n<p>A key pain point is yttrium, used in coatings that keep engines and turbines from melting at high temperatures. Without regular application of these coatings, engines cannot be used.</p>\n<p>Since Reuters first reported about yttrium shortages in November, prices have jumped 60% and are now about 69 times as high as a year ago. Some coatings manufacturers are also now starting to ration material, according to company executives and traders.</p>\n<p>Executives at two North American firms that buy yttrium to make coatings told Reuters they have needed to temporarily pause production due to shortages. One is also now turning away smaller and offshore customers in order to conserve supply for larger clients, which include certain engine makers.</p>\n<p>Another firm in the coating supply chain recently ran out of material and stopped selling products containing yttrium oxide, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.</p>\n<p>While shortages of yttrium and scandium have not weighed on production of jet engines or chips yet, a U.S. government official told Reuters some U.S. manufacturers now face &quot;shortages&quot; of certain rare earths from <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> exported 17 tons of yttrium products to the U.S. in the eight months after controls were introduced last April versus 333 tons in the eight months before the measures.</p>\n<p>A <org>White House</org> official said the Trump administration is committed to ensuring access to critical minerals for all U.S. businesses. </p>\n<p>&quot;This includes negotiating with <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> and monitoring compliance with President Trump's agreement with President Xi, as well as developing alternative supply chains as warranted.&quot;</p>\n<p>Reuters spoke with two U.S. government officials, 14 company executives and staff, traders and analysts across aerospace and semiconductors. All of them spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity except the analysts named in the story. The North American executives did not want to be named discussing internal production challenges in public. </p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China's</location> <org>Ministry of Commerce</org> did not respond to questions.</p>\n<p>PRODUCTION PRESSURE </p>\n<p>While low yttrium supplies have not hurt engine production, manufacturers remain concerned, said aerospace supply chain specialist <person>Kevin Michaels</person>.</p>\n<p>&quot;This is a watch item and a tangible example of how <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> is flexing its rare earth muscle,&quot; said Michaels, managing director at U.S. consultant AeroDynamic Advisory. </p>\n<p>Enginemakers are already struggling to meet demand for spare parts from airlines and higher production by planemakers <org value=\"BA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Boeing</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BA )</span> and Airbus.</p>\n<p>U.S. aircraft enginemakers <org>GE Aerospace</org>, RTX's Pratt &amp; Whitney and <org value=\"HON.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Honeywell</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='HON' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( HON )</span> declined comment.</p>\n<p>SCARCE SCANDIUM</p>\n<p>In addition to yttrium, U.S. semiconductor makers are running low on scandium, putting production of next-generation 5G chips at risk, said <person>Dylan Patel</person>, founder and CEO of research firm SemiAnalysis. </p>\n<p>With global production of only several tens of tons a year, scandium plays small but important parts in fuel cells, specialty aluminium aerospace alloys and advanced chip processing and packaging.</p>\n<p>Major U.S. semiconductor manufacturers all rely on scandium for making chip components that &quot;go into essentially every 5G smartphone and base station&quot;, Patel said.</p>\n<p>U.S. chipmakers have experienced delays in receiving new scandium export licenses from <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> in recent months and have reached out to <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location> for help, said two industry sources. </p>\n<p>Many of these firms had obtained scandium from third-country suppliers, another U.S. official said, but <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> requires license applicants to declare their end-users.</p>\n<p>&quot;Our thesis is that it is precisely the semi industry being targeted,&quot; the U.S. official said.</p>\n<p><org>The U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association</org> declined to comment.</p>\n<p>&quot;The U.S. currently has zero domestic scandium production and no operational alternative sources outside <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>,&quot; Patel said, adding that stockpiles are likely in months rather than years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p> (Reporting by <person>Allison Lampert</person> in <location value=\"LU/ca.qc.montrl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Montreal</location>; <person>Laurie Chen</person> and <person>Lewis Jackson</person> in <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location>; <person>Michael Martina</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location>; Additional reporting by <person>Fanny Potkin</person> in <location value=\"LC/sg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Singapore</location>, <person>Ernest Scheyder</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.tx.houstn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Houston</location> and <person>Melanie Burton</person> in <location value=\"LU/au..melbou\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Melbourne</location>; Editing by <person>Sonali Paul</person>)</p>\n",

But three of the sources said the focus had shifted\nfollowing Trump's revived <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> ambitions.</p>\n<p>&quot;We are very interested in working with American investors,\nbut not in a way where they try to push certain political\ngoals,&quot; said MP Aqqalu Jerimiassen from the Atassut party, part\nof <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> governing coalition.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> has long sought to diversify its economy,\nprimarily by courting investments in its mining sector. However,\nlimited infrastructure, including a lack of roads connecting the\nregion's 72 towns, extreme climatic conditions, and labour\nshortages, have hampered progress in attracting meaningful\nforeign capital.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/dk\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Denmark</location> has allocated extra money for infrastructure and\nother development initiatives, and the EU has proposed more than\ndoubling its funding. Still, <location>the Arctic</location> nation's economy remains\nstagnant, with growth at just 0.2% in 2025 and a significant\ndeficit in public finances.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>SOME SECTORS WILL NEED MANDATORY SCREENING</p>\n<p>First debated in November, the screening bill is set for\nfurther discussion in April and is expected to be passed that\nmonth. The draft requires foreign investors to disclose the\norigin of their funds and enables authorities to reject deals if\nthe political affiliations or intentions of the investors raise\nconcerns.</p>\n<p>&quot;If someone is working for Trump, we will find out with this\nscreening law. This is about our own security,&quot; Jerimiassen\nadded.</p>\n<p>The proposed bill does not single out specific countries but\nurges cooperation with allies, indicating that American and\nEuropean investors may face less scrutiny compared to Chinese\ncounterparts. However, it grants <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> the authority to\nreview foreign investments considered a threat to security.</p>\n<p>&quot;The purpose of the law is to prevent foreign investments\nfrom posing a threat to <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> security or public order,&quot;\nthe legislation states. In addition, its goal is to enhance the\nsecurity of &quot;<location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> and its allies, including <org>NATO</org> member\nstates&quot;.</p>\n<p>Foreign investments in critical infrastructure, IT and\nclassified data systems, raw materials and mining, hydropower,\nand government-owned companies will require mandatory screening\nunder the proposed law.</p>\n<p>The legislation is limited to areas under <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location>\njurisdiction and does not extend to U.S. military activities on\nthe island, which remain under <location value=\"LC/dk\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Denmark's</location> control.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> has said it has no intention of competing for\ninfluence in <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >GREENLAND</location> STILL WANTS AMERICAN CAPITAL, MP SAYS</p>\n<p>Last month, <person>Drew Horn</person>, a former senior aide in Trump's first\nadministration, announced plans for a multi-billion-dollar data\ncentre in <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> - the kind of project some lawmakers view as\nunderscoring the need for clearer screening rules.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> government said it has not received any\napplications or formal requests related to the proposal.</p>\n<p>Horn, who now leads an investment and advisory firm, told\nReuters the project had no political ties and that he had no\nconcerns about passing any screening requirements in <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>.</p>\n<p>&quot;<location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> wants American capital, but we fear hidden\npolitical motives behind certain U.S. private investors,&quot; said\none member of parliament, speaking anonymously due to the\nsensitivity of the issue.</p>\n<p>Negotiations between <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> and the U.S. over access and\npresence on the island are ongoing, with Trump still insisting\non \"total access\" to the island.</p>\n<p>Business Minister Naaja Nathanielsen told Reuters the\nforeign investment screening law was not drafted in response to\nU.S. interest and that she continued to welcome American\ninvestment.</p>\n<p>However, if negotiations between the U.S. and <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>\nbroke down, she said, &quot;then of course we would need to\nreevaluate our position.

Using Vaxxas' needle-free delivery technology, the three-party consortium will develop a seasonal influenza vaccine for older adults and pandemic influenza vaccine for broader populations.</p>\n    <div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1\">\n                <p>\n\n                    <img src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1979527/SK_bioscience_Logo.jpg\" title=\"SK bioscience (PRNewsfoto/SK bioscience)\" alt=\"SK bioscience (PRNewsfoto/SK bioscience)\" />\n\n                </p>\n    </div>\n<p>This contract is one of three EU-funded framework contracts, valued at up to a total of €225M and aimed at strengthening next-generation vaccine commercialization and supply capabilities within <location value=\"LR/eur\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Europe</location>. HaDEA will provide up to €12.9 million to support Phase 1 research, including a Phase 1 clinical trial. Subject to successful technical validation and clinical outcomes, the Consortium could tender to progress through subsequent phases of the program to support Phase 3 and final-stage development.</p><p>The contract is particularly meaningful as it represents the first major global public funding secured following SK bioscience's acquisition of IDT, and continues the company's close collaboration with high-density microarray patch (HD-MAP) pioneer Vaxxas. It also establishes a pathway for entry into the highly regulated European market by combining influenza vaccine development capabilities with Vaxxas' HD-MAP technology.</p><p>Within the consortium, IDT serves as the European legal contracting entity and overall project lead, overseeing project management and coordination with European authorities. Upon commercialization, IDT is expected to function as a key manufacturing hub in <location value=\"LR/eur\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Europe</location>, including responsibility for drug substance production.</p><p>SK bioscience, leveraging its proprietary cell culture technology, will supply drug substance for both its licensed influenza vaccine, SKYCellflu, and a pandemic influenza vaccine currently under development. SK bioscience will also collaborate with Vaxxas for the clinical development, with Vaxxas manufacturing HD-MAP vaccines.</p><p>The patch-based influenza vaccines are designed to achieve a comparable immunogenicity response with lower antigen doses than traditional delivery platforms. With a short application time and room-temperature stability, they are expected to significantly enhance ease of administration and increase vaccine access critical to a public health vaccination response. According to modelling by <org>Avalere Health</org> on a US scenario, the potential impact of microarray patch (MAP) vaccines in a pandemic could be at least 35% fewer cases, and at least 30% fewer deaths by enabling a broader and faster response. Additionally, MAP vaccines could reduce US economic losses by at least <money>$200 billion</money> and global economic losses by at least <money>$921 billion</money> over two years.</p><p>Through this project, SK bioscience, IDT, and Vaxxas intend to actively target the premium European seasonal influenza vaccine market for older adults, while boosting their capabilities to support the region's preparedness to respond to potential public health crises.</p><p>Upon successful development, SK bioscience with its Consortium partners plan to pursue entry into major advanced markets, including <location value=\"LR/eur\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Europe's</location> Northern Hemisphere market, and explore additional business opportunities through exports to key markets such as Korea and <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location>, depending on global clinical outcomes.</p><p>According to global market research firm Datamonitor, the seasonal influenza vaccine market targeting older adults is estimated at approximately <money>USD 459 million</money>. As immune responses decline with age, this segment shows strong demand for premium products such as high-dose and adjuvanted vaccines, making differentiated formulations and technologies a direct determinant of market competitiveness.</p><p>\"With more than 100 years of experience in vaccine development and manufacturing, IDT Biologika has continuously evolved to meet the changing needs of patients and partners worldwide,\" said Dr. <person>Sally Choe</person>, Co-CEO of IDT Biologika. \"Our global customer focus drives us to not only ensure reliable, high-quality production, but also to actively shape innovative delivery solutions that can expand access and improve acceptance across broader populations. By working with SK bioscience and Vaxxas to advance needle-free patch technology for influenza vaccines, we are helping to develop new vaccination approaches designed to better protect people around the world against seasonal and pandemic influenza.\"</p><p>\"The successful tender reflects a shared ambition across the Consortium and the <org>European Commission</org> to invest in alternative vaccine delivery technologies that simplify vaccination and enhance preparedness,\" said Vaxxas CEO Mr. <person>David Peacock</person>. \"This tender positions Vaxxas and its Consortium partners at the forefront of global vaccination innovation.

HMT will continue to lead inspection engineering, interpretation, reporting and certification, leveraging Aero Velocity’s datasets to enhance consistency and documentation.\n\n</p><p>\nThe agreement is expected to advance the tank inspection industry by providing the following benefits:\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\nLower costs – inspections may be performed faster, resulting in reduced out-of-service time;\n\n</li>\n<li>\nHigher quality – data collection designed to deliver repeatable, inspection-ready digital output; and\n\n</li>\n<li>\nEnhanced safety – use of drones to reduce the need for confined space entry by humans.\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\n“Industrial inspection is entering a new era in which safety and data quality are rising, while costs and business disruptions are falling,” said <person>Mark Hastings</person>, Chief Executive Officer of Aero Velocity. “The U.S. above-ground tank inspection market is large, highly regulated and recurring by nature. We built our industrial solutions business to capture inspection-grade data quickly and repeatably at scale. Combined with HMT’s industry leadership, this collaboration modernizes how tanks and other critical assets are documented—improving safety and lowering costs while giving operators better information to plan maintenance and manage risk.”\n\n</p><p>\n“Asset owners are increasingly demanding inspection programs that reduce downtime, while improving data quality and safety,” commented <person>Veronique Trudeau</person>, Chief Executive Officer of HMT. “Working with Aero Velocity strengthens our ability to deliver exceptional results to our customers in the form of high-quality, consistent datasets at scale, while offering safer execution, reduced costs and more efficient inspection planning.”\n\n</p><p>\nAero Velocity’s industrial solutions business combines UAV and robotic data capture with structured, inspection-ready deliverables designed to integrate into existing integrity management programs. Typical deliverables may include:\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\nHigh-resolution photo documentation sets with consistent labeling and coverage by asset zones;\n\n</li>\n<li>\nLiDAR/Photogrammetry-based 3D digital twins for navigation, measurement and visual review;\n\n</li>\n<li>\nTagged points of interest (e.g., corrosion indicators, coating breakdown, deformation, anomalies) to support inspection follow-up;\n\n</li>\n<li>\nSecure data packaging and transfer aligned with client documentation requirements; and\n\n</li>\n<li>\nRepeatable capture templates designed to support trend analysis over time.\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\nAero Velocity and HMT have already begun working together to provide cost-effective, safe inspections, data capture, and analysis to HMT’s industrial clients in the energy sector. The two companies plan to jointly market their services to existing and new customers through established sales channels and joint participation in industry conferences and trade expos throughout the year.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Strategic Growth Implications</b>\n\n</p><p>\nThe collaboration aligns with Aero Velocity’s broader industrial growth strategy focused on expanding recurring inspection services revenue, leveraging technology to improve margin profile and scalability, deepening penetration within energy and infrastructure verticals and building long-term strategic relationships with industry leaders.\n\n</p><p>\nMr. Hastings added, “We are excited about the opportunity to team with the clear industry leader in HMT. We expect this collaboration to be a cornerstone of our revenue growth in 2026 and beyond.”\n\n</p><p>\n<b>About Aero Velocity</b>\n\n</p><p>\nAero Velocity, based in <location value=\"LU/us.oh.cincin\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Cincinnati, OH</location>, designs and manufactures American-made, NDAA-compliant UAVs and operates a robust Drones-as-a-Service (DaaS) business.

            "description": "<p><location value=\"LU/us.ca.losang\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >LOS ANGELES</location>, <chron>Feb 26</chron> (Reuters) - For more than a year, <person>Elon Musk</person> has repeatedly said Tesla is months away from launching a driverless robotaxi service in <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> - once state regulators give their blessing.</p>\n<p>Tesla did nothing to secure that approval in 2025, according to previously unreported state <org>Department of Motor Vehicles</org> records and a state spokesperson. Tesla logged zero miles of autonomous test driving on California roads last year for the sixth year in a row, the records show.</p>\n<p>Documenting test miles is critical in <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California's</location> regulatory system for robotaxis, which requires companies to progress through a series of permits before being allowed to operate a driverless ride-hailing service such as Alphabet's Waymo.</p>\n<p>Much of Tesla's <money>$1.5 trillion</money> market value is tied to investors' belief that it will soon operate a vast fleet of robotaxis and sell millions of autonomous-driving software subscriptions. Operating driverless vehicles in <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> - the largest U.S. auto market - is a linchpin of those ambitions.</p>\n<p><person>Bryant Walker Smith</person>, a <org>University of South Carolina</org> law professor and autonomous-driving expert who has consulted for the California DMV, said Tesla is implying that \"they are ready and regulators are not,\" while the reality is that \"regulators are ready, and they are not.\"</p>\n<p>Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. On an earnings call in October, Musk told analysts that the company is &quot;paranoid about safety&quot; and that it takes a &quot;cautious approach&quot; to new markets. &quot;We probably could just let it loose in these cities,&quot; he said, &quot;but we just don't want to take a chance.&quot;</p>\n<p>So far, Tesla operates only a small pilot robotaxi service in <location value=\"LU/us.tx.austin\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Austin, Texas</location>, which has far fewer regulatory barriers than <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location>.</p>\n<p>In the <location value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >San Francisco Bay Area</location>, the company last July started operating what it called a \"robotaxi\" service that was not a robotaxi service at all. Instead, it is a chauffeur service with human drivers who use Tesla's \"Full Self-Driving\" driver-assistance software, which is not fully autonomous, according to the state regulator authorizing the service and Tesla's disclosures to customers.</p>\n<p>In order to operate fully self-driving vehicles in <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location>, like Waymo, Tesla would first need to obtain permits to test and operate driverless vehicles from the state's <org>DMV and Public Utilities Commission</org>, which regulates commercial ride-hailing.</p>\n<p>Tesla so far has only the entry-level DMV permit, which allows testing driverless vehicles only with a human safety monitor in the driver's seat. A DMV spokesperson said Tesla has not applied for any additional permits.</p>\n<p>Tesla would need to log at least 50,000 miles (80,467 km) of autonomous driving on public roads in <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> with a safety driver before applying for a different permit allowing testing without one, according to proposed DMV regulations expected to be finalized later this year.</p>\n<p>Tesla has not logged any miles with state regulators since 2019 and has documented only 562 miles in total since 2016. </p>\n<p>Waymo, by comparison, logged more than 13 million testing miles and secured seven different regulatory approvals between 2014 and 2023, when it received approval to charge passengers for rides in driverless robotaxis. Waymo is one of three companies with <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> permits to commercially operate driverless vehicles and the only one approved to operate a robotaxi fleet anything like what Musk envisions.</p>\n<p>In written comments last year, Tesla criticized some of the California DMV's proposed revisions to autonomous-driving rules, questioning the need for testing on state roads and minimum-mile requirements. The company also complained about &quot;overly burdensome reporting requirements&quot; for crashes and other system failures.</p>\n<p>Musk has often suggested <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> regulations are the main impediment to deploying robotaxis there. On an <chron>October 2024</chron> earnings call, he said <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> has \"quite a long regulatory approval process.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'd be shocked if we don't get approved next year,\" he added, \"but it's just not something we totally control.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(Reporting by <person>Chris Kirkham</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.ca.losang\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Los Angeles</location>; Editing by <person>Brian Thevenot</person> and <person>Matthew Lewis</person>)</p>\n",

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We keep our <money>$250</money> target, on a P/E of ~24x our CY 27 EPS view of <money>$10.31</money>, above peers/below historical. We lift our FY 27 EPS  to <money>$8.15</money> from <money>$7.80</money> and  FY 28  to <money>$10.31</money> from <money>$10.00</money>. We believe that NVDA's growth is being supported by rising hyperscaler capex (over half of sales), but we think investors need to see greater signs of successful AI monetization from its customer base in a year where CEO Jensen Huang sees Agentic AI at an inflection point. The bar undoubtedly increases, as NVDA makes the case that compute equals revenue for their customers to justify the higher spend. We do expect sequential growth to slow in 2H (tougher comps) but think this is already discounted in shares, while Physical AI/Sovereign AI offers long term upside. We no longer assume NVDA will gain considerable traction in <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> while Rubin appears on pace to ramp in 2H.

            "description": "\n<p><location value=\"LU/be..brussl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >BRUSSELS</location>, <chron>Feb.  26, 2026</chron>  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Aikido Security today unveiled Aikido Infinite, the industry’s first continuous AI penetration testing solution that autonomously validates and remediates vulnerabilities. Infinite reduces risk at every release by testing software changes as they move through deployment, confirming exploitability, and fixing vulnerabilities within the same workflow. With Infinite, Aikido is defining a new approach to software security: self-securing software.</p>  <p>Traditional penetration testing relies on manual or point-in-time assessments, often delivered weeks after software has already shipped. In a recent survey of 500 security and engineering leaders conducted by Aikido, 76% reported deploying significant production changes weekly or faster, yet only 21% validate security on every release. Meanwhile, 85% report that security findings are outdated by the time final reports are delivered.<br/><br/>While newer tools have introduced faster, AI-driven testing, these solutions are often riddled with false positives, do not truly operate autonomously, and stop short of remediation. Aikido Infinite closes this gap. Security teams can expand their capacity with elite hacking agents dedicated to finding security holes in every single piece of code that is pushed, 24/7.</p>  <p>“For years, organizations have been working around the limitations of traditional testing and DAST because there was nothing better available,” said Willem Delbare, co-founder and CEO of Aikido. “Software delivery is now continuous, but security testing isn’t. Infinite completely changes that. This is the beginning of self-securing software.”</p>  <p>Each software change triggers agentic pentesting agents that discover risk, validate exploitability, apply remediation where safe, and retest to confirm risk reduction. Instead of relying on periodic engagements, teams gain a continuous feedback loop that operates alongside deployment, not after it. This level of exhaustiveness would be difficult to replicate even with the largest in-house security teams, whose resources do not scale in proportion to the expanding attack surface and pace of change.</p>  <p>“As software delivery cycles shorten and change becomes constant, point-in-time security models no longer reflect how modern systems operate,” said <person>Katie Norton</person>, Research Manager, DevSecOps and Software Supply Chain Security at IDC. “We are beginning to see early signs of a more autonomous security approach, where exploitability validation and remediation are embedded directly into the software lifecycle. Aikido Infinite reflects this shift by combining continuous testing with remediation capabilities inside a unified platform.”</p>  <p>Infinite utilizes two main resources for its attack. First, Aikido's code-to-runtime platform gives it deep context from the organization's source code, application architecture, and internal logic flows. Then, agents autonomously pursue every possible route of attack across the application’s total surface area, identifying undocumented endpoints, hidden logic paths, complex multi-step edge cases, and architectural anomalies that are often unknown by testers today or too time-consuming for manual testers to address. Aikido Infinite learns from every finding on each deployment, providing a continuous feedback loop that developers can then use to improve code security even before commit.</p>  <p>Built on Aikido’s model-agnostic architecture, Infinite combines advanced AI with proprietary exploit validation and controlled runtime execution. Aikido Infinite is the company's flagship product and the realization of the company’s vision for building self-securing software, shifting security from a reactive process to an embedded, continuous loop. Infinite builds on Aikido Attack, the company’s on-demand AI penetration testing offering that deploys hundreds of specialized agents to hunt vulnerabilities like hackers, validate exploitability, and provide built-in remediation.</p>  <p>Aikido’s AI pentesting capability is already uncovering complex vulnerabilities in apps and frameworks that had previously gone undetected by experts. When combined with in-house expertise, teams achieve a previously unattainable improvement in security posture.</p>  <p>For more information, please visit https://www.aikido.dev/.</p>  <p><strong>About Aikido Security</strong><br/>Founded in Ghent, <location value=\"LC/be\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Belgium</location>, Aikido Security is building self-securing software for modern development teams. Aikido's unified security platform secures code, cloud and runtime, helping teams to reduce risk without slowing down development.

A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided below under “Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Financial Measures.”</p>  <p align=\"justify\">ACM believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in assessing its operating performance. ACM uses these financial measures internally to evaluate its operating performance and for planning and forecasting of future periods. Financial analysts may focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on the non-GAAP financial measures. ACM also believes it is in the best interests of investors for ACM to provide this non-GAAP information.</p>  <p align=\"justify\">While ACM believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be reported by competitors, and they may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to differences in calculation methodologies. The non-GAAP financial measures are not an alternative to GAAP information and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures. They should be used only as a supplement to GAAP information and should be considered only in conjunction with ACM’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.</p>  <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p>  <p align=\"justify\">Certain statements contained in this press release are not historical facts and may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
