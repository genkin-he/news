            "description": "\n<p><chron>12:18 PM EDT</chron>, <chron>10/31/2025</chron> (MT Newswires) -- <org>The Toronto Stock Exchange</org> which was up 70 points in earlier trade, has given up earlier gains and is now down 34 points.</p><p>Healthcare, up 2.3%, is the biggest gainer, followed by financials, up 0.3%.</p><p>The biggest decliners are the mining and energy sectors, down 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively.</p><p>According to CIBC's <person>Andrew Grantham</person>, Canadian GDP was &quot;more trick than treat&quot;, with the economy contracting in August and only rebounding slightly in September. Grantham said the -0.3% reading for August was weaker than the consensus forecast and advance estimate (0.0%), and although that came off the back of an upwardly revised 0.3% gain in July (from 0.2%) the level of GDP in August is still below consensus estimates. He noted weakness in August was reasonably broad based by sector, led by transportation &amp; warehousing, wholesaling and manufacturing. However, there were some one-off factors at play, such as a flight attendants strike that impacted air transportation and drought conditions that impacted the utilities sector. Still, Grantham noted, a +0.1% advance estimate for September suggests the unwinding of some of these factors was not enough to offset August's decline.</p><p>RBC said the preliminary estimate that output rose 0.1% in September left the preliminary estimate of Q3 GDP growth at an annualized +0.4%, just slightly below its (and the <org>Bank of Canada's</org>) +0.5% base case assumption.</p><p>&quot;While that represents a modest rebound from the 1.6% (annualized) GDP decline in Q2, much of the downside surprise in August output reflected temporary factors not related to ongoing tariff disruptions. Manufacturing output edged lower to partially retrace a 1% increase in July, but a sharp pullback in air transportation was tied to a strike by airline staff in August, and electricity output fell sharply as drought conditions weighed on hydroelectric power generation,&quot; RBC added.</p><p>RBC continues to expect broader growth in overall GDP will remain slow, but positive in the near-term.  RBC expects growth to improve in 2026 in part supported by increased government deficit spending.</p><p><org>Bloomberg</org> reports that Canadian Prime Minister <person>Mark Carney</person> said his government will soon announce more than 20 investments in critical minerals projects, with a total value of about <money>C$2 billion</money>. The announcements will be made Friday at the <org>Group of Seven</org> energy ministers' meeting in <location value=\"LU/ca.on.tornto\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Toronto</location>, Carney said during a speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit in <location value=\"LC/kr\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >South Korea</location>.</p><p>Meanwhile, <org>CTV News</org> cited Carney saying <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada's</location> relationship with <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> is at a &quot;turning point&quot; following his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

We trim our '25 EPS estimate by <money>$0.12</money>, to <money>$3.37</money>. AB posted Q3 EPS of <money>$0.86</money> versus <money>$0.77</money>, compared to our <money>$0.92</money> EPS estimate and the <money>$0.85</money> consensus forecast. Q3 revenues advanced by 4.8%, to <money>$1.14 billion</money> in Q3, and this compares to our forecast of 4% to 8% &quot;normalized&quot; revenue growth for 2025, which we maintain. These results included the mid-2024 sale/spin-off of Bernstein Research Services. That aside, base fee revenues advanced by 4.8% year-over-year in Q3 to around <money>$852 million</money>. Performance fee revenues declined by nearly 24% in Q3 to <money>$22 million</money>. Distribution revenues climbed over 11% in Q3, however, to reach over <money>$210 million</money>. We forecast revenue growth of 5% to 9% in 2026, and  expect some modest operating margin expansion.

            "description": "\n<p>(Reuters) -The U.S. central bank should not have cut interest rates this week and should not do so again in December, Dallas Federal Reserve President <person>Lorie Logan</person> said on Friday, citing a 'balanced' labor market in no immediate need of support and inflation that looks likely to stay above policymakers' 2% goal for too long. </p>\n<p>&quot;This economic outlook didn't call for cutting rates,&quot; Logan said in remarks prepared for delivery to a Dallas Fed banking conference. &quot;I did not see a need to cut rates this week. And I'd find it difficult to cut rates again in December unless there is clear evidence that inflation will fall faster than expected or that the labor market will cool more rapidly.&quot;</p>\n<p>Logan's remarks follow the Fed's decision on Wednesday to lower its policy rate for a second time this year by a quarter of a percentage point to what is now a range of 3.75%-4.00%. Fed Chair <person>Jerome Powell</person> said the move was aimed at preventing the labor market from slowing further.</p>\n<p>Another rate cut in December, he said, is not a foregone conclusion, particularly given the lack of official economic data including measures of inflation and unemployment while the federal government shutdown continues. </p>\n<p>Logan, who does not have a vote on the Fed's policy-setting committee this year, said that private-sector data, state-level unemployment claims, and the Fed's own network of business and community contacts do give the central bank visibility into the economy, and the picture is far from troubling.</p>\n<p>Consumer spending has slowed but still exceeds the longer-run trend; stock-market gains are fueling demand from wealthier households; large companies are &quot;enthusiastically&quot; putting money into artificial intelligence and data centers; lower-income households and smaller companies are faring less well but still are stable, she said.</p>\n<p>&quot;The risks to the labor market do lie mainly to the downside,&quot; Logan said, adding that she has a close eye on recent layoff announcements, and noting that a sudden drop in the stock market and a longer-than-expected government shutdown could pose risks to spending and economic activity. &quot;The remaining risks to employment are ones we can monitor closely and respond to if they are becoming more likely to materialize, not ones that currently warrant further preemptive action.&quot;</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, she said, inflation - though not at an emergency level - is still too high and too slow to return to the Fed's 2% goal. &quot;Our obligation to the public is to deliver on this commitment,&quot; she said.</p>\n<p>Logan said she supported the Fed's decision this week to stop shrinking its balance sheet, saying that elevated money market rates show the balance sheet is much closer to its normal size. Indeed, she said, if the recent rise in rates on overnight repurchase agreements for Treasuries proves not to be temporary, the Fed will need to restart asset purchases to keep bank reserves ample.</p>\n<p>She reiterated her view that the Fed should stop targeting the fed funds rate, an outdated target in her view, and should move to targeting a repo rate like the tri-party general collateral rate.</p>\n<p>(Reporting by <person>Ann Saphir</person>; Editing by <person>Paul Simao</person>)</p>\n",

We increase our 2025 EPS estimate by <money>$0.43</money> to <money>$5.17</money>, lift 2026 by <money>$0.65</money> to <money>$5.62</money>, and introduce our 2027 EPS estimate of <money>$5.78</money>. Our Hold rating reflects SCCO's strong asset quality balanced against near-term execution risks. Q3 delivered record results with net sales of <money>$3.4 billion</money> (+15.2% Y/Y) and industry-leading cash costs of <money>$0.42</money> per pound, though copper production declined 7% Y/Y. The <chron>October 2025</chron> Tia Maria mining authorization marks a key milestone, yet copper production is expected to remain pressured with 911,000 tons forecast for 2026. While SCCO's <money>$2 billion</money> 2026 capex program and exceptional by-product performance (zinc +46%, silver +16%) support long-term value creation, current valuation appears fairly valued given mixed operational trends and extended development timelines.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

            "description": "\n<p>Glendale,CA, <chron>Oct.  31, 2025</chron>  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Federal Reserve data confirms 48% of American loan applicants face rejection in 2025, forcing millions toward predatory payday lenders charging 400-600% APRs.<strong> RadCred</strong>, America's first AI-powered loan matching platform, announces breakthrough results: an 87% approval rate for bad credit borrowers through instant AI evaluation of 112 alternative data points beyond FICO scores. The platform processed 99,000+ applications in Q3 2025, connecting 76,000+ borrowers with licensed lenders offering same-day funding and transparent terms through soft credit checks, preserving credit scores. This release examines surging demand, RadCred's technology, benefits, application processes, and the future of inclusive lending.</p>  <p><b><strong>The Crisis Behind the Numbers: Why 48% of American Borrowers Face Loan Rejection</strong></b></p>  <p><strong>Federal Reserve surveys</strong> show loan rejection rates stabilized at 48% throughout 2025, with bad credit borrowers facing automatic declines regardless of current income or employment stability. This rigid FICO-dependent underwriting excludes 45 million Americans, 16% of adults, from mainstream credit markets.</p>  <p>Populations hardest hit include gig workers with irregular income, recent graduates building credit histories, single parents recovering from medical debt, and minorities facing documented lending discrimination. The Federal Reserve's <org>Consumer Credit Panel</org> reveals that &quot;discouraged borrowers&quot; avoiding applications despite genuine needs remain at 7.2% as of <chron>June 2025</chron>, well above pre-pandemic norms.</p>  <p>Rejected borrowers often resort to predatory payday lenders with 400-600% APRs, creating debt traps rather than solving emergencies. This exclusion threatens employment when car repairs go unfunded, endangers housing when rent shortfalls trigger evictions, and delays medical care when bills exceed savings.</p>  <p><b><strong>The Demand for No Credit Check Personal Loans in 2025</strong></b></p>  <p>Search volume for &quot;no credit check personal loans&quot; surged 215% year-over-year according to Google Trends, while alternative lending platforms processed a record 12 million quarterly applications, up 38% from 2024. Multiple factors drive this acceleration: Federal Reserve rates maintaining borrowing costs near 4%, persistent inflation straining household budgets, and gig economy expansion creating income volatility that traditional underwriting fails to accommodate.</p>  <p><strong>Emergency expenses remain the primary driver, and 56% of Americans cannot cover <money>$400</money> </strong>in unexpected costs from savings, per Federal Reserve surveys. Vehicle repairs averaging <money>$1,247</money>, medical bills, utility disconnections, and rent shortfalls create urgent cash needs that banks cannot address within required timeframes.</p>  <p><b><strong>What's New in RadCred's AI-Powered No Credit Check Loans?</strong></b></p>  <p><strong>RadCred's</strong> proprietary AI technology, launched in <chron>July 2025</chron>, analyzes more than 100 financial data points, including employment tenure, income deposit patterns, utility payment histories, banking behaviors, and debt-to-income ratios, not just FICO scores.</p>  <p>Breakthrough features:</p>  <ul><li> <strong>Soft credit inquiries</strong> preserve FICO scores during prequalification<br/><br/> </li><li> <strong>87% approval rate</strong> for scores 500-640 vs. 30% bank acceptance<br/><br/> </li><li> <strong>2.5-minute decisions</strong> replacing 3-7 day traditional processing<br/><br/> </li><li> <strong>91% same-day funding</strong> for approved weekday applications<br/><br/> </li><li> <strong>Multi-lender matching</strong> displaying competing offers with transparent APR comparisons </li></ul>  <p><strong>RadCred also reported exceptional Q3 2025 performance</strong><strong>:</strong> 99,127 applications processed, 48,216 new users, 76,384 borrowers matched, and a Net Promoter Score of 68.</p>  <p><b><strong>How RadCred's AI Loan Matching Works for Bad Credit and Low Credit Score Borrowers</strong></b></p>  <p><b><strong>Alternative Data Analysis</strong></b></p>  <p>RadCred's machine learning evaluates employment stability, showing job tenure and sector consistency, income reliability through regular bank deposits regardless of source (W-2, gig platforms, benefits), utility and rent payment histories demonstrating responsibility, banking behavior patterns showing account discipline, and seasonal income variations captured through transaction data.</p>  <p><b><strong>Machine Learning Technology</strong></b></p>  <p>Natural language processing identifies income sources from banking descriptions. Predictive models trained on millions of successful repayments assess probability based on spending consistency. Evaluation occurs in real-time, continuously updating profiles versus static credit bureau snapshots.</p>  <p><b><strong>Soft Pull Protection</strong></b></p>  <p>Soft credit inquiries preserve FICO scores throughout matching, critical for avoiding hard pulls, damaging credit by 5-10 points per attempt. <org>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's</org> <chron>October 2025</chron> guidance mandates lenders using AI &quot;evaluate underwriting models for bias,&quot; standards RadCred implements through quarterly algorithmic auditing.</p>  <p><org>The World Economic Forum's</org> <chron>September 2025</chron> report indicates that AI-powered alternative data expands creditworthy identification by 30% among underserved populations.</p>  <p><b><strong>Top Benefits of Choosing RadCred's No Credit Check Loans with Guaranteed Approval</strong></b></p>  <p><strong>RadCred</strong> delivers measurable advantages addressing bad credit borrower challenges:</p>  <p><strong>High Approval Rates</strong>: 87% for FICO 500-640 applicants vs. 30% traditional banks; includes freelancers (82%), first-time applicants (79%), and bankruptcy recovery (84%)</p>  <p><strong>Rapid Processing</strong>: 2.5-minute AI evaluation, 94% faster than 3-7 day traditional underwriting</p>  <p><strong>Credit Protection</strong>: Soft inquiries enable option exploration without FICO damage</p>  <p><strong>Fast Funding</strong>: 91% of approved weekday applications receive same-day deposits within hours</p>  <p><strong>No Collateral</strong>: Unsecured options eliminate asset or co-signer requirements</p>  <p><strong>Affordable Rates</strong>: 7-35% APR saves thousands vs. 400-600% payday lender rates;
