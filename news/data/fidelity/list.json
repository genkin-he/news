But sit-down restaurants and some drive-through chains buzzed with patrons seeking a special treat or cheap comfort food.</p>\n<p>Their upbeat sales made the U.S. restaurant industry a rare bright spot for jobs, with restaurant payrolls ticking up 1% last year, adding about 108,000 jobs, according to the <org>Bureau of Labor Statistics</org>. </p>\n<p>In contrast, the overall U.S. economy added 181,000 non-farm jobs in 2025, marking the weakest annual payroll growth in 20 years outside a recession year.</p>\n<p>Success among restaurants was not evenly spread, though.</p>\n<p>Corporate filings show that eateries such as <org value=\"EAT.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Brinker's</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='EAT' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( EAT )</span> <org value=\"EAT.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Chili's</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='EAT' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( EAT )</span>, <org value=\"YUM.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Yum Brands'</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='YUM' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( YUM )</span> <org>Taco Bell</org> and fast-growing coffee chain <org value=\"BROS.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Dutch Bros</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BROS' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BROS )</span> lured customers by aggressively marketing bundled deals, leaning into digital innovation and limited-time offers, and focusing on high-margin, Instagrammable food. </p>\n<p>But previous darlings like Chipotle and <org value=\"CAVA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Cava</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='CAVA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( CAVA )</span> were hurt by what analysts call the &quot;slop-bowl fatigue&quot; -  growing weariness among younger consumers with high-priced, customizable grain or salad bowls. </p>\n<p><location value=\"LU/us.az.tempe\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Tempe, Arizona</location>-based <org value=\"BROS.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Dutch Bros</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BROS' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BROS )</span> and its franchisees added roughly 8,000 employees in the last two years, a 33% increase, the company said. </p>\n<p>&quot;We have a healthy pipeline of growth,&quot; CEO <person>Christine Barone</person> told Reuters after the company's earnings in February. The brand, which serves customizable beverages, is a hit with younger consumers, Barone said.  </p>\n<p>A similar story is playing out at another chain that, like <org value=\"BROS.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Dutch Bros</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BROS' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BROS )</span>, sells more treats than meals.</p>\n<p>Ice cream chain Whit's Frozen Custard has grown its payroll by up to 40% a year for the past two years, said owner <person>Bill Aseere</person>, to keep up with rapid growth. It now has stores in 93 locations across 10 states and some 15 to 20 employees per store. </p>\n<p>Amanda Wang, co-founder of fast-growing Chinese beverage chain Ningji Lemon Tea - part of a tidal wave of Chinese tea brands coming to the U.S. - said her chain's new restaurants in the U.S. were buoyed by demand among price-weary consumers for affordable indulgences. </p>\n<p>Tea &quot;offers that little bit of happiness,&quot; she said.</p>\n<p>As a whole, the restaurant industry grew payrolls even as it weathers depressed traffic and rising labor costs, analysts say, thanks in part to menu price increases. Menu prices at restaurants grew 4.1% in 2025 compared to grocery inflation of 2.3%, according to the <org>Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</org>. </p>\n<p>DIVERGING FORTUNES</p>\n<p>A deeper look at 2025 payroll data shows the difference in fortunes between types of restaurants: staff headcount at snack and non-alcoholic beverage restaurants grew 3.6% in 2025 and those at sit-down restaurants rose 1%. But fast-food payrolls grew only 0.4%, while cafeterias and buffet payrolls shrank 3.9%. </p>\n<p>&quot;At the end of the day, people want go out to eat and celebrate those big occasions,&quot; said <person>Chad Moutray</person>, an economist at the <org>National Restaurant Association</org>, referring to resilient spending at sit-down restaurants. </p>\n<p>&quot;Consumers might be pulling back from vacations, but they still prioritize eating out.&quot;</p>\n<p>The payroll data and Moutray's comments underscore what the industry calls the &quot;lipstick effect&quot; - consumers tightened their budgets, canceling expensive trips and postponing big-ticket purchases, but treated themselves to an indulgent meal, coffee or dessert.</p>\n<p><org value=\"EAT.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Brinker's</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='EAT' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( EAT )</span> reported 23% growth in its hourly restaurant staff between fiscal years 2024 and 2025, according to <org>SEC</org> filings, though it indicated that a growing share of its employees were part-time. </p>\n<p>Darden, the parent company of sit-down restaurants like <org value=\"DRI.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Olive Garden</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='DRI' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( DRI )</span> and <org>LongHorn Steakhouse</org>, increased staff for fiscal 2025 by about 3.8%.</p>\n<p>Most national restaurant chains are franchised and do not report total employment figures among franchisees, but Chipotle and <org value=\"SBUX.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Starbucks</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='SBUX' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( SBUX )</span>, which operate the majority of their own stores, reported slight declines in total headcount for fiscal year 2025. </p>\n<p>While cascades of tariff announcements have forced other industries to raise prices and reroute sourcing, restaurant owners have only faced the tariffs impacting narrow categories like cup packaging and Chinese Sichuan peppers. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p> (Reporting by <person>Waylon Cunningham</person>; Editing by <person>Sayantani Ghosh</person> and <person>Nick Zieminski</person>)</p>\n",

            "description": "\n<p>    <location value=\"LU/us.tx.houstn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >HOUSTON</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nHighRadius launches <org>Office of the CFO</org> first Outcome Based Pricing with <money>$0</money> Implementation fee and <money>$0</money> Subscription until Go-Live. Customers only pay a fraction of realized gains based on P&amp;L impact.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Chapter 1: Outcome Based Pricing (OBP)</b>\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\n<b>Introduction of OBP: </b>HighRadius, a provider of 190+ AI agents for Order-to-Cash, Accounts Payable, Record-to-Report, and Treasury introduces Outcome Based Pricing (OBP).\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Three Components of OBP: </b>Customers pay a) <money>$0</money> in Implementation fees, b) <money>$0</money> in Subscription fees until Go Live, c) HighRadius earns a fraction of the actual savings realized by the client.\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\n<b>Chapter 2: US GAAP &amp; ASC 606 Constraints</b>\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\n<b>Not Designed for Innovation: </b>The traditional ASC 606 model requires companies to standardize and recognize revenue based on contractual obligations. For a traditional SaaS subscription, the obligation is access to software over time. AI agents are designed to deliver quantifiable, real-time Business Outcomes that do not fit the traditional accounting framework.\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\n<b>Chapter 3: Controlled Group Experiment</b>\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\n<b>HighRadius’ stress-testing for Gain share model: </b>HighRadius did not arrive at Outcome-Based Pricing through theory alone. The model was stress-tested through a controlled 24-month experiment to see if alignment on Business Outcomes increased the probability of success. Stress-testing consisted of two main groups:\n<ul class=\"bwlistcircle\">\n<li>\n<b>Group 1 (MASC established): </b>Customers went through an alignment on Business Outcomes via a formal Mutually Agreed Success Criteria document (MASC) with measurable Baseline and Target metrics, and a client Exec has to sign-off for successful completion of the project.\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Group 2 (No MASC established): </b>Customers onboarded without MASC went through an implementation and enhancement loop leading to frustration on both sides.\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Final Verdict: </b>The answer was clear, buyers cared only about Business Outcomes being achieved. They didn't care about the vendor's implementation methodology.\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\n<b>Chapter 4: Tech Companies Vendor Lock-In</b>\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\n<b>Vendor Lock-in</b>: CFOs and CIOs have lost trust in the current subscription model with the risk of being locked in by the vendor’s long implementation cycles, no alignment on success criteria, ever changing requirements etc. With sunk cost investments and high switching costs, the customer is effectively held hostage, now officially called Vendor lock-in.\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>IT Services Change Order Scam</b>: The IT services industry as well as Professional Services arm of software companies have Professional Services revenue as Bonus goals. This is a complete conflict of interest to the customer. There is a lot of friction with budget overflows and change orders. With the elimination of implementation fees to <money>$0</money> in OBP, this conflict is fully eliminated and both parties have shared goals.\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Structural misalignment:</b> Vendors get paid for access, not outcomes. Less than 40% of software buyers report being satisfied with the value delivered relative to the cost they pay.\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Antidote to Vendor Lock-In</b>: Outcome-Based Pricing is the antidote. When the earnings are tied directly to the impact on a customer's P&amp;L, the dynamics of conflict is eliminated and both are incentivised for a shared goal.\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\n<b>Chapter 5: About HighRadius</b>\n\n</p><p>\nHighRadius provides a single Agentic AI platform for the <org>Office of the CFO</org>. It integrates 190+ agents that orchestrate end-to-end processes across Order-to-Cash, Close &amp; Reconciliation, Consolidation &amp; Reporting, Accounts Payable, B2B Payments, and Treasury.

reference to certain non-IFRS measures including key performance indicators used by management and typically used by our competitors in the SaaS industry. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS. These non-IFRS measures are used to provide investors with alternative measures of our operating performance and liquidity and thus highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures, including SaaS industry metrics, in the evaluation of companies in the SaaS industry. Management also uses non-IFRS measures to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, the preparation of annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of executive compensation. The non-IFRS measures referred to in this press release include “Annual Recurring Revenue”, “Average Contract Value”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted Net Income”, “Adjusted Earnings per Share - Basic and Diluted”, “Working Capital” and “Free Cash Flow”.\n\n</p><p>\n<b><i>Key Performance Indicators</i></b>\n\n</p><p>\nWe recognize subscription revenues ratably over the term of the subscription period under the provisions of our agreements with customers. The terms of our agreements, combined with high customer retention rates, provides us with a significant degree of visibility into our near-term revenues. Management uses a number of metrics, including the ones identified below, to measure the Company’s performance and customer trends, which are used to prepare financial plans and shape future strategy. Our key performance indicators may be calculated in a manner different than similar key performance indicators used by other companies.\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\n<i>Annual Recurring Revenue:</i> We define Annual Recurring Revenue as the annualized equivalent value of the subscription revenue of all existing contracts (including Original Equipment Manufacturer contracts) as at the date being measured, excluding non-recurring revenues from implementation, support and maintenance fees. Our customers generally enter into annual or multi-year contracts which are non-cancellable or cancellable with penalty. Accordingly, our calculation of Annual Recurring Revenue assumes that customers will renew the contractual commitments on a periodic basis as those commitments come up for renewal. Subscription agreements may be subject to price increases upon renewal reflecting both inflationary increases and the additional value provided by our solutions. In addition to the expected increase in subscription revenue from price increases over time, existing customers may subscribe for additional features, learners or services during the term. We believe that this measure provides a fair real-time measure of performance in a subscription-based environment. Annual Recurring Revenue provides us with visibility for consistent and predictable growth to our cash flows. Our strong total revenue growth coupled with increasing Annual Recurring Revenue indicates the continued strength in the expansion of our business and will continue to be our focus on a go-forward basis.\n<br />\n<br />\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<i>Average Contract Value: </i>Average Contract Value is calculated as total Annual Recurring Revenue divided by the number of active customers.\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\nAnnual Recurring Revenue and Average Contract Value as at <chron>December 31, 2025</chron> and 2024 were as follows:\n\n</p><table cellspacing=\"0\"

The aircraft executed autonomous mission behaviors and the Nominal Core software platform supported test planning, data collection, and post-flight analysis.</p>    <p>“Autonomy at scale depends on testing that keeps pace with development,” said <person>Cameron McCord</person>, CEO and co-founder of Nominal. “Demonstrations like this show how modern testing can help the Department validate manned-unmanned collaborative autonomy faster while maintaining rigor and confidence.”</p>    <p>Nominal Core was used to rapidly ingest and organize flight telemetry and supporting test data, allowing <org>Navy</org> and industry teams to collaboratively assess autonomy performance, vehicle response, and mission execution. The software platform also enabled NAVAIR and industry partners to aggregate relevant insights from historical flight tests, providing critical context and improving continuous learning across future test cycles.</p>    <p>This demonstration supports the Navy’s efforts to advance AI-enabled autonomy and manned-unmanned teaming concepts in support of future CCA programs. The BQM-177A provides an operationally relevant test platform for exercising autonomy behaviors and mission execution. The <org>Navy</org> plans to build on this demonstration with additional flight tests focused on expanded autonomy behaviors and increased mission complexity.</p>    <p>As the <org>Department of War</org> advances collaborative autonomy, modernized testing approaches will be critical to realizing these warfighting capabilities on operationally relevant timelines.</p>    <p>Distribution Statement A – NAVAIR Public Release SPR 2026-0077 is approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.</p>    <p><strong>About Nominal</strong><br/>Founded in 2022, Nominal is built on the belief that learning from tests faster than the threat is how <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location> builds lasting technological advantage. By turning testing into a continuous, secure source of truth across complex programs, Nominal helps the government and its partners field mission-critical systems with speed and confidence.

            "description": "<p><location value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >LONDON</location>, <chron>Feb 26</chron> (Reuters) - Some private credit firms that borrow from retail investors may be embellishing their financial health, <org>Rubric Capital</org>, a <money>$3 billion</money> hedge fund founded by a former Point72 star manager, warned its backers in a letter seen by Reuters.  </p>\n<p>The hedge fund said some business development companies (BDCs), which lend to small enterprises, are shifting borrowings from the balance sheet between quarters, making them appear less indebted, the <chron>February 18</chron> letter shows. The debt then reappears on the balance sheet a few days after quarter end, it added.</p>\n<p>&quot;Our key takeaway from this behavior is that distribution cuts are so worrisome that some bad actors are playing Enron-like accounting games,&quot; the letter said. </p>\n<p>The firms are using repo-like loans from one particular investment bank to mask debt, the letter says.</p>\n<p><org>Rubric Capital</org> did not name the bank nor the BDCs involved and Reuters was unable to independently verify whether this practice is being deployed and at what scale.  </p>\n<p><org>Rubric Capital</org> declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.</p>\n<p>The private credit market has been gripped by anxiety in recent months since the bankruptcies of auto-parts maker First Brands and subprime lender Tricolor last year. The fallout has sharpened scrutiny of a market that has grown quickly, drawing large institutional investment and rising corporate lending in recent years. A renewed bout of uncertainty has flared up in recent weeks. </p>\n<p>The BDC industry oversees over <money>$300 billion</money> in assets under management and accounts for roughly one quarter of direct lending in the U.S., according to a Bank for International Settlements note in July. The closed-end investment vehicles can be private or listed on stock exchanges.</p>\n<p>Enron went bankrupt in 2001 after using off-balance-sheet vehicles and other accounting tricks to hide tens of billions of dollars of debt.    </p>\n<p>Before starting Rubric, founder <person>David Rosen</person> worked for 10 years at Point72, formerly called <org>SAC Capital</org>, and began his career at the <org>Blackstone Group</org> in restructuring, according to a Morgan Stanley note from June. The firm as of <chron>May 2025</chron>, oversaw around <money>$3 billion</money> in assets, said Morgan Stanley.</p>\n<p>REDEMPTION FEAR</p>\n<p>Private credit defaults are reportedly between 3% and 5%, and signs of strain-such as interest paid-in-kind financing used to help troubled lenders meet their debt obligations-are nearing post-pandemic highs, according to UBS.</p>\n<p>Privately traded BDCs require quarterly liquidity for investors but these funds limit the amount investors can redeem at 5%, the <org>Rubric Capital</org> letter added. If redemption requests reach 10% of net assets, investors can eventually become locked out of their money as the funds halt any further flows.</p>\n<p>Rising costs and an ever-present investor demand for distributions have put BDC managers under pressure, said <org>Rubric Capital</org>.</p>\n<p>&quot;This is leading to dodgy industry behavior with funds increasing leverage instead of taking their medicine and reducing distributions,&quot; said the hedge fund's letter.</p>\n<p>(Reporting by <person>Nell Mackenzie</person>; Additional reporting by <person>Isla Binnie</person>; editing by <person>Dhara Ranasinghe</person>, Anousha Sakoui and <person>Elisa Martinuzzi</person> )</p>\n",

And\nLVMH donated <money>5 million euros</money> to the victims of what it called\nthe \"tragic situation\" in <location value=\"LC/ua\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Ukraine</location>.</p>\n<p>One of its businesses in <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia</location>, however, has kept\noperating: <location>The Grand Hotel Europe</location> in <location value=\"LU/ru..saiurg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >St. Petersburg</location>, owned\nthrough LVMH's Belmond chain of luxury hotels and trains.</p>\n<p>The storied hotel itself isn't subject to sanctions and is\noperating legally. However, it has continued to receive payments\nfor providing services to corporate clients that have been\nsanctioned by <location value=\"LR/eur\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Europe</location> and the UK, including major Russian\ntransport, energy and media companies as well as banks and\nmilitary contractors, Reuters has found.</p>\n<p>Signs of the hotel's ownership have been scrubbed from\npublic view, including images from social media showing an empty\nspace at the entrance where a placard with Belmond's logo was\nonce affixed. The hotel was also de-listed from Belmond's\nbooking site in 2023, according to archived versions of the\nBelmond booking website.</p>\n<p>Belmond's ownership of the hotel, however, continues to\nappear in Russian, British and French corporate records. Belmond\nis 100% owned by LVMH, according to its 2025 accounts. Names of\nthe hotel's corporate clients, including the sanctioned ones,\nappear in value-added-tax records reviewed by Reuters.</p>\n<p>Asked about the hotel's operations and business with\nsanctioned clients, LVMH said the <location>Grand Hotel Europe</location> \"operates\nautonomously and independently from Belmond.\"</p>\n<p>\"It is not part of the Belmond distribution systems and the\ndedicated local team in <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia</location> manages this historic property\nseparately,\" the company said. LVMH declined to respond further\nto detailed questions from Reuters. Belmond issued an identical\nresponse.</p>\n<p>Executives at LVMH, the world's largest luxury conglomerate,\nconsidered closing the <location value=\"LU/ru..saiurg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >St. Petersburg</location> property but ultimately\ndecided against it, two sources with direct knowledge of the\nmatter told Reuters. \"These are people who work for us, that we\nhave been paying for years,\" said one of the people. \"Shall we\npunish them because their country is being run by a fool?\"</p>\n<p><person>Yulia Pashkovskaya</person>, the hotel manager, and a hotel\nspokesperson declined to comment to Reuters.</p>\n<p>Situated on the Nevsky Prospekt in the heart of <location value=\"LU/ru..saiurg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >St.\nPetersburg</location> since 1875, the <location>Grand Hotel Europe</location> has hosted guests\nincluding <location value=\"LC/gb\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Britain's</location> then-<person>Prince Charles</person> and pop stars <person>Elton John</person>\nand <person>Whitney Houston</person>. One of its first famous guests was Pyotr\nTchaikovsky, the Russian composer.</p>\n<p>The five-star hotel features a butler service and a caviar\nbar famous for its \"Egg in Egg\" dish - boiled truffle-flavored\neggs and three types of caviar.</p>\n<p>More recently, the hotel has hosted multiple events\ninvolving <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia's</location> political and economic elites. Last year, it\nhosted a meeting between diplomatic envoys of U.S. President\nDonald Trump and Russian President <person>Vladimir Putin</person> to discuss the\nwar in <location value=\"LC/ua\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Ukraine</location>, and celebrated its 150th anniversary with a\nlavish gala that included bank executives, the director of the\n<org>Russian State Museum</org>, and <location value=\"LU/ru..saiurg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >St. Petersburg</location> officials.</p>\n<p>For over a decade, the hotel has been an official partner of\nthe <org>St. Petersburg International Economic Forum</org>, the annual\nbusiness gathering chaired by Putin.</p>\n<p>REASONS TO STAY</p>\n<p>The hotel's enduring allure may make it worth LVMH's while\nto hold on to the property, Russian business experts say. \"Most\nlikely, they are hoping to wait out the situation, thinking that\none day things with <location value=\"LC/ua\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Ukraine</location> will improve,\" said <person>Artem\nZhavoronkov</person>, a partner at the <location value=\"LU/ru..saiurg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >St. Petersburg</location> law firm <org>Nordic\nStar</org>, who specialises in sanctions litigation but is not\nadvising the hotel. \"It's a good asset, it's profitable. And it\nis first-class real estate that will only grow in value over\ntime,\" added Zhavoronkov.</p>\n<p>LVMH's decision to retain the property could be part of a\nlong-term ambition to re-enter the Russian market, said <person>Kristian\nLasslett</person>, a professor at <org>Ulster University</org> in <location value=\"LS/gb.nir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Northern Ireland</location>\nwho studies corporate behaviour in <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia</location> and <location value=\"LR/asp\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Central Asia</location>.</p>\n<p>\"Business in <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia</location> has long depended on personal\nconnections and the favour in which one is held,\" Lasslett said.</p>\n<p>There could be other reasons why LVMH has held onto the\nproperty, according to people familiar with the situation. Among\nthe possible reasons are Russian rules requiring foreign\ncompanies to sell their assets at a hefty discount if they leave\nthe country, and that the city of <location value=\"LU/ru..saiurg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >St. Petersburg</location> holds a 6.5%\nstake in the art nouveau building in which the hotel is located,\naccording to Russian property records and Belmond filings to the\n<org>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</org>.</p>\n<p>The <location value=\"LU/ru..saiurg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >St. Petersburg</location> mayor's office didn't respond to\nquestions about whether Belmond needed the city's permission to\nsell its stake in the hotel or whether there had been any\nrequests to do so.</p>\n<p>Most Western hotel chains - including Marriott, Four\nSeasons, and InterContinental owner IHG - have cut ties with\n<location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia</location>. Unlike Belmond, all of these groups functioned through\nthird-party investors, allowing them to withdraw from <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia</location>\nquickly. Some others including Hilton halted new investments but\nstill operate there.</p>\n<p>The <location value=\"LU/ru..saiurg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >St. Petersburg</location> hotel does not face international\nrestrictions on its operations because services like\naccommodation and catering aren't specifically targeted by\nsanctions, according to legal experts in <location value=\"LU/fr..paris\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Paris</location>, <location value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >London</location> and\n<location value=\"LU/ru..moscow\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Moscow</location> and a <org>EU Commission</org> source. Regis Bismuth, an\ninternational law professor at <org>Sciences Po University</org> in <location value=\"LU/fr..paris\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Paris</location>,\nnoted that the hotel is a Russian subsidiary, incorporated under\nRussian law, providing everyday services within <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia</location>.</p>\n<p>SANCTIONED CLIENTS</p>\n<p>The hotel is making money from sanctioned companies, though.\nVAT filings to local tax authorities from the second quarter of\n2022 to the first quarter of 2025 show the hotel received\npayments from sanctioned entities including two units of arms\nmaker Rostec and a subsidiary of <org>Tactical Missiles Corp</org>, as well\nas from ship building company Sovcomflot and energy giant\nRosneft. Other payments came from corporations under asset\nfreezes such as Sberbank, Sovcombank and VTB.</p>\n<p>The tax filings don't specify what services the sanctioned\ncompanies purchased from the hotel. But most of the individual\npayments did not exceed <money>$2,000</money>, in line with the hotel's\nofferings for rooms, dinners or meeting spaces. The hotel's room\nprices range from roughly <money>$270</money> to <money>$1,200</money>, with high-end suites\nfrom <money>$1,800</money> to nearly <money>$8,000</money> per night, according to its booking\nsite. Some companies made repeated payments over the years.\nOthers only once or twice.</p>\n<p>The VAT records do not specify what goods or services were\nreceived in exchange for payments.</p>\n<p>Rostec, <org>Tactical Missiles Corp.</org>, Sovcomflot, Rosneft,\nSberbank and Sovcombank did not respond to detailed requests for\ncomment. VTB said the information Reuters provided was incorrect\nbut did not specify.</p>\n<p><org>The European Commission</org>, which has drafted several rounds of\nsanctions against <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia</location>, declined to comment about the hotel.\nThe Commission has said that its sanctions do not apply outside\nthe <org>European Union</org>, but that parent companies may not \"use their\nRussian subsidiaries to circumvent the obligations that apply to\nthe EU parent.\"</p>\n<p>Among the hotel's largest clients was sanctioned lender\nSovcombank, which paid <money>$140,000</money> to the hotel. Another major\nclient was Prezident-Servis, a travel agency owned directly by\nthe Kremlin, which made payments worth at least <money>$270,000</money> to the\nhotel.</p>\n<p>Most of the payments by both entities coincided with the <location value=\"LU/ru..saiurg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >St.\nPetersburg</location> forum in 2023 and 2024, the records show.</p>\n<p>In response to questions about the hotel, the Kremlin said\nit was not in the hospitality business.</p>\n<p><org>Europe Hotel LLC</org>, the firm behind the property, is listed\namong LVMH's hundreds of 100%-owned subsidiaries on page 401 of\nits latest universal registration document, a detailed mandatory\nannual filing with the French market watchdog AMF. Reuters could\nfind no other public mentions of the hotel by LVMH since the\nstart of the war.\nBetween 2022 and 2024, the hotel's annual revenues have almost\ndoubled, reaching <money>1.9 billion roubles</money> (<money>$25 million</money>), slightly\nabove its top line in the three years preceding the 2020\nCOVID-19 pandemic, according to Russian financial filings\nreviewed by Reuters.\nThe hotel in 2024 generated a net profit of some <money>$5.7 million</money> in\n2024, its highest since data was first published in 2004. The\ncash from these operations reached <money>$13 million</money> on the hotel's\nbalance sheet published last year, up from less than <money>$1 million</money>\nannually from 2018 to 2021, according to the documents. The\nrecords indicated that the hotel's profits stay inside <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia</location>.</p>\n<p>The totals are tiny compared to LVMH's annual sales of\naround <money>80 billion euros</money>, but the hotel's storied past and its\nties to <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia's</location> elite give it value beyond the revenue it\ngenerates.</p>\n<p>\"I always say that <location>Grand Hotel Europe</location> is one of the true\nplaces of power in <location value=\"LU/ru..saiurg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >St. Petersburg</location>,&quot; Pashkovskaya, the hotel's\nmanager since 2006, told a Russian YouTuber in <chron>June 2023</chron>.</p>\n<p>The bubbly flowed at the <location>Grand Hotel Europe's</location> 150th\nanniversary gala. But Veuve Clicquot, Dom Perignon and other\nLVMH champagne brands were nowhere to be seen in a video\nreleased by the hotel after the party was over.

That meant AI could build population-level profiles that &quot;no law explicitly prohibits but that clearly violate the spirit of constitutional protections,&quot; they added.</p>\n<p>Amodei said he hoped the Pentagon would reconsider but that the company &quot;will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider,&quot; if the Pentagon decided to cancel the contract.</p>\n<p>The Pentagon threatened to remove Anthropic from its systems if the company maintained the safeguards, designate them a supply chain risk, and invoke the Defense Production Act to force the safeguards' removal, Amodei said.</p>\n<p>&quot;Regardless, these threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.&quot;</p>\n<p>Undersecretary of Defense <person>Emil Michael</person> responded on X, saying, &quot;It's a shame that @DarioAmodei is a liar and has a God-complex.
