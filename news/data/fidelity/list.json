The legislative environment for Huawei replacement in the EU is currently non-compulsory, meaning the transition away from Huawei will take years and may slow market activity until more stringent requirements are enacted. In addition, tightening supply conditions in key components such as memory and optics were highlighted, which could impact costs and supply chain dynamics.

Data showed annual inflation cooled to 4.1%, from 4.5% in January, but was above the 3.8% expected by analysts.\n    However, the print is not expected to prevent the country's central bank from kicking off a monetary policy easing cycle in March, as indicated by policymakers recently.\n    This would be the central bank's first interest rate cut since 2024 if the expectations come true, bringing the Selic rate down from a near two-decade high of 15%.\n    &quot;Although this reading doesn't show a worsening in inflation year-on-year, it certainly shows that stickiness may be higher in services and core measures, in line with our scenario,&quot; said Citigroup analysts led by <person>Ernesto Revilla</person>.\n    &quot;This data strengthens our more hawkish monetary policy call of a 25-basis-point cut in the March meeting.&quot;\n\n    EQUITIES DIP SLIGHTLY\n    Most equities in the region were lower on the day as global risk appetite faltered.\n    <location value=\"LU/br..saopau\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Sao Paulo</location> stocks fell 1.2%, with some financial firms including Itau Unibanco falling 2%, tracking declines in global financial stocks.\n    Mexican stocks were the only outliers, up 0.4%.\n    AI chipmaker Nvidia's results on Wednesday failed to provide the boost some investors had bet on, with doubts on the AI-fueled rally and stretched tech valuations taking center stage.\nColombian equities sank 0.8%, setting them up for their worst week since <chron>March 2023</chron>. The index has shed nearly 7% over the last three sessions as trade tensions with <location value=\"LC/ec\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Ecuador</location> intensify.\n    Elsewhere, Chilean stocks slipped 1.6% and were set to break a half-year monthly winning streak, while the peso fell 0.7%. The local unemployment rate rose to 8.3% in the quarter through January.\n    February has been a data-heavy month across the region.

The company noted that price increases are not expected to be an ongoing lever for growth, indicating that future revenue improvement will rely more heavily on adding value and product innovation rather than pricing actions. Finally, the ongoing transition from on-prem to cloud for large enterprise customers remains incomplete, with approximately 150 million seats still on-prem.

By embedding payments into the platform’s intelligence engine, RevPay transforms financial activity into real-time insight that supports forecasting, reduces administrative burden, and strengthens both clinical and operational decision-making.\n\n</p><p>\nAs reimbursement pressures rise and patient expectations grow, financial visibility and operational efficiency are strategic priorities. Across healthcare, credit card fees commonly range from 2.5 to 4.5 percent per transaction. For a <money>$1 million</money> practice collecting 40 percent of revenue via card, that can mean<b> </b>anywhere <b>from <money>$10,000</money> to <money>$18,000</money> in annual processing costs</b>.\n\n</p><p>\nRevPay helps you keep more of what you earn by automating structured revenue recovery built directly into RevolutionEHR with optional patient surcharging. Additionally, practices can accept cards, ACH, digital wallets, tap-to-pay, link-to-pay, and patient portal payments directly within the platform. Transactions post automatically to patient ledgers, dashboards reflect live activity, and funding follows a predictable structure that supports operational stability.\n\n</p><p>\nFor office staff, this means fewer manual steps, faster closeout, and more time focused on patient care. For patients, it delivers flexible payment options, secure card-on-file functionality, and a seamless checkout experience that feels modern and effortless.\n\n</p><p>\nCore capabilities include:\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\nEmbedded in-office and online payment acceptance within RevolutionEHR\n\n</li>\n<li>\nAutomated ledger mapping tied directly to patient records\n\n</li>\n<li>\nUnified dashboards providing real-time visibility into transactions, fees, and deposits\n\n</li>\n<li>\nTransparent pricing and predictable funding\n\n</li>\n<li>\nAutomated revenue recovery with optional patient surcharging\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\n“RevPay marks an important step in redefining how optometry practices manage revenue,” said <person>Danny Shipman</person>, Vice President of Product Strategy at PracticeTek. “By embedding payments directly into our AI-native platform, we are transforming financial activity into real-time insight and turning clarity into a daily operating advantage.

            "description": "\n<p><chron>12:17 PM EST</chron>, <chron>02/27/2026</chron> (MT Newswires) -- <org>The Toronto Stock Exchange</org> is down 163 points at midday on mixed sectors.</p><p>The  worst performers are info tech and financials, down 2.6% and 1.7%, respectively.</p><p>Telecoms, up 2.1% is the best performer, followed by utilities, and healthcare, both up 0.8%.</p><p>In economics, focus was on Canadian GDP for the fourth quarter and December, and the flash estimate for January.</p><p>Desjardins' <person>Royce Mendes</person> noted <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada's</location> economy contracted in the fourth quarter of last year, but added that the print &quot;hides a healthier set of details&quot;. The 0.6% SAAR decline in the fourth-quarter GDP was slightly below analyst expectations for a 0.2% drop. The main drag came from inventories, which subtracted more than four percentage points from the headline reading. However, outside of that very volatile category and a further decline in housing activity, the economy posted &quot;respectable&quot; numbers for the fourth quarter.</p><p>While the underlying momentum in the economy can't be characterized as consistently strong, &quot;it's not weak enough&quot; for the <org>Bank of Canada</org> to cut rates any further.</p><p>On balance, RBC said, the economy remained &quot;more resilient&quot; last year than was feared as U.S. tariffs ramped up last spring. Some sectors targeted by tariffs have been significantly negatively impacted but, controlling for ongoing slowing in population growth, per-capita GDP posted a first increase in three years in 2025. RBC adds: &quot;Most Canadian exports have remained duty free under a CUSMA exemption, the lagged impact of earlier <org>Bank of Canada</org> interest rate cuts has helped to stabilize consumer spending, and governments have stepped in to support the economy with added spending.</p><p>TD, in looking at the key implications, noted <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> ended the year on a weaker footing as businesses drew down inventories, weighing on headline growth. For 2025 as a whole, the economy slowed to 1.7%, primarily due to lower exports to <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location>. But domestic demand grew at 2.3%, supported by stronger government spending. The rebound in consumption and the return of non-residential investment in the fourth quarter provide some reassurance that underlying demand is stabilizing, TD added.</p><p>Still, TD said, today's report is weaker than the BoC's January projections for a flat reading, reinforcing their view that momentum remains limited.</p><p>BNN Bloomberg says <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada's</location> Big Six banks had a &quot;blockbuster start&quot; to the year, with all of them exceeding earnings expectations for the first quarter. Together, the banks hit about <money>$19 billion</money> in profit, up from <money>$14 billion</money> in the same period last year. BNN cited one analyst saying it is because they have done a &quot;wonderful job&quot; managing their capital. &quot;We've said for years and years that Canadian banks are the most excellent stewards of capital in the world,&quot; <person>Brian Belski</person>, CEO and chief investment officer at Humilis Investment Strategies told BNN Bloomberg. He says last year, banks were beginning to use excess reserves they built the year prior, and the benefits are now flowing through into the first fiscal quarter of 2026. Going forward, Belski says Scotiabank will &quot;set the trend&quot; for the rest of the banks, signalling a positive capital markets backdrop and strong volumes for the quarter.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.
