The <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/deal-gives-santander-final-step-change-needed-for-u-s-growth\" target=\"_blank\"><u>pending $12.3 billion deal</u></a></ps-link>, announced earlier this month, marks the first time in years that a European-based bank has agreed to buy a U.S. bank.</p><p>It is also <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/banco-santander-inks-12-3b-deal-to-buy-webster-financial\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the largest bank M&amp;A deal announced so far in 2026</u></a></ps-link>, and it is one of the largest deals in the past five years. The combined entity is expected to have approximately $327 billion of assets. </p><p>One analyst at Wednesday's meeting expressed skepticism about <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/organization/santander\">Santander's</a></ps-link> plan, saying the integration of U.S. assets into European banks \"has been a graveyard over the last 25 years.\" <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/organization/santander\">Santander</a></ps-link> is one of the only European banks that's still operating a U.S. retail business.</p><p>Ana Botín, <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/organization/santander\">Santander's</a></ps-link> executive chair, countered by saying that Webster is \"a fantastic bank\" with \"best-in-class profitability.\"</p><p>\"This time it's different, and we are going to deliver the goods,\" Botín said.</p><p>She also pointed out that Webster has prior experience in managing successful integrations. In 2022, the $84 billion-asset Webster <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/webster-turns-to-big-bank-m-a-to-address-growth-challenges\" target=\"_blank\"><u>completed a merger of equals</u></a></ps-link> with Sterling Bancorp in New York, a transaction that was designed to build scale in a slower-growth part of the country.</p><p>Christiana Riley, <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/how-santander-plans-to-grow-in-the-u-s\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Santander's U.S. country head for the past year</u></a></ps-link>, said Wednesday that the bank is \"building on significant momentum in the U.S. business already,\" and that it has more than one lever to pull to increase profitability, including a ramp-up in fees from corporate and investment banking. </p><p>Fees in that segment have increased 30% in the past two years, Riley told analysts at the meeting. The bank is also combining its auto-lending platform with its deposit-taking platform, a move that should help increase profitability by reducing redundancies, she added.</p><p>At least one analyst expects the acquisition, which still needs approval from U.S. and European regulators as well as shareholders of both banks, to be successful overall. <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/organization/santander\">Santander</a></ps-link> is already familiar with the U.S. banking market, and its size and scale mean that it has the necessary technology to support a solid integration, said María Parra, an analyst at Morningstar DBRS.</p><p>\"They are completely changing the game in the U.S. to position them to be one of the best retail and commercial banks in terms of profitability and market share,\" Parra told American Banker.</p><p>The deal has been expected to close during the second half of this year. On Wednesday, Botín narrowed the window by saying the bank is estimating a closing date during the third quarter.</p><p><ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/organization/santander\">Santander</a></ps-link>, which entered the U.S. in 2005 by buying a partial stake in Sovereign Bank in Philadelphia, has been trying to boost its stateside profitability for the past several years. It has been known in the U.S. as a consumer-finance lender, as evidenced by its sizable auto-lending portfolio, which historically has been funded by higher-cost, less-sticky wholesale deposits.</p><p>In October 2024, <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/organization/santander\">Santander</a></ps-link> launched a nationwide digital bank in the U.S. to collect low-cost deposits. A year later, the platform known as Openbank had attracted more than $6 billion of customer funds. </p><p>But <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/organization/santander\">Santander</a></ps-link> has struggled in recent years with profitability in the U.S. In 2023, its return on tangible equity adjusted for certain capital costs was 6%, it said Wednesday. For all of 2025, the same metric was 10%.</p><p>The proposed acquisition of Webster offers a major step-up in the quality and diversity of <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/organization/santander\">Santander's</a></ps-link> U.S. deposits. Webster has 195 branches, mostly in Connecticut but also in Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island, and an array of deposit sources, including a consumer bank, a commercial bank, health-savings accounts and deposits affiliated with medical insurance claim settlements. </p><p>The deal should result in $800 million in cost savings, <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/organization/santander\">Santander</a></ps-link> executives reiterated Wednesday. About one-third of the total is expected to come from technology and operations, another one-third from office consolidations, and the remaining one-third from retail and commercial overlap, Riley said.</p><p>The $800 million includes cost reductions at both banks, Riley said. <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/organization/santander\">Santander</a></ps-link>, which bills itself as \"a digital bank with branches,\" has not mentioned any specific post-acquisition branch closures.</p><p>One of the deal's main risks is being able to realize the $800 million in cost savings, Parra said.</p><p>\"But I think they are pretty committed to this,\" Parra said. \"They're not expecting to do any big M&amp;A in the next few years, so as long as they remain focused … I think they will deliver here.\"</p><p>John Ciulla, Webster's chairman and CEO, appeared virtually Wednesday to talk about the pending acquisition. Ciulla is set to become CEO of <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/organization/santander\">Santander Bank</a></ps-link> N.A., while Luis Massiani, Webster's president and chief operating officer, will serve as COO of <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/organization/santander\">Santander</a></ps-link> Holdings USA and <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/organization/santander\">Santander Bank</a></ps-link> N.A. Massiani is also on deck to lead the integration efforts.</p><p>\"We are confident in our ability to deliver the promised financial metrics of the combined company,\" Ciulla told the audience. \"We're really excited about the scale and the technology that <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/organization/santander\">Santander</a></ps-link> brings to the combined [entity], and we think there are really opportunities to do things not only more efficiently, but more effectively to deliver products and services to our clients.\"</p></div>",

FINRA approval enables 24/7 liquidity for WisdomTree's tokenized MMF shares, with settlement facilitated by stablecoins.</p><p>\"As we see it, this is the first example of a fund trading and settling on a 'T instant' basis, which is an innovative step forward in terms of how securities and fund markets work,\" Will Peck, head of digital assets for WisdomTree, told American Banker. </p><p>\"T instant,\" or T+0, refers to a transaction with real-time or same-day settlement.

            "description": "<div class=\"RichTextArticleBody-body RichTextBody\"><ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\"><li><b>Key insights</b>: Revolut, Tether and Circle made announcements this week designed to boost their stablecoin profiles. </li><li><b>What's at stake</b>: Stablecoins are growing quickly and are attracting investment, creating an arms race among banks and fintechs. </li><li><b>Forward look</b>: Despite the growth in stablecoins, McKinsey says stablecoin payments are still a small part of the overall payments market. </li></ul><p>One of the big stories in the payments industry over the past year has been stablecoins, which have gotten a <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/customers-ceo-says-bank-poised-to-benefit-from-genius-act\" target=\"_blank\"><u>regulatory boost </u></a></ps-link>and a series of fintechs <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/news/payoneer-seeks-bank-charter-for-new-stablecoin\" target=\"_blank\"><u>seeking bank charters</u></a></ps-link> and <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/list/big-banks-are-working-on-payment-stablecoins\" target=\"_blank\"><u>banks</u></a></ps-link> considering how to approach the market. </p><p>But the story appears to be outracing the reality. Even with fast growth the market is very small, according to <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/stablecoins-in-payments-what-the-raw-transaction-numbers-miss\" target=\"_blank\"><u>McKinsey</u></a></ps-link>. </p><p>There are about $300 billion in stablecoins circulating, according to McKinsey, adding that's up from less than $30 billion in 2020. McKinsey also noted projections from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that the stablecoin supply could reach $3 trillion by 2030. And financial institutions peg the supply could reach as high as $4 trillion in the same time frame. </p><p>But that's not the payments market. McKinsey partnered with blockchain analytics firm Artemis Analytics to separate trading, internal fund movements, and automated activity from payments. After running those numbers through the strainer, McKinsey found that actual stablecoin payments totaled closer to $390 billion in 2025 — or about 0.02% of global payments volume.And even for use cases such as B2B payments and remittances, stablecoins are gains of sand on the beach.</p><p>For B2B payments, stablecoins totaled about $226 billion in 2026, or about 0.01% of the global B2B payment volume of about $1.6 quadrillion, McKinsey said. And for remittances, </p><p>there were $90 billion in stablecoin payments volumes, which is less than 1% of the more than $100 trillion in total volumes from this segment, McKinsey said. </p><p>There are benefits to stablecoins, McKinsey said, such as addressing inefficiencies in cross-border payments. They just aren't being used for that yet.</p><p>And banks are interested. Forty-seven percent of banks say their institution's clients were asking for general information about cryptocurrency, followed by 35% who said clients were asking for the ability to make payments using cryptocurrencies, according to <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/news/exclusive-research-crypto-stablecoins-have-staying-power\" target=\"_blank\"><u>research from American Banker</u></a></ps-link>, adding 27% said that customers were asking for institutionally provided custody of digital assets.</p><p>Given the growth and anticipated demand, there's plenty of investment in stablecoins, with several announcements in just the past few days. </p><p></p><h2 class=\"cms-heading-h2 HeadingH2\">Tether invests in web market Whop</h2><p>In an effort to extend stablecoins deeper into what it calls \"real economic activity,\" stablecoin issuer Tether has made an investment in Whop, an internet marketplace.</p><p>The size of the investment was not disclosed. Tether hopes the resulting partnership will enable easier processing for customers who use USDT and USAT for international payments, avoiding what Tether says is a complicated exchange process.  Whop's platform supports more than 18.4 million users, with participants earning approximately $3 billion annually. </p><p>Tether's funding round will support expansion in Latin America, Europe and Asia-Pacific.\"Stablecoins and wallets become most powerful when they are embedded directly into people's lives, supporting their businesses, activities, families and individual stories,\" Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, said in a release.</p><p>In an earlier <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/news/tether-ceo-paolo-ardoino-discusses-stablecoin-strategy\" target=\"_blank\"><u>interview</u></a></ps-link>, Ardoino said Tether will focus on its strength in emerging markets to counter bank interest in stablecoins due to the passage of enabling legislation in the U.S.\"In a certain way Tether is lucky,\" Ardoino told American Banker in 2025. \"Everyone that is launching a stablecoin will go after a single user base … the institutional or wealthy user base, at least relative to the rest of the world.\"</p><p></p><h2 class=\"cms-heading-h2 HeadingH2\">Circle touts stablecoin growth</h2><p>The boost in attention that <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/stablecoins\" target=\"_blank\"><u>stablecoins</u></a></ps-link> have gotten over the past year appears to be paying off for Circle, as the USDC issuer reports there was $75.3 billion of the stablecoin in circulation at the end of 2025, up 72% from the prior year. C</p><p>ircle on Wednesday also reported a net loss from continuing operations in 2025 of $70 million, mostly due to  $424 million for stock-based compensation related to vesting conditions met by its IPO, the company said. This compares to net income from continuing operations in 2024 of $157 million.</p><p>\"The fourth quarter marked another step forward in Circle's mission to build the infrastructure for an open, programmable internet financial system,\" said Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, in a release. Circle has gotten a boost from initiatives such as the <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/news/circle-builds-a-stablecoin-powered-network-for-real-time-pay\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Circle Payments Network</u></a></ps-link>, which has enrolled 55 financial institutions with 74 others going through eligibility reviews as of Feb. 20. \"USDC adoption continued to expand globally as more enterprises, developers and public institutions integrated digital dollars into real-world payments, treasury and onchain financial workflows,\" Allaire said.</p><p>Circle in the past year has also added scale through <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/news/fis-collaborates-with-circle-to-boost-stablecoin-scale\" target=\"_blank\"><u>partnerships</u></a></ps-link> with firms such as Visa, Intuit, Polymarket and FIS. The \"timing of USDC commercialization remains uncertain, in our view, but we believe Circle is increasingly controlling its own destiny,\" William Blair said in a research note.</p><p></p><h2 class=\"cms-heading-h2 HeadingH2\">Revolut joins a U.K. stablecoin sandbox</h2><p>The Financial Conduct Authority has chosen London fintech Revolut to test stablecoin technology in a \"sandbox,\" which refers to a lab setting with less regulatory pressure than a real-world environment. </p><p>The FCA, which said it got 20 applications, also chose fintechs Monee Financial Technologies, ReStabilise and VVTX. These firms will study how stablecoins would perform given pending regulations and economic risk. The first use cases will be payments, wholesale settlement and crypto trading ahead of regulations that go into effect in September.</p><p>The U.K. has come under fire for its relatively slow pace in <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/news/how-lagging-stablecoin-regulations-could-threaten-the-u-k-economy\" target=\"_blank\"><u>regulating stablecoins</u></a></ps-link>, which critics say places the country behind the European Union and the U.S., which have passed enabling regulations for stablecoins.  </p><p>\"We are supporting U.K. stablecoin issuers to ensure they can be trusted for payments, settlement and trading. It will benefit consumers and financial transactions and help to deliver the FCA's strategy and the Government's National Payments Vision,\" Matthew Long, director of payments and digital assets at the FCA, said in a release.</p><p></p><h2 class=\"cms-heading-h2 HeadingH2\">Visa boosts its profile in Argentina</h2><p>In global payments news this week from outside stablecoins, Visa has agreed to acquire Prisma and Newpay from private acuity firm Advent International. Both firms sell primarily to clients in Argentina. Prisma offers credit, debit and prepaid cards. </p><p>Newpay offers real-time payments, and manages the local Benelco ATM network and bill payment platform PagoMisCuentas. Visa plans to pair the two firms to accelerate deployment of tokenization, biometric authentication, advance risk management and agentic commerce. Terms were not disclosed, and Visa said the deal is expected to close in the second quarter. </p><p>\"This acquisition is an important step for Visa in Argentina, strengthening our client partnerships and advancing innovation across the payments ecosystem,\" said Ryan McInerney, CEO of Visa, in a <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://investor.visa.com/news/news-details/2026/Visa-to-Acquire-Prisma-Medios-de-Pago-and-Newpay-in-Argentina/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"><u>release</u></a></ps-link>. \"By bringing together Prisma's and Newpay's deep local expertise with Visa's global solutions and technology, we will empower our clients to make payments simpler, faster, and more secure for consumers and businesses.\"</p><p>Both <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/news/visa-mastercard-enlist-fintechs-to-reach-latin-americas-unbanked\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Visa and Mastercard</u></a></ps-link> have invested in Latin America in recent years, relying mostly on local partnerships and acquisitions to build scale. </p><p></p><h2 class=\"cms-heading-h2 HeadingH2\">Worldline updates payments tech to fuel turnaround</h2><p>French payments processor Wordline has integrated several merchant products to support shopping and payment experiences that cross channels such as mobile, online and in-store. </p><p>Called One Commerce, the firm is attempting to address \"<ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/video/digital-banking-2025/prioritizing-a-mobile-first-strategy-to-enhance-the-customers-omnichannel-experience\" target=\"_blank\"><u>omnichannel commerce</u></a></ps-link>,\" or the trend toward merchants consolidating different ways to engage with shoppers. </p><p>Worldline will also introduce an \"à-la-carte\" acquiring model, which enables merchants to choose their preferred acquires, with Worldline's merchant acquiring service being among the options. </p><p>\"Worldline One Commerce is a strategic shift for retailers. It transforms payments from a transactional necessity into a powerful enabler of growth, efficiency and customer engagement. Our ambition is clear: to help merchants scale faster, innovate with confidence and deliver truly seamless omnichannel experiences,\" David Valero Compte, global head of retail at Worldline Enterprise, said in a release. </p><p>Worldline, which is restructuring amid <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/worldline-accused-of-serving-sketchy-firms-laundering-money\" target=\"_blank\"><u>regulatory pressure</u></a></ps-link> and <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/list/worldline-plans-to-cut-its-workforce-moneygram-hires-four-new-leaders\" target=\"_blank\"><u>economic challenges</u></a></ps-link>, recently sold its Swedish subsidiary <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/news/visa-mastercard-enlist-fintechs-to-reach-latin-americas-unbanked\" target=\"_blank\"><u>CoreOrchestration</u></a></ps-link> to Incore Invest for about $160 million.

Fiserv has partnered with Canadian technology company Peoples Group to sell a suite of payments technology covering real-time processing, e-commerce and other tools.</p><p>Fiserv has entered into a series of partnerships in recent months as it looks to recover from an <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/news/fiserv-looks-to-ai-to-spur-its-recovery\" target=\"_blank\"><u>earrings slump</u></a></ps-link> in the fall. Recent moves include an expanded strategic partnership with enterprise artificial-intelligence firm ServiceNow, a deal that will add to improve Fiserv's IT departments and the customer service units that support Fiserv's clients. </p><p>Fiserv is also working with Google, Mastercard and Visa to expand agentic commerce, which refers to a form of AI that enables shopping and payments with little or no human supervision. \"Peoples Group is at the leading edge of innovation in Canada's financial ecosystem, and we're proud to support their next-generation payments strategy,\" said Sayantan Chakraborty, head of digital Payments at Fiserv, in a release. \"With the Fiserv Enterprise Payments Platform, we're delivering the scale, security and connectivity financial institutions and fintechs need to grow and compete across Canada.\"</p><p></p><h2 class=\"cms-heading-h2 HeadingH2\">MoneyGram lends its scale to U.K. blockchain project</h2><p>Transfer giant MoneyGram has joined Vodafone and eToro in running three of the ten nodes for a new blockchain from the Midnight Foundation, a decentralized commerce organization. The three companies will each run a \"node,\" which means they are one of the users and operators of a shared network. </p><p>MoneyGram will also work with the Midnight Foundation to find ways for traditional payment networks to adopt blockchains while managing inhibiting factors such as privacy, compliance and security.

CrowdStrike detects and responds to threats at runtime,\" CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said.</li></ul><p><i>Overview bullets generated by AI with editorial review</i></p><p>Anthropic's recent launch of an artificial intelligence vulnerability scanner sent cybersecurity stocks tumbling, but vendors and analysts are pushing back against the narrative that AI will render existing security platforms obsolete.</p><p>On Friday, the AI research company unveiled Claude Code Security, a tool that uses AI reasoning to spot complex vulnerabilities in software code. The announcement sparked a sudden market selloff that battered the shares of cybersecurity giants including CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks, as well as software supply chain companies like JFrog.</p><p>For U.S. banks, the market turbulence raises critical questions about whether the security vendors protecting their networks will be replaced by AI models, and the potential consequences of this.</p><p>For example, shifting security responsibilities entirely to a handful of foundational AI models could run afoul of U.S. Treasury Department warnings about concentration risks, which caution that relying too heavily on a few AI providers could create systemic vulnerabilities and widespread disruptions across the financial system.</p><h2 class=\"cms-heading-h2 HeadingH2\">Anthropic's product release causes a selloff</h2><p>Claude Code Security is a limited-preview tool that scans codebases for security vulnerabilities and suggests targeted software patches.</p><p>Rather than scanning for known patterns like traditional static analysis tools do, Claude reads and reasons about code in a way that emulates a human security researcher's thinking, attempting to understand how data moves through an application to catch complex flaws.</p><p>Anthropic has been leaning heavily into cybersecurity. Alongside releasing its Claude Opus 4.6 model (which the company claims found over 500 zero-day vulnerabilities in well-tested open-source codebases), it recently partnered with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to explore using AI to defend critical infrastructure.</p><p>Investors reacted to Friday's product launch with alarm, interpreting the AI advancement as a direct threat to the business models of established security vendors.</p><p>The Global X Cybersecurity ETF (BUG) fell 3.7% on the day of the announcement, closing at its lowest level since November 2023.</p><p>Software supply chain and application security vendor JFrog suffered the steepest decline, dropping 24.6%.</p><p>Identity and access management firm Okta fell 8.3%, while CrowdStrike dropped 7.32% amid intense short-selling pressure.</p><p>Palo Alto Networks experienced a more moderate decline of 1.1%.</p><h2 class=\"cms-heading-h2 HeadingH2\">Security vendors push back against market sentiment</h2><p>Executives at the cybersecurity vendors quickly argued following Anthropic's Friday announcement that the market fundamentally misunderstands the difference between scanning code during development and defending a live network.</p><p>CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said he directly asked Claude to build a tool to replace his company's platform, according to a post he made on LinkedIn. Claude responded that it could not replicate CrowdStrike's real-time endpoint monitoring or automated incident response with a simple script.</p><p>\"Claude Code Security finds bugs in your source code before they're exploited — proactive, development-stage security,\" Kurtz wrote. \"CrowdStrike detects and responds to threats at runtime across live endpoints — reactive, operational security.\"</p><p>Other application security vendors agreed that AI reasoning is powerful for discovering vulnerabilities but insufficient for enforcing enterprise security.</p><p>AI models frequently introduce business logic and authorization risks themselves, according to Manoj Nair, chief innovation officer at developer security firm Snyk. Trust in the AI era must be built on evidence-backed verification outside of the AI model's cognitive loop, according to Nair.</p><p>\"You can ask an AI to reason about a vulnerability,\" Nair wrote. \"You cannot ask a probabilistic model to guarantee compliance, prove data flow or enforce enterprise policy across thousands of repositories.\"</p><p>Similarly, code quality vendor Sonar emphasized that Claude Code Security engages in a sampling-based, spot-checking approach, whereas enterprise security tools systematically evaluate every line of code to provide the consistent, auditable evidence required by compliance frameworks.</p><h2 class=\"cms-heading-h2 HeadingH2\">Palo Alto preempted the panic</h2><p>Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora got in an early word during his company's earnings call on February 17, three days before Anthropic's announcement.</p><p>Responding to analyst questions about whether large language models pose an existential threat to security information and event management tools, Arora argued that AI is a net positive addition to security capabilities, not a replacement.</p><p>Security platforms require near-perfect precision to protect customers, a threshold that current AI models cannot meet on their own, he said.</p><p>\"Until they get to 99%, 99.9% accuracy, [LLMs] are not a threat to delivering security,\" Arora said. \"They are tools that can be used to summarize capabilities.\"</p><p>Arora also noted that security companies generate proprietary data by sitting at the network edges and blocking billions of attacks daily. Because a language model is not a system of record that generates this domain-specific threat data, it cannot replace the security product itself, according to Arora.</p><p>Instead of fragmenting the market, the rise of AI is actually driving enterprise customers to consolidate their security vendors into unified platforms, Arora said.</p><h2 class=\"cms-heading-h2 HeadingH2\">Analysts share vendors' skepticism</h2><p>Financial analysts covering the cybersecurity sector echoed the vendors' defenses, viewing the market selloff as an overreaction.</p><p>Bank of America Global Research analysts wrote in a Monday note that they disagree with investor concerns that AI will automate away meaningful parts of the security market. While AI tools like Claude represent progress in developer automation and code scanning, they remain too fragile for autonomous defense, according to the Bank of America report.</p><p>\"Runtime security is <i>continuous</i>, always observing execution behavior; <i>contextual</i>, combining signals across endpoint, identity, network, and cloud; and <i>defensive</i>, with required accuracy hitting ~99.99% as false negatives have immediate consequences,\" the Bank of America analysts wrote. (Emphasis original)</p><p>Morningstar equity analyst Malik Ahmed Khan also pushed back against the panic, noting that the adversarial nature of cybersecurity means AI advancements will benefit both attackers and defenders.</p><p>\"While LLMs can be trained on security methods and techniques, they simply don't have access to petabytes of real-time data gathered by large security vendors on a daily basis,\" Khan wrote.</p><h2 class=\"cms-heading-h2 HeadingH2\">How it all bears on systemic risk for banks</h2><p>For the banking sector, the debate over replacing dedicated security platforms with general-purpose AI models touches on serious regulatory and systemic concerns.</p><p>U.S. banks are currently exploring how to integrate AI to improve efficiency and fraud detection, but the U.S. Treasury has explicitly warned about the dangers of industry-wide reliance on a small number of AI providers.</p><p>In a 2024 report on AI in the financial services sector, the Treasury Department noted that the high costs and computing power required to build generative AI models force smaller institutions to depend heavily on a few large tech companies.</p><p>\"Respondents worried that this concentration risk could also lead to systemic and market vulnerabilities, as interruption at a single AI provider could create widespread disruptions across the financial system,\" according to the Treasury report.</p><p>If banks were to abandon their diversified, real-time cybersecurity platforms in favor of relying solely on a few foundational AI models for code analysis, they could exacerbate these exact systemic vulnerabilities while losing the active runtime defenses required to stop active breaches.<br/></p></div>",

While the majority of funds for the tender offer are being provided by investors including Thrive Capital, Coatue, a16z, and others, Stripe will also use a portion of its own capital to repurchase shares. </p><p>Stripe also reported what it called a \"strong year,\" saying businesses running on Stripe generated $1.9 trillion in total volume, up 34% from 2024, and equivalent to roughly 1.6% of global GDP. Stripe's Revenue suite, or non-payment products such as Stripe Billing, Invoicing, and Tax, is on pace to reach an annual run rate of $1 billion this year.The company's management also called out its progress in artificial intelligence. </p><p>\"Our programmable financial services now power more than 5 million businesses directly or via platforms, including all of the top AI companies, many of the largest blue-chip companies, most of the biggest tech companies (80% of the Nasdaq 100), and a significant fraction of freshly minted startups,\" Stripe co-founders John and Patrick Collison said in the company's shareholder letter. \"All in all, 2025 was a strong year for the internet economy, and we're delighted to see so many of Stripe's customers do so well.\"</p><p>Stripe said it is working with partners across AI labs, retailers and e-commerce platforms to lay the groundwork for the migration to agentic commerce. This includes an agentic commerce protocol and an Agentic Commerce Suite, which sells tools for businesses to use across multiple AI interfaces and protocols with a single integration. Early adopters include Anthropologie, Urban Outfitters, Etsy, Coach and Kate Spade.PayPal would be a fit for that strategy. While PayPal has struggled in recent quarters, it has made major investments in <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/news/paypals-solution-for-ai-scalability-partners\" target=\"_blank\"><u>AI-powered shopping and payments</u></a></ps-link> over the past two years.</p><p>\"Stripe knows this is a fire sale and is bottom feeding, hoping to buy PayPal or cherry-pick assets like Braintree at a deep discount to its own $159B valuation, all with the ultimate goal of using PayPal to secure a viable position in agentic commerce,\" Richard Crone, a payments consultant, told American Banker. \"Despite the recent management shakeup, PayPal remains a leader.\" </p><p>PayPal additionally has a range of properties and capabilities that are likely to be attractive to Stripe, Press said, adding PayPal has a significant acquiring portfolio, the Braintree gateway, core wallet and checkout offerings that have significant global presence and could complement Stripe's existing offerings that power wallets for platforms. \"Ancillary offerings, such as fraud management or conversion optimization, could also be leveraged,\" Press said. \"Venmo may be more challenging, but Stripe could give the system additional scale with merchants.\"</p><p>Adding Stripe as a potential owner would be good for PayPal, giving it a much-improved framework for selling its services to small and medium-sized businesses, according to Aaron McPherson, principal at AFM Consulting.</p><p>\"Stripe, for its part, would gain a leading consumer-facing brand, moving it into new markets and vastly increasing its scale,\" McPherson told American Banker, noting Stripe could also leverage PayPal's PYUSD stablecoin. to advance its own stablecoin strategy. <br/></p><h2 class=\"cms-heading-h2 HeadingH2\">A bidding war?</h2><p>Stripe and PayPal would not comment on the rumors, which were initially reported by Bloomberg without on the record attribution. </p><p>Even at a $159 billion valuation, it's hard to see Stripe being able to afford what it would take to win the bidding war that would ensue with the AI super powers, Crone said, noting firms like Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, Perplexity, Meta and Anthropic could be interested. </p><p>\"By adding PayPal, large language models–the technology behind new forms of AI, can marry buyer reasoning, deliberation history and intent scoring to a proprietary payment credential,\" Crone said. </p><p>Stripe is likely leading the speculation as much due to its valuation as to the overall strategic fit, Press said. </p><p>\"That said, valuation is not the same as cash, and any transaction of this scale involving Stripe would be a feat of financial engineering,\" Press said, noting a private equity buyer is also a possibility. \"There aren't many strategic buyers that could realistically contemplate such a move.\"</p><p>PayPal and Stripe would also be a complicated integration, according to McPherson, noting  the two companies have different cultures and very different tech stacks.  </p><p>\"Despite Stripe's $159 billion valuation, this would be a big acquisition, and could become a distraction,\" McPherson said. \"Stripe is not the only interested party, so we will probably hear about others shortly that may be a better fit.\"</p><p></p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"RichTextArticleBody-body RichTextBody\"><p>As wealthy Americans increasingly see art as an investment, some banks are taking on a dual role: part wealth manager, part connoisseur.</p><p>The latest example is <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/organization/bank-of-america\">Bank of America</a></ps-link><span class=\"QModMiniQuotesRichText\"> <span class=\"QModMiniQuotesRichText-tool\"> <span class=\"qtool\" data-qmod-params='{\"lang\":\"en\", \"symbol\": \"BAC\"}' data-qmod-tool=\"miniquotes\"></span> </span> </span>. On Feb. 18, the nation's second-largest lender unveiled its new <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bank-of-america-launches-art-consulting-service-302691393.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>art consulting</u></a></ps-link> service, which advises clients as they start or expand their collections. </p><p>\"We really wanted to be able to round out our offering, to be able to support clients regardless of where they are in their collecting journey,\" Drew Watson, <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/organization/bank-of-america\">BofA's</a></ps-link> head of art services, told American Banker.</p><p>The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank is far from alone. Citi, Morgan Stanley, UBS, HSBC and other big banks all offer art advisory services. Just last year, Goldman Sachs expanded its art and collectibles business into Asia and the Middle East for the first time.</p><p>And <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/organization/bank-of-america\">BofA</a></ps-link> itself has long offered an art consignment service, which focuses on clients who are looking to sell art. What's new about the art consulting service is that it's focused on buying — something collectors have been doing more often lately. </p><p>That's because since 2023, the high-end art market has been suffering a prolonged correction. In the first half of 2025, the number of public transactions for artworks worth more than $10 million fell by 44% from 2024, and by 72% from 2022, according to a <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.privatebank.bankofamerica.com/articles/art-market-fall-update.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>BofA analysis</u></a></ps-link>.</p><p>This downturn has opened up opportunities for collectors — and for banks ready to advise them.</p><p>\"Over the past three or four years, we've been in more of a buyer's market than a seller's market,\" <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/organization/bank-of-america\">BofA's</a></ps-link> Watson said. \"So this service allows us to maintain a high degree of relevancy to clients regardless of the market cycle.\"</p><p>The new service caters to clients at <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/organization/bank-of-america\">BofA's</a></ps-link> private bank and its Merrill wealth management division, both of which serve high net worth and ultra-high net worth individuals. </p><p>This mega-rich demographic has been rapidly getting richer. Since the first quarter of 2020, the top 0.1% of Americans by wealth have more than doubled their fortunes, from $12.08 trillion to $24.89 trillion in the third quarter of 2025, according to data from the <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/chart/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Federal Reserve</u></a></ps-link>.</p><p><ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/organization/bank-of-america\">BofA's</a></ps-link> new art service pairs wealthy clients with advisors who have deep backgrounds in the art world, including at galleries, auction houses and museums. These consultants work with collectors to determine their goals, introduce them to the right dealers and auction houses, and continuously provide market updates and other key information.</p><p>\"It's a highly tailored service that is designed to meet our clients where they are,\" Watson said. \"People collect for different reasons — sometimes to fill the walls of their home, other times to support working contemporary artists, other times just for pure love of the art objects themselves.\"</p><p>There is also another reason. In recent years, wealthy Americans have increasingly come to see paintings and sculptures not just as forms of self-expression, but as financial assets. In 2011, 25% of wealth managers offered art-consulting services, according to research by <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.deloitte.com/lu/en/services/financial-advisory/research/art-finance-report.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Deloitte</u></a></ps-link>. By 2025, that number had risen to 51%.</p><p>\"Clearly this is an area which is growing significantly in terms of the perception of its importance, among both wealth managers and high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth clients,\" Mike Foy, head of wealth intelligence at JD Power, said in an interview.</p><p>One benefit of art, Foy said, is that it's a truly distinct asset class, untethered to more traditional investments. In an era when stocks and bonds often suffer at the same time, that diversification is highly appealing to many investors.\"I think a lot of asset classes that traditionally have been perceived to offer diversification benefits are now more correlated than they were historically, so there's a need to cast a wider net,\" Foy said.</p><p>In recent months, the art market has shown some signs of recovering. In 2025, the British auction house Christie's projected $6.2 billion in global sales for the full year, up 6% from 2024.</p><p>\"We're coming off of a great fall season,\" Sayuri Ganepola, global head of art finance at Christie's, told American Banker. \"We're hearing all the doom and gloom from beforehand, but we had some great results at the end of last year.\"</p><p>As business picks back up, Ganepola said, investors' demand for advice on art has ticked up as well. And like Foy, she's noticed Americans' rising interest in art for its financial as well as aesthetic value.</p><p>\"What we've been seeing in our own space is more and more clients over the past couple of years have been proactively seeking out and asking for this type of service,\" Ganepola said. \"So it's no surprise that many banks are also positioning themselves similarly to how we have been.\"</p></div>",

It's more of a collaborator than an assistant. That was a big fundamental shift in how people use AI.\"</p><p>Masam was referring to Anthropic agents based on Claude 3.7 Sonnet and the Claude Agent SDK that use \"chain-of-thought\" reasoning to process complex, multi-step tasks like customer service, IT support, or software bug resolution.</p><p>\"We see AI as a tremendous accelerator in 2026 as adoption internally grows and as we move on from experimentation to production to scale,\" Masam said. </p><p>The stock exchange's work with Anthropic mirrors AI projects large financial institutions like JPMorganChase and Goldman have been undergoing.</p><p>\"These players are moving from AI as a point solution in a single step in a workflow to embedding AI into core applications, such as digital banking platforms, payments processing systems, credit underwriting engines and fraud detection platforms,\" said Alenka Grealish, lead analyst for emerging tech intelligence at Celent. \"While most [financial institutions] are still working on fixing operations, early movers are increasingly leveraging AI to reinvent the institution.\"</p><p>Steve Rubinow, former chief information officer at the New York Stock Exchange and current associate teaching professor at the Illinois Institute of Technology, was not surprised to hear of the stock exchange's collaboration with Anthropic.</p><p>\"Everybody's got to be experimenting,\" Rubinow told American Banker. \"Nobody can afford to be a late adopter, it doesn't matter what industry you're in, because the technology is moving so quickly, and people see there's a competitive advantage or competitive necessity. The question is, what experiments do you choose? Where are you in the risk reward curve?\"</p><p>Financial services organizations need to be more conservative than those in less regulated industries, \"but it sounds like they have the right tone,\" Rubinow said.<br/></p><h2 class=\"cms-heading-h2 HeadingH2\">Where Claude is helpful</h2><p>The NYSE has been reengineering its development process and using Claude in coding, writing tests and documenting new code, Masam said. </p><p>Where software development used to be a matter of \"buy what you can, build what you must,\" he said, now it's becoming a matter of combining multiple models, multiple vendors, platforms, data and internal capability. </p><p>\"Assembly is becoming a key aspect where you need to assemble all these things to have a solution,\" Masam said. </p><p>His team also used Claude code to build a reference implementation for the <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/nyse-dtcc-developing-blockchain-based-securities-trading\" target=\"_blank\"><u>blockchain-based settlement ledger</u></a></ps-link> it's developing with Digital Asset Holdings that will allow instant settlement of  trades of U.S. listed equities and ETFs around the clock. </p><p>\"We see AI being part of our journey to accelerate that implementation,\" he said.</p><p>Claude models are effective in processing large documents and applying rules, Masam said. The NYSE has used the technology to build agents that review proxy filings, audit Securities and Exchange Commission filings and generate news classifications, he said. <br/></p><h2 class=\"cms-heading-h2 HeadingH2\">Need for strong governance</h2><p>The NYSE processes more than a trillion messages on a peak trading day. </p><p>\"Even at that scale, system resilience, determinism are paramount,\" Masam said. </p><p>Using AI to develop software brings more accountability, Masam said. </p><p>\"Traditionally, we are so used to building deterministic platforms,\" he said. \"You write code requirements and build. Now, with AI being probabilistic, the accountability doesn't end when the project goes live, but on a daily basis, you have to  monitor behavior and outcomes.\"</p><p>Rubinow said there are a few things organizations like the NYSE need to keep in mind as they deploy agentic AI.</p><p>\"What's important in this new era, and some things haven't changed, is data,\" he said. \"You've got to pay attention to the data, because if you don't pay attention to the data, it doesn't matter how beautiful the software you're passing it through is, we know what you're going to get out.\"</p><p>He also advised people deploying AI to think more like conductors than coders. </p><p>\"You have to be a systems thinker,\" Rubinow said. \"You can't just look at little pieces of software and glue them all together and say, 'Okay, now I have a system.' You have to take a step back and look at the entirety, because you can't peek under the cover of a large language model and say, 'Oh, I can see all the gears moving. I know how it works.' You have to focus on the things you can control, like the good old-fashioned algorithms and code and the large language model components, whether it's one piece or it's a series of agents, and take a step back and look how the whole system performs, not just individual pieces.\"</p><p>And as always, there has to be a human in the loop, he said. </p><p>\"You've got to scrutinize your results more than ever, because you want to make sure that what you are using and what you're passing along is indeed acceptable for whatever application you're using,\" Rubinow said. \" And sprinkle in it a healthy dose of safety and ethics, because that's all part of the human input as well.\"</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"RichTextArticleBody-body RichTextBody\"><ul><li><b>Key insights</b>: Andrew Torre, Visa's president of Value-Added Services, says the card network is focusing on areas such as AI and digital assets. </li><li><b>What's at stake</b>: Visa is competing with Mastercard. Both firms are under pressure to find revenue beyond card fees. </li><li><b>Expert quote</b>: \"We're at a rare moment where there's an intersection of agentic AI and stablecoins, there's a lot of new technology that's colliding,\" Torre said. </li></ul><p>A particularly nasty form of payment fraud has provided the latest chance for Visa to showcase services that aren't directly related to card payments.  <br/>The card network said it recently spotted a \"romance scam\" that uses fraudulent dating sites to mimic affection through bots with automated personalities that trick victims into sending money to thieves. </p><p>\"It's a horrible thing to see, but there is definitely a way to embed AI in a case like this,\" Andrew Torre, Visa's president of Value-Added Services, told American Banker. Visa offers scam prevention tools that use AI and deep web monitoring via technology acquired from FeatureSpace to map the crime's infrastructure — and partners with merchant acquirers to dismantle it. It has nothing to do with card swipes at the point of sale, and it's a message that's primarily aimed at consumers. But it's also a way for Visa to pitch its ability to sell value-added services to merchants. </p><p><ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/news/visa-mastercard-rely-on-non-payment-services-to-counter-fee-threats\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Value-added services</u></a></ps-link> are what Visa, Mastercard and other incumbent payment firms call a strategy that uses the companies' vast cross-border networks as a marketplace for ancillary services. </p><p>As the card network faces pressure from <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/news/how-a-doj-suit-against-visa-is-a-lifeline-for-bank-tech-sellers\" target=\"_blank\"><u>regulatory scrutiny</u></a></ps-link>, <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/news/visa-mastercard-offer-a-new-interchange-dispute-settlement\" target=\"_blank\"><u>legal battles with merchants</u></a></ps-link> over fees and the growth  of <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/news/a2a-payments-show-promise-for-consumer-spending\" target=\"_blank\"><u>card alternatives</u></a></ps-link>, value-added services have become an increasingly important source of revenue for Visa and Mastercard. <br/></p><h2 class=\"cms-heading-h2 HeadingH2\">On the spot</h2><p>At Visa, much of the responsibility for expanding value-added services falls on Torre. A 24-year Visa veteran, Torre became president of Value-Added Services in 2025, replacing Antony Cahill, who was named regional president and CEO of Visa's European business. </p><p>Torre was previously Visa's regional president for Central Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa between 2018 and 2025, helping to lead the card network's aggressive <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/news/why-visas-making-a-1-billion-bet-on-africas-payments-market\" target=\"_blank\"><u>expansion in the region</u></a></ps-link>. He joined Visa in 2002 and has held roles in product, strategy and pricing, including stints as Group Country Manager in Russia in 2013 and Sub-Saharan Africa in 2015. </p><p>\"These roles have given me a view of the complexity that's out there, the problems that need to be solved,\" Torre said, noting that clients are looking to streamline international payments with blockchain and real-time processing technology. </p><p>Visa's value-added services totaled $17.5 billion in revenue during fiscal 2025, up 9% from the prior year (out of $40 billion in total revenue). The card brand has more than 650 partners in its services unit, according to Visa. In a research note, analysts at Jefferies said more than half of Visa's net revenue growth comes from value-added services, with the strength attributed to advisory and marketing services. <br/></p><h2 class=\"cms-heading-h2 HeadingH2\">How Visa tries to 'add value'</h2><p>A lot of Visa's current work focuses on selling services that help its clients embrace digital assets such as stablecoins and new forms of artificial intelligence.\"A lot of what we do rides on cards and consumer payments, but that is changing over time,\" Torre said, noting moves in digital assets and AI-supported merchant services. </p><p>\"We're looking to play a bigger role than just around consumer payments.\"Visa has an internal group of experts in stablecoins who have developed services that support stablecoins and tokenized deposits. The primary benefit is to improve processing, with more direct payments evolving in the future, according to Torre. Visa recently introduced a <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/news/visa-launches-stablecoin-advisory-service\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Stablecoin Advisory Practice</u></a></ps-link> to help deploy stablecoins and related technology, with Navy Federal Credit Union and Vystar Credit Union among the first users. </p><p>\"It's a small market but it's growing fast,\" Torre said.  The card network's agentic commerce technology uses digital credentials to vet AI agents and supports controls such as spending limits and where, when and how agents can spend. \"We're at a rare moment where there's an intersection of agentic AI and stablecoins, there's a lot of new technology that's colliding,\" Torre said. </p><p>In other moves to bolster its value-added business, Visa recently upgraded Authorize.net, a service that helps businesses analyze data to more quickly respond to consumer trends. The card brand also added more AI models and support for in-person card readers and Tap to Phone, or technology that enables smartphones to accept payments with minimal hardware upgrades. These upgrades are live in the U.S. and are slated for international release this year. </p><p>Other recent moves include a \"unified checkout service, which combines payment acceptance with other functions such as fraud management, authentication and token management (token in this case refers to substitute values for card numbers as a security measure, and is not related to cryptocurrency).</p><p>Visa has used an <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/list/visa-mastercard-and-big-banks-bet-on-global-payments-tech\" target=\"_blank\"><u>acquisition of AI firm Featurespace</u></a></ps-link> to build a risk hub, a security tool that uses Featurespace's technology to identify risky transactions and build profiles around valid customer activity to reduce the time required to vet transactions. In another move, a December partnership with MassPay will integrate Visa Direct to support faster payouts to cards, bank accounts and digital wallets through MassPay's payment orchestration platform, which routes transactions to the best possible option based on speed and expense. </p><p>Visa's value-added services is part of how it competes with Mastercard and other large payment companies such as Stripe, PayPal and Block. For Mastercard, value-added services include technology, data and consulting covering fraud prevention, cybersecurity, credit management, marketing, open banking, real-time payments and data management. </p><p>Mastercard's network includes more than 220 countries, 150 million merchant locations and 3.5 billion cards. In the most recent quarter, Mastercard's value-added net revenue was $3.9 billion, up 26% from the prior year and about 45% of the card brand's total revenue. </p><p>In a research note, William Blair analysis said that while \"we consider Mastercard's VAS offerings qualitatively superior, focused on security, cyber, authentication, etc., Visa is playing effective catch-up. We believe Visa can maintain a revenue growth advantage.\"</p><p></p></div>",

Their ability to move seamlessly from one loud grievance to another was impressive.</p><p>In the span of a few minutes, they covered everything from rescheduled Mardi Gras parades to the banks being closed to the mail not running to their manager being paid too much for how little she works. It was a master class in sustained dissatisfaction.</p><p>Now, one employee was sweeping while complaining, and another was pulling on rubber gloves to empty the garbage cans. So, they were working. But they were absolutely going to complain about anything and everything while they did.</p><p>The third person, our cashier, seemed to devote about 90% of her attention to the ongoing gripe session with her co-workers and maybe 10% to ringing us up.</p><p>She did not thank us, but she did pause her griping for two seconds to mutter, \"No problem,\" without looking in my direction, when I thanked her.</p><p>As we got back in the car, I told my wife I felt like I had just worked a shift at that store.</p><p>After only a few minutes inside, I was ready for a nap.</p><p>She smiled, agreed, and said she felt a little drained and mentally tired herself from the misery theater we had just witnessed.</p><p>That said, I completely understand and even empathize with people who are not exactly feeling it at some jobs or on certain days. I was not always the ambassador of jovialness when I was cleaning floors and equipment at a grocery store back in the day.</p><p>But I have observed equally toxic environments in workplaces filled with well-dressed folks, making a lot more money, in jobs that required far less sweeping and garbage handling.</p><p>Conversely, I have also worked some pretty unglamorous jobs in the past alongside people who brought smiles and laughter to even the dirtiest of dirty tasks. The same has been true in some of the more stressful and cutthroat environments I've found myself in along my winding career journey.</p><p>This recent experience reminded me of the hundreds of times I have talked about the impact of our brain's open loop limbic system. As humans, we are wired to be affected by our environments and by the moods and demeanors of those around us.</p><p>Neuroscientists often describe this as emotional contagion, the idea that our limbic systems help sync us up with the emotional states of others. In other words, feelings are contagious.</p><p>I have long suggested that the saying \"Misery loves company\" might be more accurately stated as \"Misery creates company.\" It does not seek it out. It manufactures it.</p><p>However, good humor creates company, too. It spreads. Not always as quickly as misery, especially in difficult moments, but even one good attitude can be a force multiplier in a workplace.</p><p>I have encountered more than a few managers over the years who dismiss talk about the importance of a positive workplace as, well … sappy. I mean, hey, grow up. You are paid to do a job whether you are enjoying yourself or not.</p><p>Customers do not care if you are having a bad day as long as you give them what they want. Right?</p><p>Not so fast. You can get compliance in negative environments. You will not get discretionary effort.

A lot.</p><p>Good humor and respectful work environments lower stress, strengthen teamwork and fuel engagement. All three tend to improve performance and even boost employee retention. And decades of research show that when employees stay longer, customers are far more likely to stay, too.</p><p>Leaders cannot mandate happiness, but they can shape atmosphere. That means correcting open negativity quickly and privately, modeling the tone you expect in public, and calling out and praising visible good humor when you see it.</p><p>You cannot control every emotion in a workplace. Nor should you try. But you can influence what is voiced, what is modeled and what is tolerated.</p><p>Words turn into attitudes. Attitudes turn into actions.

Banks and the financial industry escaped the limelight despite periodic presidential ire toward the industry in the form of <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/banks-in-a-bind-as-regulators-operationalize-debanking-order\" target=\"_blank\"><u>debanking criticism</u></a></ps-link> and credit card<ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/trump-again-calls-on-congress-to-cap-credit-card-rates\" target=\"_blank\"><u> rate caps</u></a></ps-link> and <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/trump-backs-durbin-marshall-swipe-fee-bill\" target=\"_blank\"><u>swipe fees.</u></a></ps-link> </p><p>Housing and interest rates took up a slice of the speech, with Trump promising to both make homes more affordable and preserve wealth accumulation for current homeowners. Trump said that lower interest rates would achieve this. </p><p>\"Low interest rates will solve the Biden-created housing problem while at the same time protecting the values of those people who already own a house that really feel rich for the first time in their lives,\" he said. \"We want to protect those values. We want to keep those values up. We're going to do both, and we are going to keep it that way.\" </p><p>However, Trump described an environment that would not lead the Federal Reserve to<ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/live-blog/january-2026-federal-open-market-committee-meeting-live-coverage\" target=\"_blank\"><u> cut interest rates. </u></a></ps-link></p><p>\"Inflation is plummeting, incomes are rising fast. The roaring economy is roaring like never before,\" Trump said. </p><p>Trump has repeatedly put public pressure on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. Powell <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/powell-says-doj-served-fed-subpoenas-threatened-indictment\" target=\"_blank\"><u>said last month</u></a></ps-link> that the central bank has been served grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department, and said the subpoenas and potential indictment over his testimony last June concerning ongoing renovations at Federal Reserve headquarters</p><p>should be considered part of the administration's ongoing campaign to force the central bank to lower interest rates.</p><p>Trump also called on Congress to pass a law that would put into place his executive order banning large, institutional investors from purchasing single family homes. Any such action would require an act of Congress. </p><p>\"Last month, I signed an executive order to ban large Wall Street investment firms from buying up, in the thousands, single-family homes,\" Trump said. \"And now I'm asking Congress to make that ban permanent, because homes for people, really that's what we want. We want homes for people, not for corporations. Corporations are doing just fine.\" </p><p>The call-out got rare scattered applause across the Democratic side of the aisle. Lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have tried to get momentum on this issue in the past, while most Republican lawmakers have not signed on to the idea. Trump's repeated calling for the policy might start to change that calculus among congressional Republicans. </p><p>Trump's speech comes on the heels of a year of both deregulation and tumultuous policymaking from Washington. </p><p>While banks have gotten many items on their wish lists like the attempted dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and general slowdown in enforcement, they've also gotten volatility in markets due to tariffs and the occasional barb from the president — an uncomfortable feeling for an industry that's become used to being out of the limelight for a couple of presidential election cycles. </p><p>On tariffs, Trump did not signal a departure from his aggressive stance after his rare Supreme Court loss last week. </p><p>\"Just four days ago, an unfortunate ruling from the United States Supreme Court just came down, a very unfortunate ruling,\" Trump said. \"But the good news is that almost all countries and corporations want to keep the deal that they already made.\" </p><p>\"Knowing that the legal power that I as president have to make a new deal could be far worse for them, and therefore they will continue to work along the same successful path that we had negotiated before the Supreme Court's unfortunate involvement,\" he said. </p><p>Many high-profile issues for banks, like credit cards, didn't earn a mention in the speech. </p><p>And another issue went unmentioned: Earlier in the day,  <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-administration-considers-action-requiring-banks-to-collect-citizenship-info-8e26f6d2\" target=\"_blank\"><u>The Wall Street Journal</u></a></ps-link> reported that the administration is considering an executive order requiring banks to collect information from all customers, both new and existing, to verify citizenship. The move would be a massive and likely pricey data haul for banks that have historically resisted additional data fields on items such as loan applications by arguing that the regulatory burden is too high. </p><p>The compliance lift for a requirement to collect citizenship information on all account holders would likely be much higher. There is no law or rule that bank account holders in the United States be U.S. citizens, and many people don't have passports, or easy access to their birth certificates. </p></div>",

Circuit heard oral arguments in an appeal by the National Treasury Employees Union, which is fighting to maintain an preliminary injunction that has blocked acting CFPB Director Russell Vought from laying off up to 90% of the bureau's employees. </p><p>The court is weighing whether the injunction was a necessary \"stop-gap\" measure to prevent the permanent erasure of the CFPB, before the courts could decide if the firings were even legal. During three hours of oral arguments, the judges focused, in part, on whether the executive branch has the authority to dismantle a congressionally-mandated agency and if the courts have the power to stop it.</p><p>\"I think we have quite an extreme case here where the president is claiming the power to create or destroy an agency,\" said Jennifer Bennett, a principal at Gupta Wessler LLP who argued for the NTEU. \"There is no statutory authority to shut down the CFPB.\"</p><p>A significant debate erupted near the end of the three-hour hearing over whether a constitutional violation only exists if the President uses \"magic words,\" by claiming explicit constitutional authority, or if simply acting without any authority is enough to trigger a separation of powers crisis.</p><p>The Department of Justice, representing Vought and the CFPB, claims the district court erred in issuing an injunction to stop mass firings, saying the courts lack jurisdiction over personnel matters. Vought's efforts to downsize the CFPB last year did not constitute a \"final agency action,\" as defined by the Administrative Procedure Act, the DOJ argued.</p><p>\"The injunction entered by the district court in this case last March prevents the bureau's new leadership from exercising their lawful discretion,\" said Eric McArthur, a DOJ deputy assistant attorney general. He claimed the courts cannot review the CFPB's actions at all under the APA.</p><p>McArthur argued that CFPB employees are governed by the <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Civil+Service+Reform+Act+of+1978+%28CSRA%29&amp;sca_esv=016f34706b28a015&amp;sxsrf=ANbL-n6OBm5T-wYhKWGdb1Ab5rv0GztDRQ%3A1771961059877&amp;ei=4_qdaYKoNaGckPIP87GV6Ag&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=551&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjPr8aU9PKSAxW3JUQIHSzlIscQgK4QegQIARAB&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=What+is+the+CSRA+and+how+does+it+relate+to+the+Elgin+case%3F&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAaAhgCIjpXaGF0IGlzIHRoZSBDU1JBIGFuZCBob3cgZG9lcyBpdCByZWxhdGUgdG8gdGhlIEVsZ2luIGNhc2U_MgUQIRigATIFECEYoAEyBRAhGKABMgUQIRigATIFECEYoAEyBRAhGKsCMgUQIRirAkilblAAWMxscAF4AZABAJgBhgGgAZkoqgEFNDUuMTO4AQPIAQD4AQGYAjugAogqqAIQwgIHECMYJxjqAsICDRAjGIAEGCcYigUY6gLCAg0QLhiABBgnGIoFGOoCwgIXEAAYgAQYkQIYtAIY5wYYigUY6gLYAQHCAgoQIxiABBgnGIoFwgIEECMYJ8ICCxAAGIAEGJECGIoFwgILEC4YgAQYsQMYgwHCAg4QLhiABBixAxjRAxjHAcICDRAAGIAEGLEDGEMYigXCAhEQLhiABBixAxjRAxiDARjHAcICCxAuGIAEGNEDGMcBwgIKEAAYgAQYQxiKBcICDhAAGIAEGLEDGIMBGIoFwgIWEC4YgAQYsQMY0QMYQxiDARjHARiKBcICCxAAGIAEGLEDGIMBwgIFEAAYgATCAggQABiABBixA8ICChAAGIAEGBQYhwLCAgUQLhiABMICCxAAGPoGGIsDGN0GwgIIEAAYgAQYiwPCAgkQABgWGIsDGB7CAgYQABgWGB7CAgsQABiABBiGAxiKBcICBRAAGO8FwgIIEAAYgAQYogTCAggQABiiBBiJBZgDCuIDBRgBIKdO4gMFGAEgqk7xBagNZUUS4JWuugYGCAEQARgBkgcFNDIuMTegB7SaA7IHBTQxLjE3uAf9KcIHBzAuNDIuMTfIB5QBgAgA&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Civil Service Reform Act of 1978</u></a></ps-link><u>,</u> which established the framework for managing federal personnel, covering actions like removals. The government has argued that CFPB employees who are fired must take their grievances to the Merit Systems Protection Board, an independent watchdog that <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-merit-systems-protection-board-s-independence-is-dead#:~:text=The%20MSPB%20is%20a%20shell,the%20possibility%20of%20judicial%20review.\" target=\"_blank\"><u>currently lacks a quorum</u></a></ps-link> because President Trump removed its Democratic board members last year. </p><p>But Bennett called that route a \"futile exercise,\" claiming federal employees would be seeking reinstatement to an agency that might not exist by the time their claims were heard.</p><p>Many of the judges questioned the DOJ's arguments closely. But the judges also appeared to struggle to find any resolution, suggesting the case could be remanded back to the district court for re-litigation. Despite several of the judges asking both sides how an order could be tailored to resolve the issues, neither side provided clear guidance.</p><p>\"You want everything and they want nothing,\" said Judge Cornelia Pillard, who was in the minority last year when an<ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/dc-circuit-panel-lets-trump-administration-fire-cfpb-staff\" target=\"_blank\"><u> appellate panel ruled 2-1 against the union</u></a></ps-link>. \"They want a set aside order [of the injunction], and you want the full restoration of the Bureau to its status quo.\"</p><p>Several judges expressed skepticism toward the DOJ's argument and struggled with the notion that a district court would be powerless to stop the abolition of an entire agency. </p><p>\"Can the court issue some order that ensures there will be an agency to which employees can be returned?\" Judge Patricia Millet said. \"There's no capacity for them to get due process or due relief unless there is an agency for them to go back to.\" </p><p>McArthur maintained that the administration is not seeking to shut down the CFPB, and said it would be unlawful to do so. </p><p>\"There's no fair reading of this record that there was a decision by the acting director to completely close this agency,\" McArthur said, referencing a number of emails put into the record by the DOJ that tell employees to continue doing their statutorily mandated duties, the importance of which has been strongly challenged by both the lower court judge and the CFPB employees. </p><p>The union claims the CFPB's leadership \"manufactured\" emails just days before court hearings last year in order to claim that the agency was still functioning. Bennett argued that a <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/cfpb-workers-told-to-stand-down-stop-all-work\" target=\"_blank\"><u>stop-work order</u></a></ps-link> issued last February was never rescinded and employees remain shut out of the agency's headquarters. </p><p>Evidence showed that while leadership sent emails claiming statutory duties would be performed, they simultaneously cut the teams responsible for those duties, terminated all physical office leases, and even set up a \"tip line\" to report employees who were still working.</p><p>\"This is a fundamental separation of powers claim about the structure or the very existence of an agency,\" Bennett said.</p><p>McArthur countered by saying: \"There was never any agency approved plan to RIF the entire workforce.\"</p><p>Still, the judges noted the \"breathtaking\" pace at which the administration moved to dismantle the CFPB last year, and that district court issued an injunction due to testimony suggesting the agency would have been eliminated within 30 days without judicial intervention. </p><p>Judge Florence Y. Pan suggested the scale of the alleged shutdown \"sounds very much like something that should be before district court.\" The arguments also focused on the limits of a court's equitable power to provide full relief to the injured parties.</p><p>\"What you want us to hold is that the CSRA has tentacles that reach across the entire litigation system to prevent courts from even ordering the government to comply with the Constitution by keeping functioning the offices that Congress has created and funded,\" Judge Pan said to McArthur.  </p><p>Several of the judges asked several times how the parties wanted an order to be written, but got no definitive response, said Joann Needleman, a member and leader of the financial services regulatory and compliance group at the law firm Clark Hill.</p><p>\"The judges are really struggling with what the path is going forward,\" Needeman said after the hearing. \"My sense is they don't want this case at all. They are going to punt [back to the district court] because they couldn't get a handle on what the legal issues are in the case.\"<br/></p></div>",

If approved, the new entity will allow the company to issue a U.S. dollar-pegged cryptocurrency called PAYO-USD, manage the reserves backing the token, and provide digital asset custody services.</p><p>The move comes just one day after the OCC conditionally approved a similar trust charter for cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com and merely two weeks after the agency granted a conditional charter to Bridge, a stablecoin infrastructure provider owned by Stripe and newly announced Payoneer product partner.</p><p>The rapid influx of non-traditional bank charters could alter the competitive landscape for U.S. commercial banks, and critics (including traditional banks of all sizes) are warning against the trend.</p><p>These newly chartered trust banks could function essentially as commercial banks by taking deposit-like funds via stablecoins, but without the strict capital, liquidity and community reinvestment requirements that full-service banks must follow, according to critics.</p><h2 class=\"cms-heading-h2 HeadingH2\">The Payoneer and Bridge partnership</h2><p>Payoneer's application closely follows a Feb. 17 announcement that the company partnered with Bridge to embed stablecoin receiving, holding, and sending capabilities directly into the Payoneer platform.</p><p>Days earlier, on Feb. 12, Bridge received its own conditional charter from the OCC, allowing the Stripe subsidiary to issue stablecoins and manage reserves under direct federal oversight.</p><p>While both companies seek to leverage stablecoins, their target applications differ.</p><p>Payoneer facilitates cross-border business and payments. The company says it serves nearly two million customers, specifically focusing on helping small- and medium-sized businesses in emerging markets connect to the global economy.</p><p>Bridge, which Stripe acquired earlier this month, provides back-end technology that enables other businesses to receive, store, convert, issue and spend stablecoins.</p><p>\"Bridge was built to abstract away the hardest parts of blockchain infrastructure so companies like Payoneer can focus on building great financial experiences,\" according to Zach Abrams, co-founder and CEO of Bridge.</p><p>Payoneer intends to integrate its proposed trust bank exclusively into its existing cross-border payments ecosystem, offering on-ramp and off-ramp settlement services directly to its nearly two million small- and medium-sized business customers.</p><h2 class=\"cms-heading-h2 HeadingH2\">A wave of stablecoin charters</h2><p>Recent charters granted by the Trump administration and Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan Gould represent an effort to welcome non-traditional financial firms into the federal banking system.</p><p>In December, the OCC conditionally approved five trust charters for digital asset firms, including Ripple, Paxos, and Fidelity Digital Assets.</p><p>To secure these approvals, the OCC required the banks to maintain a minimum amount of tier 1 capital—ranging from $6.05 million to $25 million—and hold 180 days of operating expenses in eligible liquid assets.</p><p>The OCC also forced the applicants to obtain written nonobjection from regulators before appointing senior executive officers and mandated that the firms conform all stablecoin activities to federal law.</p><p>The approvals are coming in fast. The OCC recently approved tech-focused Erebor Bank in just 125 days, compared to 406 days for a charter under the previous administration. The comptroller is often granting approvals in less than six months and clearly positioning itself as the favored bank regulator for digital assets, according to attorneys at law firm Latham &amp; Watkins.</p><h2 class=\"cms-heading-h2 HeadingH2\">Guardrails under the GENIUS Act</h2><p>The primary law governing these new stablecoin activities is the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, which President Trump signed in July 2025.</p><p>The GENIUS Act places specific limits on how chartered banks can operate stablecoin businesses. The law requires issuers to back their outstanding tokens on a one-to-one basis with highly liquid assets, such as U.S. currency or short-term Treasury bills.</p><p>The act strictly prohibits stablecoin issuers from paying interest or yield to token holders. Furthermore, the law explicitly subjects issuers to the Bank Secrecy Act, requiring them to maintain robust anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance programs.</p><h2 class=\"cms-heading-h2 HeadingH2\">Banks and consumer advocates push back</h2><p>Despite these guardrails, traditional banking trade groups strongly oppose the droves of bank charters the OCC has issued.</p><p>The largest banks in the U.S. want digital asset firms to seek full-service national banking charters rather than limited-purpose trust licenses if they want to offer bank-like products — an argument made by Paige Pidano Paridon, co-head of regulatory affairs at the Bank Policy Institute.</p><p>Community banks argue that stablecoins act as functional substitutes for demand deposits, allowing firms to evade the Bank Holding Company Act and operate as \"shadow banks,\" according to Mickey Marshall, regulatory counsel at the Independent Community Bankers of America.</p><p>Marshall also argued that stablecoins will drain trillions of dollars in core deposits out of local community banks, severely reducing their ability to fund small business and mortgage loans.</p><p>Consumer advocates also share concerns, with a focus on the Community Reinvestment Act, from which national trust banks are exempt.</p><p>This exemption allows firms such as Bridge and Payoneer to siphon deposits from low- and moderate-income areas without facing any corresponding statutory obligation to lend back to those communities, argues Jesse Van Tol, CEO of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.</p><p>Trade groups also warn that granting a \"national bank\" label to crypto firms misleads retail consumers into believing their funds carry Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. protection, exposing them to hidden risks in the event of an insolvency or cyberattack.</p><p><i>Melinda Huspen contributed reporting.</i><br/></p></div>",

Lisa Cook</li><li><b>Look ahead: </b>If AI boosts productivity, economic growth could remain strong even if unemployment rises, complicating the central bank's efforts to balance its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices.<br/></li></ul><p>Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook said Tuesday that the impact of generative artificial intelligence could take years, but signs are emerging such as lower demand for computer engineers.</p><p>Speaking during a panel at the National Association for Business Economics conference in Washington, Cook said it may take five to 10 years for AI-related productivity gains to be meaningfully quantified and reflected in the data.</p><p>\"It is very difficult to measure labor productivity and total factor productivity,\" Cook said during the panel. \"So we should be patient, and we should be nimble and thinking about the rollout of AI.\"</p><p>Still, early signs suggest AI is beginning to reshape the workplace. Cook said demand for workers in computer engineering fields is declining.</p><p>\"Demand for labor in certain occupations has declined—most notably for coders, a field where AI has made significant strides,\" she said in prepared remarks before the panel. \"Similarly, the unemployment rate for recent college grads has increased over the last few years at a time when some employers are deploying AI for tasks previously performed by entry-level workers.\"</p><p>Cook said it remains difficult to determine whether artificial intelligence is directly contributing to unemployment, particularly among younger workers entering the labor force. She said the central bank is \"very carefully\" monitoring whether AI adoption is affecting employment trends.</p><p>\"Labor force participation is declining, but this is something to be watched,\" she said.</p><p>The Fed official expressed caution about AI's long-term effect on the workforce. While new jobs are likely to emerge, she said, the transition could come \"with some costs.\"</p><p>\"The unemployment rate may rise and participation in the labor force may decline as the economy transitions,\" she said. \"This outcome could cause hardship for many workers and their families.\" Looking ahead, Cook said that if AI boosts productivity, economic growth could remain strong even if unemployment rises.</p><p>\"In a productivity boom such as this, a rise in unemployment may not indicate increased slack,\" she said. \"As such, our normal demand-side monetary policy may not be able to ameliorate an AI-caused unemployment spell without also increasing inflationary pressure.\"</p><p>As a result, <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/feds-cook-warns-against-assuming-ai-will-counter-inflation\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the central bank could face difficult tradeoffs</u></a></ps-link> between its dual mandate goals of <ps-link><a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/feds-goolsbee-prioritize-inflation-before-further-cuts\" target=\"_blank\"><u>maximum employment and stable prices</u></a></ps-link>, she said.</p><p>\"While there is a role for monetary policy, education, workforce, and other policies that is nonmonetary may be better suited to address these challenges in a more targeted way,\" Cook added.</p><p>Other Fed officials, including Gov.

            "description": "<div class=\"RichTextArticleBody-body RichTextBody\"><ul><li><b>Key insight: </b>Customer-satisfaction scores at superregional banks dropped 3% year over year, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index's 2026 Finance Study.<br/></li><li><b>What's at stake: </b>The dip created a gap in customer satisfaction between superregionals and the largest banks, which maintained their prior score.<br/></li><li><b>Supporting data: </b>Overall, banks scored 80 out of 100 on customer satisfaction, which was stable from the previous year.</li></ul><p>Customer-satisfaction scores for superregional banks declined over the last year, creating a gap between their performance and the biggest banks' scores, and widening the advantage held by smaller banks.</p><p>Superregionals' scores decreased by 3% compared to the prior year, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index 2026 Finance Study, which was released Tuesday. The latest score for such banks was 77 out of 100, down from 79 last year and returning to the level of their 2024 performance.</p><p>The ACSI defines superregionals as those that have at least $50 billion of assets but are smaller than the nation's Big 4 banks —  JPMorganChase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citi. The aggregate customer-satisfaction score for those banks held steady at 79, according to the report.</p><p>The slip among superregionals drove an even wider gap between them and smaller regional and community banks, whose aggregate customer-satisfaction score was 83 out of 100 for the second year in a row. That topped the banking industry's overall score, which came in at 80 for the third year in a row.</p><p>The gap in scores between superregionals and big banks may reflect the difference in scale between the two groups, with the latter having a much broader physical presence and more resources, both of which matter in terms of accessibility, said Forrest Morgeson, director of research emeritus at the American Customer Satisfaction Index.</p><p>The gap between superregionals and smaller banks reflects higher satisfaction among smaller-bank customers, Morgeson said. Regional and community banks, which are often viewed as having more of a \"community feel,\" scored higher than superregionals and big banks in all categories, except for the location and number of branches and ATMs, according to the report.</p><p>\"There's certainly a story to be told that we're seeing pressure put on [superregionals] as a whole that's not being put on regional or national banks,\" Morgeson, who is also an associate professor of marketing at Michigan State University, told American Banker. \"It's tough to say … but it may be the downside of not quite being a national bank or a regional bank.\"</p><p>The American Customer Satisfaction Index is a multi-industry measure of customer satisfaction in the U.S. In addition to banks, the annual finance study includes customer viewpoints on credit unions, financial advisory firms and online investment platforms.</p><p>Financial advisory firms scored 82 out of 100, the highest score among the four categories. Online investment firms achieved a score of 79, while credit unions came in at 78.</p><p>This year's findings are based on 14,210 surveys that were completed throughout the course of 2025 by actual customers of financial institutions. Customers were asked to evaluate their recent experiences with their financial institutions.</p><p>Of the 10 superregional banks that got scores in both 2025 and 2026, two maintained their previous scores, while the rest saw their scores decrease. Regions Bank, the banking subsidiary of Regions Financial, experienced the steepest decline in satisfaction among the superregionals, with its score falling 7% year over year. The Birmingham, Alabama-based bank received a score of 77, down from 83 last year.</p><p>Regions did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request for comment. </p><p>Citizens Bank, the banking arm of Providence, Rhode Island-based Citizens Financial Group, had the second-largest decline. Its score declined 4% year over year, coming in at 74.</p><p>A Citizens spokesperson declined to comment on the findings.</p><p>The highest-scoring superregional was USAA Bank, whose score was 82, down from 84 last year. Huntington Bank, the banking subsidiary of Huntington Bancshares, came in second with a score of 81, followed by TD Bank with a score of 80.</p><p>The report doesn't pinpoint the exact reasons for an individual bank's change in score. But it does offer an overview of customer satisfaction across 12 benchmarks, including the number and location of branches and ATMs, the competitiveness of interest rates and the effectiveness of call-center help.</p><p>Superregionals as a whole scored below big banks in all categories. They scored below regional and community banks in all categories except for the number and location of branches.</p><p>Though other industries are improving their satisfaction scores, the banking industry's stable score of 80 is still \"pretty good,\" Morgeson said. \"We've seen a lot of disruption in this industry with the introduction of new technologies, so stability is not a bad outcome in this case.\"</p><p>One factor to watch next year: whether or not mergers and acquisitions impact customers' satisfaction with their banks. M&amp;A activity increased noticeably last year.</p><p>In the past, more consolidation has led to heightened customer dissatisfaction, Morgeson said.</p><p>\"If we do have a wave of M&amp;A activity, we could see a year or two where scores follow a negative trajectory,\" Morgeson said.</p></div>",

Quarterly net earnings were still 16.5% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2024. </p><p>The industry's net interest spread increased to 3.39%, the highest level since early 2019, as interest paid on deposits fell at a slower rate than yields banks recouped on assets. The high profitability may partially be a result of more lending by firms. The fourth quarter report showed total loans and leases, which reached a total of $13.5 trillion, grew $267.8, or 2.0% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2025. Loans grew 5.9% on a yearly basis from 2024 to 2025. Loan growth largely occurred in the credit card, nonbank lending and commercial real estate sectors. </p><p>Total domestic deposits rose $318.3 billion, marking the sixth quarterly increase in a row. Falling mortgage rates also reduced unrealized securities losses on bank balance sheets by 9.2%, settling at $306.1 billion. </p><p>Credit conditions at firms showed positive and negative results. While FDIC Chairman Travis Hill expressed optimism that the industry was not seeing imminent deterioration, the rate of delinquent loans increased by 1.56%. Delinquencies were at high levels in credit card, auto-loan and commercial real estate portfolios. Hill said credit conditions remain stable overall. </p><p>\"This was another strong quarter for the industry. Strong results, both in the fourth quarter and for the year,\" Hill said. \"From a credit quality perspective, we still have no, no evidence of any deterioration, so still favorable conditions.\"</p><p>Three additional banks were added to the FDIC's problem bank list, which hit 60 banks, or 1.4% of all banks, compared with 57 in the prior quarter. The Deposit Insurance Fund, a depositor rescue fund into which banks pay fees, crept up to $153.9 billion.</p><p>In line with the long-term trend of consolidation in the banking industry, the total number of banks fell by 43 institutions in late 2025, with 4,336 total banks left standing. 36 banks merged during this time, four were sold to nonbanks and two voluntarily liquidated, while one bank opened. </p><p>No banks failed in the fourth quarter of 2025.
