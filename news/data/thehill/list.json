Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) argued that the measure, which President Trump <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5384512-trump-signs-big-beautiful-bill/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5384512-trump-signs-big-beautiful-bill/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">signed into law in July</a>, prioritizes corporations, including fossil fuel companies, over everyday Americans.</p>\n<p>“In 2024, Donald Trump stood before a room of wealthy oil executives and promised to protect their interests if they spent $1 billion to help elect him. He has now upheld his end of the bargain — slashing health care and food assistance for struggling families in the Republicans’ Big, Ugly Betrayal bill to deliver a massive $3.5 billion tax giveaway per year to the fossil fuel industry,” Merkley, the top Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, said in a written statement. </p>\n<p>“President Trump and Republicans are handing billions of dollars to the corporations responsible for poisoning our planet and profiting off the cost-of-living crisis facing hardworking Americans,” he added.</p>\n<p>Republicans have argued that the bill will bolster the economy.</p>\n<p>“This bill will fuel massive economic growth,” Trump said upon signing it, specifically touting its help for coal.</p>\n<p>Reached for comment on the Democrats’ report, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers touted the administration’s pro-fossil fuel policies.</p>\n<p>“Thanks to President Trump’s energy dominance agenda, American oil production has hit record highs and gas prices are at multi-year lows. After four years of Democrats waging war on America’s energy independence, the President has stopped costly and unpopular Green New Scam handouts while delivering on his promises to unleash American energy,” Rogers said. </p>\n<p>“President Trump is protecting our national security by boosting our domestic fossil fuel production to reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries, secure our vital supply chains, and ensure we have the necessary resources to meet both our energy and defense needs,” she added.</p>\n<p>The White House also noted that the fossil fuel spending pales in comparison to green subsidies that were passed as part of the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act. The 2022 Democratic bill included a total of <u><a href=\"https://earthjustice.org/article/the-biggest-climate-spending-bill-ever-just-turned-two-heres-what-it-has-achieved\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$391 billion</a></u> over 10 years for low-carbon energy and other efforts to combat climate change.</p>\n<p>The new report highlights estimates from authorities such as Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation. It points to the joint committee’s estimate that the bill’s increase in tax credits for sequestering and using carbon dioxide to pump more oil could be worth a total of $14.2 billion over 10 years. </p>\n<p>It also points to an estimate from climate think tank Resources For the Future that reductions in royalties for producing oil and gas on public lands and in public waters will <a href=\"https://www.resources.org/common-resources/if-then-new-cuts-to-oil-and-gas-royalty-rates-in-budget-reconciliation-will-reduce-federal-revenues/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">save the industry</a> billions more. The estimate finds that federal revenues will be cut by $6 billion over 10 years.</p>\n<p>The Democrats extrapolate that this means a total of $12 billion in savings, as revenues are split between states and the federal government, though the think tank’s own estimates of state losses appear to be a bit lower.</p>\n<p>It also highlights estimates of the cost of policies like the $1.5 billion in <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5378898-gop-megabill-coal-subsidy-steel-trump/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tax credits for coal</a>.</p>\n<p>The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature economic policy legislation, was passed with only Republican support last year.

            "title": "Whistleblower: Kash Patel tied up FBI resources during Kirk investigation?",
            "description": "<p>Let’s start with what matters most: when a political activist is murdered on a college campus, the American people expect the FBI to move immediately. No delays. No distractions. Just action.  </p>\n<p>Now, there are serious allegations that in the aftermath of the assassination of Charlie Kirk at a Utah university, the FBI’s elite shooting reconstruction team was delayed in getting to the scene — not because they weren’t ready, but because of a pilot shortage tied to FBI Director Kash Patel’s use of bureau aircraft.  </p>\n<p>According to Sen. Dick Durbin, a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5753195-whistleblower-allege-fbi-jet-misuse/amp/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">whistleblower told his office</a> that FBI pilots who had flown Patel hit federally mandated flight-hour limits, triggering required FAA rest periods. That meant the team tasked with analyzing and reconstructing the shooting scene couldn’t deploy for at least a day. Reuters has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-chief-patels-travel-decision-making-hampered-investigations-senate-democrat-2026-02-24/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> it could not independently verify those claims. The FBI has strongly denied the allegations, with spokesperson Ben Williamson calling them “ridiculous” and saying Director Patel was on official travel at the time.  </p>\n<p>Here’s why this matters.  </p>\n<p>The FBI director is required, for security reasons, to travel on government aircraft, even for personal trips, and must reimburse the government at the cost of a commercial flight. That’s not new. What is new is the scrutiny over how frequently those planes are being used and whether those decisions are affecting operations.  </p>\n<p>Durbin alleges this isn’t an isolated concern. He also points to the response to the Brown University shooting, <a href=\"https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/report-patels-sfl-flight-delayed-fbi-response-to-brown-university-shooting-40527333/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claiming</a> Patel’s decision to put the Hostage Rescue Team on standby, instead of activating closer regional SWAT teams, effectively tied up bureau aircraft and forced other responders to drive overnight. The FBI disputes that characterization, noting the incident was initially state-led and saying resources were not delayed because of director travel.  </p>\n<p>So at this point, we have competing narratives. On one side: a senior senator citing whistleblower claims of operational strain and delayed deployments. On the other: the bureau flatly rejecting the accusations and defending Patel’s travel as official and appropriate.  </p>\n<p>But let’s zoom out for a second.  </p>\n<p>The head of the FBI sets the tone. And <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5753195-whistleblower-allege-fbi-jet-misuse/amp/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to Durbin</a>, Patel once told field offices, “If you have golf, hockey, fishing, or hunting and beautiful sights, you’re going to see a lot of me.” Maybe that was a joke. Maybe it wasn’t. But leadership optics matter, especially when you’re overseeing time-sensitive, life-and-death investigations.  </p>\n<p>This isn’t about beer in a locker room or optics at the Olympics. It’s about whether taxpayer-funded resources are being managed in a way that prioritizes mission first, every single time.  </p>\n<p>If even the perception exists that travel decisions could delay justice in a murder case, that’s not partisan. That’s a governance issue.  </p>\n<p>The Government Accountability Office and the Justice Department’s inspector general are now being asked to look into it. That’s appropriate.   </p>\n<p>At the end of the day, this is simple: leadership is about judgment. And when you run the nation’s top law enforcement agency, judgment isn’t a side issue — it’s the job.  </p>\n<p><em>Lindsey Granger is a NewsNation contributor and co-host of The Hill’s commentary show “Rising.” This column is an edited transcription of her on-air commentary.  </em> </p>",

He said his first preference is diplomacy but added he would never allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. </p>\n<p>The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/u-s-brings-tough-demands-to-iran-nuclear-talks-8aab06ad?mod=hp_lead_pos3\">reported that the U.S. showed up to the talks</a> with at least three priority demands. This includes that Iran must destroy its main nuclear sites, Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. Iran must also hand over all of its remaining enriched uranium to the U.S. And any negotiated deal must last forever. </p>\n<p>The 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, which Trump exited in 2018, was criticized by Iran hawks in the U.S. as sunsetting restrictions on the nation’s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>Iran maintains its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and that uranium enrichment is a national right, rejecting U.S. ultimatums to give up enrichment completely. Reported proposals for a deal are said to include Iran being permitted uranium enrichment to about 1.5 percent, far below the 60 percent enriched uranium it currently possesses. Another proposal is allowing Iran to enrich uranium for medical purposes. </p>\n<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Wednesday that the talks taking place in Geneva are primarily focused on Iran’s nuclear program, despite the U.S. warning that Iran’s ballistic missile capabilities pose a threat to the U.S. and its allies.</p>\n<p>Trump has also brought up Iran’s human rights violations, its killing of an <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-deaths-in-irans-crackdown-on-protests-reach-at-least-7000-activists-say/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-deaths-in-irans-crackdown-on-protests-reach-at-least-7000-activists-say/\">estimated thousands </a>of protesters during mass demonstrations between December and January; Iran’s support for terrorist proxies — such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza — and Iran’s responsibility in the death of American service members. </p>\n<p>Lawmakers are looking to hold a vote on a <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5753315-trump-iran-military-force-resolution-fails/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5753315-trump-iran-military-force-resolution-fails/\">war powers resolution</a> to block the president from taking military action against Iran without approval from Congress. </p>\n<p>While there is bipartisan agreement that the <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5756532-trump-iran-strikes-regime-change/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5756532-trump-iran-strikes-regime-change/\">Iranian regime</a> is a threat to the U.S. and its allies, some lawmakers warn the president is not making the case for urgent action. </p>\n<p>“A war with Iran today is both unnecessary and dangerous,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Virg), the sponsor of the resolution, said on the Senate floor on Thursday. A vote is expected next week. </p>\n<p>“We shouldn’t be at war without a vote of Congress… I can’t believe that this nation is like, itching for another war in the Middle East,” he continued.</p>\n<p>“Haven’t we learned something from a quarter century of war in the Middle East? I hope we have,” the senator added. “I hope my colleagues will join me in suggesting no war unless we vote to authorize it.” </p>",

            "description": "<p>Sports personality Stephen A. Smith said Wednesday that President Trump has been “playing” Democrats “like a fiddle” for over a decade, pointing to comments in Trump’s <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754101-trump-state-union-address-takeaways/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754101-trump-state-union-address-takeaways/\">State of the Union address</a> about undocumented migrants.</p>\n<p>“And he’s making the claim that you hate him so much, you’re devoid of objectivity, and you’re devoid of thinking about what’s in the best interest in the United States of America because you’re too busy thinking about your own personal feelings and animus towards him. And every time you do that, he smiles and mocks you and has a field day,” Smith said on his SiriusXM show “Straight Shooter with Stephen A.”</p>\n<p>“You played right into his hand. Don’t come back at me and say ‘Eff Stephen A. Smith,’ or ‘Stephen A. Smith is selling out’ or ‘Stephen A. Smith is this way or that way.’ I’m just telling you what it is. Don’t kill the messenger. Shape the message in a fashion that benefits you for once. The man has been playing y’all like a fiddle for 11 years now, and you still can’t beat him,” he added.</p>\n<p>Trump pressed Democrats on immigration Tuesday during his State of the Union address, asking members of Congress if they prioritize U.S. citizens or undocumented migrants.</p>\n<p>“One of the great things about the State of the Union is how it gives Americans the chance to see clearly what their representatives really believe,” the president said.</p>\n<p>“So, tonight, I’m inviting every legislator to join with my administration in reaffirming a fundamental principle. If you agree with this statement, then stand up and show your support: The first duty of the American government is to protect American citizens, not illegal aliens,” he added.</p>\n<p>Democrats mostly stayed seated in response to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754101-trump-state-union-address-takeaways/\">Trump’s comments. </a></p>\n<p>Throughout his second term, the Trump administration has faced criticism over its strict immigration agenda. However, that criticism exploded last month in the wake of the killing of two people, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, in Minneapolis by federal immigration authorities.</p>",

            "description": "<p>While most of America has been celebrating the awesome victory of our Olympic hockey team over Canada for the first time in 40 years, not everybody is so pleased with them. Sound crazy, right? But a New York Times columnist for their Athletic subsection, Jerry Brewer, wrote a column saying that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/7068426/2026/02/24/usa-mens-olympics-hockey-gold-donald-trump/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the team “won gold — and then lost the room.”</a>  </p>\n<p>What? What room, the feminist studies department at some sports-hating, fun-killing liberal arts college? Because I think most people are pretty happy about the win, even if you don’t like or care about hockey. I fully admit this is the most interested I’ve been in hockey since I was a kid in Detroit in the ’ 90s, watching our Red Wings win the Stanley Cup. </p>\n<p>So what gives?  </p>\n<p>Well, The New York Times, and some other liberals, are mad that some members of our hockey team had the audacity to meet with President Trump. Shake his hand, even. Accept medals from him, and praise. How shocking! How horrifying! Don’t they know they are helping to normalize fascism!?! </p>\n<p>Seriously, that’s it. That’s the problem. </p>\n<p>Brewer writes: “These are men who thrilled a nation and rocked the world, and as adults, they need to be more savvy. Trump, perhaps more than most modern presidents, understands the optics of standing next to winners. It normalizes him. It softens his cruel instincts and crude jokes, recasting them as locker-room banter. It washes his reputation and reduces the impact of polls that indicate a significant majority of Americans disapprove of his second term.  </p>\n<p>These champions have agency. In the afterglow of triumph, they have more agency than they ever will. They should be wary of giving it away so casually.” </p>\n<p>OK, but here’s the problem with that: supporters of Trump are the majority of the country. He won the election and the popular vote. Trump is normal now. Sorry about that. </p>\n<p>I would agree that it doesn’t help us at all for professional athletes to lean way into politics, or start talking about their views on issues. In fact, the hockey team avoided doing just that. But coming to the State of the Union, taking a photo with Trump — come on. That is normal. It’s normal no matter who the president is. Remember Barack Obama <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Barack_Obama_with_artistic_gymnastic_McKayla_Maroney_2.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">taking a photo</a> with Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney?  </p>\n<p>I don’t remember people being upset about that. I wasn’t. I thought it was a cool photo! </p>\n<p>The New York Times needs to get over itself. Chill out. There’s nothing wrong with the president being excited about the performance of our Olympians, and our athletes receiving some much deserved admiration. </p>\n<p>Ironically, the one athlete the liberal media did seem eager to celebrate was Eileen Gu, a traitor <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/19/sport/eileen-gu-china-us-controversy-winter-olympics-intl-hnk\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">who chose to compete on China’s Olympic team.</a> You’d think that if we’re so worried about normalizing totalitarianism, we’d be more upset about an athlete choosing to associate herself with one of the world’s most brutal and authoritarian regimes: Communist China. </p>\n<p>But liberal Vox <a href=\"https://x.com/AGHamilton29/status/2026487801684889941\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hailed Gu as a “winner”</a> of the narrative surrounding the Olympics. And they said the US Men’s hockey team were losers because they met with Trump. Losers.  </p>\n<p>Ridiculous. And mainstream media wonders why so many Americans hate them? </p>\n<p><em>Robby Soave is co-host of The Hill’s commentary show “Rising” and a senior editor for Reason Magazine.

Omani Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi <a href=\"https://x.com/badralbusaidi/status/2027089708392579576?s=20\">wrote on social media</a> after the meeting that the sides made “significant progress” and “will resume soon after consultation in the respective capitals.”</p>\n<p>The foreign minister added that “technical” discussions will take place next week in Vienna, Austria. </p>\n<p>The meeting came two days after Trump again <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5755742-trump-iran-nuclear-threat/\">vowed to ensure</a> that Iran never develops a nuclear weapon. Last June, the president said that <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5363831-iran-nuclear-site-damage-trump-iran/\">U.S. strikes obliterated</a> three Iranian nuclear sites.</p>\n<p>“My preference is to solve this problem through diplomacy,” the president said Tuesday during his <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754101-trump-state-union-address-takeaways/\">State of the Union address</a>. “But one thing is certain, I will never allow the world’s No. 1 sponsor of terror, which they are by far, to have a nuclear weapon.”</p>\n<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said Wednesday that while the Islamic Republic is not currently enriching uranium, it is “trying to get to the point” where it can. </p>\n<p>“After their nuclear program was obliterated, they were told not to try to restart it, and here they are,” Rubio told reporters. “You can see them always trying to rebuild elements of it.”</p>\n<p>But Kaine, who said his war powers resolution on preventing the president from going to war with Iran without congressional approval will “likely” hit the Senate floor next week, pointed out Thursday that the rhetoric from the administration does not line up with Trump’s assertions last summer that the sites were obliterated.</p>\n<p>He also noted the administration is deporting Iranians, despite the president pledging to stand with the Iranian people amid widespread protests against the repressive regime.</p>\n<p>“They don’t care about how Iranians are treated,” said the Virginia Democrat.</p>",
