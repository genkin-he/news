Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) held a virtual press conference Wednesday to demand the administration send money back to small businesses and consumers, arguing that <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/business/5737182-tariffs-trump-us-businesses-impact/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/business/5737182-tariffs-trump-us-businesses-impact/\">American businesses and consumers</a> paid 96 percent of the costs for the “<a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5747353-read-supreme-court-trump-tariffs-ruling/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5747353-read-supreme-court-trump-tariffs-ruling/\">illegal</a>” tariffs, generating some $130 billion in federal revenue. She demanded Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5747881-supreme-court-tariff-refunds/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5747881-supreme-court-tariff-refunds/\">issue refunds</a> immediately.</p>\n<p>“That’s money that President Trump now owes back to the American people,” Gillibrand said. </p>\n<p>She added that tariffs and remarks from the president deeply offended Canadians, significantly reducing tourism that keeps businesses in New York afloat.</p>\n<p>To force the administration to issue refunds, the New York Democrat said companies should sue the trade commission. She also encouraged local businesses struggling without Canadian customers should write to Attorney General Letitia James (D) for legal support.</p>\n<p>“I imagine our attorney general will file a lawsuit,” she added. “I think it’s the best way for us to get our money back.”</p>\n<p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul’s (D) office would not comment on the potential for a lawsuit but said the state government would explore all of its options to get refunds for New Yorkers.</p>\n<p>Officials presented different data points to estimate alleged economic damage. Gillibrand said the tariffs cost the average New York household about $4,200 per year. Meanwhile, a <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5754391-new-york-kathy-hochul-tariff-refunds-trump-supreme-court/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5754391-new-york-kathy-hochul-tariff-refunds-trump-supreme-court/\">statement from Hochul</a> on Tuesday cited the Yale Budget Lab, estimating $1,751 per household in new costs since the 2025 tariffs were enacted.</p>\n<p>Rochester business owner Ben Pearson manufactures science kits, according to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and lost $1 million to tariffs — creating a deficit that forced him to reduce his workforce by 20 percent. Schumer invited Pearson to President Trump’s <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754101-trump-state-union-address-takeaways/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754101-trump-state-union-address-takeaways/\">State of the Union address</a> Tuesday night to demonstrate the financial strain in the state.</p>\n<p>“Upstate NY is paying the price for Trump’s cost-increasing policies, and it needs to stop,” Schumer said in a press release ahead of the <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754220-donald-trump-2026-state-of-the-union-record-speech/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754220-donald-trump-2026-state-of-the-union-record-speech/\">record-long speech</a>.</p>\n<p>After the address, conservatives in New York defended the president, targeting Hochul’s leadership instead. New York State Conservative Party Chair Gerard Kassar released a statement afterward praising Trump’s <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754028-trump-state-of-the-union-memorable-moments/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754028-trump-state-of-the-union-memorable-moments/\">State of the Union remarks</a>, arguing that he offered a sensible vision to counter progressive policies.</p>\n<p>Other than international travel, tariffs also disrupted agriculture, according to the governor. </p>\n<p>Hochul proposed a $30 million relief plan to help farmers offset the higher costs of equipment and fertilizer. According to her office, over 80 percent of agrochemical imports and 70 percent of farm machinery come from countries tariffed at 10 percent or more.</p>",

            "description": "<p>The Trump administration’s decision to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/09/health/trump-public-health-cuts-california.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">slash $600 million in public health funding</a> from California, Colorado, Illinois and Minnesota isn’t just cruel or vindictive. It is breathtakingly stupid. </p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/09/health/trump-public-health-cuts-california.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">documents reviewed by The New York Times</a>, the administration plans to rescind hundreds of millions in grants administered through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — funds that state and local health departments use for everything from hiring staff and modernizing data systems to managing disease outbreaks and preventing the spread of HIV. </p>\n<p>The rationale? These grants “<a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2026-02-11/trump-pulls-600m-in-public-health-funds-from-four-states\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">do not reflect agency priorities</a>.” Translation: The states that receive them are run by Democrats. </p>\n<p>This is weaponization of public health funding for partisan retribution. It is government by grievance, policy by punishment, and it carries consequences that will reverberate far beyond the borders of the blue states that the administration seems so eager to penalize. </p>\n<p>Start with the most elementary fact of epidemiology: Infectious diseases do not recognize state borders or consult electoral maps. As former CDC chief medical officer Dr. Deb Houry pointedly noted, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/09/health/trump-public-health-cuts-california.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">these cuts are happening “in the middle of a measles outbreak and other health threats</a>.”</p>\n<p>Measles, for those who need reminding, is <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">one of the most contagious diseases</a> known to science. An outbreak that festers in a defunded California county doesn’t politely stop at the Nevada state line. It spreads — to Arizona, to Texas, to Florida, to every red state whose leaders might now be applauding this vindictive budget maneuver. </p>\n<p>This isn’t hypothetical. In December 2014, a measles outbreak that began at Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., spread within weeks to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6406a5.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">six other states, Mexico and Canada</a>, ultimately infecting more than <a href=\"https://qmrawiki.org/case-studies/measles-outbreak-theme-park-southern-california-and-propagation-through-california\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">147 people in the U.S. alone</a>. Among the hardest hit beyond California: <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6406a5.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Arizona, a red state, with seven linked cases, and deep-red Utah, with three</a>.</p>\n<p>The virus didn’t care that it was crossing from blue California into reliably conservative territory. It simply followed the unvaccinated. </p>\n<p>Nearly two dozen of the targeted grants were specifically aimed at curbing HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Among the casualties: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/09/health/trump-public-health-cuts-california.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$5.2 million</a> from Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago for expanding HIV prevention therapy among Black women, and $<a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2026-02-11/trump-pulls-600m-in-public-health-funds-from-four-states\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">371,000 from the Colorado Health Network</a> for outreach to Latino and African American men. </p>\n<p>These are precisely the kinds of community-based interventions that prevent localized health crises from becoming national ones. Gut them, and you aren’t owning the libs. You’re seeding the next epidemic. </p>\n<p>Then there’s the economic argument, which should matter even to those unmoved by humanitarian concerns. Illness is expensive. The CDC’s core public health infrastructure grants exist precisely because prevention is orders of magnitude cheaper than treatment.  </p>\n<p>California alone accounts for nearly two-thirds of the rescinded funding. <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/04/23/california-is-now-the-4th-largest-economy-in-the-world/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">California is also the world’s fourth-largest economy</a>. When its public health infrastructure falters, the economic ripple effects don’t stay in Sacramento. They radiate through supply chains, labor markets and interstate commerce. </p>\n<p>The administration’s own stated rationale makes this worse, not better. The CDC’s website now declares that focusing on diseases that disproportionately affect certain populations “<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/about/cdc/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">has not translated into measurable improved health for minority populations, and in many cases has undermined core American values</a>.” </p>\n<p>Set aside the Orwellian redefinition of “American values” as something incompatible with helping sick people. The practical effect of this ideology is to abandon the populations most vulnerable to infectious disease — which means abandoning the early-warning systems that protect everyone else. </p>\n<p>Diseases that circulate unchecked in marginalized communities eventually find their way into the general population. We learned this lesson with AIDS. We learned it again with COVID-19. Apparently, we need to learn it once more. </p>\n<p>There is also something deeply cruel about this approach to governance. Last month, Health and Human Services briefly <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/24/public-health-infrastructure-grants-cdc-paused-states/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">paused $5 billion in public health infrastructure grants</a> to ensure they were “aligned” with administration goals, only to reverse course within 24 hours after the ensuing uproar. Now comes $600 million in permanent cuts, targeted with surgical precision at states the president lost. This isn’t fiscal discipline: It’s a tantrum with a budget pen. </p>\n<p>Public health is, by definition, a collective enterprise. It works only when the entire system works — when every state has the resources to detect, track and contain threats before they spiral beyond control. Defunding four states doesn’t strengthen the remaining 46. It weakens them all. </p>\n<p>If this administration truly cared about American health and economic strength, it would invest more in public health infrastructure, not less — recognizing that disease surveillance in California protects families in Alabama, and HIV prevention in Illinois saves health care dollars in Mississippi.</p>\n<p>Instead, we get cruelty masquerading as policy. And when the next outbreak tears across state lines — because it will — the cost will be measured not in partisan points scored, but in American lives lost.</p>\n<p><em>Michelle A. Williams is a professor of epidemiology and population health at Stanford University School of Medicine and former dean of the Harvard T.H.

That might seem like a lot, but it’s not really, considering that it’s only 0.2 percent of their total collective wealth. Let’s also not forget that they and the rest of the rich in America got another <a href=\"https://itep.org/tax-provisions-in-trump-megabill-national-and-state-level-estimates/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">massive tax break</a> with Republicans’ so-called “<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">One Big Beautiful Bill</a>” last summer.</p>\n<p>The 2026 Billionaire Tax Act would go a long way in helping California billionaires finally start paying their fair share in taxes back into the public systems — the schools, roads, courts and more — that allowed them to get so incredibly wealthy in the first place.</p>\n<p>While we should not dismiss the idea that some rich people may leave if such a tax is enacted, we should not allow those few individuals to hold the state hostage to their tax preferences. Especially because the evidence we have available today suggests that wealthy people do not move in droves when lawmakers raise their taxes. </p>\n<p>In his 2017 book, “<a href=\"https://www.sup.org/books/sociology/myth-millionaire-tax-flight\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Myth of Millionaire Tax Flight: How Place Still Matters for the Rich</a>,” Cornell University Professor Cristobal Young found that just 2.4 percent of millionaires in America move to a different state every year — compared to 2.9 percent for the general population. He explains that millionaires are more rooted to their home bases because their financial success is intimately embedded within their communities given their powerful social and business connections.  </p>\n<p>More recent research corroborates Young’s findings. In December 2023, the Fiscal Policy Institute <a href=\"https://fiscalpolicy.org/migration\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that the millionaire population in New York state had grown after tax hikes were instituted in 2017 and 2021. After <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_30,_Sales_and_Income_Tax_Increase_Initiative_(2012)\">Proposition 30</a> went into effect California, state revenues increased by <a href=\"https://calbudgetcenter.org/resources/what-has-proposition-30-meant-for-california/\">$7 billion-$8 billion per year</a>, according to the California Budget &amp; Policy Center  — a sure sign the tax didn’t empty the state of millionaires. More recently, the Institute for Policy Studies found the same when they studied the <a href=\"https://ips-dc.org/report-wealth-expands-after-higher-state-taxes-on-high-income-earners/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">number of millionaires in Washington and Massachusetts</a> after they passed tax hikes on the rich in 2022. </p>\n<p>But even if billionaires do flee California in an attempt to avoid the tax, they will not be successful. That’s because the initiative would enact the one-time tax on their net worth in 2025. In other words, so long as they were living in California on<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/us/california-billionaires-wealth-tax.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Jan 1, 2026</a>, they’re paying it.  </p>\n<p>Those of us who have W-2 income and capital gains pay a lot of tax to make for a healthier, safer and well-educated California, as we should. It is the fair thing to do. The billionaires have to start paying their fair share too. We can no longer allow them to exploit tax loopholes that let their wealth grow to oligarchic levels while they benefit from public goods and services. </p>\n<p>Despite what the public whining from a few of them may suggest, if the initiative passes and they have to pay the tax, they will be absolutely fine, especially compared to the <a href=\"https://calbudgetcenter.org/resources/californias-persistent-poverty-crisis-2024-rates-remain-alarmingly-high/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">7 million Californians </a>who live in poverty. </p>\n<p>It is time California residents and lawmakers stand up and break free from the grip billionaires have on our tax policy. We can no longer let them dictate what is a reasonable tax policy when it comes to funding social and public services they rely on. </p>\n<p><em>Maureen Kennedy is a member of <a href=\"https://patrioticmillionaires.org/\">Patriotic Millionaires</a> and former deputy assistant secretary for policy at the Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Clinton administration.

            "title": "Falling crime and a strong border haven't lifted Trump's ratings — why not?",
            "description": "<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Stand in a grocery store checkout line, and the last few years show up on the receipt.</p>\n<p>Inflation has cooled dramatically from its peak. Economists are right about that. Prices are no longer rising at the pace they were two years ago. But the total at the bottom of the receipt still hits hard. Lower inflation means slower increases — not a return to earlier costs. Families reorganized budgets. They absorbed the shock, and the memory of strain remains.</p>\n<p>Now consider the broader picture. On paper, the shifts of the past year are significant. Inflation has fallen sharply. The stock market has returned to record territory. Unemployment remains historically low. Gas prices are down from the highs that rattled households.</p>\n<p>At the southern border, the operational reality looks markedly different from four years ago, when major enforcement policies were reversed and programs like “Remain in Mexico” were ended. At that time, incentives shifted, crossings surged and the system strained visibly. Americans watched images of overwhelmed facilities and chaotic crossings and formed an impression that ran deep.</p>\n<p>Today, encounters are dramatically lower. Enforcement is much tighter. The border is more controlled than it has been in years. The difference is operational and measurable.</p>\n<p>Violent crime tells a similar story. After the pandemic-era spike that sent homicide rates soaring, national data and reporting from major metropolitan areas show one of the steepest year-over-year declines in decades. In several large cities, murders have fallen at double-digit rates. Lives that might have been lost were not. Neighborhoods that felt unstable are experiencing relief.</p>\n<p>These are consequential reversals. And yet presidential approval remains underwater.</p>\n<p>For President Trump, this disconnect between measurable progress and public approval reveals something deeper about how leadership is processed in modern America.</p>\n<p>The old equation was straightforward: Improve conditions, and voters will reward you. Restore order, and confidence will follow. Deliver economic stability, and approval rises.</p>\n<p>But that equation is no longer automatic.</p>\n<p>Most Americans are not blind to improvement. They understand the border is more controlled than during the period of peak disorder. They see crime statistics trending downward. They know inflation is no longer surging. But acknowledgment is not the same as trust. </p>\n<p>Instability leaves an imprint. Families adjust finances. Communities adapt to disruption. Voters form conclusions about competence and direction long before conditions stabilize. When order returns, it does not erase memory overnight.</p>\n<p>Then there’s tone. Trump isn’t merely a policy actor — he is a polarizing presence. Supporters view confrontation as strength. Opponents experience it as provocation. The intensity of opposition toward him is extraordinary, and his rhetoric has consistently supplied fuel for it.</p>\n<p>Tone does not negate policy gains, but it shapes whether those gains expand confidence beyond the base. Escalation energizes loyalty, but it rarely broadens trust.</p>\n<p>Republican leaders often operate within that same confrontational current. Democratic leaders face a different temptation: to treat improvement as irrelevant if acknowledging it risks validating an opponent. When border encounters drop sharply, the instinct is often to emphasize what remains broken rather than what has changed. When crime falls, the response is to question the data or shift focus elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Both instincts narrow the field. One mistakes intensity for persuasion. The other mistakes resistance for principle.</p>\n<p>The result is a paradox. A president can preside over falling homicide rates, sharply reduced border encounters, cooling inflation, and strong employment, and still struggle to expand approval beyond hardened lines.</p>\n<p>The improvements remain significant. Lower homicide rates save lives. Reduced border encounters alter operational realities. Cooling inflation eases pressure. Strong employment expands opportunity.</p>\n<p>But results do not interpret themselves.</p>\n<p>Leadership is not only about producing results. It’s about helping people make sense of them. It’s about connecting statistics to lived experience. It’s about projecting steadiness in posture as well as policy.</p>\n<p>In a polarized era, performance alone does not carry the day. Story matters more than statistics. For Republicans, that means translating policy wins into the language of stability rather than grievance and allowing governance, at least occasionally, to step out of campaign mode.</p>\n<p>For Democrats, it means competing on future vision rather than permanent alarm. When measurable improvements occur, acknowledging them strengthens credibility rather than weakening opposition.</p>\n<p>American history offers perspective. The country has endured volatility before. Markets rebound. Crime recedes. Border flows shift. Institutions adjust.</p>\n<p>The open question is whether leaders adjust with the same discipline. Progress matters. But today, people follow more than performance. They follow the story that helps them make sense of change, and the tone that tells them whether stability is real.</p>\n<p>Governing well remains essential. Helping a divided nation believe what has improved may be the harder task.</p>\n<p><em>Jeff Evans is a political consultant, leadership communications advisor, and author of </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Storytelling-Leadership-Influence-Leaders-Meaning-ebook/dp/B0GDQDYLJ9\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“<em>Storytelling for Leadership and Influence</em>.”</a></p>\n</blockquote>",

            "description": "<p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban — fighting for his political life ahead of Hungary’s April 12 elections — is once again attacking Ukraine.</p>\n<p>This time, he is callously blackmailing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/slovakia-threatens-stop-electricity-ukraine-unless-kyiv-resumes-piping-russian-2026-02-21/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">refusing to backstop Ukraine’s electrical grid</a> if needed, unless Kyiv agrees to let Russian oil flow once again through the Druzhba oil pipeline.</p>\n<p>Ukraine’s answer? It sent <a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/70609\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">35-plus drones</a> 930 miles deep inside of Russia to strike the Kaleykino oil pumping facility — a critical node of the Druzhba pipeline — destroying multiple “pump lines and crude oil storage reservoirs.”</p>\n<p>Earlier, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/hungarys-foreign-minister-says-country-will-block-key-eu-loan-to-ukraine-until-russian-oil-shipments-resume\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Orban had threatened to block</a> a $106 billion European Union loan to Ukraine unless his demands were met.</p>\n<p>As the now-ubiquitous saying goes Hungary fooled around and found out. Four years into defending Ukraine, Zelensky does not have the patience to deal with a whiny Orban. Russian oil will not be flowing anytime soon to Hungary, nor to Slovakia where Robert Fico, the country’s prime minister, was making similar threats.</p>\n<p>As a result, Orban is in even more electoral trouble. His party <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-25/orban-s-poll-support-crumbles-as-hungary-opposition-widens-lead?embedded-checkout=true\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">poll numbers are plunging</a>. Tisza, a Hungarian political party started by Peter Magyar, is leading Orban’s governing Fidesz party 55 percent to 35 percent among decided voters, according to a new poll released yesterday. </p>\n<p>Desperate for a way out, Orban is now attempting to campaign against Zelensky instead of Magyar. He is accusing Ukraine of imposing an oil blockade on Hungary and Slovakia, as if it were happening in a vacuum. It isn’t.</p>\n<p>The Druzhba pipeline runs through Ukraine. When it was flowing, those oil sales to Budapest and Bratislava were funding Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war machine that was attacking Ukraine daily.</p>\n<p>“We will not give in to blackmail!” <a href=\"https://x.com/PM_ViktorOrban/status/2026662954679074851?s=20\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">screeched Orban yesterday on X</a>. That is ironic, since Hungary has been blackmailing Ukraine, NATO and the European Union ever since Putin launched his invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.</p>\n<p>Orbán –– laughably –– is also trying to convince Hungarian voters that Ukraine is preparing kinetic strikes against “Hungary’s energy system.” He has ordered Hungarian troops deployed to “repel potential attacks” against energy infrastructure. Hungarian voters should be wary of a possible false-flag attack.</p>\n<p>But Ukraine is not at war with Hungary, even if the latter has been in a soft war against Ukraine benefiting Putin — if not at his behest. Soon after Putin’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-foreign-minister-peter-szijjarto-weapon-transit-ukraine/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Szijjarto announced that Hungary</a> would not allow NATO to transit weapons and munitions via its territory to Ukraine. His excuse at the time was that Russia might target those deliveries inside of Hungary. </p>\n<p>That was nonsense, of course. Hungary is a NATO member-state and fully militarily protected by Article Five, the alliance’s collective defense guarantee.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/hungary-has-approved-finland-joining-nato-but-its-delays-raise-deeper-concerns/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Orban began to play games</a> over Finland and Sweden’s bids to join NATO in March 2022. He succeeded in delaying the process for nearly two years by effectively blackmailing the EU for economic concessions. </p>\n<p>Initially, in early 2023, we wrote it off as <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3868742-is-winning-not-an-option-in-ukraine/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Orban being opportunistic</a> — just as Turkish President Recep Erdoğan was. Now, however, in retrospect, it feels far more nefarious.</p>\n<p>Orban’s words and actions — like Fico’s — are, wittingly or not, aiding and abetting Russia’s kinetic war against Ukraine and the <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-shadow-war-against-west\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kremlin’s ongoing hybrid war</a> against NATO.</p>\n<p>To that end, consider the totality of Orban’s actions. In December 2022, he <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/business/2022/12/06/eu-ministers-delay-key-votes-on-tax-deal-and-ukraine-aid-over-hungary-impasse\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blocked an €18 billion EU aid package</a> for Ukraine. In May 2023, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hungary-blocks-military-aid-ukraine-0f9108a3ca67440342feac3c03170507\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hungary stopped</a> the disbursement of €500 million from the EU’s European Peace Facility.</p>\n<p>In December 2023, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67724357\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Orbán vetoed a €50 billion</a> aid package for Kyiv. In March 2025, he <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/hungary-pm-orban-financing-ukraine-would-ruin-europe-2025-03-07/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">refused to sign an EU statement</a> “voicing support for Ukraine.”</p>\n<p>Essentially, Orban has been Moscow’s man in Brussels. He hides behind economic excuses, claiming Europe cannot afford this war, as he champions Putin’s interests in the West.</p>\n<p>Nor has Orban been alone. Since his electoral victory in October 2023, Fico has acted as Orban’s “<a data-id=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-Me\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-Me\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">mini-me</a>.” Later that same month, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-05/slovakia-freezes-state-military-aid-to-kyiv-after-election-upset\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fico stopped all military aid</a> to Ukraine. In October 2024, <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-ukraine-slovakia-robert-fico-military-defense-alliance/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Slovakia blocked Kyiv’s NATO</a> membership bid. </p>\n<p>One year later, Fico announced that Bratislava would not participate in any <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/slovakia-will-not-be-part-eu-scheme-ukraines-military-needs-pm-fico-says-2025-10-26/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">EU financing of the war in Ukraine</a>. Then, earlier this week –– a day before the fourth anniversary of Putin’s invasion –– Fico announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/23/eu-leaders-accuse-hungary-sabotaging-support-ukraine\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Slovakia was cutting emergency assistance</a> to Ukraine, including backstopping electricity.</p>\n<p>So let’s call them what they are: Putin’s pawns. Both central European leaders would gladly continue to crassly trade cheap Russian oil for Ukrainian lives. </p>\n<p>The historical irony is that both Hungary and Slovakia — when it was part of Czechoslovakia — learned what it is like to be invaded by Russia. In the last hundred years, it has happened to Hungary twice –– in 1944 and 1956 –– and once to Czechoslovakia in 1968, to crush what was known as the “<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Prague-Spring\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Prague Spring</a>.”</p>\n<p>It is time NATO and the EU to suspended Hungary’s and Slovakia’s memberships. Both countries are endangering the very alliances they are obligated to protect and are openly doing so to the benefit of Putin for cheap energy, if not more.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://x.com/MCTothSTL\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Toth</a> writes on national security and foreign policy.</em> <em><a href=\"https://x.com/JESweet2022\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Col.

            "description": "<p>Instagram is launching a new tool that will alert parents if their teens repeatedly try to search for terms associated with suicide and self-harm on the platform.</p>\n<p>The tool, which will roll out in the U.S. and several other countries next week, will flag for parents if their children conduct multiple searches with phrases promoting suicide or self-harm or phrases that suggest they want to harm themselves, as well as terms like “suicide” and “self-harm.”</p>\n<p>Parents will receive the alerts via email, text or WhatsApp and through an in-app notification, in addition to being presented with the option to view resources about how to approach the topic with their teens, Instagram said in a blog post Thursday.</p>\n<p>“Our goal is to empower parents to step in if their teen’s searches suggest they may need support,” the company wrote. “We also want to avoid sending these notifications unnecessarily, which, if done too much, could make the notifications less useful overall.”</p>\n<p>Instagram underscored that the platform currently blocks searches clearly associated with suicide and self-harm, in addition to barring posts that promote or glorify suicide or self-harm and limiting the content that teens can see on these issues.</p>\n<p>The social media company also said it is building a similar parental alert system for some of its AI experiences, which would notify parents if their teens attempted to engage in conversations about suicide or self-harm with its AI.</p>\n<p>The latest teen safety tools come as tech firms face increased scrutiny over how they protect young users on their platforms.</p>\n<p>Instagram is currently on trial alongside Google’s YouTube in Los Angeles over allegations that they purposefully designed their products to addict children. Snap and TikTok, both initially part of the case, settled shortly before the trial got underway.</p>\n<p>The trial in Los Angeles is the first of several set to proceed this year as part of a pair of cases at the state and federal level that consolidated thousands of lawsuits brought by individuals, school districts and states against the social media companies.</p>\n<p>Amid the rise of AI, tech firms are also feeling the heat over whether they have sufficient protections in place for children using their AI chatbots. Several families have sued AI companies over the past year, alleging the products drove their children to self-harm or suicide.</p>",
