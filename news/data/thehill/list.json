Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic, announced that the COVID-19 vaccine would <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5319852-cdc-halts-routine-covid-shots-for-children/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">no longer</a> be recommended for healthy pregnant women. </p>\n<p>Kennedy has a history of comments linking autism and vaccines, despite strong evidence showing there is no association.   </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>The coronavirus has killed more than 1 million people in the past five years, and annual shots have served as a dose of protection. Yet fewer people have been getting them, and top administration officials have argued there’s no benefit and even potential harm to individuals.  </p>\n<p>Federal vaccine advisors now say all Americans regardless of risk factors should consult a medical provider about getting a coronavirus vaccine. </p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Kennedy and the Department of Health and Human Services <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5257511-rfk-jr-calls-autism-an-epidemic-it-dwarfs-covid/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">launched an effort</a> to determine “what has caused the autism epidemic.”  </p>\n\n<p>In September, President Trump held a press conference in the White House flanked by Kennedy and other federal health leaders and said that use of Tylenol during pregnancy is linked to a “very increased risk” of autism. They warned mothers not to take Tylenol and said the Food and Drug Administration would put a warning label on the drug. </p>\n<p>“Parental awareness of the potential for adverse child neurodevelopmental outcomes after COVID-19 in pregnancy is key. By understanding the risks, parents can appropriately advocate for their children to have proper evaluation and support,” Lydia Shook, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital and lead author of the study, said in a statement.  </p>\n</div>",

Josh Hawley’s (R-Mo.) <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/844/text\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Faster Labor Contracts Act</a>. In the same hearing, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?si=Jqm6Hr3u6i_3uOPk&amp;v=o_lRpFmmVsM&amp;feature=youtu.be\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said that he’s a “strong supporter”</a> of Hawley’s bill because it’s aligned with Democrats’ PRO Act — a wish-list of union leaders’ priorities.</p>\n\n<p>Cassidy <a href=\"https://www.help.senate.gov/hearings/labor-law-reform-part-2-new-solutions-for-finding-a-pro-worker-way-forward\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">explained this policy</a> in real-world terms, saying that it would “take workers out of the process by removing the need to ratify a contract.” He put a finer point on it by saying that if the government mandated arbitration, workers “cannot reject” the resulting agreement, even though it would be binding on them. “What would happen,” he asked, “if workers lost that ability to ratify a contract?”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The union official didn’t mince words: “that would be removing the democracy from the workplace.” Then he doubled down: Such democracy “is the whole point of the union,” he said, because it gives workers “a say.” In a few short words, that union official, a Democratic witness, rejected one of the Democrats’ and labor’s biggest policy priorities.</p>\n<p>I was testifying in the same hearing, and I struggled to contain my surprise. True, Cassidy had not mentioned the Faster Labor Contracts Act by name. Nor did he call out the PRO Act. But he didn’t have to. By focusing on the actual policy instead of the bill name, he highlighted how unjust both Hawley’s proposal and that of the Democrats really is. Each hurts workers in the name of helping them. When you strip away the window dressing, even a shop steward won’t accept it. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>And this was a shop steward from Hawley’s home state of Missouri, brought in by Democrats to support their agenda, including Hawley’s bill. If he can’t support that anti-democratic reform, who can?</p>\n<p>The timing couldn’t have been more awkward. Just a few weeks earlier, the Senate had held another hearing that <a href=\"https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/40740aa3-053a-9b1c-c218-ae057606d3e8/OBrien%20Testimony.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">prominently featured a union president</a> endorsing Hawley’s bill. Yet awkward or not, the shop steward is right on the money. There’s nothing fair or democratic about taking away workers’ right to vote on contracts that dictate their jobs. There is nothing fair or democratic in letting government impose its will regardless of workers’ wishes.</p>\n<p>And a union shop steward isn’t the only one who knows it — Americans do, too. <a href=\"https://www.uschamber.com/employment-law/what-american-voters-really-think-about-unions\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">New polling</a> from the Chamber of Commerce shows that 90 percent of voters oppose government-mandated union contracts that workers don’t approve. It makes sense: It’s hard to support the gutting of workplace democracy.</p>\n\n<p>That’s not to say that workers don’t need stronger protection of their rights. They most certainly do. But a real reform wouldn’t put government in control at the back end of a union election. The better path is to put workers in control at the front end.</p>\n<p>Workers really need the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4154/text\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Employee Rights Act</a>, which protects them in numerous ways. To start, it guarantees that unionization elections use the secret ballot, preventing the public “card check” voting system that encourages intimidation and harassment. It also lets workers decide what contact information union organizers receive, protecting their privacy and that of their families. </p>\n<p>These are just a few of the pro-worker reforms in the Employee Rights Act, which Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) introduced in the Senate in mid-October. This bill will ensure that workers’ voices are truly heard.</p>\n<p>The Faster Labor Contracts Act and the PRO Act would do the opposite, stifling workers’ voices at the hands of the federal government. This isn’t the pro-worker reform it’s chalked up to be. But don’t take it from me. Take it from the union official who admitted the truth — this union demand is anti-worker and undemocratic.</p>\n<p><em>F.
