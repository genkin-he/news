They’re going to see who’s responsible, and there’ll be a price to pay for that politically.”</p>\n<p>The government shutdown continues to stretch on as Republicans attempt to pass a “clean” continuing resolution (CR), a bill that would temporarily fund the government while both parties negotiate over a larger full-year funding bill. </p>\n\n<p>But the CR’s passage has hit a wall over its lack of funding for expiring Affordable Care Act (ACA) enhanced <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5555854-aca-health-insurance-tax-credit-fight-congress/\">premium tax credits</a>. Democrats <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5549619-democrats-demand-aca-subsidies/\">have refused</a> to pass it without the funding for ObamaCare subsidiaries, saying their expiration could potentially impact millions of Americans’ access to health care.</p>\n<p>Several programs are in danger of temporarily shutting down their services due to the lapse in government funding. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will lapse this weekend, impacting <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5579437-map-see-the-number-of-snap-participants-by-county-as-benefit-lapse-looms/\">an estimated 42 million</a> Americans across the U.S. The program’s looming funding shortfall has agitated both Democrats and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5582366-snap-benefits-lapse-senate/\">Republicans</a>, many of whom have constituents enrolled in it. </p>\n<p>Johnson has canceled five weeks of previously scheduled votes to ramp up pressure on Democrats to pass the continuing resolution. House Democrats have criticized the vote cancellations, as have <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5582283-republicans-house-shutdown-recess-johnson/\">several GOP representatives</a>. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) has publicly criticized Johnson for his recess strategy and confronted him during a House GOP call on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>“We are anxious to get the House back to regular legislative session, but we have to get the lights turned back on,” Johnson said on “Fox &amp; Friends.” “Chuck Schumer and the Democrats in the Senate have got to reopen the government again.” </p>\n<p>“It’s the most fundamental responsibility of Congress is to have the government operate and work for the people, and that’s the number one priority right now, and we cannot deviate from that,” he said.</p>\n</div>",

When asked about the project, President Trump quipped that <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-admits-hes-building-arc-de-trump-for-me.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">it is for him</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Whatever is intended by the memorial and the symbolism of its location, it will be the American people who ultimately decide what this monument means.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/white-house-fires-all-commission-of-fine-arts-members-362ea9e1?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfz1JS3agyYiG8BQKhKdTSaN9UIbjepXhdpVoAmUDGGDyhF8er4CxYUBoZTYiY%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6903820e&amp;gaa_sig=EAPG3qA6CZzGUdf6HeCkstjhfhEs3Ps-2WFQOWDZUusDxfqPVaK9G5aZPqapMlyMbUVjPt97KjOabbfR-RDSaA%3D%3D\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claims</a> that “every time somebody rides over that beautiful bridge to the Lincoln Memorial, they literally say, something is supposed to be here,” the proposed site — Memorial Circle, at the Virginia end of the Arlington Memorial Bridge — is not a blank canvas. </p>\n<p>For a century, Lincoln’s temple to freedom and Lee’s former plantation — Arlington House, once home to the Confederate general Robert E. Lee — have faced each other across the river in a dialogue about emancipation, slavery and reunion. The bridge that joins them was meant to symbolically and literally join the North and South.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The National Park Service <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gwmp/learn/management/history.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">explains</a> that the bridge “also serves as the ceremonial entrance to Arlington National Cemetery, our nation’s most hallowed ground and the final resting place for more than 400,000 active-duty service members, veterans and their family members.” When unveiling the design to an audience of fundraisers, the president <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-ballroom-dinner-robert-e-lee-statue-b2846627.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">remarked</a> that he would have been fine with a statue to Lee in the same location.</p>\n<p>A massive triumphal arch in this location would intrude upon and dramatically reinterpret this symbolism of reunification. Americans might therefore question the intention behind it, and whether it carries a political or ideological signal through its choice of location. This is especially understandable because of recent efforts by the current administration to revisit Civil War memory by questioning <a href=\"https://www.military.com/history/trump-renaming-7-army-installations-here-are-stories-behind-names-being-scrubbed.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the renaming of military bases</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/us/politics/confederate-statue-trump.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">restoring certain Confederate monuments</a>.</p>\n<p>The current site is also a confusing selection because a more suitable one immediately comes to mind, along the same axis but east of the Capitol instead of west. The former RFK Stadium redevelopment comprises nearly 200 acres slated for mixed use with parks, housing, and a proposed stadium for the Washington Commanders. It would provide expansive space for a monumental arch and pedestrian-friendly park, along with unobstructed vistas toward the U.S. Capitol rotunda — a fitting gateway to the city, in the classical tradition of arches marking civic entrances.</p>\n\n<p>To many, the proposed arch is akin to the White House ballroom, It evinces a desire to monumentalize the self, to transform shared civic spaces into reflections of personal power and to do so without permission from the American people. A triumphal arch — especially one front-loaded by a president, unveiled at a donor gala and paired with the 90,000-square-foot White House ballroom — sounds less like national commemoration and more like personal aggrandizement.</p>\n<p>But previous national birthdays have been punctuated by great monuments and movements. At 100 years, <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/06/17/day-history-statue-liberty-came-america#:~:text=The%20Statue%20of%20Liberty%2C%20a%20gift%20from,the%20French%20to%20support%20the%20same%20ideals.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">France gifted us the Statue of Liberty</a>, a beacon linking freedom, immigration and democracy. At 200 years, the <a href=\"https://blog.nixonfoundation.org/2010/06/legacy-of-parks/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Legacy of Parks</a> program invested in hundreds of community spaces across the country, expanding public land and recreation for millions. Both commemorations reflected humility and inclusion. </p>\n<p>Democracies build monuments and memorials through consent, deliberation and the slow work of compromise. Since 1986, the <a href=\"https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title40/subtitle2/partD/chapter89&amp;edition=prelim\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Commemorative Works Act</a> has required that new national memorials undergo public hearings, congressional authorization and scrutiny by independent design commissions.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Dozens of steps in the process are not bureaucratic hurdles. They are democratic safeguards ensuring that national symbols remain national.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.usace.army.mil/About/History/Historical-Vignettes/Parks-and-Monuments/152-Lincoln-Memorial/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Lincoln Memorial took decades</a> of debate and legislation. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mlkm/learn/building-the-memorial.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The King Memorial</a> emerged after years of organizing and bipartisan cooperation. Those deliberate rhythms are proof that our monuments belong to the people.</p>\n<p>Regardless of where this monument might eventually stand on our national landscape, and regardless of whether it is imposed on the vista or endorsed by its people, the narrative arc for this moment in our national history, the moment it is intended to represent, is still being written. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n\n<p>Martin Luther King Jr. famously reminded us that the arc of the moral universe bends toward justice.

State law requires funeral operators to preserve the “dignity” of any remains in their care. BLM policy allows for a person to scatter cremated remains; however, the policy limits “commercial distribution of cremated remains.” A mass dumping site, like this one, <a href=\"https://www.8newsnow.com/investigators/who-left-100-piles-of-cremated-human-remains-in-the-desert-outside-las-vegas/\">likely violates federal law</a>.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know if it was the wishes of these people to be out, so that’s kind of what goes through my mind,” DiLullo said. “If this is not how they would want to be remembered, we would just want to have a place for them to be.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2324211\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.8newsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/2025/08/DJI_0780.MP4_snapshot_00.05.195.jpg?w=900\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Federal officials are investigating the discovery of more than 300 piles of cremated human remains left near a dirt road about an hour outside of Las Vegas.

Each pile no longer contained any identifiable information as of Wednesday. In August, some piles contained pieces of zip ties, which crematories use to close bags of ashes. Pieces of a broken urn also littered part of the site.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>“I think it’s important to us to make sure that these people are not forgotten and not left,” DiLullo said. “It’s important to our community and our profession that we demonstrate how much we do care about these people.”</p>\n<p>The remains are not connected to <a href=\"https://www.8newsnow.com/investigators/smell-haunts-neighbor-of-shuttered-las-vegas-funeral-home-100-improperly-stored-bodies-removed/\">McDermott’s Funeral Home</a>, which the Nevada Funeral and Cemetery Services Board <a href=\"https://www.8newsnow.com/investigators/smell-haunts-neighbor-of-shuttered-las-vegas-funeral-home-100-improperly-stored-bodies-removed/\">closed in August</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2382522\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.8newsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/2025/10/CREMATED_REMAINS_CLEANUP_PKG.mxf_snapshot_01.31.989.jpg?w=900\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Representatives from Palm Mortuaries and Cemeteries removed approximately 315 piles from the desert.
