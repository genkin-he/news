As he attempted this unpredictable move, three people in a minivan were killed crashing into his truck.  </p>\n<p>If he had read and obeyed the “Official Use Only” sign, this tragic accident would not have occurred. Apparently, the problem was that he couldn’t read English. When officers with the <a href=\"https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration</a> gave him an <a href=\"https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/newsroom/updated-internal-agency-enforcement-policy-english-language-proficiency\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">English Language Proficiency test</a> after the accident, he was only able to give a correct response to <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/illegal-immigrant-trucker-accused-killing-three-people-failed-english-road-sign-tests-dot\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">two of 12</a> verbal questions, and he could only identify one out of four highway traffic signs.  </p>\n\n<p>This driver should not have been driving a commercial vehicle at all. <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-49/subtitle-B/chapter-III/subchapter-B/part-391/subpart-B/section-391.11\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Federal regulations</a> governing qualifications for driving a commercial vehicle provide that drivers must be able to “read and speak the English language sufficiently to converse with the general public, to understand highway traffic signs and signals in the English language, to respond to official inquiries, and to make entries on reports and record.”  </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>This is particularly important for semi-truck drivers. A fully loaded semi can <a href=\"https://driverresourcecenter.com/why-are-semi-trucks-called-semi-trucks/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">weigh</a> as much as 80,000 pounds; most of them are between 70 and 80 feet long. Collisions between such large vehicles and cars are likely to be deadly. More than 4,000 people died in large truck crashes in 2023, and <a href=\"https://www.iihs.org/research-areas/fatality-statistics/detail/large-trucks\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">65 percent</a> of them were in cars and other passenger vehicles. </p>\n<p>As Rep. Pat Harrigan (R-N.C.) <a href=\"https://harrigan.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-pat-harrigan-introduces-safe-drivers-act\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">has said</a>, “If you can’t read ‘Bridge Out Ahead’ or communicate with a state trooper at a crash scene, you have no business driving an 80,000-pound truck on American highways.” Harrigan has introduced a <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr5800#:~:text=To%20require%20all%20applicants%20for%20a%20commercial%20driver%27s,in%20the%20first%20stage%20of%20the%20legislative%20process.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SAFE Drivers Act</a> last month, which would require all applicants for commercial driver’s licenses to show English proficiency. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Even so, the English proficiency regulations have to be enforced to be effective, and some administrations have not enforced them.  </p>\n<p>The Obama administration issued a <a href=\"https://www.gallaghersharp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SafetyNotice_English-Proficiency.pdf?x23768#:~:text=PURPOSE:,BACKGROUND:\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">memorandum</a> in June 2016, that removed the requirement to put non-English proficient drivers out of service. Moreover, it also provided that “If the driver cannot read, write, or speak English but can communicate sufficiently with the inspector / investigator, he / she should not be cited for a violation.”</p>\n<p>President Trump wants stricter enforcement of the English proficiency requirements for commercial truck drivers. In April 2025, he issued an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/enforcing-commonsense-rules-of-the-road-for-americas-truck-drivers/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">executive order</a> titled “Rules of the Road for America’s Truck Drivers,” in which he declared that commercial truck drivers must comply with federal law on English proficiency. It is the policy of his administration to support truck drivers and safeguard our highways by enforcing these commonsense requirements. </p>\n\n<p>But enforcement of commercial vehicle regulations won’t eliminate the risks posed by non-commercial drivers who cannot read or understand English. Apparently, the states aren’t concerned about non-commercial drivers who can’t read English. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYF18NrrBfA\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Only three</a> of the 50 states require all driver’s license applicants to take the written part of the exam in English: South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming. </p>\n<p>Every driver — commercial or not — should be able to read English traffic signs, detour notices and highway warnings, and be able to respond to law enforcement or first-responder instructions. Though accidents with an 80,000-pound truck are likely to be more serious than accidents with a <a href=\"https://www.autopadre.com/vehicle-weight/honda-accord\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">3,000-pound</a> Honda sedan, people die in collisions with Honda sedans and other passenger vehicles, too. </p>\n<p>A national road environment requires a common language, and English is America’s <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/designating-english-as-the-official-language-of-the-united-states/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">national language</a>. Using a single language simplifies signage, emergency instructions and law-enforcement communication. After a collision, drivers must know English well enough to exchange information, report locations to 911 operators, and understand instructions given by first-responders. They also should be able to understand instructions given in English when a disaster occurs.  </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>It isn’t necessary to establish a categorical “English-only” requirement<strong> </strong>that might raise<strong> </strong>discrimination issues under <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/civil-rights/civil-rights-library/civil-rights-act-1964#6\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Title VI of the Civil Rights Act</a>.

The <a href=\"https://www.convenience.org/Media/Daily/2025/September/25/1-Retailers-Start-to-See-Penny-Shortages_GR\">National Association of Convenience Stores</a> warned last month that supply shortages were starting to emerge amongst its members, with more expected to be impacted. </p>\n<p>So far, at least two gas and convenience store chains, Love’s and Kwik Trip, have said they will round change on cash transactions <a href=\"https://fox8.com/news/how-the-growing-penny-shortage-may-impact-you/#:~:text=Love%E2%80%99s%20and%20Kwik%20Trip\">in favor of the customer</a>. Rounding may, however, <a href=\"https://fox8.com/news/how-the-growing-penny-shortage-may-impact-you/\">face legal challenges</a>, experts warn. </p>\n<p>Another chain, Sheetz, <a href=\"https://fox8.com/news/how-the-growing-penny-shortage-may-impact-you/#:~:text=convenience%20store%20chain%2C-,Sheetz,-%2C%20confirmed%20to%20Nexstar\">confirmed</a> it is encouraging customers to pay with a cashless option. Customers can also exchange pennies for a free self-serve drink or as a donation to Sheetz For the Kidz. A spokesperson noted that donated coins “will then be recirculated for other customers.”</p>\n<p>At PetSmart, customers can <a href=\"https://fox8.com/news/how-the-growing-penny-shortage-may-impact-you/\">round their cash transactions up</a> to the nearest dollar, with the extra change going toward PetSmart Charities. </p>\n<p>Pennies remain legal tender and will likely gain <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/nexstar_media_wire/5324955-penny-production-to-end-should-you-start-stocking-up/\">little to no value</a> as collectors’ items — though some may argue the Giant Eagle exchange is the most fiscally beneficial to penny holders.</p>\n</div>",

But this time, it could be the blood of our sons and daughters giving their last full measure of devotion in a conflict far from home.</p>\n\n<p>It is a reality and a risk to help end this latest chapter of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has caused so much suffering on both sides. There may be no alternative to putting our military in harm’s way today, but there could be and must be one in the future, and we need to embrace and pursue it as soon as possible.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>So, what if we could protect both civilians and our military by sending something else in their place — humanoid drones?</p>\n<p>We know how that sounds, but let us explain. These humanoids would be powered by interoperable, agentic artificial intelligence. Maybe it’s the stuff of science fiction, but it’s no longer the purview of just screenwriters.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>We now have the technology to deploy such robots in war zones to protect populations, establish communications and stabilize what’s happening on the ground. These systems could serve as guardians defending humanitarian corridors and deterring violence without firing a shot.</p>\n<p>We are entering a new era in which artificial intelligence becomes a civic institution rather than merely a commercial or military tool. The question is whether we lead the world in building ethical, interoperable systems that protect people, or leave the future to regimes with nefarious intentions.</p>\n<p>Let’s be clear: Our adversaries are already using this technology — not to save lives but to take them. Russia <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/10/1166189\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">uses drone swarms</a> to attack Ukraine’s infrastructure. China <a href=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/china/2025/02/20/china-ai-neuro-quantum-surveillance-security-threat/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">integrates AI into its naval and surveillance systems</a> and shares it with governments, using it for population control.  </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, we and our allies hesitate. Our doctrines remain anchored to an era when deterrence meant soldiers and sanctions. </p>\n<p>The new challenge isn’t our ability to get our military to the next hot spot. It’s machine coordination. The balance of power around the world is about to be determined by our approach to AI governance.</p>\n<p>From Ukraine to Gaza, the international community faces the same challenge: civilians stranded between opposing forces, and humanitarian agencies unable to provide aid. Yet, technology already exists to change that. Autonomous systems could patrol ceasefire zones, protect evacuation routes, deliver aid and detect incoming threats, creating buffer zones where humans can safely operate.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>This isn’t fantasy. It’s a moral and strategic imperative. Western democracies must find ways to deter aggression without risking American lives.  </p>\n<p>The foundation for this future is what we call Omni Cities — democratic, interoperable infrastructures where civic AI integrates across transportation, energy, health and defense systems. It’s not about surveillance, but about saving lives and protecting the peacemaker. It doesn’t control; it coordinates. It is is the civic answer to authoritarian implementations of AI.   </p>\n<p>The U.S. needs to lead this effort and set standards for interoperability, data ethics, and autonomous deterrence. Under United Nations oversight, AI-enabled drones and humanoid guardians could be deployed to regions such as Gaza to secure humanitarian corridors and enforce ceasefires. </p>\n\n<p>They would act not as instruments of war, but as intermediaries for peace — enforcing accountability through presence, not violence.</p>\n<p>Such a framework would extend beyond conflict zones. Domestic applications could include rapid disaster response to floods, wildfires or hurricanes, where AI could coordinate public infrastructure and autonomous assets to save lives. </p>\n<p>If the nuclear age was about avoiding mutual assured destruction, the civic AI era must be about preserving life. </p>\n\n<p>Public perception is understandably based on what we’ve seen in movies like “The Terminator.” Skeptics warn machines lack human morality and autonomy risks AI becoming more powerful than our ability to control it. Those concerns are legitimate, but inaction carries its own risk. </p>\n<p>Failing to define the ethics of AI deployment leaves it to authoritarian regimes that already use this technology to repress. The challenge isn’t whether to use AI but ensuring that it serves us. </p>\n<p>The new “Space Race” isn’t a contest between capitalism and communism, but rather between authoritarian AI and civic AI. The nations leading in building interoperable, ethical systems will shape the moral frontier of technology.</p>\n\n<p>So far, President Trump has rejected calls to cooperate in that venture with international partners. But the time has come for the U.S. and its allies to build Omni Cities and deploy these guardians of peace, not to replace humans, but to protect them. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>The civic AI Era is emerging.

Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, blasted the Trump administration following reports that his Republican counterparts were briefed on the <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5574179-congress-concerns-trump-military/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5574179-congress-concerns-trump-military/\">unilateral strikes</a> against <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5535523-trump-armed-conflict-drug-cartels-caribbean/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5535523-trump-armed-conflict-drug-cartels-caribbean/\">alleged drug boats</a> in the Caribbean.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?id=B11DC2AE-BB78-47F8-A1D1-6E5A4746B2A0\">forceful statement</a>, Warner condemned the <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/10/30/democrats-trump-boat-attacks-pacific-caribbean\">reported partisan briefing</a> as “indefensible,” expressing concern about the “troubling precedent” that such a move sets.</p>\n\n<p>“Shutting Democrats out of a briefing on U.S. military strikes and withholding the legal justification for those strikes from half the Senate is indefensible and dangerous,” Warner wrote in his statement.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“Decisions about the use of American military force are not campaign strategy sessions, and they are not the private property of one political party,” he continued. “For any administration to treat them that way erodes our national security and flies in the face of Congress’ constitutional obligation to oversee matters of war and peace.”</p>\n<p>The Virginia Democrat added, “This partisan stunt is a slap in the face to Congress’ war powers responsibilities and to the men and women who serve this country. It also sets a reckless and deeply troubling precedent.”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The reported briefing comes amid <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5573828-kelly-trump-caribbean-boat-strikes-evidence/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5573828-kelly-trump-caribbean-boat-strikes-evidence/\">bipartisan</a> <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5573870-rand-paul-caribbean-boat-strikes/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5573870-rand-paul-caribbean-boat-strikes/\">concerns</a> about the lack of transparency around the president’s <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5572478-trumps-venezuela-policy-criticized/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5572478-trumps-venezuela-policy-criticized/\">unilateral approach</a> to <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5571008-trump-congress-drug-strikes/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5571008-trump-congress-drug-strikes/\">conducting military strikes</a> against alleged <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5576347-us-military-strikes-pacific/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5576347-us-military-strikes-pacific/\">drug cartel boats</a> in the Caribbean.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has confirmed <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5571471-trump-authorizes-cia-venezuela/\">nearly a dozen attacks</a> on vessels in <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/us-attacks-caribbean-timeline/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/us-attacks-caribbean-timeline/\">recent months</a> that officials say are trafficking narcotics with the hope of reaching the U.S. Some senators have called the moves unconstitutional without <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5568471-congress-authorization-drug-smuggling/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5568471-congress-authorization-drug-smuggling/\">congressional authorization</a>, but others have merely pressed for more information about the strikes.</p>\n<p>CNN <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/06/politics/classified-justice-department-memo-cartel-strikes\">reported</a> earlier this month that the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) produced a legal opinion justifying <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5580409-hegseth-new-strike-alleged-narco-trafficking-boat-killing-4/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5580409-hegseth-new-strike-alleged-narco-trafficking-boat-killing-4/\">the strikes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Warner, in his statement, demanded that Democrats be given access to that opinion.</p>\n<p>“The administration must immediately provide to Democrats the same briefing and the OLC opinion justifying these strikes, as [Secretary of State Marco] Rubio personally promised me that he would in a face-to-face meeting on Capitol Hill just last week,” Warner wrote.</p>\n<p>“Americans deserve a government that fulfills its constitutional duties and treats decisions about the use of military force with the seriousness they demand,” he added.</p>\n<p>The White House, Pentagon and State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n</div>",
