Accordingly, by its failure to allow the government of Venezuela to pay Mr. Maduro’s defense costs, OFAC is interfering with Mr. Maduro’s ability to retain counsel and, therefore, his right under the Sixth Amendment to counsel of his choice,” Pollack wrote.</p>\n<p>“If OFAC fails to act on the request to reinstate the original license, or denies that request, Mr. Maduro will file a formal motion in the coming days seeking relief from the Court.”</p>\n<p>The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to request for comment and the Trump administration has not yet responded to the letter in court.</p>\n<p>Maduro was <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5670837-trump-operation-captures-maduro/\">indicted</a> on Jan.3 shortly after his capture on narco-terrorism charges.</p>\n<p>However, while the indictment accuses Maduro of involvement with six different terrorism and drug trafficking groups, in some cases it offers few details about those connections or makes only passing references to the organizations.</p>",

            "description": "<p>The federal government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/26/trump-administration-childcare-funding-freeze\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recently froze</a> Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funding in five states, including New York, Illinois and Minnesota, citing the need to crack down on fraud. </p>\n<p>Headlines have been <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpWHWDV5ZrU\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dominated by scandal</a>: phantom day cares, faked receipts, and misuse of taxpayer dollars. But these scandals are not an aberration. They are the predictable result of a system that measures compliance instead of outcomes. And while Washington focuses on the fraud we can see, it is ignoring the failure we cannot see.</p>\n<p>The real scandal of the American welfare system isn’t just that money is being stolen — it is that the money we do spend isn’t helping people escape poverty. Rather, it is trapping them in poverty.</p>\n<p>This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families welfare program, signed into <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/104th-congress/house-bill/3734\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">law by President Clinton in 1996</a> with the promise to <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/income-security/temporary-assistance-for-needy-families\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“end welfare as we know it.”</a> Three decades later, must admit that we replaced one trap with another. We exchanged a system of dependency for a system of compliance — paying states to keep caseloads low while failing to ask whether families are actually better off. </p>\n<p>Consider “Tanya,” a composite of the millions navigating this system. A full-time warehouse worker in Ohio, Tanya turns to the program for a bridge when her hours are cut. Instead, she finds a maze designed to police her poverty. Her experience is not unusual; it is a documented feature of how Temporary Assistance for Needy Families operates nationwide. </p>\n<p>The current congressional debate, centered on the “<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/2354/text\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Restoring ‘Temporary’ to TANF Act,</a>” misses the forest for the trees. We are obsessed with auditing receipts to exclude the wrong people trying to access the money, but we never ask whether the right people are moving forward. </p>\n<p>In Tanya’s case, the system works exactly as designed — and that is the problem. When she receives a modest raise, she hits a “<a href=\"https://www.unitedwaycleveland.org/benefits-cliff-challenges-and-solutions/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">benefits cliff</a>.” Her child-care support is cut so sharply that her net income actually drops. Faced with an impossible choice, she has to decide whether to refuse the promotion or fall further behind. </p>\n<p>In short, we are punishing success because our accountability metrics are broken. </p>\n<p>Since 1996, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families has rewarded states for <a href=\"https://www.chapinhall.org/research/overall-tanf-caseload-declined-between-2010-and-2022/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shrinking caseloads</a>, not for reducing poverty. In practice, states are rewarded for exits, regardless of the reason. If a family leaves because they found a high-paying job, that is a success. But if a family is kicked off for missing a filing deadline and sinks into homelessness, that is also counted as a “success” under the current statute. The system is indifferent to whether a family is rising out of poverty or simply falling off the radar.</p>\n<p>The 2026 funding freeze, while necessary to stop criminal fraud, is insufficient as a reform. We cannot “restore integrity” to a system that lacks a coherent purpose. Real reform requires shifting from compliance-based to outcome-based accountability — measuring whether families are moving forward, not merely moving off the rolls.</p>\n<p>First, we must abandon work participation rates as a proxy for success and begin measuring economic mobility directly. Bills like the “<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1567/text\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">JOBS for Success Act</a>” have hinted at this idea, but we must go further. States should be rewarded when recipients see wage growth, retain employment for 12 months or gain credentials. We have the data to do this; we simply aren’t using it.</p>\n<p>Second, we must replace the benefit ledge with a ramp. Transitional benefits that phase out gradually as income rises would ensure that work always pays. Critics may argue this is too expensive, but a system that tracks verified employment outcomes is far more secure than one that tracks receipts. It is easy to fake a generic invoice; it is much harder to fake IRS-verified wage growth.</p>\n<p>If we want to stop fraud, we must stop building systems so complex that they invite exploitation. If we want to help families, we must stop forcing mothers like our hypothetical Tanya to choose between stability and upward mobility.</p>\n<p>The January 2026 freeze should mark the end of “cash policing.” Congress must use this moment not merely to restore funding, but to rewrite the rules — replacing a system that manages poverty with one that enables families to escape it.</p>\n<p><em>Parth Patel is a social policy professional with more than five years of experience in human services and a background in public finance.

            "description": "<p>An editor for the popular YouTube creator MrBeast has been fined and suspended by prediction market platform Kalshi over suspected insider trading. </p>\n<p>The company’s disciplinary committee found that Artem Kaptur violated its policies when Kaptur placed bets last August and September related to the YouTube channel where he worked. </p>\n<p>“Specifically, the Committee found reasonable cause to conclude Kaptur traded while employed by or legally affiliated with a Source Agency for “Mr. Beast” contracts, and that he traded on material, non-public information he obtained because of this employment in violation of Kalshi Rule 5.17(y),” the committee wrote in its <a href=\"https://kalshi-public-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/regulatory/notices/Notice%20of%20Disciplinary%20Action%20(2.25.2026)%20(1).pdf\">report</a>. “Further, the Committee found Kaptur failed to cooperate with the investigation, in violation of Kalshi Rule 3.6(a).”</p>\n<p>Kalshi fined Kaptur over $20,000 and issued a two-year suspension from accessing the platform. The fine includes $5,397.58 in profits from the alleged insider trades and $15,000 in penalties. </p>\n<p>The trading platform allows users to bet on a wide range of topics, including the men’s college basketball champion, which Democratic candidate will win the Texas Senate primary race and the highest temperature in New York City on a given day. </p>\n<p>Kalshi’s site hosts several trades related to MrBeast, a YouTube channel started by Jimmy Donaldson, which has the most subscribers among all individual accounts on the platform. Kalshi users can place bets on when Donaldson will get married, the length of his next video and his content’s viewership numbers. </p>\n<p>A spokesperson for Donaldson’s company, Beast Industries, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/02/25/nx-s1-5726050/kalshi-insider-trading-enforcement-actions\">told NPR</a> it has “no tolerance” for insider trading, saying the company has rules against trading on markets related to MrBeast content. </p>\n<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), an independent agency that regulates the U.S. derivatives markets, said in a Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9185-26\">report</a> that Kaptur “potentially violated prohibitions on misappropriation of confidential information in breach of a pre-existing duty of trust and confidence to the source of the information,” also known as insider trading.</p>\n<p>The CFTC noted that it “has full authority to police illegal trading practices,” including insider trading violations. The Commission also noted another enforcement case involving a little-known GOP candidate in the California governor’s race who was fined by Kalshi for trading on his own candidacy. </p>\n<p>“I just bet $100 that I, Kyle Langford will be the next Governor of California, join me,” The Republican candidate <a data-id=\"https://x.com/KyleLangfordCA/status/1926349137760362572\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/KyleLangfordCA/status/1926349137760362572\">said on the social media platform X</a>.</p>\n<p>Langford received a 5-year suspension from Kalshi and was fined over $2,000 by the platform. </p>\n<p>The CFTC has also come <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5741800-cox-challenges-cftc-prediction-markets/\">under fire</a> for its fight against state laws that would place restrictions on prediction markets. </p>\n<p>CTFC Chair Mike Selig said the commission would challenge any state that sought to “challenge our authority in this space,” adding, “We will see you in court.”</p>\n<p>“These prediction markets you are breathlessly defending are gambling—pure and simple. They are destroying the lives of families and countless Americans, especially young men. They have no place in Utah,” Gov.

            "description": "<p>The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has kicked off its deposition of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in its investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. </p>\n<p>The deposition, taking place Thursday in Chappaqua, New York, comes after the former first lady and former President Bill Clinton reversed course earlier this month and agreed to sit for depositions to avoid being held in contempt of Congress for defying a Congressional subpoena. </p>\n<p>The former president, who had a documented friendship with Epstein and flew on his plane a few times in the early 2000s, is scheduled to sit for a deposition on Friday. </p>\n<p>“No one’s accusing, at this moment, the Clintons of any wrongdoing. They’re going to have due process,” House Oversight Committee chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) said in a press conference before the deposition started. </p>\n<p>“But we have a lot of questions,” Comer continued. “And the purpose of the whole investigation is to try to understand many things about Epstein. How did he accumulate so much wealth? How was he able to surround himself with some of the most powerful men in the world? Was he an asset for our government or any other government?”</p>\n<p>The Hill’s partners at NewsNation reported that the Clintons and the committee agreed to focus on five topic areas in the deposition: How the government handled its inquiry into Epstein and Maxwell; the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death; how the government can tackle sex trafficking; how Epstein and Maxwell worked with powerful figures to protect themselves; and possible ethics rules violations by public officials.</p>\n<p>Clinton spokesman Angel Ureña on social media prodded Comer and made a reference to no Republicans attending a deposition with Epstein’s former employer, billionaire Les Wexner, in Ohio last week — which Comer had missed due to oral surgery.</p>\n<p>“We congratulate the Republicans for showing up today and tomorrow for their first deposition in their Epstein investigation. Glad none of them had pre-scheduled oral surgery,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/angelurena/status/2027044530629874058\">posted on X</a>. “We hope they actually ask questions about Epstein. Up until this point, they haven’t asked a single one.”</p>\n<p>Hillary Clinton has said she cannot recall ever speaking to Epstein and met his co-conspirator Ghislane Maxwell a few times.</p>\n<p>Asked about that, Comer said: “There are a lot of questions pertaining to Secretary Clinton, with respect to Epstein and his involvement in the Clinton initiative and her relationship with Ghislane Maxwell.”</p>\n<p>Republican members in attendance at the deposition included Reps. Anna Paulina Luna (Fla.), Nancy Mace (S.C.), Lauren Boebert (Colo.), William Timmons (S.C.), John McGuire (Va.), Michael Cloud (Texas) and Eric Burlison (Mo.).</p>\n<p>On the Democratic side, Ranking Member Robert Garcia (Calif.) is expedited to attend along with some other Democratic members of the panel.</p>\n<p>The Oversight panel had voted on a bipartisan basis to subpoena the Clintons and several other former government officials last year, and spent months negotiating with the Clintons over how they could provide testimony about their links to Epstein.</p>\n<p>As they attempted to avoid depositions, the Clintons previous Clintons argued that they had already provided the committee with all the information they had about Epstein Maxwell, provided sworn statements that they had no knowledge of their criminal activities, and argued that the subpoenas were invalid. </p>\n<p>Later, they <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5718848-clintons-reject-deposition-offer/\">sought</a> to have Hillary Clinton provide a sworn statement instead of testifying, and sought to limit the former president’s deposition to a four-hour interview. </p>\n<p>In January, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5699996-democrats-clintons-contempt-vote/\">three Democrats on the panel voted</a> with Republicans to hold Hillary Clinton in contempt of Congress over the refusal to sit for a deposition.

He has been sharply critical of the event during his years in office, and was famously mocked by former President Obama during his remarks at the dinner in 2011.</p>\n<p>Previous entertainers at the dinner have also included Colin Jost, Trever Noah and Roy Wood Jr. </p>\n<p>Last year, the WHCA, which has clashed with Trump over his White House’s handling of the press pool, announced comedian Amber Ruffin as its emcee before <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/5221808-white-house-correspondents-association-dinner-comedy-performance-cancelled/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/5221808-white-house-correspondents-association-dinner-comedy-performance-cancelled/\">abruptly dropping her</a> a month later.<br/><br/></p>",

These ‘Rebounder’ schools offer critical lessons about the practices and investments that can help students regain lost ground and continue moving forward.” </p>\n<p>The study defined full recovery by a school as having the same or better scores in the fall of 2024 compared to fall of 2019. </p>\n<p>Full recovery is more likely to be seen in schools serving a majority white or Asian population, with majority Black or Hispanic schools following behind. Rural schools also have higher rates of recovery than suburban or urban schools, the research shows.</p>\n<p>NWEA said the findings signal a need for local and state leaders to support schools with specific goals, such as creating benchmarks for recovery and preparing for future crises.  </p>\n<p>The study builds on vast research showing a majority of students are behind in reading and math across the country. </p>",

            "description": "<p>Illinois Gov. <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/jb-pritzker/\">JB Pritzker </a>(D) on Wednesday sought to distance himself from his cousin Tom Pritzker, whose communications with convicted sex offender <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/jeffrey-epstein/\">Jeffrey Epstein</a> were exposed in the Department of Justice’s release of files related to Epstein’s prosecution. </p>\n<p>“I’m not close to my cousin, but I can tell you that it’s very important that people be held to pay the price for whatever it is that they may have done,” Gov. Pritzker said during an interview on MS NOW’s “All In with Chris Hayes.”</p>\n<p>Tom Pritzker<a href=\"https://thehill.com/business/5740879-pritzker-epstein-controversy-resignation-hyatt/\"> resigned </a>from his role as executive chair of the Hyatt Hotels Corporation earlier this month after files showed his email communications with Epstein. Tom Pritzker kept in close contact with Epstein in the years after Epstein’s 2008 plea deal for procuring a minor for prostitution.</p>\n<p>“Good stewardship also means protecting Hyatt, particularly in the context of my association with Jeffrey Epstein and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/ghislaine-maxwell/\">Ghislaine Maxwell </a>which I deeply regret,” Pritzker wrote in a letter to the company’s board, according to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/16/us/politics/tom-pritzker-hyatt-epstein.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times</a>.</p>\n<p>“I exercised terrible judgment in maintaining contact with them, and there is no excuse for failing to distance myself sooner,” he added.</p>\n<p>Pritzker, 75, has served as chair of the family’s company since 2004 and announced that he would not seek reelection for the role in May. </p>\n<p>Gov. Pritzker said there are people in the files who “just sent a few emails or whatever and had nothing to do with any of the wrongdoing, but there’s a whole lot of people that have seemingly done something wrong.”</p>\n<p>He said he would like people who have done something wrong to be identified and wants to “see complete transparency.”</p>\n<p>Gov. Pritzker has referenced his wealth as a Hyatt Hotels heir in major political speeches. </p>\n<p>“Donald Trump thinks we should trust him on the economy because he claims to be very rich,” he said during a Democratic convention speech in August 2024. “Take it from an actual billionaire, Trump is rich in only one thing: stupidity.”</p>",
