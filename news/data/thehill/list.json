But on Wednesday, she told CNN that DHS may suspend the program again to prioritize standard security lanes.  </p>\n<p>Rosen suggested Noem is playing politics by threatening to pause PreCheck again, “despite no demonstrated need to do so.”</p>\n<p>“Given these concerns, I urge DHS to immediately reopen Global Entry and ensure that PreCheck remains available to travelers,” the senator wrote. “I also request a detailed explanation of the decision-making process that led to the suspension of TSA PreCheck and Global Entry, including the legal authority relied upon, the operational or budgetary assessments conducted, the officials who authorized the action, and the rationale for restoring PreCheck while leaving Global Entry closed.”</p>\n<p>She asked Noem to respond by March 2 and to provide the department’s plan and timeline for fully restoring Global Entry services.</p>\n<p>Rosen also copied the DHS inspector general on the letter.</p>\n<p>She told The Hill that she’s concerned about the broader economic effects of hampering air travel.</p>\n<p>“You’re going to shut down trillions of dollars. You shut down our economy by shutting down our airspace. You’re going to get your revenge alright because you’re going to cause the economy to collapse,” Rosen warned. “Good luck with that one.”</p>\n<p>“We don’t have enough people traveling, we don’t have enough shifts at the hotels, restaurants, bars. What about the people who sell toilet paper, paper towels and soap in the bathrooms there?” she continued. “You cascade all the way down. People make less, they spend less in their neighborhoods.”</p>",

            "description": "<p>If a certain crime can only be committed by a male, can there be justice for the accuser when the male defendant is called “she?”</p>\n<p>A case in Madera County, California, winding its way to trial, will soon decide guilt or innocence of the defendant, Tremaine Carroll, a trans-identifying male. It will also test how far the U.S. criminal justice system will go to affirm the beliefs of men who profess female identities when they stand accused of the overwhelmingly male crime of rape. </p>\n<p>Outside the U.S., compelled use of female pronouns to describe accused male sex-offenders has been widely reported, resulting in such verbal abominations at trial and in rulings as “<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12035403/Her-penis-NSW-District-Court-judge-Alister-Adadees-comments-child-sex-offender-criticised.html\">her penis</a>.” But this case may be the first in the U.S. to compel the use of female pronouns to describe a man accused of rape.</p>\n<p>Carroll is a felon in the California prison system. Since the state’s <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB132\">Transgender Respect, Agency, and Dignity Act took effect in 2021</a>, men in California prisons, including violent felons like Carroll charged with sex offenses who have intact genitals, can request transfer to women’s prisons based on self-identification as transgender. After serving more than twenty-two years in the men’s prison, Carroll was thus transferred to a California women’s correctional facility in 2021 — because he claimed to be a woman. </p>\n<p>Besides being a violent felon, Carroll is also one of four trans-identified male inmates hand-selected by the American Civil Liberties Union to <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f232ea74d8342386a7ebc52/t/627ae5341fb9965df6503ecd/1652221238536/Memo+to+support+motion+to+intervene.pdf\">intervene</a> in a <a href=\"https://womensliberationfront.org/chandler-v-cdcr-women\">lawsuit</a> brought by <a href=\"https://womensliberationfront.org/\">my organization</a> on behalf of six female inmates. We charge (among other things) that placing males in women’s facilities subjects female inmates to cruel and unusual punishment under the Constitution’s Eighth Amendment, including sexual assaults, attempted rapes, voyeurism and a pervasive climate of sexual intimidation. </p>\n<p>Awkwardly for the ACLU, Carroll was eventually returned to the men’s facility after being accused of raping two female inmates within a 24-hour period.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://womensliberationfront.org/news/update-court-transcript-shows-california-da-forced-to-call-alleged-male-rapist-sheher\">A hearing</a> took place on Dec. 16 to decide whether the court would compel the prosecution and witnesses in Carroll’s rape trial to refer to him by she/her pronouns. Representing the people of California, Deputy District Attorney Eric DuTemple objected that to do so would undermine the charge. Carroll, he noted, “is a biological male with male genitalia who is currently housed in a male prison and is accused of committing two rapes against two females, a crime that can only be committed by a biological male. … [T]he court compelling us to use that language, which is contrary to the facts, could indicate approval for the defendant’s legal position.”</p>\n<p>Forced usage of these pronouns also certainly runs contrary to our legal theory of the case — that the defendant is using the pronouns simply to get into a female prison so he can carry on such unlawful sexual contacts or rapes.</p>\n<p>The defense most succinctly described what was at stake in the judge’s ruling, stating, “This case really is about setting a precedent across the board” for referring to transgender litigants. The use of incorrect “she/her” pronouns would lead to confusion at trial and in court hearings. It would also be disrespectful and traumatic to the victims in any such future cases, forcing them to police their own language while testifying about being raped.</p>\n<p>In this case, to call Carroll “she” would deprive the people of California of justice. “She” refers to a female, and no female could commit the crime of which Carroll is accused, which involves vaginal penetration by a penis. It would also be an affront to his female accusers, who know full well the sex of their attacker. </p>\n<p>Judge Katherine Rigby rejected the argument that using she/her pronouns would interfere with the prosecution’s rape charge, leaning heavily on nonbinding discussion in a California case that observing a litigant’s professed “gender identity” is a matter of “respect, courtesy, and dignity” and protections for “gender identity” in California judicial canons. And so in a trial involving forcible rape — a crime only a male could commit — she ordered the prosecution to refer to the defendant by female pronouns.</p>\n<p>But Rigby deferred ruling on how witnesses can refer to the defendant. Perhaps she understood that the principles of “respect, courtesy, and dignity” are inconsistent with requiring a witness to refer to the man she has accused of raping her as anything other than a man. </p>\n<p>The point at which she will have to make that decision is now approaching. A hearing to set the trial date will occur on March 6, and additional motions on the pronoun issue can be expected. </p>\n<p>Should this case go to trial, justice can only be served by reversing the order requiring the prosecution to use female pronouns and by allowing witnesses to testify freely, in truthful terms, unrestricted by gender circumlocutions. </p>\n<p>A trial is a process for arriving at truth. Should the court subvert the hard truth of Carroll’s sex — which is foundational to the rape charge against him — to the subjective feeling of gender identity, the trial risks becoming instead a taxpayer-funded exercise in affirmation of the accused at the expense of justice for his accusers.</p>\n<p><em>N.K.

            "description": "<p>Years ago, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/liberty-vittert-opioid-crisis-patients-life-threatening-pain\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">I wrote</a> about the opioid crisis and the dangers of punishing legitimate pain patients in our rush to address addiction. I warned that we were reacting too strongly to the problem, swinging too far in the opposite direction. </p>\n<p>I never imagined I would become an exhibit for that warning.</p>\n<p>I recently underwent extensive maxillofacial surgery — jaw bone removal for osteomyelitis. The doctor even said, “You’ll be in real pain” — that’s when you know it’s gonna be bad. My surgeon’s office called the day before to go over my pre-operative care and also to inform me they would not be prescribing any opioid pain medication.</p>\n<p>Why not? Because I had an existing prescription  for a different opioid — even though it was one that had run out and was sitting, unused, in a medicine cabinet at my parent’s house four states away. They told me to “just use that” for my post-surgical pain.</p>\n<p>Never mind that the other opioid medication had been prescribed at a very specific dose for a completely different reason. Never mind that I was going to be in severe pain after having my jaw reconstructed. The answer was no. </p>\n<p>When I pushed back, they made me feel like I was drug-seeking simply for asking for appropriate post-surgical pain management.</p>\n<p>I am not the first person to have such a thing happen. After I wrote a piece about this six years ago I received many emails from readers who had received similar treatment — even people undergoing terminal cancer. Recently, a close friend — a prominent plastic surgeon who has spent her career caring for patients — developed a severe infection in her wisdom teeth. She too was denied stronger pain medication. Let me repeat that — a prominent plastic surgeon who clearly understands pain management was told simply, “Take ibuprofen.”</p>\n<p>This is medical malpractice hiding behind the guise of policy for good. </p>\n<p>I know the opioid crisis is devastatingly real. I live in West Virginia, a state that has been devastated by opiates. In 2025, approximately 73,000 Americans died from opioid overdoses. But the data tell that these deaths are not coming from your surgeon’s prescription pad.</p>\n<p>According to the CDC, 92 percent of opioid overdose deaths involved synthetic opioids — that is, illicitly manufactured fentanyl and street drugs. Prescription opioid deaths have been rapidly declining for years, dropping to around 13,000 in 2023 and remaining <a href=\"http://wonder.cdc.gov/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">relatively stable</a>.</p>\n<p>In the U.S., if fentanyl involvement in overdoses had remained constant rather than skyrocketing, we would have approximately <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X25002364\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">260,000 more deceased people living among us today</a> — about four times the number who attended the Super Bowl in person this year.</p>\n<p>You want to know what’s killing us? In 2024, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/politics/us-canada-trade-fentanyl-fact-check/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">22,000 lbs</a> of fentanyl was seized at U.S. borders. For context, just two milligrams of fentanyl — an amount that fits on the tip of a pencil — is enough to be lethal. So the amount seized is the equivalent of 5 billion lethal doses — enough to kill every man, woman, and child in the U.S. 15 times over. And that is just what was seized — much more gets through each year.</p>\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control guidelines acknowledge that its recommendations have been misapplied in harmful ways, including “rigid application of opioid dosage thresholds” and actions that “contributed to patient harm, including untreated and undertreated pain, serious withdrawal symptoms, worsening pain outcomes, psychological distress, overdose, and suicidal ideation and behavior.”</p>\n<p>What’s really happening is that doctors are terrified, and they are hurting people because of it. </p>\n<p>We have created a system where doctors are more afraid of prescribing appropriately than they are of leaving patients to suffer. They are scared scrutiny from federal authorities and state medical board investigators. They fear being labeled as “pill mill” doctors. They have watched colleagues face prosecution and they have reacted by taking the safest route — prescribing nothing or prescribing inadequately.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, assumptions that appropriate prescribing will lead to addiction is totally unproven. Studies show that roughly <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7440649/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">94 percent of patients</a> don’t even try to refill their opioid prescriptions. They take what they need, and then they stop.</p>\n<p>When I left the surgeon’s office, groggy from the anaesthesia, jaw throbbing, being told I couldn’t have appropriate pain medication, I thought about the thousands of patients going through the same thing — sent home from surgery, from emergency rooms, from dental procedures, to suffer needlessly because we have overcorrected.</p>\n<p>The opioid crisis is real. The prescription-to-addiction pipeline was real and required intervention. But we have now created a new crisis in the form of systematic undertreatment of acute pain in America. We have turned appropriate medical care into a guilty act.</p>\n<p>What about the elderly woman after hip replacement or the construction worker after a serious accident? They suffer in silence, told their pain “isn’t that bad” or that they should “tough it out.”</p>\n<p>This isn’t health care. It is abandonment.</p>\n<p>The data are clear: prescription opioids are not driving the overdose crisis. Illicit fentanyl is. And it’s time we direct our outrage and resources toward the flood of deadly synthetic opioids pouring across our borders from abroad. Because right now, we’re fighting yesterday’s war while innocent patients pay the price.</p>\n<p><em>Liberty Vittert is a professor of data science at Washington University in St. Louis and the resident on-air statistician for NewsNation, a sister company of The Hill.</em></p>",

Paxton is narrowly ahead in the average with 36.5 percent support, closely followed by Cornyn with 32.2 percent and Rep. <strong>Wesley Hunt</strong> (R) in third with 18 percent.</p>\n<p>On the Democratic side, state Rep. <strong>James Talarico</strong> and Rep. <strong>Jasmine Crockett</strong> are <a href=\"https://polls.decisiondeskhq.com/averages/primary-ballot-test/2026-tx-us-senate-dem/texas/lv-rv-adults-independents-democrats\">neck and neck</a> in the DDHQ polling average, with 44.4 percent support for Talarico to Crockett’s 44.1 percent.</p>\n<p>But polling has been much more limited than on the Republican side. A few of the polls have also been affiliated with a campaign or its supporters, including a few showing Talarico ahead, and are viewed with some skepticism as to their reliability.</p>\n<p>Cornyn is locked in the race of his political life as he tries to fend off primary challenges from Paxton and Hunt. Both have sought to brand the GOP senator as a “RINO,” or Republican in name only, and as insufficiently supportive of the president, while Cornyn has pushed back in stressing his conservative bona fides.</p>\n<p>Although Cornyn has been an institution unto himself in Texas politics, having served in his Senate seat for more than two decades, he faces a significant uphill battle to clinching renomination.</p>\n<p>Texas election law requires a candidate to receive a majority of the vote to win a primary outright, so the top two candidates appear almost certain to advance to a runoff in May.</p>\n<p>The race has gotten increasingly intense as the primary approaches, though Cornyn and Paxton are longtime rivals and have been trading barbs with each other for months.</p>\n<p>Cornyn has attacked Paxton for various controversies concerning both his public and private life, including an indictment on security fraud charges he faced and an <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/4207133-ken-paxton-acquitted-in-texas-impeachment-trial/\">unsuccessful impeachment effort</a> over accusations of bribery.

            "title": "Some Republicans increasingly frustrated stock trading ban touted by Trump is stalled",
            "description": "<p>Some House Republicans are growing increasingly frustrated with leadership for not moving the ball quickly enough on a stock trading ban, an issue that has vexed Congress for years despite repeated bipartisan calls for reform.</p>\n<p>Last month, the House Administration Committee advanced a bill by Chairman Bryan Steil (R-Wis.) that would allow members of Congress, their spouses and their dependent children to hold onto the stocks they already own but prevent them from buying new ones. No action, however, has been taken on the bill since.</p>\n<p>And the lack of movement has pushed some rank-and-file Republicans to renew calls for a stock trading ban, especially after President Trump urged Congress to pass legislation on the matter during his State of the Union address Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>“If you have a strong bipartisan majority in Congress (supporting the issue), if you have overwhelming support from the public. You have the president of the United States specifically referencing it in the State of the Union, why pray tell is it not put on the floor?” Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) said.</p>\n<p>He added that a stock trading ban is long “overdue.”</p>\n<p>“It’s very frustrating,” Fitzpatrick said. “This should have been the first thing we took up.”</p>\n<p>Steil’s bill isn’t the only stock trading ban that’s been introduced.</p>\n<p>Fitzpatrick had endorsed a bipartisan bill last year sponsored by Reps. Chip Roy (R-Texas) and Seth Magaziner (D-R.I.), dubbed the “Restore Trust in Congress Act,” that would bar lawmakers, their spouses, dependent children and trustees from owning, buying or selling individual stocks.</p>\n<p>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) had introduced a discharge petition to force a vote on Roy and Magaziner’s bill; however, leadership ended up advancing Steil’s bill, dubbed the “Stop Insider Trading Act,” through committee.</p>\n<p>Trump urged members of Congress during his speech on Tuesday to pass Steil’s legislation “without delay.”</p>\n<p>Luna, referencing Trump’s speech, wrote on<a href=\"https://x.com/RepLuna/status/2026529605696274879\"> the social platform X</a>, “PASS THE STOP INSIDER TRADING ACT NOW!”</p>\n<p>“This is going to be a great vote. Banning insider trading needs to happen!” Luna wrote in a follow-up tweet.</p>\n<p>Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) told reporters on Wednesday that Steil’s bill will get a House vote “soon,” according to<a href=\"https://news.bgov.com/bloomberg-government-news/johnson-expects-vote-on-trump-backed-stock-buying-ban-soon?taid=699f1a469bba4c0001379f8c&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter\"> Bloomberg News.</a></p>\n<p>But complicating matters for Johnson is whether he has enough votes for the bill to pass. </p>\n<p>Johnson is currently operating with a 218-214 majority, meaning he can afford only one Republican defection and still pass party-line legislation. Virtually every Democrat will oppose Steil’s bill because the minority party is pushing for any ban to include the president, vice president and their families.</p>\n<p>Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) said he’s leaning towards opposing Steil’s bill, which he argues falls short of addressing the issue. He also said he doesn’t see the Senate taking up the bill, even if it did pass the House.</p>\n<p>“I think if they do, they’re going to pass something that’s totally different than what we have,” Burchett said. “And we don’t agree on it, and then they all giggle and laugh in both parties as it fails and they continue on their insider stock trading.”</p>\n<p>When asked why there’s been a stalled effort on a stock trading ban overall, Burchett said, “glaciers sprint past Congress.”</p>\n<p>“We move at a very record slow pace,” he said. “We always have, since I’ve been there under Democrats and under Republicans.”</p>\n<p>Fitzpatrick said he would support Steil’s bill because he believes it’s “incremental progress,” but he added that he doesn’t think it goes “far enough” to “fix the system.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, House Democrats introduced a discharge petition last month to force action on a bill banning members of Congress, the president, the vice president and their immediate families from owning, holding and trading stocks. Magaziner had introduced the bill last year, with support from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.).</p>\n<p>Democrats have blasted Steil’s bill, arguing that it doesn’t extend to the executive branch and allows members to still sell their existing stocks.</p>\n<p>“I want something to be very clear: That this bill that has been introduced by Republican leadership is not a congressional stock trading ban,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) told reporters last month. “It was written by and for the absolute wealthiest members of Congress to look like they are passing a ban, but … it actually creates a ton of new [avenues] by which they can own, buy and sell stock in even greater shadows from public opinion. … They can call it whatever they want, but it is not a stock trading ban.”</p>",

            "title": "The big new controversy over the Epstein files, explained",
            "description": "<p>When the Department of Justice released more than 3 million pages of documents relating to the convicted sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein on Jan. 30, the sheer volume of the material was dizzying.</p>\n<p>It always seemed plausible that important elements of the release would take time to emerge as reporters and researchers dug into the massive trawl.</p>\n<p>This is exactly what has happened. Major news outlets this week picked up on reporting, which first came from an independent journalist, about potentially vital documents that appear not to have been made publicly available.</p>\n<p>It’s a complicated story. Here’s what you need to know.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is the core of the controversy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Documents outlining three of four FBI interviews apparently related to a woman who accused President Trump, as well as Epstein, of sexually assaulting her decades ago, seem to be missing from the latest release. </p>\n<p>The woman made the claims in 2019, but they date back to the 1980s, when she was a minor.</p>\n<p>Her allegation against Trump is uncorroborated. The president has denied all wrongdoing in relation to his friendship with Epstein, which ended roughly two decades ago.</p>\n<p>Also, The Guardian late on Thursday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/26/trump-epstein-files-fbi\">published a story</a> in which it said its reporters had obtained the missing documents and that the woman’s claims “at times appear outlandish.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What’s the broader explanation? </strong></h2>\n<p>The latest release of the Epstein files includes a 2021 catalogue of material provided to Ghislaine Maxwell’s legal team. </p>\n<p>Maxwell, Epstein’s sometime-girlfriend, was tried and convicted of sex trafficking charges at the end of that year. The <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">data set</a> lists “non-testifying witness material.”</p>\n<p>It includes anonymized reference to four interviews relating to one person, who has the case number 3501.045.</p>\n<p>Of those four interviews, only one appears to have been publicly released. </p>\n<p>In that interview, the woman makes detailed allegations of rape by Epstein but makes no allegation of abuse against Trump. </p>\n<p>The president is mentioned only in relation to a friend sending the woman a photograph. In her interview with FBI agents, the woman notes she still has this photo saved in her cellphone messages but asks if she can crop it so it shows only Epstein.</p>\n<p>When she was asked why she wanted to crop the photo, she hesitated, and the notes reflect that her “attorney advised [she] was concerned about implicating additional individuals, and specifically any that were well known, due to fear of retaliation.” The photo, according to the FBI account of the interview, was “a widely distributed photograph” of Epstein and Trump.</p>\n<p>The strand of the Epstein story centering on this woman was first brought to light by independent journalist Roger Sollenberger.</p>\n<p>Sollenberger, and subsequently outlets including NPR, The New York Times and CNN, have traced details about the woman in question that match a woman who made the serious but unproven allegation of sexual assault against Trump.</p>\n<p>Some commentators have pointed to the fact that four interviews took place as a sign that investigators believed the woman to be credible. But her credibility would not, in itself, prove any specific claim to be true. Furthermore, The Guardian’s story noted that it had “identified a woman matching the biographical details in the FBI records. She has faced several fraud and theft charges in Washington and, in 2023, a felony charge for the exploitation of an elderly person in Georgia. It is not clear how those cases were resolved.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What does the DOJ and the White House have to say?</strong></h2>\n<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) is adamant that it has done nothing wrong and is not hiding anything for nefarious reasons.</p>\n<p>In one social media post earlier this week, the DOJ said that “NOTHING has been deleted.” The <a href=\"https://x.com/DOJRR47/status/2026366459375497413?s=20\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post asserted</a>: “ALL responsive documents have been produced unless a document falls within one of the following categories: duplicates, privileged, or part of an ongoing federal investigation.”</p>\n<p>This has not quelled disquiet around the story, however.</p>\n<p>The Hill <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5757945-trump-epstein-files-release/\">reported</a> on Thursday that several Republican senators were putting pressure on the DOJ to release all possible files. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), asked whether material containing this woman’s allegations should be held back, replied: “I don’t know how else to say it: Release the documents.”</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the DOJ said that it was conducting a review because “several individuals and news outlets have recently flagged files related to documents produced to Ghislaine Maxwell.” </p>\n<p>It <a href=\"https://x.com/DOJRR47/status/2026769082159112295?s=20\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">added that if any file</a> was discovered to have been kept out of the public eye when it should not have been, “the Department will of course publish it, consistent with the law.”</p>\n<p>Trump has not addressed this specific element of the controversy in any in-depth way, but, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5746028-trump-responds-prince-andrew-arrest/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">speaking with reporters</a> last week, he claimed he had “been totally exonerated” in the Epstein matter. </p>\n<p>White House statements to multiple news outlets this week have echoed that claim.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What about Democrats</strong>?</h2>\n<p>Democrats, especially those serving on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which has been probing the Epstein matter, have been scathing.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the House Oversight Democrats’s <a href=\"https://x.com/OversightDems/status/2026781758897717280?s=20\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">account on the social platform X</a> asserted: “The Department of Justice continues to change its story. The facts are clear: documents related to a survivor who accused Donald Trump and Jeffery Epstein of abuse when she was a minor are missing from the released files.” </p>\n<p>Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), the committee’s ranking member, told MS NOW on Tuesday that he had gone to the Department of Justice in person to probe the matter further.</p>\n<p>“Those additional documents <a href=\"https://x.com/RepRobertGarcia/status/2026421331844280785?s=20\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">seem to be missing</a>,” Garcia said, “and that’s something that I confirmed as of yesterday in my visit to the Department of Justice. The idea that there is a possible cover-up or that we are hiding actual documentation of an alleged crime by the President of the United States … is incredibly serious.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Where does the story go from here?</strong></h2>\n<p>The focus on the story has become so intense that pressure for disclosure of the interview notes is intense. However, the new reporting from The Guardian may dilute at least some of that pressure.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the problem for those pressing for disclosure is, if the DOJ says it has valid reasons for not making the interviews public, it is hard to definitively prove them wrong.</p>",

            "description": "<p>President Trump is looming large over Texas as the Lone Star State’s GOP gears up for competitive primaries next week. </p>\n<p>The president is set to stop in Corpus Christi on Friday, just days after his State of the Union address and as Texas voters cast their ballots in a high-stakes, three-way Republican primary race for Sen. John Cornyn’s (R-Texas) seat in the Senate.  </p>\n<p>While Trump is visiting the state in an official capacity, observers are eager to see if the president has anything to say about the closely watched primary, with Texas Democrats feeling increasingly optimistic about their chances in November.  </p>\n<p>Trump <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5717394-trump-texas-republican-senate-endorsement/\">told reporters</a> earlier this month that he was taking a “serious look” at endorsing in the Texas Senate race. Two weeks later, he said he was still undecided, even as he <a href=\"https://thetexan.news/elections/2026/trump-endorses-in-several-key-texas-congressional-seats-ahead-of-2026-primary-election/article_d1e2bc69-6161-432a-8ba9-f55e48ef5cc1.html\">issued support</a> for several other candidates in the state. </p>\n<p>“I like all three of them, actually. Those are the toughest races. They’ve all supported me. They’re all good,” Trump said on Feb. 17. “You’re supposed to pick one, so we’ll see what happens. But I support all three,” the president said of the primary’s leading candidates. </p>\n<p>Cornyn, seeking a fifth term in the Senate, is locked in a competitive race with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) and Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-Texas) — all three of whom have flexed their conservative bona fides and underscored their alignment with the president.  </p>\n<p>“When you have a 24-year incumbent U.S. senator and you don’t endorse him, that’s a pretty big tell to the electorate, especially a Texas ruby red primary electorate, one Republican strategist, referring to Cornyn, told The Hill. </p>\n<p>“It’s not an endorsement against Cornyn,” the strategist added. “But when you have the president and your fellow junior senator [Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas)] not willing to endorse you in the primary, people get that and primary voters get that.”  </p>\n<p>All three contenders are slated to attend Trump’s Friday remarks in Corpus Christi, with Paxton’s campaign <a href=\"https://x.com/RenzoDowney/status/2027092679385907523?s=20\">reportedly rescheduling a planned event</a> so the Texas’ attorney general can see the president ahead of the March 3 contest. </p>\n<p>Paxton boasts a 1-point lead over Cornyn — with 34 percent and 33 percent, respectively —according to Decision Desk HQ’s <a href=\"https://polls.decisiondeskhq.com/averages/primary-ballot-test/2026-tx-us-senate-gop/texas/republicans-lv-rv-adults-independents\">polling aggregate</a>. But neither appears poised to secure the support they need to win the primary outright. Hunt, whose bid has been seen as a longshot, is pulling in roughly 20 percent support.  </p>\n<p>If no candidate wins over 50 percent of the vote on Tuesday, the race will head to a May 26 runoff between the top two vote-getters.  </p>\n<p>“Around the primary, the number one issue appears to be: who can differentiate themselves as the closest to the president?” Josh Blank, research director for the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, told The Hill last week. </p>\n<p>“If they have an endorsement, that’s the best-case scenario,” he continued. “But outside of that, you’re seeing a lot of advertisements that show, in one way or another, that candidate’s closeness to the president, or even just the president’s orbit.”  </p>\n<p>A Trump endorsement could be a game-changer in the close race, though experts say that the possibility of one coming before the primary is increasingly unlikely as Tuesday nears.  </p>\n<p>Texans have already started to vote, and an endorsement may be more likely after the primary, especially if it tips into the expected runoff. </p>\n<p>While Democrats are outpacing Republicans in early vote turnout, GOP turnout is higher than past years.  </p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/26/politics/texas-democratic-primary-early-voting-data\">CNN</a>, early turnout on the GOP side is 15 percent higher than it was at this point in 2022.  </p>\n<p>“These are pretty high number for Republicans too, which conceivably could help Cornyn, but when you get to a runoff in Texas, it’s a much more constricted, more redder, much more conservative voting bloc,” the GOP strategist said.  </p>\n<p>If Trump weighed in, “it absolutely would affect Republican primary voters’ choices,” James Dickey, a former Texas GOP chair, said. </p>\n<p>Blank, though, suggested that Trump’s backing may not hold as much weight in the Senate race as in other Texas contests, since GOP voters are largely engaged in the race and both leading candidates, whom have won statewide elections, have their own faithful bases.</p>\n<p>And, although Trump has long <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5721161-trump-kingmaker-republican-candidates/\">been a kingmaker</a> in Republican primaries, he had a notable slipup in the state earlier this month. The president endorsed the Republican candidate in a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5716988-democrats-score-upset-texas/\">special election runoff</a> for Texas’s ninth state Senate district — but the Democrat contender overperformed, winning the seat by roughly 14 points.  </p>\n<p>Cornyn, who told NBC News that he spoke to Trump about a possible endorsement last month, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5744208-cornyn-warns-of-massacre-if-paxton-beats-him-in-texas-gop-primary/\">has warned</a> of a “massacre” for the GOP in Texas if Paxton gets the nod, pointing to controversy around the state attorney general. Paxton was impeached by the Texas House in 2023 on corruption charges, then later acquitted by the state Senate. </p>\n<p>Republicans’ national Senate campaign arm has made a similar case. In a February memo, argued that Cornyn is “the only Republican candidate who reliably wins a general election matchup.” </p>\n<p>And Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) also told Semafor earlier this month that he’s cautioned Trump “many times” on consequences for the party if Cornyn isn’t the Texas Senate GOP nominee. </p>\n<p>The warnings come as Republicans have raised concerns over their support among Hispanic voters, including in Texas. According to VoteHub data <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2026/02/06/texas-senate-district-9-taylor-rehmet-latino-voters-swing-democrats/\">cited in the Texas Tribune</a> earlier this month, 79 percent of Hispanic voters backed the Democrat in the state Senate District 9 special election this month.  </p>\n<p>Paxton’s team, however, has emphasized his double-digit wins in past elections, as well as his lead over Cornyn in the polls.  </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Hunt’s team last week blasted national Republicans’ “misguided investment in a 24-year incumbent.”  </p>\n<p>Friday’s trip is Trump’s first public event since delivering his State of the Union address on Tuesday, where he acknowledged the devastating flooding that tore through the state last year as part of a wide-ranging speech on his administration’s accomplishments.  </p>\n<p>“President Trump looks forward to returning to the great State of Texas this week to discuss the economy and tout his ‘Drill Baby Drill’ agenda,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to The Hill.  </p>\n<p>Even if an endorsement in the Senate race doesn’t come before Tuesday’s primary, Trump’s presence will be closely watched as Texas kick’s off the midterm cycle with primaries up and down the ballot.  </p>\n<p>“I’m never one to try to [predict] what the President will or will not do, but…he will be in Corpus Christi [Friday],” Texas Republican Vinny Minchillo consultant told The Hill via email.  “Does he endorse? And who? If it’s Cornyn I don’t believe it will be enough to help him avoid a runoff.”  </p>",

            "description": "<p>Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-Texas) on Thursday defended his missed votes in the House by pointing to Senate votes missed by Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Vice President Vance when he represented Ohio.</p>\n<p>Hunt was questioned about his voting record in an appearance on “The Will Cain Show” on Fox News. Host Will Cain said Hunt was the most absent member of Congress and did not attend the State of the Union. Hunt said in his defense that he has been <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5749807-hunt-gop-leadership-generation/\">running his campaign</a> for a Senate seat all across Texas.</p>\n<p>“Do you know how many votes JD Vance missed when he was campaigning to be vice president? All of them,” Hunt said. “Do you know how many votes Tim Scott missed when he was running for president? The third-most in the history of the Senate, over 150.”</p>\n<p>“So again, this is a moot point,” he continued. “Everybody knows that when you’re running for higher office, it’s important to get your face in front of the people.”</p>\n<p>Hunt added that when on flights, he voted for “consequential pieces of legislation.”</p>\n<p>Between November and February, Hunt has missed 69 out of 158 votes, according to the nonpartisan Congress-tracking website <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/wesley_hunt/456946\">GovTrack</a>. Vance missed 111 votes in the Senate after he was picked to be President Trump’s running mate in July 2024, <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/james_david_vance/456876\">GovTrack</a>‘s data shows. Scott <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/tim_scott/412471\">missed</a> 110 votes in the Senate between April 2023 and December 2023, though he ran for president from May to November of that year.</p>\n<p>In December, <a href=\"https://news.bgov.com/bloomberg-government-news/which-senators-missed-the-most-votes-in-exhausting-record-year\">Bloomberg</a> reported that the senator with the third-most missed votes in 2025 was Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who missed 58 of 659 votes. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) ranked at No. 2, with Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) in the top spot.</p>\n<p>Hunt was third in the <a href=\"https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/blog/competition-remains-fierce-in-both-u-s-senate-primaries-in-texas-according-to-latest-ut-texas-politics-project-poll-2\">University of Texas/Texas Politics Project Poll</a> behind Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and incumbent Sen. John Cornyn.

            "description": "<p>The U.S. military shot down a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) drone with a laser in Texas on Thursday, according to Democratic lawmakers, prompting the closure of <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/transportation/5736518-faa-el-paso-airspace-closure/\">airspace</a> near the U.S.-Mexico border. </p>\n<p>Democratic Reps. Rick Larsen (Wash.), Bennie Thompson (Miss.) and Andre Carson (Ind.) said in a joint <a href=\"https://x.com/transportdems/status/2027198549608317278?s=46\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> Thursday evening that the Pentagon reportedly shot down a CBP drone using “high-risk counter-unmanned aircraft system.” </p>\n<p>The trio criticized the White House “sidestepping” a bipartisan bill to train drone operations and address the lack of communication between the Department of Homeland Security, Pentagon and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). </p>\n<p>“Now, we’re seeing the result of its incompetence,” they said in a statement. </p>\n<p>The incident prompted the FAA to close the airspace near Fort Hancock, Texas. </p>\n<p>The FAA told The Hill that a temporary flight restriction (TFR) was already in place around the Fort Hancock area and has been expanded include a “greater radius to ensure safety.” The TFR does not impact commercial flights.  </p>\n<p>The Hill has reached out to the Pentagon, CBP and the White House for comment. </p>\n<p>The incident marks the second time this month that a laser was used in Texas and caused a closure of airspace. The CBP used a laser, lent by the Pentagon, to fire in the airspace near Fort Bliss, causing the FAA to shut down air traffic at the El Paso airport. </p>\n<p>Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), the ranking member on the Senate’s Aviation Subcommittee, said the situation is “alarming” and demanded a “thorough, independent” investigation. </p>\n<p>“As Ranking Member of the Aviation Subcommittee, I will be calling on the Inspectors General of the Departments of Defense, Transportation and Homeland Security to launch a joint investigation into the recent scandals in El Paso and now Fort Hancock,” Duckworth said in a statement Thursday night. </p>",
