The incident revealed how a single cyberattack can ripple through the economy, and how dependent our defense and civilian sectors are on fragile energy networks. </p>\n<p>Attacks like this highlight the urgent need for stronger cyber defenses and remind us that energy underpins every aspect of national security. If a conflict with an adversary, such as China or Russia, were to occur, we cannot be certain that we will have reliable energy from the existing electrical grid. </p>\n\n<p>The strength of the American armed forces — and of our economy — depends on reliable energy. Yet our most critical infrastructure remains dangerously vulnerable to cyberattacks and fuel supply disruptions. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Electricity demand on the battlefield is growing rapidly to power unmanned platforms, directed energy weapons, artificial intelligence, advanced manufacturing and other power-intensive systems.

The deployment of advanced nuclear energy for our nation’s critical defense and civilian infrastructure would provide resilience against a cyberattack on our grid. It can also help the Pentagon reduce logistical burdens.</p>\n<p>Several companies, including ours, are on track to deliver nuclear fission micro-reactors capable of supplying compact, resilient power to our nation’s military bases, operational assets and other networks vital for public health and our economic well-being.</p>\n<p>Modern nuclear systems use advanced fuels — tiny particles that each serve as mini containment vessels, preventing the release of fission products even under extreme conditions.   </p>\n\n<p>These reactors are also passively safe. If the reactor temperature begins to rise unexpectedly, the physics of the system causes the nuclear reactions to slow down and maintain safety with no human or mechanical intervention needed. If power is lost, automatic control drums and shutdown rods stop the nuclear reactions instantly. </p>\n<p>Even in a total cooling loss, the temperature of these advanced reactors stays well within safety limits, protecting people and the environment.</p>\n<p>Recognizing their potential, President Trump issued new <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/deploying-advanced-nuclear-reactor-technologies-for-national-security/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">executive orders</a> in May, and now federal agencies — including the Defense and Energy Departments and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission — are working together to accelerate broader use of these cutting-edge, safe reactor designs by the military and commercial actors alike.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>On the margins of last month’s Association of the United States Army Conference, the secretary of the Army and secretary of Energy announced <a href=\"https://www.army.mil/article/288903/army_announces_janus_program_for_next_generation_nuclear_energy\">Project Janus</a>, a program designed to deliver resilient, secure, and assured energy to support national defense installations and critical missions by 2028. </p>\n<p>To succeed, the U.S. must reestablish its uranium enrichment supply chain and build more infrastructure for reactor testing. We must also grow the training pipeline for nuclear experts and engineers.</p>\n<p>But with continued partnership across the private and public sector, these obstacles are surmountable, and we can strengthen our nation by quadrupling America’s nuclear capacity by 2050.</p>\n\n<p>Dense, clean nuclear energy can provide power for a host of military use cases including early warning radars, missile defense systems, high-powered optics, directed energy and advanced manufacturing, including assets in remote and austere locations.</p>\n<p>Power at our military installations today typically consists of large amounts of fossil fuel, usually diesel, stockpiled in tanks on or near the base. </p>\n<p>Deploying nuclear power means our joint force would no longer need to transport diesel fuel to installations across the continental United States or to bases in Alaska and the Pacific. </p>\n\n<p>Advanced nuclear reactors can help solve what U.S. military planners call “contested logistics” — the challenges and disruptions an adversary poses to military supply chains.</p>\n<p>Our adversaries are likely to test our resilience with cyber-attacks on our critical infrastructure again. China and Russia are investing in advanced energy technologies as part of their military modernization strategies. Our military needs to maintain its edge in remote, distributed locations throughout the Pacific islands and on the northern slope of Alaska. </p>\n<p>If conflict were to break out, the forces with assured access to electricity in all contested domains will prevail.

Only then can you hate completely without restraint or regret.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that the left has learned how to hate. Hateful speech is in vogue as Democratic leaders <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/james-carville-fantasizes-trump-collaborators-140317382.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ramp up violent rhetoric</a> and political violence rises. The key is to get voters to hate your opponent so much that they forget how much they dislike you.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The irony is crushing. For years, liberals have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8ns76RCmWs&amp;t=210s\">sought to criminalize</a> hate speech while expanding the range of viewpoints considered to fall within this category. Democratic leaders, from senators to former presidential candidates, have falsely claimed that hate speech is not protected under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>In “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1668047047?tag=simonsayscom\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage,</a>” I write about rage and the uncomfortable fact: “What few today want to admit is that they like it. They like the freedom that it affords, the ability to hate and harass without a sense of responsibility.” Rage is addictive, and it is contagious.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>What rage-addicts cannot tolerate are those who cling to residual impulses of decency or humanity. In an age of rage, reason is viewed as a reactionary tendency.</p>\n<p>This week, Bravo star and liberal podcast host Jennifer Welch praised footage of a “No Kings” protester celebrating the death of Charlie Kirk, holding her up as an example for all liberals. </p>\n<p>In the clip, the elderly woman said, “Charlie Kirk is horrible. Yes. I’m glad he’s not here.” When pressed if she was actually happy that the husband and father of two had been murdered, the woman said “Yes…because he was horrible on the campuses. Horrible person.”</p>\n\n<p>After playing the clip, Welch laughed with joy and declared, “So listen up, Democratic establishment. You can either jump on board with this s—, or we’re coming after you in the same way that we come after MAGA. Period.”</p>\n<p>Celebrities like Jamie Lee Curtis certainly got that message. The actress was facing a social and professional meltdown <a href=\"https://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-1678-jamie-lee-curtis\">after openly mourning Kirk’s death</a> in a podcast interview. “I disagreed with him on almost every point I ever heard him say,” she said. “But I believe he was a man of faith, and I hope in that moment when he died, that he felt connected to his faith, even though his ideas were abhorrent to me.”</p>\n<p>It appeared to be a moment of weakness that briefly overrode wokeness. Curtis quickly found herself persona non grata in Hollywood, as an angry liberal mob began to circle her. Curtis quickly saw the light and effectively retracted her fleeting expression of humanity, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/5577677-jamie-lee-curtis-charlie-kirk-comments/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claiming</a> it had been “mistranslated.” It is said that in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. But that does not apply if you then gouge out your own eye. Now fully and comfortably blinded by her own hand, Curtis is back as a member of good standing in Hollywood.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Internationally, the left has pushed for criminalizing the speech of those with opposing views as hateful and harmful. UNESCO works off <a href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/countering-hate-speech/need-know\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a definition</a> of hate speech as including “pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender or other identity factor.” This includes “scapegoating, stereotyping, stigmatization and the use of derogatory language” based on any “identity factor.”</p>\n<p>Countries are also “required to prohibit” speech tied to “conspiracy theories, disinformation and denial and distortion of historical events.”</p>\n<p>In the past, some leftists have included political criticism or parodies of their leaders as hate speech. For example, when a rodeo clown, Tuffy Gessling, donned a President Barack Obama mask at the Missouri State Fair as part of a skit years ago, the response was calls for his arrest. The President of the Missouri chapter of the NAACP, Mary Radliff, <a href=\"https://jonathanturley.org/2013/08/16/round-up-the-rodeo-clowns-naacp-official-calls-for-rodeo-employees-to-be-prosecuted-for-hate-crime/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">insisted</a> that it constituted criminal hate speech.</p>\n\n<p>But things have changed. The left has now discovered the thrill of uninhibited hate.</p>\n<p>Recently, in Chicago, elementary school teacher Lucy Martinez was <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15207753/chicago-teacher-mocking-charlie-kirk-assassination-school.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shown on video</a> reacting to an image of Kirk by mockingly making a gesture akin to being shot in the neck, mimicking how Kirk had been assassinated.</p>\n<p>Another educator, Wilbur Wright College Adult Education Manager Moises Bernal, <a href=\"https://x.com/AshFarms/status/1980266507062980970\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">screamed</a> to a crowd that “ICE agents gotta get shot and wiped out.” Bernal told the crowd, “You gotta grab a gun!” and “We gotta turn around the guns on this fascist system!”</p>\n\n<p>In academia, hateful speech has long been a way to establish one’s bona fides as a faculty member. By attacking and excluding others, you reaffirm your own protected status.</p>\n<p>Faculty have thrilled their colleagues and students by talking about “<a href=\"https://www.thecollegefix.com/barnard-college-instructor-discusses-blowing-up-and-gassing-whites-in-coming-race-war/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">detonating white people</a>,” <a href=\"https://www.thecollegefix.com/video-uc-berkeley-professor-under-fire-for-abolish-white-people-comments/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">abolishing white people</a>,  <a href=\"https://theiowastandard.com/breaking-drake-university-president-emails-campus-about-professor-who-said-she-hates-republicans-and-they-need-to-suffer-among-other-things/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">calling for Republicans to suffer</a>,  <a href=\"https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20201010215021154\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">strangling police officers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thecollegefix.com/professor-who-hoped-rush-limbaugh-suffered-until-his-last-breath-hides-twitter-account/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">celebrating the death of conservatives</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thecollegefix.com/professor-wishes-for-death-of-trump-supporters-while-studying-intellectual-humility-funded-by-large-grant/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">calling for the killing of Trump supporters</a>, and supporting the <a href=\"https://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2020/09/why-was-michael-reinoehl-killed\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">murder of conservative protesters</a>.</p>\n<p>Even school board members have referred to taking faculty “<a href=\"https://jonathanturley.org/2023/01/03/put-a-rope-on-them-and-take-them-to-the-slaughterhouse-college-board-trustee-calls-for-culling-dei-critics/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to the slaughterhouse</a>” for questioning diversity, equity and inclusion policies.</p>\n\n<p>Last week, Democratic strategist James Carville went on a hate-filled rant, to the delight of his podcast audience. He declared that anyone supporting Trump and the Republicans will be treated like collaborators in World War II who were publicly abused and paraded by mobs.</p>\n<p>“You know what we do with collaborators?” he said. “I think <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/23/us/trump-white-house-ballroom-donors-invs\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">these corporations</a> [funding White House renovations] — my fantasy dream is that this nightmare ends in 2029 and I think we ought to have radical things. I think they all ought to have their heads shaven, they should be put in orange pajamas and they should be marched down Pennsylvania Avenue and the public should be invited to spit on them.”</p>\n<p>Carville later repeated the call that “The universities, the corporations, the law firms, all of these collaborators should be shaved, pajamaed and spit on.”</p>\n\n<p>For years, Democratic leaders have given their base the license for such blind rage by calling Republicans “Nazis” and claiming that democracy will die unless their opponents are stopped.</p>\n<p>The effect has been transformative across the party. In the current race for <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/virginia-ag-candidate-once-referenced-putting-two-bullets-head-gop-leader-texts-show\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Virginia Attorney General</a>, Democratic nominee Jay Jones admitted to sending text messages expressing the desire to kill a political opponent, “piss on the grave” of a dead Republican, and kill his children, whom he dismissed as “little fascists,” in their mother’s arms.</p>\n<p>There was a time when such a candidate would be denounced by those on the ticket from his party and made a nonentity in politics. Instead, the Virginia Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Abigail Spanberger (who had previously told her supporters to “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/5524115-let-your-rage-fuel-you-politicians-and-pundits-embrace-demonization-politics/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Let your rage fuel you</a>”), has refused to withdraw her endorsement. Moreover, the race <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/polls/virginia-attorney-general-election-polls-2025.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">remains close</a>, with most Democratic voters still planning to cast their ballots for him. </p>\n\n<p>It is a lesson many hope will take hold in the midterm elections. Like Queen Elizabeth, these voters have overcome all inhibitions and can now teach others “how to curse.”</p>\n<p><em>Jonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University.

For the <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/sanae-takaichi-makes-history-as-japans-first-woman-prime-minister\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">first time</a> in its modern history, the country has chosen a woman to lead it. Sanae Takaichi, a 64-year-old conservative, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japans-takaichi-become-prime-minister-after-winning-lower-house-vote-2025-10-21/?\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">has won</a> 237 out of 465 votes in the Lower House and 125 of 248 in the Upper House to become Japan’s first female prime minister. </p>\n<p>Her historic rise is not the result of a feminist breakthrough or generational change. It is the culmination of factional politics and a desire for continuity in an uncertain world.</p>\n\n<p>Takaichi’s path to power was shaped by the internal recalibration of the Liberal Democratic Party following a breakup with its longtime coalition partner, Komeito. The party struck a new alliance with the Japan Innovation Party, creating a tenuous parliamentary majority. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Despite leading a minority administration, balancing competing factions has cemented Takaichi’s image as a pragmatic yet determined leader — a quality that earned her the nickname <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/04/sanae-takaichi-the-new-leader-of-japans-liberal-democratic-party-who-cites-thatcher-as-an-influence?\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Japan’s Iron Lady</a>.</p>\n<p>Behind the symbolism, few expect radical transformation. Takaichi’s <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/japan-s-conservative-iron-lady-plans-to-stimulate-growth-tech-competition-via-massive-public-spending/3722272?\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">economic philosophy</a> mirrors her mentor Shinzo Abe’s “Abenomics.” It involves expansionary fiscal policy, ultra-loose monetary conditions and a belief that government stimulus remains key to Japan’s growth.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>She has already signaled plans for large-scale spending on infrastructure, defense and technology. The Nikkei 225 <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japans-nikkei-extends-record-bonds-stable-takaichi-pm-election-2025-10-21/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rallied</a> after her election, reflecting investor optimism for continued liquidity and state-led stimulus.</p>\n<p>Still, this optimism may prove fragile. Japan’s public debt exceeds <a href=\"https://www.mri.co.jp/en/knowledge/mreview/2023013.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">260 percent of GDP</a>. Another wave of spending could worsen inflationary pressure and further weaken the yen. A soft currency benefits exporters, but it also raises import costs and erodes purchasing power for ordinary households.</p>\n<p>Can Takaichi’s administration sustain economic momentum without stoking financial instability? Her record suggests she will tolerate a weaker yen as the price of national competitiveness, reinforcing the continuity of Abe’s economic model.</p>\n\n<p>However, change is likely in Japan’s <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/japan-s-conservative-iron-lady-plans-to-stimulate-growth-tech-competition-via-massive-public-spending/3722272?\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">geopolitical posture</a>. Takaichi’s nationalism is open and unapologetic. Often compared to Italy’s Giorgia Meloni for her ideological conviction and political discipline, she brings a more assertive tone to Japanese leadership that emphasizes sovereignty, pride and strength.</p>\n<p>Her worldview rests on the conviction that Japan must reclaim a central role in shaping Asia’s strategic future. This means defense spending will rise, continuing the trajectory begun under Abe and Kishida. Japan is already on track to double its defense budget by 2027. Under Takaichi, that goal may accelerate.</p>\n<p>She is expected to push for enhanced missile deterrence, expanded U.S. cooperation and deeper engagement with Australia, the Philippines and South Korea. For Takaichi, security and economic policy are intertwined. Strong defense, resilient supply chains and technological independence define Japan’s survival in a volatile Indo-Pacific.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Her hard line toward China will likely define her early foreign policy. Takaichi has long been critical of Beijing’s assertiveness in the <a href=\"https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20251030_03/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">East China Sea</a> and its stance on Taiwan. </p>\n<p>Her election prompted swift reactions from both capitals. Taipei’s President Lai Ching-te called her a “<a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/10/05/japan/politics/taiwans-lai-congratulates-takaichi/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">steadfast friend</a>,” while China’s foreign ministry warned Japan to “<a href=\"https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xw/fyrbt/202510/t20251023_11739485.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">honor its political commitments</a>” regarding Taiwan. This dynamic hints at a heightened Tokyo-Beijing rivalry in the years ahead, one where Japan asserts itself more openly against Chinese influence.</p>\n<p>Still, Takaichi is not seeking confrontation for its own sake. Her initial gestures toward Seoul, <a href=\"https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10605483\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">calling South Korea</a> an “important neighbor and a key partner,” signal a pragmatic recognition that Japan’s strength depends on its alliances. </p>\n\n<p>The improving Tokyo-Seoul relationship, combined with close ties to Washington, could form a new triangle of cooperation in Northeast Asia. This would bolster Japan’s leverage economically and strategically, positioning it as a pivotal player in regional security and technology supply chains.</p>\n<p>Domestically, Takaichi faces the paradox of being a historic figure leading a party resistant to change. Her cabinet includes only two women. That has fueled debate over whether her rise will advance women’s empowerment or simply reinforce the status quo. </p>\n<p>But her political instincts are clear; symbolism must serve stability. In that sense, she represents evolution without disruption, a conservative reformer steering Japan toward strength through discipline rather than social revolution.</p>\n\n<p>Looking ahead, Takaichi’s Japan will likely be defined by fiscal assertiveness, strategic nationalism and technological revival. Her administration will pour resources into semiconductor production, renewable energy and defense manufacturing under the banner of “economic security.” </p>\n<p>This will deepen Japan’s integration with Western economies while reducing its exposure to Chinese markets. Over time, Tokyo may emerge as a manufacturing hub and a geopolitical anchor, a democratic power balancing Washington and Beijing in Asia’s shifting order.</p>\n<p>The true test for Japan’s Iron Lady will be whether she can convert symbolic history into sustainable progress. Managing a weak yen, an aging population and fragile coalitions will demand pragmatism and resolve. Yet her brand of determined leadership may give Japan the clarity it has long lacked.</p>\n\n<p>Takaichi’s rise is not a revolution. It is the continuation of Japan’s long search for identity, between pacifism and assertiveness, tradition and renewal. But for the first time in history, that search will be guided by a woman whose strength could reshape how Tokyo defines power in Asia.</p>\n<p><em>Ronny P.

Approximately <a href=\"https://justicegap.lsc.gov/resource/section-2-todays-low-income-america/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">50 million Americans</a> have household incomes below 125 percent of the poverty threshold. The Justice Gap study found that low-income Americans do not get adequate legal assistance in <a href=\"https://justicegap.lsc.gov/resource/executive-summary/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">92 percent of civil cases</a>, which often involve securing and protecting basic needs.</p>\n\n<p>What can we do to improve civil representation for low-income Americans? Responsible use of artificial intelligence may be the answer. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>A January 2025 article in the <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/llr/vol57/iss4/2/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review</a> said AI can potentially enhance access to legal aid services. The article referenced <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3210&amp;context=llr\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a study</a> revealing that 21 percent of participating legal aid professionals are already using AI tools to complete routine tasks, freeing them to focus on more complex matters. Because many civil cases involve completing standardized forms, drafting routine letters, or explaining legal documents in plain language, low-income Americans should be able to access such basic services at little to no cost through an AI bot.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the study identified risks such as inaccurate results and <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3210&amp;context=llr\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hallucinations</a> — “the confident generation by AI tools of inaccurate results, such as nonexistent case citations, inaccurate legal information, and incorrect information about court procedures or deadlines.” However, it is difficult to estimate the gravity of potential problems associated with such hallucinations.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The Loyola article cited a separate <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jla/article/16/1/64/7699227?login=false\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2024 research study</a> whose authors found that “LLMs hallucinate between 58 percent (ChatGPT 4) and 88 percent (Llama 2) of the time.” For this reason alone, AI should not be relied upon to make significant legal decisions or recommendations resulting in fines or jail time.</p>\n<p>Regulation is needed at every jurisdictional level, or AI could easily do more harm than good. However, AI can still deliver tremendous benefits to low-income Americans by lowering the cost of basic legal support. Tasks like translating lease agreements into plain English or guiding tenants through standard court forms are well within AI’s current capabilities. For many Americans, these seemingly small actions could mean the difference between stability and crisis. </p>\n<p>Will AI replace junior attorneys altogether? According to <a href=\"https://assets.bbhub.io/bna/sites/18/2024/06/2024-Legal-Ops-and-Tech-Survey.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg Law’s Legal Ops and Tech Survey</a>, “With investment for legal technology as part of budgeting plans, respondents agree that there will be a reorganization of roles to accommodate the shift towards new tech.” This indicates that we are more likely to see a change in work roles rather than a complete restructuring of the legal profession. Only time will tell how AI may affect attorneys overall. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n\n<p>Although the future of law remains an important concern, the greater current risk to society is the continuation of a system in which millions of Americans cannot afford basic assistance for civil legal matters. The hope, however tenuous, is that AI can improve this metric by acting as a form of legal triage. An AI bot can act as frontline support to screen cases, answer simple questions, and navigate someone toward professional assistance when necessary. </p>\n<p>The alternative is to maintain the status quo, where the overwhelming majority of low-income Americans face civil matters without any legal representation. </p>\n<p><em>Michelle Mikhels is editor-in-chief of the NYU Undergraduate Law Review.</em> </p>\n</div>",
