            "description": "<p>Denver Mayor Mike Johnston (D) on Thursday announced that federal <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5143719-denver-public-schools-dhs-ice-policy-trump-immigration-crackdown/\">immigration agents</a> are banned from city property while also mandating Denver law enforcement to protect protesters.</p>\n<p>Johnston issued the ban via an executive order. The order mandates that Denver police and sheriff’s deputies document federal immigration officers with body cameras, give life-saving aid to someone harmed by federal officers and “to intervene in instances of force that could cause death or serious bodily injury by immigration enforcement agents,” among other provisions. </p>\n<p>“We seek not to provoke but to protect,” Johnston said in a <a href=\"https://denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Mayors-Office/News/2026/Executive-Order-152\">statement</a>. “In a time of great fear, we are reminding Denverites that there are still those you can trust and lines you can’t cross. Our law enforcement and legal teams will stand up for civil liberties, and, if necessary, step in to protect the life and safety of our residents.</p>\n<p>“This is our city, and we will defend the rights of every person in it,” he added.</p>\n<p>A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson called the executive order “legally illiterate.”</p>\n<p>“Enforcing federal immigration laws is a clear federal responsibility under Article I, Article II and the Supremacy Clause,” the spokesperson said in a statement to The Hill. “While Mayor Johnston continues to release pedophiles, rapists, gang members, and murderers onto their streets, our brave law enforcement will continue to risk their lives to arrest these heinous criminals and make Denver safe again.”</p>\n<p>The order <strong>is</strong> symbolic, as Denver and the state of Colorado do not have the power to stop federal immigration officers from conducting operations, even in the face of the state’s sanctuary laws.</p>\n<p>Johnston’s executive order comes amid President Trump’s immigration crackdown in Democratic-led states. His deportation agenda faced major pushback in Minnesota, after officials accused the administration of federal overreach. </p>\n<p>This was exacerbated by the shooting deaths of two U.S. citizens, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, in Minneapolis last month, which led to further outcry after Trump administration officials accused them of “domestic terrorism.”</p>\n<p>Other states have acted on how local law enforcement will interact with ICE. Earlier this month, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) signed into law a bill banning cooperation agreements between sheriffs and ICE. Wicomico County Sheriff Michael Lewis on Wednesday <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5758182-ice-maryland-sheriffs-law-enforcement/\">accused the new law</a> of putting “politics over public safety.”</p>\n<p>Democratic lawmakers called for dramatic reform within DHS and for ICE. Some House Democrats backed an appropriations bill to fund DHS last month. Pretti’s death drew Democratic senators away from the backing the bill, resulting in an ongoing shutdown.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5751540-maryland-challenges-ice-detention/\">ICE</a>) and Maryland sheriffs on Thursday slammed a new state law that bars cooperation agreements between federal immigration officers and local authorities.</p>\n<p>ICE accused Maryland lawmakers of allowing Americans to become “hurt or, worse, killed by criminal aliens,” the agency <a href=\"https://x.com/ICEgov/status/2027135506560000371\">posted</a> on the social platform X. The post included a video of Wicomico County Sheriff Michael Lewis describing the new law as “politics over public safety,” a video also shared by the White House’s <a href=\"https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2027048640183726275\">Rapid Response X profile.</a></p>\n<p>“And we, as elected sheriffs, are fed up with it,” he said, adding that he and other sheriffs “have to come together in unison to stop the ridiculousness that’s going on up here in Annapolis, Maryland. Lawmakers need to wake up and realize the American people want public safety over politics, and they’re not getting it!”</p>\n<p>Sheriffs from seven Maryland counties gathered in Annapolis on Wednesday to speak out against another bill, the Community Trust Act, that would restrict ICE’s interaction with local police even further, <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/2026/02/25/maryland-sheriffs-opposition-immigration-bills/\">The Baltimore Sun</a> reported. </p>\n<p>The bill would prohibit local police from investigating or arresting a person based on their citizenship status and would prevent them from notifying or transferring potential suspects to ICE without a warrant.</p>\n<p>Gov. Wes Moore (D) signed a law banning 287(g) agreements in the state, which allows ICE to deputize local law enforcement officers to carry out immigration enforcement. In the two weeks since it became law, local sheriffs have vowed to continue working with ICE in an informal capacity, which could soon also be prohibited.</p>\n<p>“Federal law enforcement handcuffs are considerably larger than state police handcuffs, than sheriff’s deputies’ handcuffs, than local law enforcement handcuffs,” Lewis said, according to the Sun. “Who are we to tell them how to do their job?”</p>\n<p>Even Moore’s predecessor, former Gov. Larry Hogan (R), said that local police will “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5746598-hogan-moore-ice-law-dispute/\">ignore</a>” the new law. </p>\n<p>“So I get the whole, you know, overreach and overstep and doing the wrong things, but, you know, when they have violent criminals that they’re holding in jail that ICE wants to be detained, they, you know, they shouldn’t be let back on the street,” Hogan said at Politico Live’s “Governors Summit.” “So there’s two sides to this argument.”</p>\n<p>Moore <a href=\"https://governor.maryland.gov/news/press/pages/Governor-Moore-Signs-Legislation-to-Prohibit-Maryland-Jurisdictions-from-Deputizing-Officers-for-Federal-Civil-Immigration-.aspx\">previously said</a> the new law “draws a clear line: we will continue to work with federal partners to hold violent offenders accountable, but we refuse to blur the lines between state and federal authority in ways that undermine the trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.”</p>\n<p>Moore and other Democrats have accused ICE officers of breaking the law in recent months, citing an excessive use of force and racial discrimination. And after two U.S. citizens were killed by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis last month, the Maryland governor and others have also condemned the actions by the Department of Homeland Security’s agencies.</p>\n<p>Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) last month called for “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5695169-van-hollen-ice-reform-criticism/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dramatic reform</a>” within ICE and accused ICE officers of breaking the law and acting “completely lawless.”</p>",

            "description": "<p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Thursday criticized questions she said she got from House Republicans about UFOs and the “Pizzagate” conspiracy <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5756577-clintons-questioned-epstein-links/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">during her deposition</a> as part of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee’s investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>\n<p>“It then got, at the end, quite unusual because I started being asked about UFOs and a series of questions about Pizzagate — one of the most vile bogus conspiracy theories that was propagated on the internet — that was serving as the basis of a member’s questions to me,” Clinton told reporters after her deposition in Chappaqua, N.Y.</p>\n<p>She added, however, “I want to commend Chairman [James] Comer [R-Ky.] for raising a series of significant questions that I responded to about the nature of the investigation and the areas that I thought should be explored. So I appreciated that, I want to see the truth come out. So that was a reassuring way to end a very long, repetitive deposition.” </p>\n<p>Clinton said she answered “every one” of the committee’s questions as fully as she could based on what she knew.</p>\n<p>“I thought it was very repetitive,” Clinton later said. “I thought that they literally asked the same questions over and over again, which didn’t seem to me to be very productive. And then, as I said toward the end, there were several questions that were off-subject.”</p>\n<p>She said she never met with Epstein and that she knew his associate Ghislaine Maxwell “casually, as an aquaintance.” </p>\n<p>She later said she was confident that the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) files related to Epstein do not reveal anything that suggests her husband, former President Clinton, knew about Epstein’s crimes. </p>\n<p>Clinton said she will not testify again and slammed the committee for not allowing the hearing to be in public, as she and Bill Clinton had pushed for, saying they could have “spent their day more productively.”</p>\n<p>Rep. Suhas Subramanyam (D-Va.) hinted at the questions Clinton was asked during an appearance on CNN. Anchor Jake Tapper asked if it was true that the questions about UFOs and “Pizzagate” were asked during the deposition. </p>\n<p>“I hope that the transcript will be released within 24 hours,” Subramanyam told Tapper. “I‘m not allowed to say specifics about it, but I will just say that the transcript will be very revealing about that.”</p>\n<p>The Clintons agreed to sit for depositions under threat of being held in contempt of Congress for defying a congressional subpoena. The former president, who flew on Epstein’s plane a few times during the early 2000s and who appears in photos released as part of the Epstein files, is scheduled to sit for a deposition Friday.</p>\n<p>Controversy <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5757287-hillary-clinton-deposition-boebert-photo/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">boiled over earlier in the deposition</a> Thursday after Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) leaked a photo from inside the room, which was against the rules set out for the interview. Oversight Democrats called it “unnacceptable” that Republicans broke “their own committee rules that they established with the Secretary and her team,” ranking member Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) said.</p>\n<p>When later asked about the photo, Boebert made a reference to the FBI’s investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server while serving in the Obama administration. The issue became a key controversy during the final stretch of her 2016 presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>“I just returned to my hotel room and installed the BleachBit software … So, I guess in regards to taking photos, I do not recall,” Boebert quipped to reporters.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Netflix on Thursday said it would not match a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5757758-paramount-hostile-bid-warner-discovery/\">bid from Paramount</a> seeking to acquire Warner Brothers Discovery, the sprawling media empire that includes legacy brands in news and entertainment like CNN and HBO.</p>\n<p>News of the streamer bowing out of its deal with Warner Bros. Discovery came just minutes after the David Zaslav-led company said it considered the hostile bid mounted by Paramount to be a “superior” offer to the one it struck with the streamer <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5652023-netflix-warner-deal-paramount-bid/\">late last year</a>.</p>\n<p>Netflix’s deal would have given the streamer control of Warner Bros. Discovery’s premier movie and television studios at a price of more than $70 billion.</p>\n<p>“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” Netflix said in a statement. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.” </p>\n<p>Paramount’s bid, which seeks to purchase the entire Warner Bros. Discovery portfolio including its linear television assets like CNN and TNT Sports, comes with a purchase price of $31 per share in cash, as well as a $7 billion regulatory termination fee for the previous deal with Netflix.</p>\n<p>Paramount was sold last year to Skydance, the rapidly growing media conglomerate owned by Larry Ellison, an ally of President Trump and one of the richest people on earth. </p>\n<p>Since the sale, led by Larry’s son David Ellison, Paramount has worked to implement sweeping changes to the company’s news and entertainment divisions at CBS.</p>\n<p>The company has vowed to retool its news coverage and entertainment content offerings to appeal to a more politically diverse customer base, a sentiment many elected Democrats and media critics have warned signals as a rightward shift at the legacy media giant. </p>\n<p>“We are pleased WBD’s Board has unanimously affirmed the superior value of our offer, which delivers to WBD shareholders superior value, certainty and speed to closing,” David Ellison said in a statement on Thursday.</p>\n<p>A merger between Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery would require approval by President Trump’s Justice Department, which earlier this month ousted the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5735535-gail-slater-leaves-doj-antitrust/\">head of its antitrust division</a>.</p>\n<p>Trump has spoken positively about the Ellison’s efforts to retool CBS under Paramount, and said he wishes to see CNN operate under new ownership. </p>\n<p>As Paramount mounted its hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, the president and his allies railed against Netflix over what they argued is left-leaning bias at the streamer, while some Democrats on Capitol Hill raised anti-trust concerns about the proposed merger. </p>\n<p>“Netflix’s business is healthy, strong and growing organically, powered by our slate and best-in-class streaming service,” the company said. “This year, we’ll invest approximately $20 billion in quality films and series and will expand our entertainment offering. Consistent with our capital allocation policy, we’ll also resume our share repurchase program.”</p>",

This report was conducted between August 2021 and August 2023.</p>\n<p>Between 1988 and 1994, when the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/hestat112.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">second report</a> was being surveyed, researchers found that almost 23 percent of adults 20 years and older were found to be obese. Of that number, 2.8 percent had severe obesity, and 33.1 percent were deemed overweight.</p>\n<p>The researchers relied on heights and weights established by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to monitor and track years-long trends. Surveying for both reports was paused starting in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and resumed in August 2021.</p>\n<p>Professor David Ludwig of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health called the rate levels “exceptionally concerning.” He noted in <a href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/rising-childhood-obesity-exceptionally-concerning-says-expert/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a report</a> published by the school that obesity rates were previously on a decline for children between 2 and 5 years old in the 2010s, something he said was a “glimmer of hope.” What reached down to 9.4 percent between 2013 and 2014 jumped to a 14.9 percent obesity rate.</p>\n<p>“We saw that dip [in 2014] and we all got excited thinking that we were beginning to turn the tide,” Ludwig said in the report. “In retrospect, that was more of a statistical aberration, more of mirage than a true glimmer of hope because the trend overall has continued upward.”</p>\n<p>The reports also show that adult obesity rates may be slowing as a result of public health policies and the introduction of GLP-1 agonists. </p>\n<p>“I do think the advent of the GLP-1s are absolutely playing a role,” Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children’s Hospital, told <a href=\"https://abcnews.com/Health/us-child-teen-obesity-rates-reach-record-high/story?id=130441952\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ABC News</a>. “At that point in 2023, they weren’t as widespread as they are today. So, we expect that these factors could play even more significant role in more recent times.”</p>\n<p>The new data comes months after Gallup found that the country’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5578724-glp-1-weight-loss/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">obesity rate declined</a> in the last three years as a result of Americans using GLP-1 agonists for weight loss. Pollsters, however, noted that this was likely a “vanity effect” accounting for Gallup’s slightly lower obesity rates on average when compared with randomized clinical measurements.</p>",

Our strong preference is to continue to serve the Department and our warfighters—with our two requested safeguards in place.”</p>\n<p>The Pentagon said earlier on Thursday that it has “no interest in using AI to conduct mass surveillance of Americans (which is illegal) nor do we want to use AI to develop autonomous weapons that operate without human involvement.”</p>\n<p>“Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” Sean Parnell, chief Pentagon spokesperson , wrote in a post on the social platform X. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”</p>\n<p>The Pentagon’s latest proposal, which came less than 48 hours before the proposed deadline, included some of the Anthropic’s suggested language around narrow exceptions to the autonomous and surveillance provisions, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Hill on Thursday.  </p>\n<p>But substantively, the DOD offer reverts to permitting any lawful use while adding qualifiers where they see fit to the autonomy provision and all other applicable guidelines to the surveillance provision, the source briefed on the talks said.  </p>\n<p>The source argued that the additions are made to look like concessions, but ultimately give the other side the ability sideline restrictions whenever necessary.  </p>\n<p>They also accused the Pentagon of strategically leaking information to news outlets make it appear to be engaging in good-faith negotiations. </p>\n<p><em>Updated at 6:34 p.m. EST</em></p>",
