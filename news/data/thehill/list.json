Amid significant employee concerns for medical privacy, Google retracted this policy, making disclosure optional. But worker medical privacy remains under attack nationally. </p>\n<p>Despite over <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/iif/#:~:text=The%20Injuries%2C%20Illnesses%2C%20and%20Fatalities%20%28IIF%29%20program%20produces,and%20the%20Census%20of%20Fatal%20Occupational%20Injuries%20%28CFOI%29.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2.5 million job-related injuries and illnesses annually</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2021/08/06/the-skyrocketing-volume-of-healthcare-data-makes-privacy-imperative/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">proliferation of patient medical information as technology grows</a>, injured workers often do not enjoy medical privacy protections that even prisoners can count on.</p>\n\n<p>This surprising denial of medical privacy is the result of our current approach to workers’ compensation. State constitutional and statutory privacy protections may not apply to workers who file for workers’ compensation. And federal medical privacy protections are judicially construed to exempt workers’ compensation processes. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>As a result, injured workers — many with severe disabilities — face a difficult choice: file for workers’ compensation benefits for their injuries or else protect their medical privacy. </p>\n<p>The situation is different for almost all other patients who seek medical care. The <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act’s privacy rule</a> requires that physicians who maintain electronic health or billing records must protect “<a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-C/part-160/subpart-A/section-160.103\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">individually identifiable health information</a>.”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Such information includes diagnoses and even demographic information, such as residential addresses, which may be used to identify a patient. Outside patient treatment, disclosures are often limited to the “<a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-C/part-164\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">minimum necessary</a>.” The goal is to protect patients from unwanted disclosures that may be stigmatizing or otherwise harmful.</p>\n<p>Medical disclosures may indeed prove very stigmatizing. Without protection, unrelated medical information such as mental health information could be prejudicially used to deny workers’ compensation claims. Stigmatizing information could be disclosed to third parties affecting future employment and insurability. Prejudicial communications may also occur between employers and their agents and treating physicians. </p>\n<p>In fact, these types of disclosures <a href=\"https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/ga-supreme-court/1525927.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">are routinely outlawed in medical malpractice</a> and employment discrimination claims due to the potential harms they may cause. </p>\n\n<p>Further, lack of medical privacy for workplace injuries is especially concerning because, in most states, workers cannot sue their employers for their injuries and may only obtain <a href=\"https://scholarlycommons.law.emory.edu/faculty-articles/305/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">compensation and medical care for workplace injuries through workers’ compensation</a>.</p>\n<p>How we arrived here is a <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3601896\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">complex story of federalism, judicial interpretation and state inaction.</a> </p>\n<p>States historically protected the privacy of their citizens and administered their own workers’ compensation systems under their 10th Amendment powers. Federal medical privacy regulations thus contain an <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/164.512\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">exception for workers’ compensation</a> that assumes states will address injured workers’ privacy through their own laws. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>This exception has been widely misinterpreted by courts as eliminating federal privacy protections if states fail to act. And states have not filled in the gaps of privacy protection. </p>\n<p>In a 2025 published <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5679122\">survey</a>, states failed to protect workers’ privacy in five areas: scope of disclosure, authorization for disclosure, ex parte communications (i.e., communications between opposing parties and treating physicians), notice of such communications and protective orders (i.e., orders issued by a court to limit the scope of disclosure).</p>\n<p>To be sure, states have the power to administer their own workers’ compensation schemes and must be able to process claims efficiently. Many states impose a limited window on obtaining medical information and distributing benefits. </p>\n\n<p>It would not be in the spirit of the federal medical privacy laws to let workers impede the administration of claims by failing to disclose information or delay its disclosure — perhaps by pressuring their physicians to limit or not disclose relevant medical information. But there is a significant difference between the efficient administration of workers’ compensation claims and voiding medical privacy requirements altogether.</p>\n<p>The solution could be judicial, legislative or both. Courts could adopt the federal privacy standards as a floor for privacy protections, perhaps following clarification from Health and Human Services that the exemption for workers’ compensation was not intended as a waiver of medical privacy.</p>\n<p>States could pass laws consistent with this standard, but responsive to their unique circumstances. If states fail to adopt privacy protections, the federal standards could apply. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n\n<p>Alternatively, states could promulgate their own standards and rules to protect privacy, informed by the best practices of some states.

The amendment would allow the Old Dominion to redraw its House map if another state redraws its lines for a reason that isn’t part of the mandated redistricting process, which happens after every 10-year U.S. Census or in response to litigation over its present map.</p>\n\n<p>The constitutional amendment, if passed, would offer a limited timeline for lawmakers to be able to do mid-cycle redistricting: They would only be allowed to change their congressional lines until Oct. 31, 2030. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The constitutional amendment was quickly taken up in the state Senate, where the Virginia Senate Privileges and Election Committee passed it in an 8-6 vote.

The goal for Democrats is to pass the constitutional amendment ahead of Election Day next week and quickly pass it again early next year during the start of the new legislative session before setting up a vote before Virginians soon afterward, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/us/virginia-congress-redistricting-midterms.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to The New York Times.</a></p>\n\n<p>Texas became the first state to fire off the first salvo in a broader redistricting war before next year’s midterms after much pressure from the White House and national Republicans. Republicans in Missouri and North Carolina have also passed new congressional lines while California Democrats are poised to see new lines with their redistricting ballot measure, Proposition 50, expected to pass next week. </p>\n<p>The redistricting war has become a tit-for-tat, with both parties trying to neutralize potential gains in 2026 as the House represents Democrats’ best chance at flipping one of the chambers of Congress. </p>\n</div>",

In an effort to bring Putin to the negotiating table in Alaska, Trump announced a <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-50-day-deadline-russia-expires-2123116\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">50-day</a> deadline for new sanctions on Russia — a deadline that was soon shortened to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-sets-new-deadline-10-or-12-days-russia-act-ukraine-2025-07-28/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">10 days</a>. </p>\n<p>The gambit appeared to backfire. Not only does the war in Ukraine grind on,<strong> </strong>but the Kremlin has also withdrawn from negotiations, refused further talks and escalated tensions: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c2enwk1l9e1t\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">19 Russian drones</a> were detected over Poland, several more <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80g7g5rmlno\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">intercepted</a> over Romania and three fighter jets entered Estonian airspace for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czrp6p5mj3zo\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">12 minutes</a>.

For decades, Russia has leveraged its energy resources as a political weapon. </p>\n\n<p>After meeting with Trump in Alaska, Putin said the war will not end until the “<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0q964851po\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">root causes</a>” are addressed, echoing his long-held grievances over NATO expansion and Ukraine’s Western alignment. </p>\n<p>Those root causes — denial of Ukraine’s sovereignty and a demand for a Russian sphere of influence — have defined his justification for war since 2014, yet none can be addressed without weakening Ukraine or NATO.</p>\n<p>After three and a half years of war, Russia remains one of the world’s most heavily sanctioned countries.

Yet allies must do far more to help bring an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>First of all, allies must follow through on their commitments to Ukraine’s air defense, including Trump’s widely reported promise of <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/15/will-patriots-promised-by-trump-boost-ukraines-defence-against-russia\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">17 Patriot missile systems</a>, a pledge that has seen little public follow-up.</p>\n<p>The U.S. and the European Union must <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/eu-readies-ban-russian-gas-imports-by-end-2027-2025-06-17/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ban</a> Russian energy and impose sanctions on its importers. Russian exports to third countries must be prohibitively costly. </p>\n\n<p>Targeting most of the 600 vessels in Russia’s so-called shadow fleet is necessary. As of mid-2025, the EU has <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/an-update-on-the-efficacy-of-sanctions-against-russia/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sanctioned</a> 444 vessels, the United Kingdom 423, while the U.S. remains at 216, having failed to sanction a single new tanker under the current administration.</p>\n<p>Western corporations should face pressure to withdraw from Russian ventures. Many global enterprises <a href=\"https://som.yale.edu/story/2022/over-1000-companies-have-curtailed-operations-russia-some-remain\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">continue to trade</a> with Russia despite sanctions, exploiting loopholes enabled by weak enforcement and oversight. For years, Moscow has used these partnerships to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/exxon-mobile-russia-sanctions-rex-tillerson-232770\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">lobby</a> against sanctions.</p>\n<p>Sanctions lists against Russian oligarchs must be synchronized.

Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/six-defendants-indicted-alleged-conspiracy-bribe-government-officials-india-mine-titanium\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">indicted</a> by the U.S. in 2014 for bribery and racketeering and long linked to the Kremlin, remains in Austria, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/austria-dymitro-firtash-court-extradition-chicago-4cd7c4ef23b8ef04a85953ca47b91906\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">avoiding</a> extradition.</p>\n<p>Western allies should back Ukraine’s EU and NATO aspirations, recognizing its advances in drone <a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/55897\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">warfare</a> and defense innovation.

But this year, there is a new city being crowned the “rattiest” — Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Orkin cites that growing warm climates can help a rat’s survivability rate, so hotter cities are seeing themselves fly up the rankings, giving Los Angeles the slight edge over Chicago this year.</p>\n<p>Chicago falls to No. 2 in the rankings, followed by New York and San Francisco.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Rounding out the top five is Hartford, Conn., which wasn’t even listed in the top 10 in last year’s rankings</p>\n<p>Here’s <a href=\"https://www.orkin.com/press-room/worst-cities-for-rats-los-angeles\">Orkin’s</a> full list of the top 25 “rattiest” cities in the U.S.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><th><strong>Rank</strong></th><th><strong>City</strong></th><th><strong>Number of spots moved since 2024</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.</td><td>Los Angeles</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Chicago</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>New York</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>San Francisco</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>Hartford, Conn.</td><td>+8</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td>Washington, D.C.</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>7.</td><td>Detroit</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>8.</td><td>Philadelphia</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>9.</td><td>Minneapolis</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>10.</td><td>Denver</td><td>-4</td></tr><tr><td>11.</td><td>Cleveland</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>12.</td><td>Baltimore</td><td>-3</td></tr><tr><td>13.</td><td>Boston</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>14.</td><td>Indianapolis</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>15.</td><td>Dallas</td><td>+7</td></tr><tr><td>16.</td><td>Milwaukee</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>17.</td><td>Seattle</td><td>-3</td></tr><tr><td>18.</td><td>Atlanta</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>19.</td><td>Sacramento, Calif.</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>20.</td><td>Pittsburgh</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>21.</td><td>Columbus</td><td>-4</td></tr><tr><td>22.</td><td>Tampa, Fla.</td><td>+13</td></tr><tr><td>23.</td><td>Houston</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>24.</td><td>San Diego</td><td>-6</td></tr><tr><td>25.</td><td>Grand Rapids, Mich.</td><td>+2</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">(<a href=\"https://www.orkin.com/press-room/worst-cities-for-rats-los-angeles\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Orkin</a>)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>To view the full list and see if your city has a rat problem, visit Orkin’s website for the <a href=\"https://www.orkin.com/press-room/worst-cities-for-rats-los-angeles\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">complete report</a>.</p>\n</div>",
