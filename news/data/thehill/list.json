They’ve missed four paychecks. How many of them are not going to show up for work?” he continued. “You take the TSA lines that are already too long, even right now, and say half of those people don’t show up for work.

We are the last great superpower on the earth. China intends to be a near peer-to-peer advisory to us. But in order to maintain peace around the world, you have to show strength, and that’s what the president believes in. That’s what he’s demonstrated over and over,” Johnson told reporters on Thursday morning.</p>\n\n<p>“So the idea that he would make a public statement stating that he would want our nuclear arsenal to be fully prepared, it’s a deterrent, and that’s an important show of force for us,” Johnson said.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href=\"http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/78301\">confirmed</a> the Kremlin had <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5580076-markey-calls-nuclear-disarmament/\">resumed nuclear weapons testing</a> and by Wednesday said they’d successfully tested both the nuclear-powered cruise missile and nuclear-powered underwater drone.</p>\n<p>“I say, well, if they’re going to test, I guess we have to test,” the president told reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>China has also doubled the size of its nuclear arsenal in the past five years, according to the <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/parading-chinas-nuclear-arsenal-out-shadows\">Center for Strategic International Studies</a>.

It’s home to two-thirds of the nuclear triad and global strike command there. I can tell you, they are ready and they are on the ready, but we need to have that as a daily reminder and a daily process,” Johnson continued. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>“And so, I’m glad that we have a president who understands the necessity of that. I think it sends a strong message to our adversaries around the world. And it’s an important time to do that,” he added. </p>\n<p>Trump’s announcement Thursday has been met with criticism from peace organizations and advocates who say the resumption of nuclear testing will poorly impact the U.S.</p>\n<p>“By foolishly announcing his intention resume nuclear testing, Trump will trigger strong public opposition in Nevada, from all U.S. allies, and it could trigger a chain reaction of nuclear testing by U.S. adversaries, and blow apart the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty,” Daryl Kimball, Director of Arms Control Association, wrote in a <a href=\"https://x.com/DarylGKimball/status/1983716991421571322\">Thursday statement</a> on X.</p>\n\n<p>He said it would take at least 36 months to resume contained nuclear tests underground at the former test site in Nevada.</p>\n<p>“Note: Trump’s post is not clear about whether he is talking about n-explosive testing (which the NNSA would do) or flight testing of n-capable missiles (which the DoD does). Trump’s policy is incoherent: calling for denuclearization talks one day; threatening n-tests the next,” he added in a <a href=\"https://x.com/DarylGKimball/status/1983725406583701731\">follow up post</a>.</p>\n</div>",

Three percent said they were undecided while both longshot candidates — Socialist Worker Party candidate Joanne Kuniansky and Libertarian Party candidate Vic Kaplan – each received 1 percent. </p>\n\n<p>The polling offers a minor shift from the last poll Quinnipiac University released earlier this month, which showed Ciattarelli at 44 percent and Sherrill at 50 percent.  </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The poll offers several other bright spots for Sherrill. For one, Sherrill enjoys a higher favorability rating, 47 percent, compared to Ciattarelli at 43 percent. Ciattarelli also has a higher unfavorable rating, 47 percent, than Sherrill at 38 percent. More people haven’t heard of Sherrill, 13 percent, than Ciattarelli at 9 percent.</p>\n<p>The latest Quinnipiac University poll found that term-limited New Jersey Gov.

That was followed by ethics in government at 16 percent and health care at 14 percent.  </p>\n<p>Sherrill and Ciattarelli are vying for Murphy’s seat on Tuesday to helm the Garden State. The race has turned increasingly competitive in the final stretch as more voters are tuning into the race and both campaigns bring in last-minute surrogates to rally their bases.  </p>\n\n<p>The poll shows Sherrill with a more comfortable lead over her GOP opponent compared to most recent public polls, which have shown her leading by less than 8 percent. An Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill survey <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5579199-sherrill-ciattarelli-nj-governor/\">released on Thursday</a> showed Sherrill barely edging out Ciattarelli 49 percent to 48 percent, well within the poll’s margin of error. </p>\n<p>A Decision Desk HQ polling <a href=\"https://polls.decisiondeskhq.com/averages/general-ballot-test/new-jersey/lv-rv-adults\">average of surveys</a> on the race shows Sherrill at 50 percent while Ciattarelli is at 45 percent.  </p>\n<p>The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted between Oct. 23 and Oct. 28 with 1,166 New Jersey likely voters surveyed.

He blamed a miscommunication — “I hadn’t adequately communicated to my staff the depth of my opposition to this bill,” he said in his remarks — and the belief that another senator opposed to the bill would object. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Cotton’s objection to Scott’s bill has again delayed any immediate changes to the biannual practice, at least for now. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5464355-daylight-saving-time-which-states-want-to-stop-changing-the-clocks/\">Several states, meanwhile, have considered legislation</a> this year to stop changing the clocks, though efforts are largely split between permanent daylight saving time and permanent standard time. </p>\n<p>Nearly half of respondents in a recent poll say they are <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/5581203-daylight-saving-time-poll/\">“somewhat” or “strongly” opposed</a> to changing the clocks twice a year.
