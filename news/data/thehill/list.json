            "description": "<p>Republican Sen. Thom Tillis (N.C.) is asking why Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law, and Steve Witkoff, a Trump ally who made his fortune in real estate, are leading peace talks with Russia, Iran and Israel, given their general lack of foreign policy experience and the fact that they never underwent formal Senate confirmation proceedings.</p>\n<p>Tillis told ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl that peace talks to resolve the violence in Ukraine and Gaza and another potential conflict with Iran should not be led by Kushner and Witkoff.</p>\n<p>“Kushner and Witkoff are very accomplished businesspeople. I’m sure they’re good negotiators, but they’re not subject to Senate confirmation, and they’re not subject to oversight,” <a href=\"https://x.com/jonkarl/status/2026762357058175196\">Tillis told Karl</a>.</p>\n<p>The outspoken GOP senator said putting Kushner and Witkoff in charge of high-stakes foreign policy and national security negotiations “doesn’t make any sense.”</p>\n<p>“It is suspect that you can negotiate an Ukraine peace, an Iranian situation, a Gaza situation, and whatever, and be the same two people. That doesn’t make any sense to me,” Tillis said.</p>\n<p>Democrats on Capitol Hill have also criticized Kushner’s high-profile role given his limited experience in foreign policy matters and have raised concerns about the $2 billion in investment his company, Affinity Partners, received from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund.</p>\n<p>Democrats have also criticized Witkoff’s family business dealings, particularly his role in co-founding World Liberty Financial (WLF), a cryptocurrency company, with his sons and members of Trump’s family. Democrats raised alarms after a United Arab Emirates-backed firm invested $2 billion in WLF’s stablecoin.</p>\n<p>Senate Democrats Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Chris Murphy (Conn.) raised alarms after Witkoff said he stepped away from the company prior to becoming Trump’s special envoy.</p>\n<p>Kushner and Witkoff were <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5755665-live-updates-trump-iran-hillary-clinton/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in Geneva on Thursday</a> to negotiate a deal with Iran to end its nuclear weapons program, talks that could determine whether Trump orders missile strikes against Iran in the near future. The special envoys met with Oman’s foreign minister, a broker in the talks.</p>\n<p>The meetings come only days after Witkoff and Kushner participated in talks to end the war in Ukraine and to set up Trump’s “Board of Peace” to maintain stability and order in Gaza.</p>",

In a separate statement, Adams said the call was a typical meeting between federal officials and secretaries of state. </p>\n<p>“FBI, DOJ, DHS and other national agencies reminded us of the resources they make available to help us election officials do our job,” he wrote. “They reaffirmed state officials’ primary role in the election process, and noted that they take domestic threats, including threats to election officials, just as seriously as they take cyber threats from foreign nations.”</p>\n<p>DHS’s assurance follows President Trump’s declaration that he would like to “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5719458-trump-suggests-republican-voting-takeover/\">nationalize</a>” federal elections <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5722063-donald-trump-state-elections-nationalization/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5722063-donald-trump-state-elections-nationalization/\">in over a dozen states</a>, sparking <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5721428-trump-nationalize-election-backlash/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5721428-trump-nationalize-election-backlash/\">fears</a> among Democratic leaders and <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5722041-rand-paul-trump-call-to-nationalize-elections/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5722041-rand-paul-trump-call-to-nationalize-elections/\">push back</a> from some <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5720386-thune-trump-federal-elections/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5720386-thune-trump-federal-elections/\">Republican lawmakers</a>.</p>\n<p>Democratic Sen.

Could those ICE roving vans be used to try to go and intimidate voters at the polling station?” Warner asked earlier this month in an episode of the “The Contrarian” podcast. </p>\n<p>He added at the time, “These are all things that, you know, sounded maybe way out or draconian a year ago or a year and a half ago, but they are at our front door right now.”</p>\n<p>The questions come as the Trump administration <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5709357-kristi-noem-criticism-minneapolis-shooting/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5709357-kristi-noem-criticism-minneapolis-shooting/\">faces heat</a> over tactics ICE uses when enforcing Trump’s sweeping deportation agenda.

            "description": "<p>The Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/27419547-25a952/\">asked the Supreme Court</a> Thursday to allow it to end temporary protections extended to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5513158-syrian-deportation-protections-end/\">more than 6,000 Syrians</a>. </p>\n<p>It marks <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5537995-supreme-court-ends-venezuelan-protections/\">the third time</a> the administration has urged the justices to rein in lower courts that have blocked the administration from restricting Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which provides individuals from countries with unsafe conditions protections against deportation and a pathway to apply for work authorization. </p>\n<p>“The Second Circuit’s ruling is indefensible,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote to the justices. “It flouts this Court’s two prior stays of materially similar orders in materially similar postures.” </p>\n<p>Beyond an immediate intervention allowing the termination to move forward, Sauer called on the justices to take up the case on their normal docket and settle the broader legal issues “so this cycle does not repeat a fourth, fifth, or sixth time.” </p>\n<p>Since taking office, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has looked to restrict TPS for various countries. Lawsuits have been filed over changes to TPS for Afghanistan, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Haiti, Honduras, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, South Sudan and Venezuela. </p>\n<p>The battle over Venezuela is what reached the Supreme Court on the two prior occasions. Each time, the court <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5307670-trump-administration-ends-tps/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">issued emergency orders</a> in <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5537995-supreme-court-ends-venezuelan-protections/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Noem’s favor</a>.  </p>\n<p>Noem <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5513158-syrian-deportation-protections-end/\">announced last fall</a> she would be terminating Syria’s TPS designation, pointing to the fall of the Assad regime and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5595883-trump-syrian-leader-visit/\">the administration’s embrace</a> of Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa.  </p>\n<p>The termination was set to take effect in November. </p>\n<p>After a group of Syrian TPS holders sued, U.S. District Judge Katherine Failla agreed to block the administration from ending TPS for Syria. The appointee of former President Obama ruled the termination likely illegal because it failed to adequately consult other agencies and rested on undue political influence. </p>\n<p>The administration turned to the Supreme Court after an appeals court declined to lift Failla’s ruling. It argues judges have no authority to second-guess Noem’s judgment and that she followed the law.</p>\n<p>The Hill has reached out for comment from the International Refugee Assistance Project, which represents the plaintiffs. </p>\n<p>The filing marks the second Trump administration’s 33rd emergency application at the Supreme Court, a staggering number. Trump’s critics contend it reflects how officials have repeatedly flouted the law, while the administration says it’s responding to lower courts overstepping to block Trump’s agenda.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Last Nov. 18, six members of Congress — all Democrats and all former military or intelligence veterans — posted a 90-second video in which they urged active military personnel to not obey illegal orders.</p>\n<p>The six members included Sens. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), and Reps. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), Chris Deluzio (D-Pa.), Maggie Goodlander (D-N.H.), and Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.).</p>\n<p>They knew exactly what they were doing. Although the video was not explicit about what illegal orders they had in mind, it is generally understood they were incensed by President Trump’s decisions to bomb alleged drug-running boats in the Caribbean and to deploy National Guard troops in American cities to help round-up illegal immigrants. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title10-section892&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Article 92</a> of the Uniform Code of Military Justice makes clear that service members must obey lawful orders or face potential serious punishment, including court martial. The article also makes clear that members of the armed forces may not only refuse to obey a manifestly illegal order, but have a duty to do so. The courts have held that for an order to be considered manifestly illegal, the unlawfulness must be clear and obvious, such as targeting civilians.</p>\n<p>The six video contributors were quite aware that their social media posting would likely anger Trump. Two days later, on Nov. 20, the president lashed out at the lawmakers, saying they should be arrested and tried for sedition: “TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP?????.” In a subsequent post the president left no doubt as to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-military-traitors-sedition-illegal-orders-c5fc3c5bd2fbc6b1204550e4203c24b2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">where he stood</a>: “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH.”</p>\n<p>Trump’s outrage was quickly absorbed by his loyal lieutenants at the departments of Justice and Defense. At Justice, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro convened a grand jury to indict the six members for their conduct. Due to grand jury secrecy, the specific charges were not made known, even to the accused members. In short order, though, the 20-person grand jury <a href=\"http://Jeanine%20Pirro,%20convened%20a%20grand%20jury%20to%20indict%20the%20six%20members%20for%20their%20conduct\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rejected Pirro’s request for an indictment</a>.</p>\n<p>Meantime, the Department of Defense was going full bore on investigating and punishing Kelly, but not the other five members. As Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth explained, Kelly was the only one of the six who had “formally” retired and therefore was subject to being recalled to duty and punished, even though his alleged offenses occurred after his retirement.</p>\n<p>On Jan. 5, Hegseth issued a “Secretarial Letter of Censure” to Kelly, based on a determination that he had exhibited conduct that is “prejudicial to good order and discipline in the Armed Forces…and [is] unbecoming an officer.”</p>\n<p>Although the Defense secretary downplayed the seriousness of the censure letter as “a necessary process step” to proceedings that could lead to Kelly’s demotion in rank and retirement pay, it is clear from the Code of Military Justice that censure is, in fact, already a finding of guilt and form of punishment.   </p>\n<p>In the censure letter Hegseth elaborated on numerous instances in which Kelly had been critical of administration policies, and accused “me and senior military officers of war crimes and to frame resistance to lawful orders….”</p>\n<p>Hegseth concluded his censure letter by informing Kelly of his “right to submit a written rebuttal. … However, you do not have a right to appeal this administrative action.” After receiving a recommendation from the secretary of the Navy, Hegseth said a determination would be made as to whether Kelly’s rank as captain would be reduced, and, with it, his commensurate retirement benefits.</p>\n<p>Kelly circumvented the meaningless rebuttal that would go nowhere other than into his personal file, and instead filed in the U.S. District Court for D.C. his motion that the censure be blocked. On Feb. 12, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/kelly-hegseth-pentagon-trump-censure.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blocked the Pentagon’s censure</a>, based primarily on grounds that Kelly’s free speech rights had been violated: “This court has all it needs to conclude that defendants have trampled on Senator Kelly’s First Amendment freedoms and threatened the constitutional liberties of millions of military retirees.”  </p>\n<p>Hegseth <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5753909-defense-secretary-appeals-senator-kelly/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">appealed the ruling on Tuesday</a>. Interestingly, Kelly did not emphasize in his own defense his immunity as a senator from being questioned in any other place for any “speech or debate” relating to his official duties in Congress. Moreover, Judge Leon did not highlight that constitutional shield members of Congress enjoy. </p>\n<p>While that additional argument may have some bearing on appeal, Leon and Kelly wanted to make clear that the more important issue is in protecting all Americans from government retribution for their public utterances.</p>\n<p><em>Don Wolfensberger is a 28-year congressional staff veteran culminating as chief of staff of the House Rules Committee in1995.

It remains susceptible to ongoing <a href=\"https://www.pism.pl/publications/nato-and-the-eu-respond-to-russian-maritime-sabotage\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sabotage operations of critical infrastructure</a> — since 2023, Russia damaged at least 11 undersea cables and pipelines — and the most important laboratory to practice hybrid war against NATO and the West.

The Baltic serves as a gateway for Russia into the Atlantic and, more broadly, onto the global stage. </p>\n<p>Given the importance of the Baltic Sea area to the balance of power in the Euro-Atlantic, it should be a major focus of U.S. foreign policy. America must work with like-minded partners and allies to protect the world from falling under the influence and control of Russia, China and Iran. It can do so in the Baltic by having a strategy in place with political, diplomatic, military and economic options to advance its posture in the region. </p>\n<p>Greater military engagement with NATO littoral Baltic Sea states can strengthen deterrence and sea denial strategy in critical areas, including air defense, mine sweeping and antisubmarine warfare, that can hold the region at risk should Russia behave more aggressively there. </p>\n<p>Working closely with Poland is key. Warsaw is tightening its <a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/feature/a-curtain-of-iron-can-contain-russia-in-europe\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">security links with Nordic and Baltic partners</a> while modernizing its naval assets to provide a capable force to defend interests in the Baltic. This is part of Warsaw’s ambitious northern framework policy, which by 2028 aims to host a regional <a href=\"https://dailymare.com/news/polmafor-poland-to-host-natos-new-regional-maritime-command,1852\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NATO maritime command</a> in Gdynia to strengthen the Baltic’s security architecture in cooperation with regional partners, including Germany and Sweden. </p>\n<p>In addition, the U.S. should consider resourcing exportable defense packages to Baltic Sea littoral states (radars, jammers) while enabling the U.S. Navy to rotate mobile hard-defense detachments into the region to work with allies to protect coastlines, commercial assets, and infrastructure and energy arteries. This should include frequent and continuous port calls or maritime operations by cruisers and destroyers as well as smaller ships that can bolster coastal defense capabilities. </p>\n<p>Helping partners ensure freedom of navigation on the Baltic Sea will directly impact trade and commerce, contributing to the prosperity of regional states as well as the U.S. The states in this region are among Europe’s most attractive, up-and-coming trade and business partners — Poland is the first post-communist country to reach <a href=\"https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7786/artykul/3574113,poland-joins-elite-1-trillion-economy-club-as-growth-outpaces-major-powers\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$1 trillion GDP</a> per capita, joining an exclusive group of just 20 nations. </p>\n<p>Engaging in measures further securing the Baltic as Central and Eastern Europe’s energy-import corridor are in Washington’s interest. Regional states are consumers of U.S. liquefied natural gas, which accounts for about <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-share-europes-lng-imports-increased-60-january-2026-01-30/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">60 percent of Europe’s supply</a>.

Strong congressional bipartisan support exists toward the region and littoral states, which are seen as among America’s closest allies. For this reason, Congress should urge the Trump administration to draft a Baltic Sea strategy as a necessary element of the U.S. policy toolbox.</p>\n<p>A free and open Baltic will foster economic and other connectivity between Europe, North America and the world.

            "description": "<p>Børge Brende resigned as president and CEO of the World Economic Forum (WEF) amid revelations regarding his ties to Jeffrey Epstein.</p>\n<p>Brende <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/press/2026/02/press-statement-from-co-chairs-andre-hoffmann-and-larry-fink-on-behalf-of-the-board-of-trustees/\">wrote in a WEF release</a> he decided to step down “after careful consideration” from a role he has occupied since 2017. He did not mention the late convicted sex offender.</p>\n<p>“My time here, spanning 8½ years, has been profoundly rewarding,” Brende added. “We have seen a record number of partners join us, and we have had a very successful Annual Meeting in Davos behind us, where we engaged with governmental leaders from all over the world like never before. </p>\n<p>“I am grateful for the incredible collaboration with my colleagues, partners, and constituents, and I believe now is the right moment for the Forum to continue its important work without distractions.”</p>\n<p>The WEF <a href=\"https://thehill.com/business/5726336-brende-wef-epstein-emails-dinners-probe/\">launched a probe</a> into Brende earlier this month, after documents released by the Department of Justice revealed he attended multiple “business dinners” with Epstein and exchanged emails and <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01612631.pdf\">text messages</a> with the sex offender, years after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to procuring a child for prostitution and soliciting a prostitute.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02258065.pdf\">September 2018</a>, Brende emailed with Lesley Groff, an assistant to Epstein, regarding a dinner at the disgraced financier’s Manhattan home. He also emailed with an assistant to Epstein, whose name is redacted, regarding a dinner at the home in June 2019 — weeks before the convicted sex offender was <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/jeffrey-epstein-charged-manhattan-federal-court-sex-trafficking-minors\">arrested and charged</a> with trafficking minors for sex.</p>\n<p>Brende and Epstein also <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01612631.pdf\">exchanged messages in 2019</a>, with the latter sending the former what appears to be a photo of a woman he called “mss piggy.” In June 2019, Brende told Epstein he just “met your friend POTUS,” seemingly referring to President Trump. The president has denied wrongdoing in connection to Epstein. </p>\n<p>André Hoffmann and Larry Fink, the co-chairs of the WEF, wrote in the release they have “sincere appreciation for Børge Brende’s significant contributions” to the organization. They announced that Alois Zwinggi, a longtime member of the WEF’s managing board, will serve as interim president and CEO. </p>\n<p>“The independent review conducted by outside counsel has concluded.
