            "description": "<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) said Thursday that any military strikes against Iran should result in regime change to effect real change in a country that has long been hostile to the United States and its allies, particularly Israel.</p>\n<p>“In my view, if you’re going to do something there, you better well make it about getting new leadership and regime change,” Thune told reporters.</p>\n<p>“If you’re going to take some sort of action, I think you want to achieve a result that actually brings about the transformational change that I think we want in the region” Thune said.</p>\n<p>The GOP leader made his comments amid growing expectations on Capitol Hill that President Trump will order strikes against Iran in the next few days or weeks if negotiations led by special envoys Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff fail to produce a deal to end Iran’s nuclear weapons program.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has destroyers and aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea to prepare for a possible strike on Iran.</p>\n<p>“The president I don’t think, to my knowledge, has made any decisions  but I think they’re gaming out what contingencies might look like and what’s in our national security interests. Of course, first and foremost is to prevent them from having a nuclear capability but there are also other threats that they represent in the region,” Thune said.</p>\n<p>Trump told lawmakers at the State of the Union address on Tuesday that Iran has resumed its nuclear weapons program and could soon develop a ballistic missile capable of reaching the United States.</p>\n<p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who has spoken to Trump recently, has urged him to take advantage of what he and foreign policy experts view as the growing weakness of Iran’s regime in the aftermath of a bloody crackdown on anti-government protesters.</p>\n<p>“I said, ‘Listen, the regime has never been weaker. They are teetering,’” Cruz told CNBC in an interview Tuesday, recounted, recounting his conversation with Trump.</p>\n<p>“We are at a moment … where in the next six months we could realistically see the regimes in Iran, Venezuela and Cuba all fall and we could see them replaced with governments that want to be friendly with America,” he said.</p>\n<p>“If that happened, that would be the biggest geopolitical shift since the fall of the Berlin Wall,” Cruz argued.</p>",

The federal government pays the full cost. So this should be an easy call for everyone, including Democrats.</p>\n<p>Instead, in a <a href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/01.26.26-Federal-Privatization-of-K12-Education-Report_final.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">report released by the Senate HELP Committee,</a> Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has urged states to reject the federal dollars. In doing so, he is reversing an argument he once made with moral clarity and political force.</p>\n<p>For more than a decade after passage of the Affordable Care Act, Democrats rightly excoriated Republican governors who refused to embrace Medicaid expansion. The logic was straightforward. When the federal government offers states money to help working families, ideological objections are illegitimate. Take the money and help your constituents. Anything else would be putting politics over people.</p>\n<p>Few Democrats made that case more forcefully than Sanders himself. “This is a federal program, which costs zero dollars,” Sanders <a href=\"https://www.idahocountyfreepress.com/opinion/guest-commentary/support-from-planned-parenthood-pelosi-makes-prop-s-medicaid-expansion/article_2f77b4fb-b37f-540c-8198-b660cb7417b1.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">argued in 2013</a>, criticizing Republicans who rejected Medicaid expansion. He was right. Refusing federal dollars to help struggling families was indefensible.</p>\n<p>Yet that is precisely what Sanders now recommends on education.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/01.26.26-Federal-Privatization-of-K12-Education-Report_final.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">his report</a>, Sanders urges states to reject the federal scholarship tax credit and misrepresents it as a voucher program designed to undermine public schools. The same logic he once condemned, refusing federal support for working families because you oppose the underlying policy, is now his explicit recommendation.</p>\n<p>Democrats should not follow him down this path.</p>\n<p>The federal scholarship tax credit is not a voucher program. Scholarship-granting organizations can fund tutoring, curriculum, technology, transportation and special education services for students who remain enrolled in public schools.</p>\n<p>A student struggling in math can receive targeted tutoring. A child with a disability can access specialized services their district cannot provide. A rural student can enroll in virtual courses unavailable locally. These supports strengthen public education. They do not dismantle it.</p>\n<p>Sanders’s report barely acknowledges this reality. It makes a passing reference to public school students being eligible and then proceeds as if the program exclusively serves students who leave public schools. That omission is not a minor oversight. It fundamentally misrepresents how the program works.</p>\n<p>The report also argues that private school tuition remains out of reach for many working-class families. In some cases, that is true. But that is not an argument for rejecting the program. It is an argument for strengthening it.</p>\n<p>When Medicaid expansion proved insufficient, Democrats did not call for repeal. They fought to expand coverage further. The same logic applies here. If funding levels are too low, the answer is to improve the policy, not abandon it.</p>\n<p>Sanders also warns that education choice creates a two-tiered system. This misses a basic reality. We already have a two-tiered education system, and we have had one for decades. Affluent families exercise choice every day through housing decisions, private tuition and selective enrollment. The families trapped without meaningful alternatives are overwhelmingly working-class, disproportionately Black and Latino, and concentrated in the very communities Democrats claim to champion.</p>\n<p>The federal scholarship tax credit does not create inequality. It addresses one of the most entrenched and least discussed drivers of inequality in American education: the massive gap in out-of-school enrichment spending.</p>\n<p>Wealthy families routinely spend thousands of dollars a year on tutoring, test prep, academic enrichment, summer programs, technology and specialized services for their children. These investments compound over time, accelerating learning and widening achievement gaps. Working-class families understand this. They want to provide the same kinds of support for their kids. Most simply cannot afford to.</p>\n<p>The federal scholarship tax credit is designed to narrow that gap. By allowing funds to be used for tutoring, supplemental instruction, special education services and other learning support, including for students who remain in public schools, the program gives lower-income families access to the very tools affluent families already deploy as a matter of course. That is not privatization. It is equalization.</p>\n<p>Twenty-seven states have already opted in. Working families in those states will soon have access to tutoring, special education services, and learning options that did not exist before. Families in states that refuse to participate will have none of that.</p>\n<p>Once broadly trusted on education, Democrats <a href=\"https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/have-democrats-lost-their-education\">have lost ground</a>. Swing voters and communities of color are increasingly open to alternatives the party refuses to offer. </p>\n<p>Democratic governors face a defining question. Are we the party that puts families first, even when it challenges our preconceptions? Or are we the party that protects institutional orthodoxy, even when families pay the price?</p>\n<p>Voters are watching. And as with Medicaid expansion, they will remember who opted in and helped them, and who did not.</p>\n<p><em>Jorge Elorza is CEO of Democrats for Education Reform.

But we’ll see.”   <br/> </p>",

In 2024, the humanitarian organization delivered 2.5 million metric tons of food and disbursed $2.82 billion in cash-based transfers and commodity vouchers, <a href=\"https://www.wfp.org/who-we-are\">according to its website</a>.</p>\n<p>McCain, 71, was <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/03/1134077\">appointed as executive director in 2023</a>, succeeding David Beasley. Prior to that, she served as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture under former President Biden. </p>\n<p>“Serving this incredible organization has been the honor of a lifetime,” said McCain, who will stay in the job for three months. “I’ve seen firsthand WFP’s ability to save lives in the most dangerous, destitute, and remote locations of the world, where people need us the most.”</p>\n<p>“Time and time again, I have seen the WFP team show up where no one else can, no matter the odds,” she added.</p>\n<p>During her tenure, McCain spoke out on starvation crises in war-torn <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/3264468-cindy-mccain-ukraine-war-forcing-us-to-take-from-the-hungry-to-feed-the-starving/\">Ukraine</a>, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/4643067-cindy-mccain-full-blown-famine-northern-gaza/\">Gaza</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wfp.org/news/sudans-war-risks-creating-worlds-largest-hunger-crisis-warns-wfp-chief\">Sudan</a>. She said Thursday that WFP’s “unwavering commitment” to feeding the most vulnerable “will be more important than ever” going forward.</p>\n<p>“To our donors, partners and our global WFP team: thank you for everything you have done and continue to do,” the WFP chief added. “I will remain WFP’s biggest champion and continue to be an unwavering voice for those struggling with hunger everywhere.”</p>\n<p>McCain is the widow of the late former Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the Republican nominee for president in 2008. Her husband, a decorated combat veteran and prisoner of war who twice sought the White House, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/365351-mccain-war-hero-and-senate-giant-dies/\">died in 2018</a> after battling glioblastoma for over a year.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Republican Sen. Thom Tillis (N.C.) is asking why Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law, and Steve Witkoff, a Trump ally who made his fortune in real estate, are leading peace talks with Russia, Iran and Israel, given their general lack of foreign policy experience and the fact that they never underwent formal Senate confirmation proceedings.</p>\n<p>Tillis told ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl that peace talks to resolve the violence in Ukraine and Gaza and another potential conflict with Iran should not be led by Kushner and Witkoff.</p>\n<p>“Kushner and Witkoff are very accomplished businesspeople. I’m sure they’re good negotiators, but they’re not subject to Senate confirmation, and they’re not subject to oversight,” <a href=\"https://x.com/jonkarl/status/2026762357058175196\">Tillis told Karl</a>.</p>\n<p>The outspoken GOP senator said putting Kushner and Witkoff in charge of high-stakes foreign policy and national security negotiations “doesn’t make any sense.”</p>\n<p>“It is suspect that you can negotiate an Ukraine peace, an Iranian situation, a Gaza situation, and whatever, and be the same two people. That doesn’t make any sense to me,” Tillis said.</p>\n<p>Democrats on Capitol Hill have also criticized Kushner’s high-profile role given his limited experience in foreign policy matters and have raised concerns about the $2 billion in investment his company, Affinity Partners, received from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund.</p>\n<p>Democrats have also criticized Witkoff’s family business dealings, particularly his role in co-founding World Liberty Financial (WLF), a cryptocurrency company, with his sons and members of Trump’s family. Democrats raised alarms after a United Arab Emirates-backed firm invested $2 billion in WLF’s stablecoin.</p>\n<p>Senate Democrats Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Chris Murphy (Conn.) raised alarms after Witkoff said he stepped away from the company prior to becoming Trump’s special envoy.</p>\n<p>Kushner and Witkoff were <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5755665-live-updates-trump-iran-hillary-clinton/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in Geneva on Thursday</a> to negotiate a deal with Iran to end its nuclear weapons program, talks that could determine whether Trump orders missile strikes against Iran in the near future. The special envoys met with Oman’s foreign minister, a broker in the talks.</p>\n<p>The meetings come only days after Witkoff and Kushner participated in talks to end the war in Ukraine and to set up Trump’s “Board of Peace” to maintain stability and order in Gaza.</p>",
