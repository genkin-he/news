Gen. Joe McGee, is retiring from the role after reported friction with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine. </p>\n<p>“General McGee is retiring, and the War Department is grateful for his service,” chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell confirmed in a statement to The Hill on Thursday morning. </p>\n\n<p>McGee, who retired from his post earlier this month, was the director for strategy, plans and policy on the Joint Staff, advising Caine on long-term military strategy. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>McGee objected to Hegseth and Caine on a range of issues, including the Trump administration’s strikes against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and the Russia-Ukraine war, according to CNN, which first reported on McGee’s departure. </p>\n<p>McGee was nominated to be the director of the Joint Staff, but was never renominated during the current administration, according to CNN. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Parnell pushed back on the report, saying “CNN’s claims regarding his retirement are 100 percent fake news.” </p>\n<p>News of McGee’s ouster comes as the Trump administration has steadily escalated its actions and rhetoric toward the Venezuelan government, <u><a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5559019-counter-narcotics-venezuela-trump/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">quietly shifting</a></u> roughly 10,000 troops in addition to warships, fighter jets and a nuclear submarine to the Caribbean in support of what officials say are counternarcotics operations. </p>\n<p>It also marks the latest senior official Hegseth has pushed out since taking office in January. More than a dozen senior military officials have been fired, forced to retire or moved to less visible roles since the start of the year, including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown, the first female chief of naval operations, Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the directors of the National Security Agency and Defense Intelligence Agency, the former director of the Joint Staff, the head of U.S. Southern Command, and the top uniformed lawyers for the Army and Air Force.</p>\n\n<p>The most recent senior departure before McGee came <u><a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5562049-holsey-departure-raises-alarms/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">earlier this month</a></u> with Southcom head Adm. Alvin Holsey announcing he would retire two years ahead of schedule, reportedly due to him and Hegseth at odds over the U.S. mission in the Caribbean. </p>\n<p>McGee and Holsey’s unexpected departures mean the U.S. military has further lost voices that may offer a counterbalance to the Trump administration’s increasing bombing of vessels off the Venezuelan coast that it claims are transporting drugs — most recently <u><a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5580409-hegseth-new-strike-alleged-narco-trafficking-boat-killing-4/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on Wednesday</a></u> — escalating a standoff with the government of President Nicolás Maduro.</p>\n</div>",

Pope Francis reiterated many times that marriage and family were in crisis. Early on, <a href=\"https://www.ncregister.com/news/leo-xiv-at-one-month\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pope Leo XIV</a> said that the world needs marriage “to defeat … the forces that break down relationships and societies.”</p>\n<p>Catholics were once the guardians of marriage. Until New York enacted no-fault divorce, the <a href=\"https://catholiccourier.com/articles/ny-bishops-oppose-no-fault-divorce-bill/#:~:text=By%20Jennifer%20Burke/Catholic%20Courier,custody%20issues%20have%20been%20resolved.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">New York Catholic dioceses</a> stood strong against this heinous law. But today, Catholic marriage and annulment <a href=\"https://www.ewtnreligiouscatalogue.com/betrayed-without-a-kiss/p/BKFAM03158\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">statistics</a> track the secular culture. Over 426,000 U.S. Catholic weddings occurred in 1969; today, weddings total less than 100,000 per year. In 1968, hardly 350 annulments were granted nationwide; by 1989, the tally had risen to 70,000. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/What-God-Has-Joined-Together/dp/0195107640?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&amp;ref_=fplfs&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">scandal of easy annulments</a> continues and is well-documented. Still, you won’t find divorce or annulment reform on the Church’s policy agenda.</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>Overturning no-fault divorce would not be easy. And fulfilling Charlie’s dream might mean Erika Kirk loses the friendship of many powerful secular and Catholic leaders praising her husband’s legacy. She is likewise a <a href=\"https://people.com/all-about-erika-kirk-mom-lori-frantzve-11815425\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">child of divorce</a>.

I’m a big believer that there are things out there that we can’t explain. And so if another person sees an alien, maybe I see an angel or a demon. So, I’m a big believer that there are like spiritual forces working on the physical world that a lot of us don’t see and a lot of us don’t understand and a lot of us don’t appreciate.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“Is it aliens or is it our guardian angel, or is it aliens or is it a not so guardian force that doesn’t care about us or in fact actively wishes us harm?” Vance continued. “I don’t know the answer to that question. What I try to do is I try to say my prayers, I try to be as good of a person as I can be and I try to do a good job. And, hopefully, that’s all I need to do.”</p>\n<p>Vance also said that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was also interested in the topic, saying it is something they both talked about since their days working together in Senate.</p>\n<p>“There’s certainly an interest there, there’s certainly an intrigue,” Vance said. “But I really haven’t yet had time to dig in. Things have been so busy. But this is the crazy person inside me. All of us put the tinfoil hat on from time to time.”</p>\n\n<p>Miranda brought up the topic in reference <a href=\"https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/jd-vance-ufo-video-2024-investigation-trump/\">to an interview Vance had on the “Ruthless Podcast” on Aug. 1,</a> where he said he was “obsessed with the whole UFO thing.”</p>\n<p>“What’s actually going on? What were those videos all about? What’s actually happening?” Vance said at the time. “I haven’t gotten to the bottom of it yet, but we’re only six months in.”</p>\n<p>In September, Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) accused the federal government of lying about its knowledge of unexplained aerial phenomenon (UAP), commonly called UFOs. He made the accusation during a Task Force for the Declassification of Federal Secrets hearing, where he defended veterans who testified on seeing UAPs while in the military.</p>\n<p>“The narrative has changed, right?” Moskowitz said. “It’s politically convenient for the government if you all weren’t military folks in suits. It would be much better if you pulled up in Winnebagos and were wearing hats. This is now the second or third committee where we have former military folks with impeccable records with information and knowledge.”</p>\n<p>During Vance’s interview on “Pod Force One,” Rubio’s name also came up when the vice president referred to him as <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5578600-rubio-vance-trump-succession/\">his “best friend” in the administration</a>, spurred by the question of a Vance-Rubio 2028 ticket to succeed President Trump. Vance called any discussion about a future presidential run “premature.”</p>\n\n</div>",

In 2020, an <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/the-maduro-hezbollah-nexus-how-iran-backed-networks-prop-up-the-venezuelan-regime/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Atlantic Council</a> analysis found the security implications of Hezbollah in Venezuela is underestimated.  </p>\n<p>“Understanding the nature of how Hezbollah operates in Venezuela, through the lens of threat-convergence theory, is critical,” the report found.</p>\n\n<p>There are also precedents for invoking the Authorization for Use of Military Force against terrorists by democratic presidents, for security and humanitarian reasons, and without congressional approval.  </p>\n<p>Barack Obama <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6661&amp;context=faculty_scholarship\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">authorized</a> airstrikes against ISIS in Syria and Iraq.

France recently joined in the fight against the Venezuelan criminal organizations by sending <a href=\"https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20250831-how-the-caribbean-became-a-front-line-in-frances-fight-against-the-cocaine-trade\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">military reinforcements</a>.  </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>In September, the United Nations Human Rights Council’s <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/venezuela-only-hope-victims-find-justice-lies-international-community-says\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> on politically motivated persecution in Venezuela concluded that “the only hope to find justice for the victims lies with the international community.” </p>\n<p>It detailed gruesome accounts of detentions of protesters, torture, sexual violations and murders. Human Rights Watch has documented thousands of <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2023/country-chapters/venezuela\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">extrajudicial killings</a> at the hands of the Maduro regime.</p>\n<p>The Washington-based non-profit think tank <a href=\"https://insightcrime.org/news/behind-the-curtain-venezuelas-cartels-and-the-us-missile-strike-explained/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Insight Crime</a> reported that Maduro presides over a “regime of state-embedded drug trafficking.” </p>\n\n<p>Their research found that Venezuela’s Cartel of the Suns is “a system of hybrid criminal governance in which the current regime has created alliances with criminal actors,” and “the Maduro system regulates these criminal economies, including the cocaine trade. </p>\n<p>The allegation that Maduro is connected to terrorism is not incorrect, either. According to files seized by the <a href=\"https://www.mrt.com/news/article/Colombia-revela-documentos-sobre-supuestos-lazos-7517960.php\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Colombian government in 2008</a>, the Chavez regime (which Maduro <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/timeline/venezuelas-chavez-era\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">was a part of</a>) had a longstanding relationship with Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, a deadly internationally recognized terrorist group. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.infobae.com/venezuela/2025/09/11/el-parlamento-europeo-aprobo-una-resolucion-que-pide-a-la-ue-incluir-al-cartel-de-los-soles-en-su-lista-de-organizaciones-terroristas/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">European Parliament</a> recently approved a resolution to include the Cartel of the Suns on the European list of international terrorist organizations. </p>\n\n<p>In the July 2024 presidential election, the Venezuelan people overwhelmingly chose the opposition candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez. U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken announced support for Gonzalez as the legitimate winner, citing “<a href=\"https://2021-2025.state.gov/secretary-blinkens-call-with-un-secretary-general-guterres-6/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">overwhelming evidence.</a>”   </p>\n<p>Yet the regime stayed in power using threats of violence, forced disappearances and extrajudicial arrests to thwart the transfer of power. The <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/european-union-not-recognize-venezuela-election-result-nicolas-maduro/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">European Union</a>, along with the U.S. and 10 Latin American countries, refused to recognize Maduro as the Venezuelan president.</p>\n<p>While many Americans are <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/52958-most-americans-oppose-military-involvement-in-venezuela-maduro-poll\">against the military deployment</a>, the Venezuelan people are overwhelmingly in favor of it. <a href=\"https://www.infobae.com/america/opinion/2025/09/20/la-esperanza-crece-entre-los-venezolanos-ante-la-presencia-militar-de-estados-unidos-en-el-caribe/\">Eighty-seven percent</a> reportedly approve the U.S. “in the Caribbean under the narrative of combating drug trafficking.” Furthermore, <a href=\"https://www.infobae.com/america/opinion/2025/09/20/la-esperanza-crece-entre-los-venezolanos-ante-la-presencia-militar-de-estados-unidos-en-el-caribe/\">over 95 percent</a> of the Venezuelan diaspora support the U.S. military presence and 90 percent view U.S. actions positively</p>\n\n<p>The inconvenient truth is, on Venezuela, Trump is right. Multiple <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/blog/bidens-tragic-mistake-venezuela-calling-new-election-instead-respect-election-opposition-won\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">negotiations</a> with Maduro have failed. If the vast power of the U.S. military is to be used as a point of leverage to reinforce human rights and rule of law, dismantling Maduro’s regime should be one of its primary goals. </p>\n<p><em>Kristina Foltz is a Rotary Scholar who writes on Latin American affairs</em>.</p>\n</div>",
