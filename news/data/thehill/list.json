            "description": "<p>Democrats in both chambers of Congress are conflicted over how to respond to President Trump’s deployment of military forces against Iran, with some open to launching limited strikes against the regime and others worried about triggering another war in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>Pro-Israel Democrats in particular see reasons for the administration to threaten military force to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon capable of reaching Tel Aviv or U.S. bases in the region.</p>\n<p>Democrats who attended a classified briefing from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe on Tuesday said the information they received about Iran is “very serious.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t talk about the briefing, it’s classified. But what they talked about is very serious, and the administration could come clean and tell the American people their goals,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) told reporters Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said that colleagues who attended the briefing appeared alarmed over what they heard from senior administration officials.   </p>\n<p>“I can tell from their facial expressions they’re nervous, but they’ve been discreet about what they’ve shared,” he said of members of the Gang of Eight who received the classified briefing on Iran this week.</p>\n<p>Trump told lawmakers at his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening that Iran is building a nuclear weapon that could soon have the range to hit targets in the United States.</p>\n<p>“They’ve already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they’re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America,” he said.</p>\n<p>He said that Iran has ignored U.S. warnings to cease development of a nuclear weapon after U.S. Air Force and Navy bombers struck three nuclear facilities in the country last year.</p>\n<p>“They want to start all over again and are at this moment again pursuing their sinister ambitions,” Trump said.</p>\n<p>Some centrist Democrats are keeping their options open, hoping to learn more about what national security threats the Pentagon is seeking to neutralize.</p>\n<p>“I’m trying to figure out the objective here, or what the president is trying to do next,” said Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.).</p>\n<p>Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) said Trump needs to make a direct appeal to Congress before launching military strikes.</p>\n<p>“I think he needs to come to us and give us his plan,” she said when asked about whether she would support a limited strike against Iran.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the Capitol, at least two House Democrats say they will oppose a bipartisan war powers resolution to curb Trump’s authority to deploy military forces against Iran without approval from Congress.</p>\n<p>Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.), two staunch allies of Israel, argue that Trump should have broad power to confront Iran given its support for terrorist groups around the region and its push to attain nuclear weapons.</p>\n<p>“We know that Tehran is still pursuing a nuclear weapon and, since the June conflict, has moved aggressively to rebuild its ballistic missile capabilities — a direct threat to our brave service members and key democratic allies,” Gottheimer said in a joint statement with Republican Rep. Mike Lawler (N.Y.).</p>\n<p>Moskowitz told Jewish Insider that he doesn’t want to take any of Trump’s military options off the table.</p>\n<p>“I am not willing to preemptively tell the supreme leader that he has nothing to worry about, no reason to negotiate because you are totally safe, and that the people of Iran can’t depend on us,” Moskowitz said of the war powers resolution.</p>\n<p>But other Democrats fear any strike against Iran, which has a far stronger military than Venezuela — Trump’s previous target — could spiral into a broader regional conflict and result in a significant number of U.S. casualties.</p>\n<p>“Everything we know from what he said and what we’re hearing is that Donald Trump clearly did not learn the lessons about what happened in Iraq, where we lost about 7,000 Americans, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and lost trillions of dollars,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.).</p>\n<p>“He’s never put forward a rationale for why America should go to war against Iran because he doesn’t have one,” he added.</p>\n<p>Kaine, who has sponsored a Senate war powers resolution to prevent the Trump administration from going to war against Iran, says he hopes to bring the measure back to the floor for a vote soon.</p>\n<p>He said Trump’s claim that Iran poses an imminent threat to the United States and its allies is “completely inaccurate.”</p>\n<p>“Months ago, he was saying that Iran’s nuclear program was obliterated,” Kaine said, pointing to Trump’s claims after Operation Midnight Hammer targeted Iranian nuclear facilities in June.</p>\n<p>“We shouldn’t be sending our sons and daughters into a war in Iran. We do not need our kids going into another war in the Middle East,” he said.</p>\n<p>The Senate passed a war powers resolution during Trump’s first term to restrict the president’s use of military force against Iran without congressional approval. That measure passed by a vote of 55-45 in February 2020.</p>\n<p>Every Senate Democrat voted for that measure, along with eight Republicans — Sens. Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Bill Cassidy (La.), Susan Collins (Maine), Mike Lee (Utah), Jerry Moran (Kan.), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Rand Paul (Ky.) and Todd Young (Ind.).</p>\n<p>Senate Democrats say it’s difficult to assess the threat Iran now poses to U.S national security because the Trump administration has provided little information to lawmakers to justify the recent buildup of naval forces in the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.</p>\n<p>“First of all, I think they have to define what the objective is. We’ve had no real briefing, information or anything else. So it’s hard to justify something without rationale,” said Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Several court challenges, roadblocks in Maryland’s upper chamber and a late special legislative session in Florida are injecting uncertainty into a handful of states looking to pass new congressional maps ahead of November’s midterms, as both Democrats and Republicans look to clinch the House majority. </p>\n<p>Democrats took major hits in Virginia and Maryland in recent weeks, with a Virginia judge blocking the party from moving forward with its April redistricting referendum, and the top Maryland Senate Democrat has made it clear he’s not interested in passing new lines.</p>\n<p>However, in a blow to the GOP, a federal court this week allowed Utah to utilize a map that could give Democrats a rare pickup opportunity this November. Meanwhile, Republicans in Florida will have one last bite at the apple in April, when the Legislature will convene in an effort to pass a GOP-favored map.</p>\n<p>These developments are playing out as several states, including Texas — which ignited the redistricting arms race last year— are set to start holding their primaries in the coming weeks. </p>\n<p>Here’s where redistricting stands in a handful of key states: </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Virginia</strong></h2>\n<p>The redistricting process in Virginia has become tumultuous as the party looks to pass a 10-1 Democratic gerrymander in the state, which currently has a 6-5 Democratic edge in its congressional delegation. </p>\n<p>Virginia Democrats were hoping to hold<strong> </strong>an April 21 referendum on new maps approved by the state House asking voters to allow the state to bypass its redistricting commission before 2030, when congressional lines were initially slated to be redrawn.</p>\n<p>A local judge last month, however, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5709183-virginia-democrats-redistricting-ruling/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blocked the party</a> from moving forward with its referendum, saying Democrats could not hold the election in time for the November midterms. The Virginia Supreme Court <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5737289-democrats-redistricting-referendum-virginia/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ultimately allowed the Democrats to move forward</a> with its plans for a special election while litigation over the referendum works its way through the courts.</p>\n<p>But then, the local judge, Tazewell County Circuit Judge Jack Hurley Jr., threw another wrench in Democrats’ plans, when he temporarily blocked the referendum from proceeding after several national GOP groups <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5747297-virginia-redistricting-referendum-blocked-tazewell-judge/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pushed for an emergency injunction</a>.</p>\n<p>Democrats have signaled they intend to appeal that decision. The 2026 primary has already been pushed back from June until August amid Democrats’ redistricting push.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Maryland</strong></h2>\n<p>Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) and national Democrats’ last-minute push for new House maps in the Old Line State has largely come up short.</p>\n<p>Democrats in the state’s lower chamber <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5719665-maryland-democrats-redistricting-map/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">passed an 8-0 Democratic gerrymander</a> earlier this month, which teed up a November referendum asking voters if lawmakers can keep the congressional lines in place until after the 2030 U.S. census.  </p>\n<p>But efforts to convince Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D), who’s remained  adamantly against mid-decade redistricting, have been unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>Ferguson has reason to be wary: The Democratic Party tried to usher through an 8-0 map after the 2020 U.S. census, but a court later struck it down in 2022 as a partisan gerrymander. </p>\n<p>“It takes at least three to four months for a trial-level court to play out, and then whatever decision happens likely leads to an appeal,” Ferguson told reporters last week, regarding potential litigation if Democrats were to push ahead with redistricting, <a href=\"https://marylandmatters.org/2026/02/20/ferguson-window-of-opportunity-has-closed-on-redistricting-efforts/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to Maryland Matters</a>. </p>\n<p>“We are not going to wait until June to reopen a filing deadline for new maps, new precincts, new local boards,” he added. </p>\n<p>Moore, however, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5751307-moore-vows-redistricting-maryland/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">has vowed to continue</a> his push for a new map even as the candidate filing deadline passed this week. The state currently has a 7-1 Democratic edge in its congressional delegation, with Rep. Andy Harris as the lone Maryland Republican. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Utah</strong></h2>\n<p>Democrats in ruby-red Utah are poised to gain a new congressional seat after the state was forced to redraw its maps for the midterms.  </p>\n<p>Unlike redistricting efforts in Texas and California, where maps were redrawn to boost party margins, Utah’s new maps are the result of a court order. A state judge <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/utah-redistricting-court/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">last year tossed</a> GOP-drawn lines, ruling that state legislators <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5489323-utah-redistricting-battle-democrats/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">had disregarded</a> partisan gerrymandering safeguards.</p>\n<p>The Utah GOP has fought hard to block the new map, which could offer Democrats a rare pickup opportunity — a blue-leaning district around Salt Lake County — in a state that voted for President Trump by more than 20 points in 2024 and where Republicans control all four congressional districts.  </p>\n<p>The Utah Supreme Court this month dismissed an effort to stay the map, and a federal panel this week <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5751219-utah-court-rejects-gop-house-map/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rejected another bid</a> that could have sent the maps back to the state Legislature, where Republicans hold a supermajority in both chambers.  </p>\n<p>Barring the possibility that the case makes its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, the maps are set to take hold for the midterms, with primaries set for June 23.  </p>\n<p>The Democratic National Committee hailed this week’s ruling as a “victory for fair representation” in Utah, while Republicans have panned the judge who kick-started the redistricting back-and-forth.  </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Utah Republicans have <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5740222-utah-republican-redistricting-initiative/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said they have the support</a> they need to put forward a ballot initiative in November that would effectively repeal the state’s independent redistricting commission.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Florida</strong></h2>\n<p>Florida Republicans have signaled they hope to join the ranks of states that have redistricted to net their party more seats in the House ahead of the November midterms. </p>\n<p>A Florida House redistricting panel has already convened to start the process, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) has called for a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5677005-desantis-florida-redistricting-session/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">spring special legislative session</a> focused on redistricting in the Sunshine State. </p>\n<p>The session is expected to begin in April, as officials wait for a highly anticipated Supreme Court ruling over Louisiana’s congressional map and the Voting Rights Act, a decision DeSantis said could impact how any new lines are handled in Florida. </p>\n<p>Florida voters this month <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5725343-desantis-redistricting-challenge-florida/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">filed a petition</a> arguing that DeSantis doesn’t have the authority to order the state House to redraw maps, and experts expect additional legal obstacles could be on the horizon if the state moves forward.  </p>\n<p>Republicans currently have a 20-8 advantage in the state’s House congressional delegation, but redistricting could diminish Florida Democrats’ power even further by giving the GOP as many as <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5682775-florida-republicans-redistricting-threat/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">five more seats</a> for the midterms.   </p>",

            "description": "<p>The abrupt departure of the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) top antitrust enforcer is raising questions about the Trump administration’s approach to major anti-monopoly cases and controversial mergers.</p>\n<p>Gail Slater <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5735535-gail-slater-leaves-doj-antitrust/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5735535-gail-slater-leaves-doj-antitrust/\">announced her plans to resign</a> earlier this month after less than a year leading the DOJ’s antitrust division, marking an abrupt end to a tenure that was repeatedly plagued by tensions with top Trump officials.  </p>\n<p>Slater’s nomination spurred alarm among tech companies and other corporate giants, who faced aggressive antitrust enforcement during the first Trump administration.</p>\n<p>Now, with Slater on her way out, attention is turning to several high-profile deals awaiting Trump administration approval  — and the president’s own influence over antitrust policy.</p>\n<p>“It feels like the support for populist antitrust enforcement is kind of gone from the Trump administration. Slater was kind of seen as the leader of that philosophy and clearly that’s been pushed aside,” said Owen Tedford, a senior research analyst at Beacon Policy Advisors.  </p>\n<p>Previously a top adviser to Vice President Vance, Slater was confirmed as assistant attorney general for the antitrust division last spring.  </p>\n<p>Her nomination was one of several moves by the Trump administration that initially signaled a continuation of aggressive antitrust enforcement, particularly against major tech firms.</p>\n<p>Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked major tech platforms and have warned that companies like Google and Meta have used their power to influence voters against conservatives, as Trump has warned with mainstream media companies.  </p>\n<p>In nominating Slater, Trump argued on social media that “Big Tech has run wild for years,” noting he was “proud to fight these abuses in my First Term, and our Department of Justice’s antitrust team will continue that work under Gail’s leadership.” </p>\n<p>Her unexpected exit came against a backdrop of increased consolidation of major American businesses and immediate tensions between Slater and top DOJ officials.  </p>\n<p>A $14 billion merger between Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Juniper Networks proved to be an early point of contention when two top antitrust officials were fired in July amid an internal dispute over the handling of that merger. </p>\n<p>While the DOJ initially sued to block the acquisition, it later settled the case, with Slater reportedly being overruled in the decision. </p>\n<p>One of the ex-officials, Roger Alford, later slammed senior DOJ leadership for allegedly allowing politically connected lobbyists to influence decisionmaking. </p>\n<p>“It felt like it was just reaching a boiling point where either Slater was going to have to perhaps relent on some of her personal political philosophies or go this route of deciding to leave the administration instead,” Tedford added. </p>\n<p>The DOJ’s antitrust division has several high-profile legal battles ahead.  </p>\n<p>The department is pursuing a case against Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation, accusing the firms of blocking competition in the live entertainment industry, and that case is set to go to trial next week.  </p>\n<p>The department is also expected to consider several key deals that executives at some of the world’s largest media companies have been angling for in the coming months. </p>\n<p>Warner Bros. Discovery <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5754397-warner-bros-paramount-netflix-deal/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5754397-warner-bros-paramount-netflix-deal/\">struck a deal</a> late last year to sell its sprawling movie and television studios to Netflix, an agreement valued at more than $70 billion that has raised questions about the streamer’s growing market share and content production priorities.  </p>\n<p>President Trump has criticized the deal, and this week <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5750810-netflix-warner-brothers-ted-sarandos-trump-rice/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5750810-netflix-warner-brothers-ted-sarandos-trump-rice/\">urged Netflix</a> to fire Susan Rice, a longtime Democratic political operative who sits on the company’s board, over comments she made that were critical of his administration or the company would “face the consequences.”  </p>\n<p>Some observers say Trump meddling in such deals complicates the work of the DOJ’s antitrust division in a way not seen during previous administrations.  </p>\n<p>“Netflix leadership is saying this is a business deal not a political deal, but we’re entering uncharted territory here,” said Corey Martin, a corporate lawyer specializing in media deals. “It seems like everything [in the media sector] is becoming political whether we want it to or not.” </p>\n<p>The increased pressure on the Netflix-Warner Bros. Discovery deal comes as Paramount Skydance, the Hollywood behemoth owned by Trump ally David Ellison, mounts a hostile bid for the company’s entire portfolio, including its linear television assets like CNN.  </p>\n<p>Trump has said he would like to see CNN operate under new leadership and spoken glowingly about changes the Ellison family has implemented at Paramount.  </p>\n<p>The DOJ could also consider a <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5732004-fcc-broadcast-ownership-nexstar-tegna-hearing/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5732004-fcc-broadcast-ownership-nexstar-tegna-hearing/\">massive merger</a> in the local news business, where broadcaster Nexstar Media Group, which owns The Hill, is eyeing a $7 billion acquisition of fellow television group Tegna.  </p>\n<p>Reilly Steel, a professor of law at Columbia University, argued media mergers are the most consequential of any that Trump’s DOJ will consider soon.  </p>\n<p>“This is the way information is conveyed to the public. If you control the media, you control the informational environment and the narrative,” Steel said. “It has enormous implications for our democracy [more] than your standard consumer product markets.”   </p>\n<p>Several Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about improper political influence at the DOJ on a range of issues.  </p>\n<p>In a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi earlier this month, Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) suggested Slater’s departure “reinforces a troubling pattern in which senior Antitrust Division officials appear to be sidelined when their enforcement decisions conflict with the interests of President Trump or his allies.” </p>\n<p>Without the former antitrust head, they warned that the case against Ticketmaster is at “extreme risk of political interference” and the agency’s review of the Warner Bros. deal is “vulnerable to undue influence at a critical moment.” </p>\n<p>Slater was replaced by Omeed Assefi, a former Trump White House official who served as Slater’s deputy during her time in the position and has taken over as acting assistant attorney general for antitrust. </p>\n<p>“She was seen as somebody who was going to uphold the rule of law and push back against the kind of favor courting model that has been prevailing at the DOJ with companies trying to grease their deals through with lobbying and appealing to Trump’s agenda,” noted Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a law professor at Vanderbilt University focused on antitrust issues. </p>\n<p>Now, Tedford suggested there may be “increasing acceptance of outside lobbying by Trump-connected ex-officials.” </p>\n<p>“I don’t know that any hire is a golden ticket, but there’s clearly some who are starting to build a track record of successfully working these agencies and getting deals through,” he said. </p>",

            "description": "<p>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) on Wednesday defended transgender rights in her State of the State address, a day after President Trump criticized gender transition in his State of the Union address.</p>\n<p>“In Michigan, everyone deserves to be who they are and love who they love. I want to take a moment and speak directly to our gay and trans neighbors, family and friends: I want you to know that you are welcome in Michigan,” Whitmer said in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KQRmHPd0iE\">her address.</a></p>\n<p>“You belong, you matter, and no matter who comes after you, I’ll stand in the way. In Michigan, we look out for each other. That’s why I’ll always fight for your freedom and your safety, and I’ll veto any legislation that diminishes your humanity. I got your back,” she added.</p>\n<p>Whitmer’s words stand in contrast to comments from Trump a day before, in which he lambasted the concept of gender transition for children, a topic that has been heavily criticized by the right.</p>\n<p>“Surely we can all agree, no state can be allowed to rip children from their parents’ arms and transition them to a new gender against the parents’ will. Who would believe that we’re even talking about it? We must ban it, and we must ban it immediately,” Trump said.</p>\n<p>Trump signed an executive order on his first day back in office last year to recognize male and female as the only sexes and ordered federal agencies to stop promoting the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5097278-trump-executive-order-gender-transition/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">concept of gender transition.</a></p>\n<p>The order stemmed from a wider Trump campaign promise to get rid of “transgender insanity” in the U.S. and go back on diversity and inclusion initiatives from the prior administration.</p>\n<p>Whitmer is among a pack of notable Democrats whose names have been floated as possible 2028 <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5718752-whitmer-substack-bipartisan-solutions/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">presidential candidates</a>, including Kentucky Gov.

            "description": "<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) said Wednesday that a former Air Force pilot was arrested because he gave “defense services” to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-us-air-force-pilot-arrested-providing-defense-services-chinese-military\">Chinese military forces.</a></p>\n<p>In a press release Wednesday, the DOJ said 65-year-old Gerald Eddie Brown Jr., had been arrested in Jeffersonville, Ind., that day. The department said that Brown, a former Air Force officer and pilot, had been charged “for providing and conspiring to provide defense services to Chinese military pilots without authorization, in violation of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA).”</p>\n<p>“The United States Air Force trained Major Brown to be an elite fighter pilot and entrusted him with the defense of our Nation. He now stands charged with training Chinese military pilots,” Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Eisenberg said in the Wednesday DOJ release.</p>\n<p>“When U.S. persons — whether military or civilian — provide training to a foreign military, that activity is illegal unless they have a license from the State Department. The National Security Division will use all tools at its disposal to protect our military advantages and hold to account those who would violate the AECA.”</p>\n<p>The DOJ said that Brown had worked with foreigners and Americans so that he could give combat aircraft training to Chinese Air Force soldiers “since at least in or around August 2023,” according to a criminal complaint. </p>\n<p>Brown’s Air Force career lasted 24 years, according to the DOJ, and he left active duty 30 years ago. He previously headed up combat missions and “sensitive units” that had jurisdiction over nuclear weapons delivery systems, per the department.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday slammed her 2024 presidential election opponent President Trump over his Tuesday State of the Union address.</p>\n<p>“I watched it. It was full of lies. And, you know, when he wasn’t lying, he was — it reminded me of our kids going to show-and-tell at school. It was lite — nothing that was true about really, how the American people right now, so many are suffering under the weight of high prices, unaffordable health care, unaffordable housing,” Harris told “The Parnas Perspective” host Aaron Parnas on his <a href=\"https://aaronparnas.substack.com/p/exclusive-vice-president-kamala-harris\">Substack show</a>, discussing Tuesday’s speech.</p>\n<p>“And, it was, you know, we’ve come to expect it. And, you know, some people have said it was really quite boring, and that there was nothing very interesting about it, because it was the same old, same old. The guy lying about what he intends to do, what he has done, and the state of our economy and the state of the world,” she added.</p>\n<p>Trump gave his first official State of the Union address of his <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754101-trump-state-union-address-takeaways/\">second term Tuesday</a>. The president’s address came alongside low approval ratings and tough political territory for <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5753379-trump-state-union-second-term/\">himself and his party</a>.</p>\n<p>In recent months, the president has been facing heat over issues including his immigration agenda, affordability, files linked to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his foreign policy moves.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5753379-trump-state-union-second-term/\">The president boasted</a> about the successes of his second term while going after Democrats over numerous issues during his speech. Trump started by extolling a “transformation” of the U.S. while he has been in office.</p>\n<p>“I can say with dignity and pride that we have achieved a transformation like no one has ever seen before, and a turnaround for the ages. We will never go back to where we were just a short time ago,” Trump said.</p>\n<p>Harris has been consistently floated as a 2028 presidential contender, a run that would come four years after whirlwind campaign against Trump that ultimately led to his return to the White House. But she has not yet said definitively whether she will run. </p>",

            "title": "Trump State of the Union piles pressure on Johnson for second reconciliation push",
            "description": "<p>President Trump used much of his State of the Union address Tuesday night to promote GOP legislation likely to hit a wall with Democrats, turning up the heat on Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) to pursue a complicated avenue to pass it with only Republican votes.</p>\n<p>Johnson may have only a narrow window to push much of Trump’s legislative agenda over the finish line, as the president’s party historically suffers losses in midterm elections. And the administration appears eager to sharpen its economic policy as the election cycle ramps up — a dynamic that could complicate matters for Johnson as he steers a razor-thin majority through resistance from both GOP hard-liners and moderates.</p>\n<p>Though Trump did not mention a second reconciliation package explicitly in Tuesday’s speech, he repeatedly highlighted the tax cuts enacted in his One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Shortly before the speech, Trump told news anchors that he wants new personal and corporate tax cuts this year and wants to use reconciliation to pass them, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/24/state-of-the-union-trump-tax-cuts.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to CNBC News</a>.</p>\n<p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also suggested to NBC News on Tuesday that Republicans could use the budget reconciliation process to advance a new retirement proposal that Trump unveiled during his speech. The proposal would offer Americans who do not have a retirement savings plan through their employer, such as a 401(k), access to the same plan offered to federal workers. Trump said he would match the contribution with up to $1,000 a year.</p>\n<p>“We can do it through reconciliation,” Bessent said. “This is the president coming back for working Americans — those who have been left behind.”</p>\n<p>Reconciliation is a special process that allows a party with unified control of Washington to bypass the Senate filibuster, lending them a major opportunity to move legislation that couldn’t pass otherwise. It was this process that Republicans used to enact Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act last year. </p>\n<p>But advancing another reconciliation package would be a heavy lift for Johnson, who had struggled to push Trump’s first-year agenda across the finish line and would likely face even stronger headwinds in an election year. Even House Republicans concede the path forward would be fraught with challenges.</p>\n<p>“Just judging from the amount of effort it took to get the last one passed, I wouldn’t bet the farm on another one happening. There seems to be a lot of outspoken opponents to doing one. Good reasons to pursue one, but I think it’s very difficult to back,” Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) said on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Johnson is currently operating with a 218-214 majority, meaning he can afford only one Republican defection and still pass party-line legislation. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), a conservative fiscal hawk who voted against the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is already considered a likely no vote on any new reconciliation package.</p>\n<p>In January, the Republican Study Committee <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5686728-gop-housing-health-energy-reforms/?tbref=hp%27\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unveiled a framework</a> for a second reconciliation package that includes housing reforms aimed at boosting access to homeownership; health reforms that Trump has backed, such as having ObamaCare subsidies flow to individuals rather than to insurance companies; and cuts to regulations governing energy production. But even Johnson’s allies concede it would be a heavy lift.</p>\n<p>“Obviously, the math governs what happens around here,” Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) said of a second reconciliation package. “It does any deliberative body. And so, the question will be, can you secure 218 votes and 51 votes to bend the arc of health care toward affordability and quality?”</p>\n<p>Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), who voted against Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, said that he’s always “suspect” of reconciliation bills because he prefers “two-party solutions.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve voted against multiple reconciliation bills, both Democrat and Republican,” he added. “I’m not a fan of single-party bills.”</p>\n<p>The other issue at hand is tariffs. Trump said in his speech that “congressional action will not be necessary” to impose additional levies. But his staunchest allies, led by Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio), are pushing a plan to use reconciliation to move legislation that would raise tariff rates with a simple majority vote to bolster Trump’s embattled trade agenda, which was shot down by the Supreme Court last week.</p>\n<p>“What we would be talking about is moving tariffs that are already in legislation to a higher amount,” Moreno said, referring to tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that are already in place under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, for example.</p>\n<p>But that strategy likely won’t play well with GOP moderates in the House, who have argued that tariffs are harming their constituents. Six House Republicans — Reps. Don Bacon (Neb.), Jeff Hurd (Colo.), Kevin Kiley (Calif.), Massie, Fitzpatrick and Newhouse — voted in favor of a resolution to repeal Trump’s tariffs on Canada in early February.</p>\n<p>Speaker Johnson, who still identifies as a free-trade Reagan Republican, acknowledged to Politico on Wednesday that codifying Trump’s tariffs would be tough within his conference.  </p>\n<p>“It’s going to be, I think, a challenge to find consensus on any path forward on the tariffs on the legislative side,” he said.</p>\n<p>Democrats would provide no help. They’ve opposed virtually every facet of Trump’s legislative agenda, including tariffs and corporate tax cuts, and are vowing to continue that resistance heading into the midterm elections. </p>\n<p>There are “far too many people struggling here in America to live paycheck to paycheck, cannot thrive and can barely survive,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) told reporters Wednesday during the Democrats’ annual issues retreat in Leesburg, Va., where party leaders bashed Trump for putting the financial interests of the wealthy over those of the working class. </p>\n<p>But some House Republicans noted that they’ve been able to pass critical bills even with a razor-thin margin, and that a second reconciliation package isn’t out of the question altogether. </p>\n<p>“The dominant narrative of the 119th [Congress] has been people telling Republicans they can’t get something done with narrow margins, and then us actually delivering victories. And so I guess I wouldn’t count us out,” Dusty Johnson said.</p>\n<p>Rep. Gabe Evans (R-Colo.) said he believes that if leadership and the White House decide to pursue a reconciliation package, it likely “would be much smaller.”</p>\n<p>“By being much smaller and incorporating reconciliation instructions to fewer committees, it’s by default also going to be less complex to get across the finish line,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Republicans are the party of independent thought. We are the policy-focused party, so we’re always going to have conversations, but as we’ve seen before, every time that the naysayers say ‘I don’t know if they’re going to get it done,’ we always get it done,” Evans added. “So we’re always going to have that robust conversation. That’s how you know that we’re putting together a good product, and then we’ll always pull together to get it across the finish line.”</p>\n<p><em>Alexander Bolton and Emily Brooks contributed.</em></p>",
