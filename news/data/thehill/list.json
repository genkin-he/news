            "description": "<p>Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.) said Thursday the Trump administration lacks a “clear objective” with respect to its <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5755665-live-updates-trump-iran-hillary-clinton/\">pressure campaign towards Iran</a>. </p>\n<p>“The president hasn’t made the case to the American public, and they don’t have a clear objective,” Kaine <a href=\"https://www.ms.now/morning-joe/watch/no-war-in-iran-without-a-vote-of-congress-sen-kaine-on-his-war-powers-resolution-2489345091839\">said on MS NOW</a>.</p>\n<p>“This looks like [the] Iraq [War], which was a disaster, but without the work done at the front end to try to convince the American public and Congress that it’s a good idea,” he added later.</p>\n<p>Special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law, met Thursday with Omani and Iranian officials in Geneva, Switzerland. Omani Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi <a href=\"https://x.com/badralbusaidi/status/2027089708392579576?s=20\">wrote on social media</a> after the meeting that the sides made “significant progress” and “will resume soon after consultation in the respective capitals.”</p>\n<p>The foreign minister added that “technical” discussions will take place next week in Vienna, Austria. </p>\n<p>The meeting came two days after Trump again <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5755742-trump-iran-nuclear-threat/\">vowed to ensure</a> that Iran never develops a nuclear weapon. Last June, the president said that <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5363831-iran-nuclear-site-damage-trump-iran/\">U.S. strikes obliterated</a> three Iranian nuclear sites.</p>\n<p>“My preference is to solve this problem through diplomacy,” the president said Tuesday during his <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754101-trump-state-union-address-takeaways/\">State of the Union address</a>. “But one thing is certain, I will never allow the world’s No. 1 sponsor of terror, which they are by far, to have a nuclear weapon.”</p>\n<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said Wednesday that while the Islamic Republic is not currently enriching uranium, it is “trying to get to the point” where it can. </p>\n<p>“After their nuclear program was obliterated, they were told not to try to restart it, and here they are,” Rubio told reporters. “You can see them always trying to rebuild elements of it.”</p>\n<p>But Kaine, who said his war powers resolution on preventing the president from going to war with Iran without congressional approval will “likely” hit the Senate floor next week, pointed out Thursday that the rhetoric from the administration does not line up with Trump’s assertions last summer that the sites were obliterated.</p>\n<p>He also noted the administration is deporting Iranians, despite the president pledging to stand with the Iranian people amid widespread protests against the repressive regime.</p>\n<p>“They don’t care about how Iranians are treated,” said the Virginia Democrat.</p>",

            "description": "<p>The United Kingdom’s far-right political activist Tommy Robinson completed a tour at the State Department on Wednesday after meeting with one of Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s senior advisers.  </p>\n<p>A State Department spokesperson told The Hill that the anti-immigration advocate was there in an “unofficial capacity” for a tour.</p>\n<p>Robinson toured the department’s diplomatic reception room among other spaces at the invitation of senior adviser Joe Rittenhouse.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://x.com/Overlord26/status/2026708849848205801?s=20\">post</a> on the social platform X after the visit, Rittenhouse said he was honored to host Robinson, whom he described as a “free speech warrior.”</p>\n<p>“The World and the West is a better place when we fight for freedom of speech and no one has been on the front lines more than Tommy. Good to see you my friend!” he added in the post. </p>\n<p>Robinson, born Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon, said he visited to make “<a href=\"https://x.com/TRobinsonNewEra/status/2026705173884911868\">alliances &amp; friendships</a>” amid a <a href=\"https://x.com/newsguyusa/status/2024644101749043490\">report</a> that he also met with Kari Lake who heads the U.S. Agency for Global Media. </p>\n<p>However, several British lawmakers and others criticized Robinson’s visit, noting his past history of arrests and documentaries encouraging Islamophobia. </p>\n<p>Emily Thornberry, British Foreign Affairs Committee Chair, said, “Yaxley-Lennon is being touted around Washington as a ‘free speech warrior.’ We need to engage this administration on the difference between that and incitement to violence and racial hatred. There should be no place in any democracy for the latter,” in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/far-right-activist-tommy-robinsons-us-welcome-sparks-british-backlash/\">Politico</a>.</p>\n<p>Others echoed her sentiments noting Robinson’s staunch support from former White House adviser Elon Musk, who covered that activist’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/13/tommy-robinson-says-elon-musk-is-paying-his-legal-costs-as-trial-begins\">legal fees</a> during a court battle related to libel and the UK’s anti-terrorism laws. </p>\n<p>“The Trump administration hosting Tommy Robinson must be a wake-up call. The government needs to include the US in their inquiry into foreign interference in UK politics,” British Member of Parliament Calum Miller wrote in a <a href=\"https://x.com/calummillerld/status/2026968573793440082\">post</a> on X.</p>\n<p>“We cannot stand by while the likes of Trump and Musk meddle in our democracy,” he added.</p>\n<p>Robinson’s visit comes amid a broader concern for Islamophobia in Washington after Rep. Randy Fine (R-Fla.) faces <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5742244-randy-fine-censure-calls-muslims-dogs-post/\">calls to be censured</a> for making a social media post comparing dogs and Muslim people. </p>\n<p>Over the past two decades, Robinson has served five prison sentences for assault, harassment, fraud and contempt of court. </p>\n<p>Robinson joined an English branch of Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West and later co-founded the English Defence League (EDL), a now deflated Islamophobic social movement. </p>\n<p>In 2011, a judge sentenced him to a 12-month community rehabilitation order for starting a 100-man brawl, during which he chanted, “EDL till I die.” </p>\n<p>The fight broke out at a soccer match and resulted in Robinson’s completion of 150 hours of unpaid work and a three-year ban from attending football matches, as reported by the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-suffolk-14278957\">BBC</a>.</p>\n<p>Last year, Robinson organized a “Unite The Kingdom” anti-immigration rally with more than 100,000 participants, according to <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/london-protests-tommy-robinson-march-musk-starmer-latest-updates-b2827227.html\">The Independent</a>. Authorities were injured during the demonstration, and more than a dozen arrests were made.</p>\n<p>Robinson fled the United Kingdom after police warned him that he’d been identified in an Islamic publication as someone “to commit violence” against.</p>\n<p><em>Max Rego contributed</em>.</p>",

            "title": "Trump projects his failings onto others in his State of the Union address",
            "description": "<p>President Trump’s State of the Union address was a long temper tantrum filled with lies, insults and projection, attributing his own failings to others.</p>\n<p>Trump falsely accused those he considers his enemies of mistakes, misconduct and malignant behavior. He complained incessantly about former President Joe Biden, congressional Democrats, unauthorized immigrants, the media and others, in <a href=\"https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/chicago-politics/longest-state-of-the-union-in-history-delivered-by-trump-tuesday/3899802/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the longest State of the Union on record</a>, at one hour and 47 minutes. He showed once again that he is in love with the sound of his own voice and would rather attack Democrats than work with them to benefit the American people.</p>\n<p>Trump used his speech to shower himself with praise for what he claimed were his great accomplishments. But most of his boasts were either gross exaggerations or flat-out lies.</p>\n<p>News organizations compiling long lists of Trump’s false and misleading statements in his speech include <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/article/2026/feb/25/Donald-trump-state-union-green/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Politifact,</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/25/us/fact-check-state-of-the-union-trump\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/24/politics/fact-check-state-of-the-union\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CNN</a>. </p>\n<p>Trump claimed that “<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/02/25/g-s1-111434/trump-state-of-the-union-democrats-protest-immigration-epstein\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Democrats are destroying our country</a>.” In fact, his tariffs are making America less affordable for everyone, and hurting farmers and businesses that import and export products. His cuts to government programs are depriving Americans of vital services and pushed dedicated civil servants out of their jobs.</p>\n<p>Trump’s destructive crackdown on unauthorized immigration has caused businesses to lose needed worker. It is terrorizing communities and has resulted in the killing, beating and imprisoning of Americans and immigrants who never committed violent crimes. Immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for years and have children who are American citizens have been deported.</p>\n<p>The president’s other destructive actions hurting Americans include his executive order declaring DEI programs illegal, even though they make America a more just and equitable nation. In addition, he has slashed federal funding for colleges and universities, destroying their ability to hold down tuition costs and avoid cuts in programs.</p>\n<p>Trump falsely claimed that Democrats “want to cheat” in elections because “the only way they can get elected is to cheat.” He said election fraud is “rampant.” In fact, Trump called on Congress to change election laws to make it harder to vote and to help Republicans keep control of both chambers.</p>\n<p>In addition, Trump worked to overturn his 2020 reelection defeat with baseless lawsuits and by unsuccessfully calling on Republican state officials to alter the results. In a phone call recorded without his knowledge, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-55524838\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Trump asked</a> Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) to “find 11,780 votes” that didn’t exist to give him a victory in the state. This shows that Trump is the one who wants to cheat in elections and projects his dishonesty onto Democrats.</p>\n<p>Trump hypocritically said “we must totally reject political violence of any kind,” even though he summoned his supporters to come to Washington on Jan. 6, 2021 to overturn his reelection defeat and then told them to march on the Capitol, where they staged a deadly riot.</p>\n<p>Trump also claimed that Democrats are soft on crime and said “dangerous repeat offenders continue to be released by pro-crime Democrat politicians again and again.” Yet it was Trump — not Democrats — who granted pardons and commuted the sentences of <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-set-pardon-defendants-stormed-capitol-jan-6-2021-rcna187735\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">about 1,500 people</a> either charged or already convicted of crimes in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.</p>\n<p>In addition, in his second term Trump has so far <a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU08/20260121/118871/HHRG-119-JU08-20260121-SD007.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">granted pardons</a> to 87 people and one corporation convicted of financial crimes. Many of those pardoned were wealthy and collectively had been ordered to pay over $298 million in fines and restitution.</p>\n<p>Trump used his speech to exaggerate his role in settling foreign conflicts, even as he has amassed a massive military force near Iran and is threatening to plunge America into a Middle East war without any authorization by Congress.</p>\n<p>Yet in addition to ordering the capture of the president and first lady of Venezuela, Trump the self-described peacemaker has ordered bombings of small boats that have resulted in the deaths of <a href=\"https://wgnradio.com/news/political-news/ap-us-military-strikes-alleged-drug-boat-in-caribbean-sea-killing-3/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">at least 151</a> alleged drug smugglers near that nation. No evidence has been publicly released indicating the people killed were actually smuggling drugs.</p>\n<p>Trump’s projection and lies have become so routine that they are as predictable as day turning into night, reducing their shock value and public outrage.</p>\n<p>Yet as an American, I still find it embarrassing to have the 79-year-old leader of my country acting like a spoiled child having an uncontrollable temper tantrum, telling absurd lies he expects us to believe, denying responsibility for his misconduct, and blaming everyone but himself for things that go wrong.</p>\n<p>As a Democrat, I never expect to agree with much in a State of the Union address by a Republican president. But I expect every president to be honest and not project his flaws onto others. Trump fails this test spectacularly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ascottbolden.com/about/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>A.

            "description": "<p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) shared his trepidation about Vice President Vance in a recent interview with MS NOW, describing him as “dangerous.”</p>\n<p>“Vance, for whatever reason, scares me, almost more than Trump,” the Democratic governor told Jen Psaki. “I mean, talk about a guy who put a mask on and his face grew into it.”</p>\n<p>Newsom called Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio “frauds” and “phonies” for reversing their previous criticisms about the president. </p>\n<p>“But JD is a unique fraud and phony, and he’s a little more dangerous,” Newsom said. </p>\n<p>Newsom, who is widely seen as a top potential Democratic contender in the 2028 presidential race, has staunchly opposed the Trump administration’s policies. </p>\n<p>In the MS NOW interview, which was recorded a day after Trump’s State of the Union address, the governor expressed particular concerns about the possibility of Trump <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5574490-trump-teases-third-term/\">seeking a third term</a> in office and issued a “code red” about the state of election security in America. </p>\n<p>“My fear is we get so easily distracted and they’re so effective on the other side, and so … we must continue to be mindful, laser-focused on what’s in front of us every single day until the job is done,” he said. </p>\n<p>Newsom urged states to maintain control over their election processes. His comments follow threats from Trump to “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5721428-trump-nationalize-election-backlash/\">nationalize</a>” elections in 15 states, eliciting <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5722063-donald-trump-state-elections-nationalization/\">concerns</a> from Democratic governors about maintaining independence in their state’s voting systems. </p>\n<p>“I think it’s about a state of mind, a vigilance,” Newsom said. “They have to double down on all their voter protection, they have to double down on what the registrar of voters is doing or not doing, as it relates to election security.</p>\n<p>“And that’s county by county, it’s bottom-up, not top-down,” he continued. “States play a big role. Secretaries of state do, as well. But the registrars in each county play an even bigger one.”</p>",
