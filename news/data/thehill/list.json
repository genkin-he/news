            "description": "<p>American and Iranian representatives had a terse exchange Saturday at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, hours after the U.S. and Israel <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5760747-trump-iran-regime-change/\">attacked</a> the Middle Eastern country with a barrage of missile strikes.</p>\n<p>“I advise to the representative of the United States to be polite,” Iranian Ambassador to the UN Amir Saeid Iravani said at the meeting. “It would be better for yourself and the country you represent.”</p>\n<p>His counterpart, U.S. Ambassador Mike Waltz, replied, “Frankly, I am not going to dignify this with another response, especially as this representative sits here in this body representing a regime that has killed tens of thousands of its own people and imprisoned many more simply for wanting freedom from your tyranny.”</p>\n<p>French President Emmanuel Macron called for the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5760591-un-security-council-emergency-meeting-iran-strikes/\">emergency session</a> earlier Saturday after news broke of the joint U.S.-Israeli strikes on Iran. He warned of “grave consequences for international peace and security” if the situation escalates.</p>\n<p>At the meeting, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres similarly said further escalation must be prevented, according to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-us-un-security-council-airstrikes-9140bca9241fb99be8cb3cff2c650741\">The Associated Press</a>.</p>\n<p>“The alternative,” he said, “is a potential wider conflict with grave consequences for civilians and regional stability.”</p>\n<p>Guterres also said the U.S. and Israeli airstrikes violated international law, including the UN Charter. Waltz countered by saying the United States is “taking lawful actions,” adding that Iran “cannot have a nuclear weapon.”</p>\n<p>Iravani said during the meeting that the strikes killed Iranian civilians, referring to the action as a war crime, the AP reported. President Trump announced earlier Saturday that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader for decades, was <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5760795-us-israel-strike-iran-khamenei/\">killed</a>.</p>\n<p>“We are stopping extremism before it becomes unstoppable,” Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon said at the Security Council meeting. “We will ensure that no radical regime armed with nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles can threaten our people or the entire world.”</p>\n<p>The European Commission, meanwhile, is planning to convene a “special Security College” about the strikes on Monday. </p>",

John Cornyn’s (R-Texas) Senate seat were vocal in their condemnation or support for the strikes. Most gave longer statements with state Rep. James Talarico (D) simply <a href=\"https://x.com/jamestalarico/status/2027780986138718385?s=20\">writing</a> the social platform X, “No more forever wars.”</p>\n<p>Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) slammed Trump for refusing “to even pretend that he cares about following the law.” She called the Senate election one of “life or death!”</p>\n<p>“CONGRESS, not the PRESIDENT, but CONGRESS has the EXCLUSIVE authority to declare war!” she <a href=\"https://x.com/JasmineForUS/status/2027744189945909495?s=20\">wrote on X</a>. “Speaker [Mike Johnson] needs to call us in IMMEDIATELY &amp; it is time for the House &amp; the Senate to pass a war powers resolution! This is how you prove your love and respect for the constitution.”</p>\n<p>“This is how you show your constituents that you are truly patriots!” she added. “It is time for us, collectively, as Dems and Repubs to stand up to this President. Please call your reps in the house and the senate and urge them to take a vote on a war powers resolution!”</p>\n<p>Republicans running for Cornyn’s seat –– including Cornyn himself –– praised the attack. Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-Texas) <a href=\"https://x.com/WesleyHuntTX/status/2027838846893699305\">wrote on X</a> that Trump “did it again. PEACE THROUGH AMERICAN STRENGTH!”</p>\n<p>Cornyn accused Iran of having its “tentacles of terror” destabilize the Middle East and wage “war on the West and our values” for decades. He then praised Trump for bringing about “an opening for these dark days to come to an end.”</p>\n<p>“It is my hope that the Iranian people, after years of oppression and being ignored by previous Democrat administrations, will finally be free, and I’m proud of the support being provided by President Trump and the United States,” Cornyn <a href=\"https://x.com/JohnCornyn/status/2027735472621912403?s=20\">wrote on X</a>. </p>\n<p>Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) <a href=\"https://x.com/KenPaxtonTX/status/2027759310202343661?s=20\">congratulated</a> Trump for his “courageous leadership.”</p>\n<p>Crockett leads Talarico 46 percent to 43.6 percent, according to the <a href=\"https://polls.decisiondeskhq.com/averages/primary-ballot-test/2026-tx-us-senate-dem/texas/lv-rv-adults-independents-democrats\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ)</a> polling average. <a href=\"https://polls.decisiondeskhq.com/averages/primary-ballot-test/2026-tx-us-senate-gop/texas/republicans-lv-rv-adults-independents\">DDHQ</a> has Paxton leading the Republican primary with 38 percent support, following by 35.3 percent for Cornyn and 17 percent for Hunt.</p>\n<p>News of the airstrikes also entered the Senate Democratic primary race in Maine as a topic of backlash. Candidate Graham Platner slammed Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), the latter of whom he could face in November if he wins the primary. Platner shared Fetterman’s <a href=\"https://x.com/SenFettermanPA/status/2027771338639679554\">post on X</a> applauding the strikes.</p>\n<p>“A man who has never seen war and never will, cheering this on from a comfortable perch in Washington,” Platner <a href=\"https://x.com/grahamformaine/status/2027791114497818936\">wrote</a>. “Every Senator who fails to stop this war should lose their seat, starting with @SenSusanCollins and @SenFettermanPA.”</p>\n<p>Collins’s other Democratic opponent, Gov. Janet Mills (D), called on the Republican lawmaker to use the power “she claims to have to conduct oversight, demand answers, and stand up to the clear abuses of the President.”</p>\n<p>“Trump’s unilateral military action against Iran is recklessly pushing the United States into a dangerous conflict in the Middle East, putting the men and women of our military into harm’s way and ignoring the Constitutional imperative to consult Congress,” Mills <a href=\"https://x.com/JanetMillsforME/status/2027792067603137020?s=20\">wrote on X</a>. “This is yet another abuse of power from a president who constantly disregards the rule of law.”</p>\n<p>Collins praised the attack on her official Senate <a href=\"https://x.com/SenatorCollins/status/2027877912008134848\">profile on X</a>, saying the U.S.’s “highly skilled and brave service members are in my prayers as they perform this mission.”</p>\n<p>“Sustained combat operations require full engagement with Congress,” she added. “There are important questions that will be discussed in the Senate’s classified briefings with Administration officials next week.”<a href=\"https://x.com/SenatorCollins/status/2027877912008134848\"></a></p>\n<p>The Texas primary is scheduled for March 3, with Maine’s primary set for June 9.</p>",

            "description": "<p>President Trump on Saturday said he will offer immunity to members of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), along with its military and police forces, after the U.S. and Israel <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5760747-trump-iran-regime-change/\">attacked the country</a> earlier in the day.</p>\n<p>“We are hearing that many of their IRGC, Military, and other Security and Police Forces, no longer want to fight, and are looking for Immunity from us,” Trump wrote on Truth Social where he also announced that Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5760795-us-israel-strike-iran-khamenei/\">was dead</a>. “As I said last night, ‘Now they can have Immunity, later they only get Death!'” </p>\n<p>“Hopefully, the IRGC and Police will peacefully merge with the Iranian Patriots, and work together as a unit to bring back the Country to the Greatness it deserves,” the president added. “That process should soon be starting in that, not only the death of Khamenei but the Country has been, in only one day, very much destroyed and, even, obliterated.”</p>\n<p>The president also said the U.S. bombing campaign on Iran could continue “uninterrupted” over the next week or “as long as necessary to achieve our objective of PEACE THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST AND, INDEED, THE WORLD!”</p>\n<p>The U.S. and Israel carried out a join operation, dubbed “Operation Epic Fury,” attacking the IRGC command and control facilities, ballistic missile and drone launch sites, military airfields and Iranian air defense systems. The attack took place at 1:15 a.m. EST, with Trump announcing the attack over an hour later in a video posted online. </p>\n<p>Iran’s Red Crescent counted over 200 people killed during the airstrikes, along with 750 people who were injured, according to Iranian state media. U.S. Central Command (Centcom) said it was looking into reports that strikes hit a girls’ school in southern Iran, which Iranian officials said killed more than 80 students. </p>\n<p>The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) said its strikes hit over 500 targets, including Iranian missile launchers and aerial defense systems. The IDF carried out its longest military flyover in history, with over 200 jets attacking Iran’s missile sites and the IRGC’s air defense systems in western and central Iran.</p>\n<p>Israel was one of the targets Iran <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5760555-gulf-unity-pushing-back-iran/\">retaliated against</a> following the initial attack, with drones and ballistic missiles also striking Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Each country warned it would retaliate if threatened.</p>\n<p>The strikes were met with praise from Republican lawmakers and condemnation from Democrats. Some Democratic members of Congress called for a quicker reconvening to force a House vote on a resolution to put a check on Trump’s war powers in check.</p>\n<p>Few Republicans have said they will back a war powers resolution, with Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) co-sponsoring it with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.). Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Wisc.) became the second Republican to back it. </p>\n<p>“Surely Congress can be troubled with a vote?” Davidson <a href=\"https://x.com/WarrenDavidson/status/2027882684739977448\">wrote Saturday</a> on the social platform X. “Surely any administration can define the mission?

            "title": "Why young voters are moving away from Trump",
            "description": "<p>Young voters are turning away from President Trump more sharply than any other major voting bloc. </p>\n<p>In 2024, Trump narrowed Democrats’ longstanding advantage with voters under 30, outperforming recent Republican presidential nominees and prompting talk of a generational shift for the GOP.</p>\n<p>But that same group now appears to be pulling back, with some questioning whether the president has delivered on the economy or on the broader promise of change that fueled his gains.</p>\n<p>A year ago, Trump was 7 points underwater among 18- to 29-year-olds, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/survey-research/cpr-polltracker/trumps-mired-approval-rating?check_logged_in=1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cook Political Report’s poll aggregator</a>, averaging 44.4 percent approval and 51.4 percent disapproval. Today, he is nearly 34 points underwater with the group, at 31.8 percent approval and 65.7 percent disapproval.</p>\n<p>Among all voters, Trump’s standing has also slipped, though less steeply. His net approval rating fell from negative 1.6 percentage points at the start of last March to negative 16 percentage points today.</p>\n<p>Rachel Janfaza, who researches youth voting trends, said Trump’s gains in 2024 reflected the broader cultural mood more than a fundamental ideological realignment.</p>\n<p>“In 2024, there was a culture shift with Trump 2.0, and Trump performed the best of any Republican candidate in years, primarily because he was selling a vision to make America great again at a time when young people were, and they still are, super fed up with the status quo and the state of things and didn’t want an extension of four years with Biden with four years of Kamala Harris,” said Janfaza, founder of <a href=\"https://www.theupandup.us/p/trumps-youth-favorability-drops-34-points-genz\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Up and Up</a>, a media and research firm focused on Generation Z.</p>\n<p>Many younger voters saw Trump as an answer to their economic concerns, facing a competitive job market, high rents and rising costs. While the Biden administration took steps to address those issues, many voters under 30 — most of whom were too young to vote in 2016 — viewed Trump as offering a fresh approach.</p>\n<p>“Trump was the counterculture at the time, whereas Biden and the Democrats were the mainstream,” Janfaza said. “For any young person kind of looking to rail against the status quo and the elite, that meant not voting for the Democratic ticket.”</p>\n<p>Young voters consistently cite economic issues as their top concern in political polling. Weekly surveys conducted by YouGov and The Economist show Trump’s approval rating among Americans younger than 30 falling more than 20 points — from 48 percent in late January 2025 to 25 percent in early February 2026. His approval rating on the economy dropped even further, down 27 points among the same demographic. Trump has also seen declines among younger voters on immigration, foreign policy and health care, though not to the same extent.</p>\n<p>Geoffrey Skelley, chief elections analyst at Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ), said he is “skeptical” that issues like health care or foreign policy are the primary drivers of Trump’s slide with young Americans. </p>\n<p>“When the economy is not doing great and people aren’t feeling good about the economy, it is easier, I think, to criticize a president’s focus on foreign policy because there’s a feeling of, like, ‘Well, things aren’t going well at home. Why are you focused as much on what’s going on abroad?’” Skelley said.</p>\n<p>“So I’m not trying to dismiss it,” he continued. “I just think, broadly speaking, the economic sentiments are the most important factor in Trump’s low approval, broadly, and certainly play in, to a large extent, to the frustration among young people.”</p>\n<p>Janfaza similarly said that while the economy and cost-of-living concerns are top of mind, younger voters often view other issues through that same lens. Trump’s focus on foreign policy or projects like the White House ballroom, she said, can reinforce doubts about whether the “America First” message that drew some young voters to his campaign still guides his administration.</p>\n<p>“It’s not just one thing that is making young people move away from Trump, but it’s a bunch of things. They’re all related. And at the end of the day, it kind of boils down to this idea of, like, ‘Is the president making life better for young people in this country or not?’ And a lot of young people feel like he’s not,” Janfaza said.</p>\n<p>The White House pushed back on that characterization, reaffirming its commitment “to delivering for the young Americans who played a key role in President Trump’s decisive Election Day victory: inflation has cooled, real wages are up, and median rents are at multi-year lows.”</p>\n<p>“Much work remains, but the President is aggressively moving forward on his agenda to increase housing and healthcare affordability, in addition to unleashing the job, wage, and economic growth that Americans experienced during his first term,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to The Hill.</p>\n<p>Some analysts argue that assumptions about a lasting conservative shift among young voters may have been overstated. Most Americans under 30 identify as independent, and a large share expresses skepticism toward both major parties. </p>\n<p>“I think what the 2024 election should teach anyone who’s trying to win an election is that young voters are swing voters. Young voters are up for grabs, and their vote has to be earned. And I think for a long time, it was sort of taken for granted by Democrats and also not really sought after by Republicans,” Janfaza said.</p>\n<p>“While many of them hold more lowercase-p progressive values, it doesn’t mean that they’re voting all the time for the capital-D Democratic candidate,” she continued.</p>\n<p>Skelley cautioned that it remains unclear how the trend will translate in upcoming elections. Midterms typically draw more highly engaged voters, meaning turnout among younger Americans tends to drop, “but that’s not necessarily indicative of a dramatic shift in voting patterns.”</p>\n<p>“You really can’t know that until the next presidential election, because there are less engaged, more inconsistent voters who are going to show up in a presidential election, who are not going to show up in a midterm, and we do know that that is the group of voters with whom Trump has done better.”</p>",

The joint operation from the U.S. and Israel follows weeks of negotiations between Iranian and American officials over the terms of a new nuclear deal. </p>\n<p>President Trump issued a stark <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/116147082884192486\">warning</a> to the Iranian regime in a video posted on Truth Social announcing “Operation Epic Fury” at 2:30 a.m. </p>\n<p>“The United States military is undertaking a massive and ongoing operation to prevent this very wicked and radical dictatorship from threatening America and our core national security interests,” Trump said. “We’re going to destroy their missiles and raise their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally — again — obliterated.”</p>\n<p>The president called the operation a “noble mission” and indicated the U.S. military is seeking a regime change.  </p>\n<p>“When we are finished, take over your government,” Trump said, directing his comments to the Iranian people. “It will be yours to take; this will be probably your only chance for generations.”</p>\n<p>The strikes followed a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-us-and-iran-to-hold-a-third-round-of-nuclear-talks-as-more-american-forces-deploy-to-the-mideast/\">third round of indirect talks</a> in Geneva on Thursday, which ended without an agreement. </p>\n<p>Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who mediated the talks, said he was “dismayed” by the news on Saturday morning. </p>\n<p>“Neither the interests of the United States nor the cause of global peace are well served by this,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/badralbusaidi/status/2027716606223388847?s=20\">posted</a> on the social platform X. “And I pray for the innocents who will suffer. I urge the United States not to get sucked in further. This is not your war.”</p>\n<p>Busaidi met with Vice President Vance a day before the U.S. launched this attack on Iran. The foreign minister is set to join CBS News’s Margaret Brennan on “Face the Nation” on Sunday. </p>\n<p>Republican members of Congress have <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5760326-republican-reaction-us-iran-strikes/\">lauded</a> the president for initiating these strikes.  </p>\n<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a long-time war hawk, commended Trump’s message.</p>\n<p>“His speech will go down in history as the catalyst for the most historic change in the Middle East in a thousand years. I echo President Trump’s call to the Iranian military, IRGC and security forces to lay down their arms,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/2027706424533422531\">wrote on social platform X</a>. “I echo his call to the Iranian people to take back their government.”</p>\n<p>Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, similarly expressed his support for Trump’s regime change promise.</p>\n<p>“The world, the Middle East, and especially the great people of Iran will be better off without Khomeini and his armies of terrorism,” Zinke <a href=\"https://x.com/RepRyanZinke/status/2027776456559051179?s=20\">posted</a> on X. “Now is the time for the people of Iran to take their country back.

John Fetterman (D-Penn.), has broken party lines to express his support for the operation, saying the operation is “right and necessary to produce real peace in the region” in an X <a href=\"https://x.com/SenFettermanPA/status/2027674658091204808\">post</a>. </p>\n<p>The strikes have <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5760287-lawmakers-call-war-powers-vote/\">elicited calls</a> from congressional Democrats and some Republican lawmakers to move up a vote on a war powers resolution this week. </p>\n<p>“<a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump </a>has launched a war on Iran and Congress must convene on Monday to vote on [Rep.] <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/thomas-massie/\">Thomas Massie’s </a>[R-Ky.] and my war powers resolution to stop this war,” Rep. <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/ro-khanna/\">Ro Khanna </a>(D-Calif.) said in a video posted on X. </p>\n<p>Khanna is also set to join NBC’s “Meet the Press” this Sunday. </p>\n<p>Additionally, foreign leaders have <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5760393-uk-france-germany-iran-strikes-negotiations/\">voiced opposition</a> to the operation, urging the U.S. and Iran to return to the negotiation table. </p>\n<p>“We call for a resumption of negotiations and urge the Iranian leadership to seek a negotiated solution. Ultimately, the Iranian people must be allowed to determine their future,” the leaders of Germany, France and the United Kingdom wrote in a joint statement. </p>\n<p>The UN National Security Council will convene on Sunday afternoon for an <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5760591-un-security-council-emergency-meeting-iran-strikes/\">emergency meeting</a> to discuss escalating tensions in the Middle East following these strikes. </p>\n<p>UN Secretary-General António Guterres spoke out against the strikes in a <a href=\"https://x.com/antonioguterres/status/2027754597700206618\">statement</a> shared on X.</p>\n<p>“I condemn today’s military escalation in the Middle East,” Guterres wrote. “The use of force by the United States and Israel against Iran, and the subsequent retaliation by Iran across the region, undermine international peace and security.”</p>\n<p>The strikes on Iran come as America gears up for primary elections in several states this upcoming week. Texas, North Carolina and Arkansas will hold primary elections on Tuesday. </p>\n<p>Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who is running in a competitive primary to defend his Senate seat, said the operation signals “an opening for these dark days to come to an end.”</p>\n<p>“It is my hope that the Iranian people, after years of oppression and being ignored by previous Democrat administrations, will finally be free, and I’m proud of the support being provided by President Trump and the United States,” Cornyn <a href=\"https://x.com/JohnCornyn/status/2027735472621912403\">posted</a> on X.</p>\n<p>U.S. House candidate Jack Schlossberg (D), who is running in a U.S. House race in New York, issued a call for “REGIME CHANGE IN THE UNITED STATES” in an X <a href=\"https://x.com/JBKSchlossberg/status/2027728973497565303?s=20\">post</a> on Saturday. </p>\n<p>In a later <a href=\"https://x.com/JBKSchlossberg/status/2027828549567062436\">post</a>, JFK’s grandson issued advice to other midterm candidates. </p>\n<p>“If you’re running for Congress, don’t mince words on questions of war and peace,” Schlossberg wrote. “This is simple. War will not bring stability, freedom to the Iranian people. It will bring destruction, chaos,  a massive bill and risk to US service members. </p>\n<p>The candidate is scheduled to join CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday morning. </p>\n<p>Additionally, “The Hill Sunday” will host a panel with Republican National Committee Chair Joe Gruters, Texas Democrats Chair Kendall Scudder and Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) on Sunday morning. </p>\n<p>The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee made headlines this week after it held separate closed-door deposition hearings with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Clinton as part of its investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. </p>\n<p>The Clintons maintained that they had no knowledge of Epstein’s criminal activities during lengthy testimony before the committee in Chappaqua, N.Y., on <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5756577-clintons-questioned-epstein-links/\">Thursday</a> and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5758942-bill-clinton-jeffrey-epstein-deposition/\">Friday</a>. </p>\n<p>Committee Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) is scheduled to join Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures” and is likely to discuss these hearings. </p>\n<p>See the full list of guests on the Sunday morning news shows below:</p>\n<p><strong>NewsNation’s “The Hill Sunday”:</strong> Sen.

            "description": "<p>Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) on Saturday ripped into Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Democratic lawmakers pushing for a war powers resolution to rein in President Trump after the U.S. and Israel carried out joint strikes on Iran.</p>\n<p>Lawler said the president must notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying troops or carrying out an attack, since “many of my Democrat colleagues don’t seem to understand the War Powers Act.”</p>\n<p>“The President must then withdraw troops within 60-90 days, unless Congress declares war,”<br/>Lawler <a href=\"https://x.com/lawler4ny/status/2027805378713440455\">wrote</a> on the social platform X. “In this instance, Congress was notified in advance and briefed before the strike on Iran. A full classified briefing will be forthcoming.”</p>\n<p>The New York Republican added that Congress can pass the resolution co-sponsored by Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), but Trump still has the authority to act under Article II of the Constitution. </p>\n<p>“The notion that this strike is illegal or that the President needed Congress’ authority is wrong,” Lawler said. “Furthermore, Biden and Obama conducted numerous strikes in numerous countries without Congress and none of the people screaming now, seemed to have any objections. For historical context, Congress has not declared war since WWII.”</p>\n<p>He <a href=\"https://x.com/lawler4ny/status/2027789731254137146\">also called</a> on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) to stop Democratic opposition to funding the Department of Homeland Security due to “the situtation in the Middle East and the potential for Iran and its terrorist proxies to attempt some type of attack.”</p>\n<p>Earlier in the day, Massie said he was “opposed to this war” and vowed to work with Khanna when Congress reconvenes to force a vote on a war powers resolution. </p>\n<p>“This is not ‘America First,'” Massie <a href=\"https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/2027739993033134279\">posted on X</a>. </p>\n<p>Following the U.S. attack, members of Congress called on convening earlier than planned to force a vote. Sen. Andy Kim (D-N.J.) called on senators to vote on Sen. Tim Kaine’s (D-Va.) version of a war powers resolution. </p>\n<p>“Trump once again started a cycle of violence that has already escalated and could spiral out of control,” Kim wrote in a post on X. “This is unacceptable. The Senate should vote on Senator Kaine’s War Powers Resolution immediately. I stand ready to do so today.”</p>\n<p>The large-scale operation dubbed “Operation Epic Fury” began at 1:15 a.m. ET, with strikes targeting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) command and control facilities, ballistic missile and drone launch sites, military airfields and Iranian air defense systems.</p>\n<p>The joint attack killed over 200 people in Iran and left almost 750 injured, Iran’s Red Crescent said to Iranian state TV, adding that the strikes hit 24 out of the 31 provinces. U.S. Central Command (Centcom) said it was looking into reports that strikes hit a girls’ school in southern Iran, which Iranian officials said killed more than 80 students. </p>\n<p>Iran retaliated with <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5760555-gulf-unity-pushing-back-iran/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">drone and missile strikes on U.S. bases</a> in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait, along with several attacks on Israel. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/lawler4ny/status/2027789731254137146\"></a></p>",

When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take; this will be probably your only chance for generations,” the prescient said in an 8-minute video. “America is backing you with overwhelming strength and devastating force. Now is the time to seize control of your destiny.”</p>",

            "description": "<p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday said she is against “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5760747-trump-iran-regime-change/\">regime change</a>” in Iran and accused President Trump of “dragging the United States into a war the American people don’t want.”</p>\n<p>“Let me be clear,” Harris wrote in a <a href=\"https://x.com/KamalaHarris/status/2027820065886777456\">statement</a> shared on the social platform X. “I am opposed to a regime-change war in Iran, and our troops are being put in harm’s way for the sake of Trump’s war of choice.”</p>\n<p>Harris called the U.S.-led strikes on Iran “a dangerous and unnecessary gamble” and accused her 2024 presidential opponent of lying on the campaign trail when he “promised to end wars rather than start them.”</p>\n<p>“Then last year, he said, ‘we obliterated’ Iran’s nuclear program. That, too, was a lie,” the former vice president said. </p>\n<p>Harris said she and former second gentleman Doug Emhoff will “be praying for all of our brave servicemen and women” and said they “deserve a Commander-in-Chief who approaches decisions on matters of war and peace with the same steadiness and discipline our troops show every day.”</p>\n<p>Harris also called the strikes “unwise, unjustified and not supported by the American people,” noting that Trump did not receive congressional approval to attack Iran. </p>\n<p>“There is no equivocation in our opposition to Donald Trump’s war of choice, and Congress must use all available power to prevent him from further committing us to this conflict,” she said. </p>\n<p>Harris, while campaigning for president in October 2024, called Iran America’s “greatest adversary” in an interview with “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJys7OVH24E\">60 Minutes</a>.” She accused the Middle Eastern country of having “American blood on their hands” and avoided “hypotheticals” when asked if she would take military action on Iran if they were building a nuclear weapon. </p>\n<p>The U.S. and Israel began the large-scale operation at 1:15 a.m. ET, targeting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) command and control facilities, ballistic missile and drone launch sites, military airfields and Iranian air defense systems. </p>\n<p>The joint mission killed over 200 people in Iran and left almost 750 injured, Iran’s Red Crescent said to Iranian state TV, adding that the strikes hit 24 out of the 31 provinces. U.S. Central Command (Centcom) said it was looking into reports that strikes hit a girls’ school in southern Iran, which Iranian officials said killed more than 80 students. </p>\n<p>The Israeli Air Force conducted the largest military flyover in the Israeli Defense Forces’ (IDF) history, with over 200 jets striking Iran’s missile sites and the IRGC’s air defense systems in western and central Iran, the IDF <a href=\"https://x.com/IDF/status/2027817570498142532\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. The IDF added that it hit over 500 targets, including Iranian missile launchers and aerial defense systems. </p>\n<p>The strikes come after weeks of worsening tensions and negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program left at a standstill. Trump and other administration officials said they wanted to see a diplomatic solution, but the president warned that he was considering a limited strike and said any conflict would not be a long one. </p>",

But the people of this country reject another endless war and will take to the streets now and make our voices heard,” stated <a href=\"https://www.answercoalition.org/iran\">Action Coalition</a>.</p>\n<p>The coalition listed several emergency protests scheduled earlier in the day and into Saturday afternoon across several cities. These cities include Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, New York City and more. </p>\n<p>Six more protests will be held on Sunday in Albany, N.Y.; Ellensburg, Va.; Chattanooga, Tenn.; Decorah, Iowa; Gainesville, Fla.; and Springfield, Mo.</p>\n<p>The coalition said Iran was engaged in diplomatic negotiations with the U.S. “up to the very last moment.”</p>\n<p>“Trump promised to bring peace to the world while he was running for office, but he has done nothing but left a trail of devastation the world over,” the coalition added. “Rather than making executives at oil companies and weapons manufacturers richer, our tax dollars should be used to meet people’s needs.”</p>\n<p>The coalition is made up of other organizations like the Palestinian Youth Movement, the Democratic Socialists of America, Code Pink and The People’s Forum, among other activist groups. </p>\n<p>Trump said in a video <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/116147082884192486\">posted to Truth Social</a> at 2:30 a.m. EST that the U.S. “began major combat operations in Iran.”</p>\n<p>“Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime, a vicous group of very hard, terrible people,” he added.</p>\n<p>Trump urged the Iranian people to reclaim their government from the regime that has controlled Iran since 1979. </p>\n<p>Iran struck back, launching missiles and drones toward Israel and across other countries allied with the U.S. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the retaliatory attack and <a href=\"https://x.com/IDF/status/2027662583344296185\">wrote</a> on the social platform X that Israel “has a right to defend itself.”</p>\n<p>Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/ali-khamenei/\">Ali Khamenei </a>was reportedly moved to a secure location as the attacks unfolded, according to <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/bulletin/news/ayatollah-ali-khamenei-alive-iran-supreme-leader-us-attack-b2929525.html\">multiple reports</a>.</p>\n<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Tehran is weighing its options following Saturday’s attack. When asked if he was a target, Araghchi said he did not know, adding that the U.S. and Israel “targeted everybody.” He cited one strike that killed 57 at a girls elementary school in southern Iran, upping a previous death toll of 40, according to Iranian state media.</p>",
