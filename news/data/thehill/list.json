            "title": "Some Republicans increasingly frustrated stock trading ban touted by Trump is stalled",
            "description": "<p>Some House Republicans are growing increasingly frustrated with leadership for not moving the ball quickly enough on a stock trading ban, an issue that has vexed Congress for years despite repeated bipartisan calls for reform.</p>\n<p>Last month, the House Administration Committee advanced a bill by Chairman Bryan Steil (R-Wis.) that would allow members of Congress, their spouses and their dependent children to hold onto the stocks they already own but prevent them from buying new ones. No action, however, has been taken on the bill since.</p>\n<p>And the lack of movement has pushed some rank-and-file Republicans to renew calls for a stock trading ban, especially after President Trump urged Congress to pass legislation on the matter during his State of the Union address Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>“If you have a strong bipartisan majority in Congress (supporting the issue), if you have overwhelming support from the public. You have the president of the United States specifically referencing it in the State of the Union, why pray tell is it not put on the floor?” Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) said.</p>\n<p>He added that a stock trading ban is long “overdue.”</p>\n<p>“It’s very frustrating,” Fitzpatrick said. “This should have been the first thing we took up.”</p>\n<p>Steil’s bill isn’t the only stock trading ban that’s been introduced.</p>\n<p>Fitzpatrick had endorsed a bipartisan bill last year sponsored by Reps. Chip Roy (R-Texas) and Seth Magaziner (D-R.I.), dubbed the “Restore Trust in Congress Act,” that would bar lawmakers, their spouses, dependent children and trustees from owning, buying or selling individual stocks.</p>\n<p>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) had introduced a discharge petition to force a vote on Roy and Magaziner’s bill; however, leadership ended up advancing Steil’s bill, dubbed the “Stop Insider Trading Act,” through committee.</p>\n<p>Trump urged members of Congress during his speech on Tuesday to pass Steil’s legislation “without delay.”</p>\n<p>Luna, referencing Trump’s speech, wrote on<a href=\"https://x.com/RepLuna/status/2026529605696274879\"> the social platform X</a>, “PASS THE STOP INSIDER TRADING ACT NOW!”</p>\n<p>“This is going to be a great vote. Banning insider trading needs to happen!” Luna wrote in a follow-up tweet.</p>\n<p>Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) told reporters on Wednesday that Steil’s bill will get a House vote “soon,” according to<a href=\"https://news.bgov.com/bloomberg-government-news/johnson-expects-vote-on-trump-backed-stock-buying-ban-soon?taid=699f1a469bba4c0001379f8c&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter\"> Bloomberg News.</a></p>\n<p>But complicating matters for Johnson is whether he has enough votes for the bill to pass. </p>\n<p>Johnson is currently operating with a 218-214 majority, meaning he can afford only one Republican defection and still pass party-line legislation. Virtually every Democrat will oppose Steil’s bill because the minority party is pushing for any ban to include the president, vice president and their families.</p>\n<p>Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) said he’s leaning towards opposing Steil’s bill, which he argues falls short of addressing the issue. He also said he doesn’t see the Senate taking up the bill, even if it did pass the House.</p>\n<p>“I think if they do, they’re going to pass something that’s totally different than what we have,” Burchett said. “And we don’t agree on it, and then they all giggle and laugh in both parties as it fails and they continue on their insider stock trading.”</p>\n<p>When asked why there’s been a stalled effort on a stock trading ban overall, Burchett said, “glaciers sprint past Congress.”</p>\n<p>“We move at a very record slow pace,” he said. “We always have, since I’ve been there under Democrats and under Republicans.”</p>\n<p>Fitzpatrick said he would support Steil’s bill because he believes it’s “incremental progress,” but he added that he doesn’t think it goes “far enough” to “fix the system.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, House Democrats introduced a discharge petition last month to force action on a bill banning members of Congress, the president, the vice president and their immediate families from owning, holding and trading stocks. Magaziner had introduced the bill last year, with support from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.).</p>\n<p>Democrats have blasted Steil’s bill, arguing that it doesn’t extend to the executive branch and allows members to still sell their existing stocks.</p>\n<p>“I want something to be very clear: That this bill that has been introduced by Republican leadership is not a congressional stock trading ban,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) told reporters last month. “It was written by and for the absolute wealthiest members of Congress to look like they are passing a ban, but … it actually creates a ton of new [avenues] by which they can own, buy and sell stock in even greater shadows from public opinion. … They can call it whatever they want, but it is not a stock trading ban.”</p>",

            "title": "The big new controversy over the Epstein files, explained",
            "description": "<p>When the Department of Justice released more than 3 million pages of documents relating to the convicted sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein on Jan. 30, the sheer volume of the material was dizzying.</p>\n<p>It always seemed plausible that important elements of the release would take time to emerge as reporters and researchers dug into the massive trawl.</p>\n<p>This is exactly what has happened. Major news outlets this week picked up on reporting, which first came from an independent journalist, about potentially vital documents that appear not to have been made publicly available.</p>\n<p>It’s a complicated story. Here’s what you need to know.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is the core of the controversy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Documents outlining three of four FBI interviews apparently related to a woman who accused President Trump, as well as Epstein, of sexually assaulting her decades ago, seem to be missing from the latest release. </p>\n<p>The woman made the claims in 2019, but they date back to the 1980s, when she was a minor.</p>\n<p>Her allegation against Trump is uncorroborated. The president has denied all wrongdoing in relation to his friendship with Epstein, which ended roughly two decades ago.</p>\n<p>Also, The Guardian late on Thursday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/26/trump-epstein-files-fbi\">published a story</a> in which it said its reporters had obtained the missing documents and that the woman’s claims “at times appear outlandish.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What’s the broader explanation? </strong></h2>\n<p>The latest release of the Epstein files includes a 2021 catalogue of material provided to Ghislaine Maxwell’s legal team. </p>\n<p>Maxwell, Epstein’s sometime-girlfriend, was tried and convicted of sex trafficking charges at the end of that year. The <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">data set</a> lists “non-testifying witness material.”</p>\n<p>It includes anonymized reference to four interviews relating to one person, who has the case number 3501.045.</p>\n<p>Of those four interviews, only one appears to have been publicly released. </p>\n<p>In that interview, the woman makes detailed allegations of rape by Epstein but makes no allegation of abuse against Trump. </p>\n<p>The president is mentioned only in relation to a friend sending the woman a photograph. In her interview with FBI agents, the woman notes she still has this photo saved in her cellphone messages but asks if she can crop it so it shows only Epstein.</p>\n<p>When she was asked why she wanted to crop the photo, she hesitated, and the notes reflect that her “attorney advised [she] was concerned about implicating additional individuals, and specifically any that were well known, due to fear of retaliation.” The photo, according to the FBI account of the interview, was “a widely distributed photograph” of Epstein and Trump.</p>\n<p>The strand of the Epstein story centering on this woman was first brought to light by independent journalist Roger Sollenberger.</p>\n<p>Sollenberger, and subsequently outlets including NPR, The New York Times and CNN, have traced details about the woman in question that match a woman who made the serious but unproven allegation of sexual assault against Trump.</p>\n<p>Some commentators have pointed to the fact that four interviews took place as a sign that investigators believed the woman to be credible. But her credibility would not, in itself, prove any specific claim to be true. Furthermore, The Guardian’s story noted that it had “identified a woman matching the biographical details in the FBI records. She has faced several fraud and theft charges in Washington and, in 2023, a felony charge for the exploitation of an elderly person in Georgia. It is not clear how those cases were resolved.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What does the DOJ and the White House have to say?</strong></h2>\n<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) is adamant that it has done nothing wrong and is not hiding anything for nefarious reasons.</p>\n<p>In one social media post earlier this week, the DOJ said that “NOTHING has been deleted.” The <a href=\"https://x.com/DOJRR47/status/2026366459375497413?s=20\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post asserted</a>: “ALL responsive documents have been produced unless a document falls within one of the following categories: duplicates, privileged, or part of an ongoing federal investigation.”</p>\n<p>This has not quelled disquiet around the story, however.</p>\n<p>The Hill <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5757945-trump-epstein-files-release/\">reported</a> on Thursday that several Republican senators were putting pressure on the DOJ to release all possible files. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), asked whether material containing this woman’s allegations should be held back, replied: “I don’t know how else to say it: Release the documents.”</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the DOJ said that it was conducting a review because “several individuals and news outlets have recently flagged files related to documents produced to Ghislaine Maxwell.” </p>\n<p>It <a href=\"https://x.com/DOJRR47/status/2026769082159112295?s=20\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">added that if any file</a> was discovered to have been kept out of the public eye when it should not have been, “the Department will of course publish it, consistent with the law.”</p>\n<p>Trump has not addressed this specific element of the controversy in any in-depth way, but, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5746028-trump-responds-prince-andrew-arrest/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">speaking with reporters</a> last week, he claimed he had “been totally exonerated” in the Epstein matter. </p>\n<p>White House statements to multiple news outlets this week have echoed that claim.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What about Democrats</strong>?</h2>\n<p>Democrats, especially those serving on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which has been probing the Epstein matter, have been scathing.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the House Oversight Democrats’s <a href=\"https://x.com/OversightDems/status/2026781758897717280?s=20\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">account on the social platform X</a> asserted: “The Department of Justice continues to change its story. The facts are clear: documents related to a survivor who accused Donald Trump and Jeffery Epstein of abuse when she was a minor are missing from the released files.” </p>\n<p>Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), the committee’s ranking member, told MS NOW on Tuesday that he had gone to the Department of Justice in person to probe the matter further.</p>\n<p>“Those additional documents <a href=\"https://x.com/RepRobertGarcia/status/2026421331844280785?s=20\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">seem to be missing</a>,” Garcia said, “and that’s something that I confirmed as of yesterday in my visit to the Department of Justice. The idea that there is a possible cover-up or that we are hiding actual documentation of an alleged crime by the President of the United States … is incredibly serious.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Where does the story go from here?</strong></h2>\n<p>The focus on the story has become so intense that pressure for disclosure of the interview notes is intense. However, the new reporting from The Guardian may dilute at least some of that pressure.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the problem for those pressing for disclosure is, if the DOJ says it has valid reasons for not making the interviews public, it is hard to definitively prove them wrong.</p>",

            "title": "Trump looms large in Texas as GOP gears up for Senate primary",
            "description": "<p>President Trump is looming large over Texas as the Lone Star State’s GOP gears up for competitive primaries next week. </p>\n<p>The president is set to stop in Corpus Christi on Friday, just days after his State of the Union address and as Texas voters cast their ballots in a high-stakes, three-way Republican primary race for Sen. John Cornyn’s (R-Texas) seat in the Senate.  </p>\n<p>While Trump is visiting the state in an official capacity, observers are eager to see if the president has anything to say about the closely watched primary, with Texas Democrats feeling increasingly optimistic about their chances in November.  </p>\n<p>Trump <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5717394-trump-texas-republican-senate-endorsement/\">told reporters</a> earlier this month that he was taking a “serious look” at endorsing in the Texas Senate race. Two weeks later, he said he was still undecided, even as he <a href=\"https://thetexan.news/elections/2026/trump-endorses-in-several-key-texas-congressional-seats-ahead-of-2026-primary-election/article_d1e2bc69-6161-432a-8ba9-f55e48ef5cc1.html\">issued support</a> for several other candidates in the state. </p>\n<p>“I like all three of them, actually. Those are the toughest races. They’ve all supported me. They’re all good,” Trump said on Feb. 17. “You’re supposed to pick one, so we’ll see what happens. But I support all three,” the president said of the primary’s leading candidates. </p>\n<p>Cornyn, seeking a fifth term in the Senate, is locked in a competitive race with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) and Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-Texas) — all three of whom have flexed their conservative bona fides and underscored their alignment with the president.  </p>\n<p>“When you have a 24-year incumbent U.S. senator and you don’t endorse him, that’s a pretty big tell to the electorate, especially a Texas ruby red primary electorate, one Republican strategist, referring to Cornyn, told The Hill. </p>\n<p>“It’s not an endorsement against Cornyn,” the strategist added. “But when you have the president and your fellow junior senator [Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas)] not willing to endorse you in the primary, people get that and primary voters get that.”  </p>\n<p>All three contenders are slated to attend Trump’s Friday remarks in Corpus Christi, with Paxton’s campaign <a href=\"https://x.com/RenzoDowney/status/2027092679385907523?s=20\">reportedly rescheduling a planned event</a> so the Texas’ attorney general can see the president ahead of the March 3 contest. </p>\n<p>Paxton boasts a 1-point lead over Cornyn — with 34 percent and 33 percent, respectively —according to Decision Desk HQ’s <a href=\"https://polls.decisiondeskhq.com/averages/primary-ballot-test/2026-tx-us-senate-gop/texas/republicans-lv-rv-adults-independents\">polling aggregate</a>. But neither appears poised to secure the support they need to win the primary outright. Hunt, whose bid has been seen as a longshot, is pulling in roughly 20 percent support.  </p>\n<p>If no candidate wins over 50 percent of the vote on Tuesday, the race will head to a May 26 runoff between the top two vote-getters.  </p>\n<p>“Around the primary, the number one issue appears to be: who can differentiate themselves as the closest to the president?” Josh Blank, research director for the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, told The Hill last week. </p>\n<p>“If they have an endorsement, that’s the best-case scenario,” he continued. “But outside of that, you’re seeing a lot of advertisements that show, in one way or another, that candidate’s closeness to the president, or even just the president’s orbit.”  </p>\n<p>A Trump endorsement could be a game-changer in the close race, though experts say that the possibility of one coming before the primary is increasingly unlikely as Tuesday nears.  </p>\n<p>Texans have already started to vote, and an endorsement may be more likely after the primary, especially if it tips into the expected runoff. </p>\n<p>While Democrats are outpacing Republicans in early vote turnout, GOP turnout is higher than past years.  </p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/26/politics/texas-democratic-primary-early-voting-data\">CNN</a>, early turnout on the GOP side is 15 percent higher than it was at this point in 2022.  </p>\n<p>“These are pretty high number for Republicans too, which conceivably could help Cornyn, but when you get to a runoff in Texas, it’s a much more constricted, more redder, much more conservative voting bloc,” the GOP strategist said.  </p>\n<p>If Trump weighed in, “it absolutely would affect Republican primary voters’ choices,” James Dickey, a former Texas GOP chair, said. </p>\n<p>Blank, though, suggested that Trump’s backing may not hold as much weight in the Senate race as in other Texas contests, since GOP voters are largely engaged in the race and both leading candidates, whom have won statewide elections, have their own faithful bases.</p>\n<p>And, although Trump has long <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5721161-trump-kingmaker-republican-candidates/\">been a kingmaker</a> in Republican primaries, he had a notable slipup in the state earlier this month. The president endorsed the Republican candidate in a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5716988-democrats-score-upset-texas/\">special election runoff</a> for Texas’s ninth state Senate district — but the Democrat contender overperformed, winning the seat by roughly 14 points.  </p>\n<p>Cornyn, who told NBC News that he spoke to Trump about a possible endorsement last month, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5744208-cornyn-warns-of-massacre-if-paxton-beats-him-in-texas-gop-primary/\">has warned</a> of a “massacre” for the GOP in Texas if Paxton gets the nod, pointing to controversy around the state attorney general. Paxton was impeached by the Texas House in 2023 on corruption charges, then later acquitted by the state Senate. </p>\n<p>Republicans’ national Senate campaign arm has made a similar case. In a February memo, argued that Cornyn is “the only Republican candidate who reliably wins a general election matchup.” </p>\n<p>And Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) also told Semafor earlier this month that he’s cautioned Trump “many times” on consequences for the party if Cornyn isn’t the Texas Senate GOP nominee. </p>\n<p>The warnings come as Republicans have raised concerns over their support among Hispanic voters, including in Texas. According to VoteHub data <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2026/02/06/texas-senate-district-9-taylor-rehmet-latino-voters-swing-democrats/\">cited in the Texas Tribune</a> earlier this month, 79 percent of Hispanic voters backed the Democrat in the state Senate District 9 special election this month.  </p>\n<p>Paxton’s team, however, has emphasized his double-digit wins in past elections, as well as his lead over Cornyn in the polls.  </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Hunt’s team last week blasted national Republicans’ “misguided investment in a 24-year incumbent.”  </p>\n<p>Friday’s trip is Trump’s first public event since delivering his State of the Union address on Tuesday, where he acknowledged the devastating flooding that tore through the state last year as part of a wide-ranging speech on his administration’s accomplishments.  </p>\n<p>“President Trump looks forward to returning to the great State of Texas this week to discuss the economy and tout his ‘Drill Baby Drill’ agenda,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to The Hill.  </p>\n<p>Even if an endorsement in the Senate race doesn’t come before Tuesday’s primary, Trump’s presence will be closely watched as Texas kick’s off the midterm cycle with primaries up and down the ballot.  </p>\n<p>“I’m never one to try to [predict] what the President will or will not do, but…he will be in Corpus Christi [Friday],” Texas Republican Vinny Minchillo consultant told The Hill via email.  “Does he endorse? And who? If it’s Cornyn I don’t believe it will be enough to help him avoid a runoff.”  </p>",

            "description": "<p>Vice President Vance on Thursday defended the U.S. <a href=\"https://thehill.com/newsletters/defense-national-security/5755848-on-eve-of-nuclear-talks-trump-hits-iran-with-new-sanctions/\">potentially</a> launching military strikes on Iran, saying there was “no chance” that it would lead to a longer war in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>Vance said in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2026/02/26/vance-no-chance-us-will-be-drawn-out-war-middle-east/\">The Washington Post</a> that the strikes would be a deterrent to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon unless the issue is solved diplomatically. </p>\n<p>“The idea that we’re going to be in a Middle Eastern war for years with no end in sight — there is no chance that will happen,” he said.</p>\n<p>The vice president said he does not know how President Trump will act on Iran, saying that he and the president are “skeptic[s] of foreign military interventions.”</p>\n<p>Vance chuckled when the Post asked if he, given the Marine veteran’s past criticisms of the Iraq War, could have seen himself as part of an administration interested in bringing about regime change. He said that life “has all kinds of crazy twists and turns” and said Trump is an “America First president.”</p>\n<p>“I do think we have to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past,” Vance added. “I also think that we have to avoid overlearning the lessons of the past. Just because one president screwed up a military conflict doesn’t mean we can never engage in military conflict again. We’ve got to be careful about it, but I think the president is being careful.”</p>\n<p>Vance reiterated that the administration prefers a diplomatic outcome to the current standoff. But, he said, that “depends on what the Iranians do and what they say.”</p>\n<p>Tensions have risen between leaders in Washington, D.C., and in Tehran over Iran’s nuclear program. Trump has threatened Iran with military action over the program, despite previously claiming the U.S. “obliterated” it <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5362470-us-iran-bombing-takeaways/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">during strikes against the country</a> in June.</p>\n<p>The president also threatened military actions over the government’s crackdown on dissent following massive anti-government protests last month. </p>\n<p>The administration has <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5709342-iran-us-strike-tension-middle-east/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">amassed a major military contingent</a> in the Middle East amid negotiations, with Trump previously saying he is considering a limited strike. </p>\n<p>Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned of retaliation if the U.S. were to strike. Iranian officials have argued that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, claiming that uranium enrichment is a national right.</p>\n<p>Talks on Thursday in Oman showed “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5757110-us-iran-talks-oman-complete/\">significant progress</a>,” according to Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi. </p>\n<p>Some congressional lawmakers plan to hold a vote on a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5753315-trump-iran-military-force-resolution-fails/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">war powers resolution</a> to block Trump from carrying out strikes on Iran without approval from Congress. Democrats largely back the bipartisan call for a resolution, co-led by Reps. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.). </p>\n<p>Republican Rep. Warren Davidson (Ohio) joined Massie in <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5757526-davidson-massie-back-resolution-iran/\">pledging to support</a> the resolution. He argued that “no case has been made” in favor of striking Iran.</p>\n<p>House Democrats have said they will <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5756657-democrats-trump-iran-war-powers/\">force a vote</a> to limit the president’s war powers next week.</p>",

            "description": "<p>The U.S. military shot down a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) drone with a laser in Texas on Thursday, according to Democratic lawmakers, prompting the closure of <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/transportation/5736518-faa-el-paso-airspace-closure/\">airspace</a> near the U.S.-Mexico border. </p>\n<p>Democratic Reps. Rick Larsen (Wash.), Bennie Thompson (Miss.) and Andre Carson (Ind.) said in a joint <a href=\"https://x.com/transportdems/status/2027198549608317278?s=46\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> Thursday evening that the Pentagon reportedly shot down a CBP drone using “high-risk counter-unmanned aircraft system.” </p>\n<p>The trio criticized the White House “sidestepping” a bipartisan bill to train drone operations and address the lack of communication between the Department of Homeland Security, Pentagon and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). </p>\n<p>“Now, we’re seeing the result of its incompetence,” they said in a statement. </p>\n<p>The incident prompted the FAA to close the airspace near Fort Hancock, Texas. </p>\n<p>The FAA told The Hill that a temporary flight restriction (TFR) was already in place around the Fort Hancock area and has been expanded include a “greater radius to ensure safety.” The TFR does not impact commercial flights.  </p>\n<p>The Hill has reached out to the Pentagon, CBP and the White House for comment. </p>\n<p>The incident marks the second time this month that a laser was used in Texas and caused a closure of airspace. The CBP used a laser, lent by the Pentagon, to fire in the airspace near Fort Bliss, causing the FAA to shut down air traffic at the El Paso airport. </p>\n<p>Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), the ranking member on the Senate’s Aviation Subcommittee, said the situation is “alarming” and demanded a “thorough, independent” investigation. </p>\n<p>“As Ranking Member of the Aviation Subcommittee, I will be calling on the Inspectors General of the Departments of Defense, Transportation and Homeland Security to launch a joint investigation into the recent scandals in El Paso and now Fort Hancock,” Duckworth said in a statement Thursday night. </p>",

Four men on the boat were killed while six others were wounded and taken into custody. </p>\n<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also Cuban American, said the U.S. government is conducting their own investigation into the incident because it does not trust the Cuban version of events.</p>\n<p>Thursday, the Cuban Ministry of the Interior identified the individuals as:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Cristian Ernesto Acosta Guevara</li>\n<li>Conrado Galindo Serrior</li>\n<li>José Manuel Rodríguez Castelló</li>\n<li>Leordán Cruz Gomez of Tampa</li>\n<li>Amijail Sanchez Gonzalez</li>\n<li>Roberto Alvarez Avila</li>\n<li>Pavel Alling Peña</li>\n<li>Michael Ortega Casanova of Tampa</li>\n<li>Ledián Padrón Guevara</li>\n<li>Hector Duani Cruz Correa</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last four people on the list were said to be deceased. The others are in Cuban custody.</p>\n<p>According to the Cuban government, weapons were found on the boat, including “assault rifles, sniper rifles, pistols, Molotov cocktails, multiple assault equipment including night vision equipment, bulletproof vests, assault bayonets, camouflage clothing, ammunition of various calibers, food for combat use, means of communication, and a large number of monograms of counterrevolutionary terrorist organizations.”</p>\n<p>The statement continued:</p>\n<p>“Right from the start, Cuban authorities have been in touch with their U.S. counterparts, including the State Department and the Coast Guard, about this terrorist attempt. An investigation is underway to clarify the facts with the utmost rigor. The Cuban government is willing to exchange information with the US government on this matter.

            "title": "Denver mayor bans federal immigration agents from city property",
            "description": "<p>Denver Mayor Mike Johnston (D) on Thursday announced that federal <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5143719-denver-public-schools-dhs-ice-policy-trump-immigration-crackdown/\">immigration agents</a> are banned from city property while also mandating Denver law enforcement to protect protesters.</p>\n<p>Johnston issued the ban via an executive order. The order mandates that Denver police and sheriff’s deputies document federal immigration officers with body cameras, give life-saving aid to someone harmed by federal officers and “to intervene in instances of force that could cause death or serious bodily injury by immigration enforcement agents,” among other provisions. </p>\n<p>“We seek not to provoke but to protect,” Johnston said in a <a href=\"https://denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Mayors-Office/News/2026/Executive-Order-152\">statement</a>. “In a time of great fear, we are reminding Denverites that there are still those you can trust and lines you can’t cross. Our law enforcement and legal teams will stand up for civil liberties, and, if necessary, step in to protect the life and safety of our residents.</p>\n<p>“This is our city, and we will defend the rights of every person in it,” he added.</p>\n<p>A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson called the executive order “legally illiterate.”</p>\n<p>“Enforcing federal immigration laws is a clear federal responsibility under Article I, Article II and the Supremacy Clause,” the spokesperson said in a statement to The Hill. “While Mayor Johnston continues to release pedophiles, rapists, gang members, and murderers onto their streets, our brave law enforcement will continue to risk their lives to arrest these heinous criminals and make Denver safe again.”</p>\n<p>The order <strong>is</strong> symbolic, as Denver and the state of Colorado do not have the power to stop federal immigration officers from conducting operations, even in the face of the state’s sanctuary laws.</p>\n<p>Johnston’s executive order comes amid President Trump’s immigration crackdown in Democratic-led states. His deportation agenda faced major pushback in Minnesota, after officials accused the administration of federal overreach. </p>\n<p>This was exacerbated by the shooting deaths of two U.S. citizens, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, in Minneapolis last month, which led to further outcry after Trump administration officials accused them of “domestic terrorism.”</p>\n<p>Other states have acted on how local law enforcement will interact with ICE. Earlier this month, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) signed into law a bill banning cooperation agreements between sheriffs and ICE. Wicomico County Sheriff Michael Lewis on Wednesday <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5758182-ice-maryland-sheriffs-law-enforcement/\">accused the new law</a> of putting “politics over public safety.”</p>\n<p>Democratic lawmakers called for dramatic reform within DHS and for ICE. Some House Democrats backed an appropriations bill to fund DHS last month. Pretti’s death drew Democratic senators away from the backing the bill, resulting in an ongoing shutdown.</p>",

            "title": "ICE, Maryland sheriffs slam new state law prohibiting cooperation agreements",
            "description": "<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5751540-maryland-challenges-ice-detention/\">ICE</a>) and Maryland sheriffs on Thursday slammed a new state law that bars cooperation agreements between federal immigration officers and local authorities.</p>\n<p>ICE accused Maryland lawmakers of allowing Americans to become “hurt or, worse, killed by criminal aliens,” the agency <a href=\"https://x.com/ICEgov/status/2027135506560000371\">posted</a> on the social platform X. The post included a video of Wicomico County Sheriff Michael Lewis describing the new law as “politics over public safety,” a video also shared by the White House’s <a href=\"https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2027048640183726275\">Rapid Response X profile.</a></p>\n<p>“And we, as elected sheriffs, are fed up with it,” he said, adding that he and other sheriffs “have to come together in unison to stop the ridiculousness that’s going on up here in Annapolis, Maryland. Lawmakers need to wake up and realize the American people want public safety over politics, and they’re not getting it!”</p>\n<p>Sheriffs from seven Maryland counties gathered in Annapolis on Wednesday to speak out against another bill, the Community Trust Act, that would restrict ICE’s interaction with local police even further, <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/2026/02/25/maryland-sheriffs-opposition-immigration-bills/\">The Baltimore Sun</a> reported. </p>\n<p>The bill would prohibit local police from investigating or arresting a person based on their citizenship status and would prevent them from notifying or transferring potential suspects to ICE without a warrant.</p>\n<p>Gov. Wes Moore (D) signed a law banning 287(g) agreements in the state, which allows ICE to deputize local law enforcement officers to carry out immigration enforcement. In the two weeks since it became law, local sheriffs have vowed to continue working with ICE in an informal capacity, which could soon also be prohibited.</p>\n<p>“Federal law enforcement handcuffs are considerably larger than state police handcuffs, than sheriff’s deputies’ handcuffs, than local law enforcement handcuffs,” Lewis said, according to the Sun. “Who are we to tell them how to do their job?”</p>\n<p>Even Moore’s predecessor, former Gov. Larry Hogan (R), said that local police will “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5746598-hogan-moore-ice-law-dispute/\">ignore</a>” the new law. </p>\n<p>“So I get the whole, you know, overreach and overstep and doing the wrong things, but, you know, when they have violent criminals that they’re holding in jail that ICE wants to be detained, they, you know, they shouldn’t be let back on the street,” Hogan said at Politico Live’s “Governors Summit.” “So there’s two sides to this argument.”</p>\n<p>Moore <a href=\"https://governor.maryland.gov/news/press/pages/Governor-Moore-Signs-Legislation-to-Prohibit-Maryland-Jurisdictions-from-Deputizing-Officers-for-Federal-Civil-Immigration-.aspx\">previously said</a> the new law “draws a clear line: we will continue to work with federal partners to hold violent offenders accountable, but we refuse to blur the lines between state and federal authority in ways that undermine the trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.”</p>\n<p>Moore and other Democrats have accused ICE officers of breaking the law in recent months, citing an excessive use of force and racial discrimination. And after two U.S. citizens were killed by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis last month, the Maryland governor and others have also condemned the actions by the Department of Homeland Security’s agencies.</p>\n<p>Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) last month called for “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5695169-van-hollen-ice-reform-criticism/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dramatic reform</a>” within ICE and accused ICE officers of breaking the law and acting “completely lawless.”</p>",
