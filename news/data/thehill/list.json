            "title": "Members' video raises issues of sedition and free speech",
            "description": "<p>Last Nov. 18, six members of Congress — all Democrats and all former military or intelligence veterans — posted a 90-second video in which they urged active military personnel to not obey illegal orders.</p>\n<p>The six members included Sens. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), and Reps. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), Chris Deluzio (D-Pa.), Maggie Goodlander (D-N.H.), and Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.).</p>\n<p>They knew exactly what they were doing. Although the video was not explicit about what illegal orders they had in mind, it is generally understood they were incensed by President Trump’s decisions to bomb alleged drug-running boats in the Caribbean and to deploy National Guard troops in American cities to help round-up illegal immigrants. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title10-section892&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Article 92</a> of the Uniform Code of Military Justice makes clear that service members must obey lawful orders or face potential serious punishment, including court martial. The article also makes clear that members of the armed forces may not only refuse to obey a manifestly illegal order, but have a duty to do so. The courts have held that for an order to be considered manifestly illegal, the unlawfulness must be clear and obvious, such as targeting civilians.</p>\n<p>The six video contributors were quite aware that their social media posting would likely anger Trump. Two days later, on Nov. 20, the president lashed out at the lawmakers, saying they should be arrested and tried for sedition: “TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP?????.” In a subsequent post the president left no doubt as to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-military-traitors-sedition-illegal-orders-c5fc3c5bd2fbc6b1204550e4203c24b2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">where he stood</a>: “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH.”</p>\n<p>Trump’s outrage was quickly absorbed by his loyal lieutenants at the departments of Justice and Defense. At Justice, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro convened a grand jury to indict the six members for their conduct. Due to grand jury secrecy, the specific charges were not made known, even to the accused members. In short order, though, the 20-person grand jury <a href=\"http://Jeanine%20Pirro,%20convened%20a%20grand%20jury%20to%20indict%20the%20six%20members%20for%20their%20conduct\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rejected Pirro’s request for an indictment</a>.</p>\n<p>Meantime, the Department of Defense was going full bore on investigating and punishing Kelly, but not the other five members. As Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth explained, Kelly was the only one of the six who had “formally” retired and therefore was subject to being recalled to duty and punished, even though his alleged offenses occurred after his retirement.</p>\n<p>On Jan. 5, Hegseth issued a “Secretarial Letter of Censure” to Kelly, based on a determination that he had exhibited conduct that is “prejudicial to good order and discipline in the Armed Forces…and [is] unbecoming an officer.”</p>\n<p>Although the Defense secretary downplayed the seriousness of the censure letter as “a necessary process step” to proceedings that could lead to Kelly’s demotion in rank and retirement pay, it is clear from the Code of Military Justice that censure is, in fact, already a finding of guilt and form of punishment.   </p>\n<p>In the censure letter Hegseth elaborated on numerous instances in which Kelly had been critical of administration policies, and accused “me and senior military officers of war crimes and to frame resistance to lawful orders….”</p>\n<p>Hegseth concluded his censure letter by informing Kelly of his “right to submit a written rebuttal. … However, you do not have a right to appeal this administrative action.” After receiving a recommendation from the secretary of the Navy, Hegseth said a determination would be made as to whether Kelly’s rank as captain would be reduced, and, with it, his commensurate retirement benefits.</p>\n<p>Kelly circumvented the meaningless rebuttal that would go nowhere other than into his personal file, and instead filed in the U.S. District Court for D.C. his motion that the censure be blocked. On Feb. 12, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/kelly-hegseth-pentagon-trump-censure.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blocked the Pentagon’s censure</a>, based primarily on grounds that Kelly’s free speech rights had been violated: “This court has all it needs to conclude that defendants have trampled on Senator Kelly’s First Amendment freedoms and threatened the constitutional liberties of millions of military retirees.”  </p>\n<p>Hegseth <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5753909-defense-secretary-appeals-senator-kelly/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">appealed the ruling on Tuesday</a>. Interestingly, Kelly did not emphasize in his own defense his immunity as a senator from being questioned in any other place for any “speech or debate” relating to his official duties in Congress. Moreover, Judge Leon did not highlight that constitutional shield members of Congress enjoy. </p>\n<p>While that additional argument may have some bearing on appeal, Leon and Kelly wanted to make clear that the more important issue is in protecting all Americans from government retribution for their public utterances.</p>\n<p><em>Don Wolfensberger is a 28-year congressional staff veteran culminating as chief of staff of the House Rules Committee in1995.

The Baltic serves as a gateway for Russia into the Atlantic and, more broadly, onto the global stage. </p>\n<p>Given the importance of the Baltic Sea area to the balance of power in the Euro-Atlantic, it should be a major focus of U.S. foreign policy. America must work with like-minded partners and allies to protect the world from falling under the influence and control of Russia, China and Iran. It can do so in the Baltic by having a strategy in place with political, diplomatic, military and economic options to advance its posture in the region. </p>\n<p>Greater military engagement with NATO littoral Baltic Sea states can strengthen deterrence and sea denial strategy in critical areas, including air defense, mine sweeping and antisubmarine warfare, that can hold the region at risk should Russia behave more aggressively there. </p>\n<p>Working closely with Poland is key. Warsaw is tightening its <a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/feature/a-curtain-of-iron-can-contain-russia-in-europe\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">security links with Nordic and Baltic partners</a> while modernizing its naval assets to provide a capable force to defend interests in the Baltic. This is part of Warsaw’s ambitious northern framework policy, which by 2028 aims to host a regional <a href=\"https://dailymare.com/news/polmafor-poland-to-host-natos-new-regional-maritime-command,1852\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NATO maritime command</a> in Gdynia to strengthen the Baltic’s security architecture in cooperation with regional partners, including Germany and Sweden. </p>\n<p>In addition, the U.S. should consider resourcing exportable defense packages to Baltic Sea littoral states (radars, jammers) while enabling the U.S. Navy to rotate mobile hard-defense detachments into the region to work with allies to protect coastlines, commercial assets, and infrastructure and energy arteries. This should include frequent and continuous port calls or maritime operations by cruisers and destroyers as well as smaller ships that can bolster coastal defense capabilities. </p>\n<p>Helping partners ensure freedom of navigation on the Baltic Sea will directly impact trade and commerce, contributing to the prosperity of regional states as well as the U.S. The states in this region are among Europe’s most attractive, up-and-coming trade and business partners — Poland is the first post-communist country to reach <a href=\"https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7786/artykul/3574113,poland-joins-elite-1-trillion-economy-club-as-growth-outpaces-major-powers\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$1 trillion GDP</a> per capita, joining an exclusive group of just 20 nations. </p>\n<p>Engaging in measures further securing the Baltic as Central and Eastern Europe’s energy-import corridor are in Washington’s interest. Regional states are consumers of U.S. liquefied natural gas, which accounts for about <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-share-europes-lng-imports-increased-60-january-2026-01-30/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">60 percent of Europe’s supply</a>.

Strong congressional bipartisan support exists toward the region and littoral states, which are seen as among America’s closest allies. For this reason, Congress should urge the Trump administration to draft a Baltic Sea strategy as a necessary element of the U.S. policy toolbox.</p>\n<p>A free and open Baltic will foster economic and other connectivity between Europe, North America and the world. Most importantly, it would counter Putin’s “arc of crisis” from further destabilizing the transatlantic space while advancing America’s interests.  </p>\n<p><em><u><a href=\"https://pism.pl/analysts/Pawel_Markiewicz_en\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pawel Markiewicz</a></u> is a historian of 20th century Central and Eastern Europe.

            "description": "<p>Børge Brende resigned as president and CEO of the World Economic Forum (WEF) amid revelations regarding his ties to Jeffrey Epstein.</p>\n<p>Brende <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/press/2026/02/press-statement-from-co-chairs-andre-hoffmann-and-larry-fink-on-behalf-of-the-board-of-trustees/\">wrote in a WEF release</a> he decided to step down “after careful consideration” from a role he has occupied since 2017. He did not mention the late convicted sex offender.</p>\n<p>“My time here, spanning 8½ years, has been profoundly rewarding,” Brende added. “We have seen a record number of partners join us, and we have had a very successful Annual Meeting in Davos behind us, where we engaged with governmental leaders from all over the world like never before. </p>\n<p>“I am grateful for the incredible collaboration with my colleagues, partners, and constituents, and I believe now is the right moment for the Forum to continue its important work without distractions.”</p>\n<p>The WEF <a href=\"https://thehill.com/business/5726336-brende-wef-epstein-emails-dinners-probe/\">launched a probe</a> into Brende earlier this month, after documents released by the Department of Justice revealed he attended multiple “business dinners” with Epstein and exchanged emails and <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01612631.pdf\">text messages</a> with the sex offender, years after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to procuring a child for prostitution and soliciting a prostitute.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02258065.pdf\">September 2018</a>, Brende emailed with Lesley Groff, an assistant to Epstein, regarding a dinner at the disgraced financier’s Manhattan home. He also emailed with an assistant to Epstein, whose name is redacted, regarding a dinner at the home in June 2019 — weeks before the convicted sex offender was <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/jeffrey-epstein-charged-manhattan-federal-court-sex-trafficking-minors\">arrested and charged</a> with trafficking minors for sex.</p>\n<p>Brende and Epstein also <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01612631.pdf\">exchanged messages in 2019</a>, with the latter sending the former what appears to be a photo of a woman he called “mss piggy.” In June 2019, Brende told Epstein he just “met your friend POTUS,” seemingly referring to President Trump. The president has denied wrongdoing in connection to Epstein. </p>\n<p>André Hoffmann and Larry Fink, the co-chairs of the WEF, wrote in the release they have “sincere appreciation for Børge Brende’s significant contributions” to the organization. They announced that Alois Zwinggi, a longtime member of the WEF’s managing board, will serve as interim president and CEO. </p>\n<p>“The independent review conducted by outside counsel has concluded. The findings stated that there were no additional concerns beyond what has been previously disclosed,” Hoffman and Fink wrote, regarding the investigation into Brende. </p>\n<p>Brende is the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5754818-summers-epstein-ties-harvard-resigns/\">latest in a string</a> of U.S. and global figures to face professional or criminal consequences for their ties to Epstein.

            "description": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ms.now/opinion/minneapolis-ice-metro-surge-trump-dhs\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">lengthy drama that has played out in Minneapolis</a> in recent weeks has exposed yet again that too many Americans misunderstand what constitutes free expression. </p>\n<p>The First Amendment was designed by the framers to give citizens the rights to express themselves politically, religiously and culturally. Those protections allow people to express their thoughts and ideas. But that’s all the Constitution guarantees. </p>\n<p>Somewhere along the way, provocateurs bastardized the concept of free expression. They have confused unlawful incitement as “messaging” and falsely portrayed actual behavior as “free speech.” Apologists consciously obfuscate action and expression, lumping all approaches of dissent into the same category. </p>\n<p>A close reading of the First Amendment should remind Americans of the wording <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“peaceably to assemble.”</a> </p>\n<p>Even a former anchor at a high-profile news channel has intentionally mischaracterized what the First Amendment means. <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5737966-don-lemon-pleads-not-guilty/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Don Lemon</a> intruded on private property and disrupted other citizens’ exercise of their rights, then tried to snooker the public with the claim that doing “journalism” allows such an invasion. Lemon’s stunt led to his arrest in Los Angeles by federal officials. Immediately, Mayor <a href=\"https://mayor.lacity.gov/news/mayor-bass-issues-statement-regarding-arrest-renowned-journalists-don-lemon-and-georgia-fort\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Karen Bass perpetuated the same inaccurate portrayal of Lemon’s actions</a>, proclaiming Lemon was “just doing his job.”</p>\n<p>Polarization happens when some citizens interpret free expression protections to include hostile action and incitement of unlawful behavior. Debate on issues ceases when mob behavior can be considered “expression” in a broad and unhealthy categorization. The forces of chaos thrive on these expansive interpretations of “expression” that justify dangerous behavior. </p>\n<p>Delineating what is constitutionally protected expression from uncivil conduct really isn’t that difficult to figure out, if the various parties want to promote reasoned discourse instead of chaotic behavior. Assembling, demonstrating, holding signs and chanting slogans are all just fine, if done on public property or your own property. All of those things are expressions.</p>\n<p>Blocking roads, vandalism, spitting, inciting violence, trespassing and organized interference with law enforcement officers are not OK. All of those things are actions — not expression or dissent. This should be simple enough to understand. </p>\n<p>There is no First Amendment “right” to try to nullify enforcement of federal law. President Dwight Eisenhower <a href=\"https://www.eisenhowerlibrary.gov/research/online-documents/civil-rights-little-rock-school-integration-crisis\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">made that clear</a> to the governor of Arkansas in 1957, when the 101st Airborne was ordered to Little Rock to desegregate a school.</p>\n<p>But to the manipulators of mayhem and their overwrought true-believer followers, the false claim that action is the same as dissent serves a disruptive objective. Constitutional framer James Madison warned his countrymen about the dangers of mobs. He wrote in the <a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/01-10-02-0178\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Federalist Papers that mobs</a> were “adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.” In 1838, a 28-year-old <a href=\"https://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/lyceum.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Abraham Lincoln addressed a lyceum</a> in Springfield, Ill., telling his fellow citizens, “There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law.”</p>\n<p>Sensible Americans engage in productive dissent and free speech. Mobs promote civil disintegration and rage, and ultimately lead to anarchy. As British philosopher Edmund Burke <a href=\"https://www.irishphilosophy.com/2018/11/01/rage-and-frenzy/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wrote two centuries ago</a>, “Rage and frenzy will pull down more in half an hour than prudence, deliberation and foresight can build in a hundred years.”</p>\n<p>It is unhelpful when government officials who should know better engage in the rhetoric of hysteria, demonizing political opponents and mischaracterizing disruptive behaviors as patriotic or somehow promoting justice. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyMNyvO7xrk\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey broadly accused federal law enforcement</a> of trying “to silence dissent.” Perhaps some innocent citizens have been silenced, but it  is not silencing dissent to clear barricaded streets, stop vandalism or restrain people who are throwing projectiles. Rather, those are examples of addressing criminal behavior.</p>\n<p>The role of television news outlets in covering or even fueling disruptions is also worth noting. Much of the havoc carried out on the streets was designed particularly for the television cameras and news organizations playing along as publicists, dispensing emotion but providing too little context.</p>\n<p>Certainly, there is much blame to go around for the sad trajectory of events in Minneapolis. But it is safe to say that First Amendment ignorance has been a key part of this sad and, indeed, tragic episode. </p>\n<p>These intentional mischaracterizations of free expression, dispensed into the tense climate, did nothing to promote justice or patriotic dissent. Rather, the manipulation led to bedlam and a weakening of the rhetorical sphere in which such disputes should be resolved.  </p>\n<p><em><u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Prof_McCall\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jeffrey M.

            "description": "<p>The Justice Department will review whether it failed to publish several documents in the Epstein files after various media outlets reported several records related to accusations made against President Trump were removed from the tranche.</p>\n<p>The documents in question relate to accusations made by a woman who said as a minor she refused Trump’s sexual advances, prompting the president to respond violently and kick her out of the room. </p>\n<p>While the woman’s accusation was cataloged in the Epstein files, serial numbers tracking the various documents show that while the woman spoke to the FBI four times, roughly 50 pages related to the woman’s interviews were not publicly released; instead, only files detailing her accusations against Epstein were published.</p>\n<p>The White House has denied any wrongdoing by Trump, and Justice previously described the accusations as “salaciously insane” and argued they were found to have no credibility. It also had previously defended its handling of the release of documents.</p>\n<p>But in a shift, Justice on Wednesday said it would conduct the review.</p>\n<p>“Several individuals and news outlets have recently flagged files related to documents produced to Ghislaine Maxwell in discovery of her criminal case that they claim appear to be missing,” DOJ said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/DOJRR47/status/2026769082159112295?s=20\">statement Wednesday</a>.</p>\n<p>“As with all documents that have been flagged by the public, the Department is currently reviewing files within that category of the production. Should any document be found to have been improperly tagged in the review process and is responsive to the Act, the Department will of course publish it, consistent with the law.”</p>\n<p>Congressional Democrats are pledging to review the matter.</p>\n<p>“Yesterday, I reviewed unredacted evidence logs at the Department of Justice,” Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), ranking member of the Oversight Committee, said in a Tuesday statement.</p>\n<p>“Oversight Democrats can confirm that the DOJ appears to have illegally withheld FBI interviews with this survivor who accused President Trump of heinous crimes. Oversight Democrats will open a parallel investigation into this.” </p>\n<p>In a response the same day, DOJ again asserted nothing had been removed, saying, “NOTHING has been deleted…ALL responsive documents have been produced unless a document falls within one of the following categories: duplicates, privileged, or part of an ongoing federal investigation.</p>\n<p>But the pushback only prompted more questions from Oversight Democrats.</p>\n<p>“Records of FBI interviews with a survivor who alleged Trump sexually assaulted her as a child aren’t duplicates or shouldn’t be privileged. Are you saying there’s an active, ongoing federal investigation into President Trump?” the panel’s minority wrote on X.</p>",

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) held a virtual press conference Wednesday to demand the administration send money back to small businesses and consumers, arguing that <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/business/5737182-tariffs-trump-us-businesses-impact/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/business/5737182-tariffs-trump-us-businesses-impact/\">American businesses and consumers</a> paid 96 percent of the costs for the “<a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5747353-read-supreme-court-trump-tariffs-ruling/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5747353-read-supreme-court-trump-tariffs-ruling/\">illegal</a>” tariffs, generating some $130 billion in federal revenue. She demanded Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5747881-supreme-court-tariff-refunds/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5747881-supreme-court-tariff-refunds/\">issue refunds</a> immediately.</p>\n<p>“That’s money that President Trump now owes back to the American people,” Gillibrand said. </p>\n<p>She added that tariffs and remarks from the president deeply offended Canadians, significantly reducing tourism that keeps businesses in New York afloat.</p>\n<p>To force the administration to issue refunds, the New York Democrat said companies should sue the trade commission. She also encouraged local businesses struggling without Canadian customers should write to Attorney General Letitia James (D) for legal support.</p>\n<p>“I imagine our attorney general will file a lawsuit,” she added. “I think it’s the best way for us to get our money back.”</p>\n<p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul’s (D) office would not comment on the potential for a lawsuit but said the state government would explore all of its options to get refunds for New Yorkers.</p>\n<p>Officials presented different data points to estimate alleged economic damage. Gillibrand said the tariffs cost the average New York household about $4,200 per year. Meanwhile, a <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5754391-new-york-kathy-hochul-tariff-refunds-trump-supreme-court/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5754391-new-york-kathy-hochul-tariff-refunds-trump-supreme-court/\">statement from Hochul</a> on Tuesday cited the Yale Budget Lab, estimating $1,751 per household in new costs since the 2025 tariffs were enacted.</p>\n<p>Rochester business owner Ben Pearson manufactures science kits, according to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and lost $1 million to tariffs — creating a deficit that forced him to reduce his workforce by 20 percent. Schumer invited Pearson to President Trump’s <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754101-trump-state-union-address-takeaways/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754101-trump-state-union-address-takeaways/\">State of the Union address</a> Tuesday night to demonstrate the financial strain in the state.</p>\n<p>“Upstate NY is paying the price for Trump’s cost-increasing policies, and it needs to stop,” Schumer said in a press release ahead of the <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754220-donald-trump-2026-state-of-the-union-record-speech/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754220-donald-trump-2026-state-of-the-union-record-speech/\">record-long speech</a>.</p>\n<p>After the address, conservatives in New York defended the president, targeting Hochul’s leadership instead. New York State Conservative Party Chair Gerard Kassar released a statement afterward praising Trump’s <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754028-trump-state-of-the-union-memorable-moments/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754028-trump-state-of-the-union-memorable-moments/\">State of the Union remarks</a>, arguing that he offered a sensible vision to counter progressive policies.</p>\n<p>Other than international travel, tariffs also disrupted agriculture, according to the governor. </p>\n<p>Hochul proposed a $30 million relief plan to help farmers offset the higher costs of equipment and fertilizer. According to her office, over 80 percent of agrochemical imports and 70 percent of farm machinery come from countries tariffed at 10 percent or more.</p>",
