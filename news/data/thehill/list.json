The <a href=\"https://www.convenience.org/Media/Daily/2025/September/25/1-Retailers-Start-to-See-Penny-Shortages_GR\">National Association of Convenience Stores</a> warned last month that supply shortages were starting to emerge amongst its members, with more expected to be impacted. </p>\n<p>So far, at least two gas and convenience store chains, Love’s and Kwik Trip, have said they will round change on cash transactions <a href=\"https://fox8.com/news/how-the-growing-penny-shortage-may-impact-you/#:~:text=Love%E2%80%99s%20and%20Kwik%20Trip\">in favor of the customer</a>. Rounding may, however, <a href=\"https://fox8.com/news/how-the-growing-penny-shortage-may-impact-you/\">face legal challenges</a>, experts warn. </p>\n<p>Another chain, Sheetz, <a href=\"https://fox8.com/news/how-the-growing-penny-shortage-may-impact-you/#:~:text=convenience%20store%20chain%2C-,Sheetz,-%2C%20confirmed%20to%20Nexstar\">confirmed</a> it is encouraging customers to pay with a cashless option. Customers can also exchange pennies for a free self-serve drink or as a donation to Sheetz For the Kidz. A spokesperson noted that donated coins “will then be recirculated for other customers.”</p>\n<p>At PetSmart, customers can <a href=\"https://fox8.com/news/how-the-growing-penny-shortage-may-impact-you/\">round their cash transactions up</a> to the nearest dollar, with the extra change going toward PetSmart Charities. </p>\n<p>Pennies remain legal tender and will likely gain <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/nexstar_media_wire/5324955-penny-production-to-end-should-you-start-stocking-up/\">little to no value</a> as collectors’ items — though some may argue the Giant Eagle exchange is the most fiscally beneficial to penny holders.</p>\n</div>",

But this time, it could be the blood of our sons and daughters giving their last full measure of devotion in a conflict far from home.</p>\n\n<p>It is a reality and a risk to help end this latest chapter of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has caused so much suffering on both sides. There may be no alternative to putting our military in harm’s way today, but there could be and must be one in the future, and we need to embrace and pursue it as soon as possible.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>So, what if we could protect both civilians and our military by sending something else in their place — humanoid drones?</p>\n<p>We know how that sounds, but let us explain. These humanoids would be powered by interoperable, agentic artificial intelligence. Maybe it’s the stuff of science fiction, but it’s no longer the purview of just screenwriters.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>We now have the technology to deploy such robots in war zones to protect populations, establish communications and stabilize what’s happening on the ground. These systems could serve as guardians defending humanitarian corridors and deterring violence without firing a shot.</p>\n<p>We are entering a new era in which artificial intelligence becomes a civic institution rather than merely a commercial or military tool. The question is whether we lead the world in building ethical, interoperable systems that protect people, or leave the future to regimes with nefarious intentions.</p>\n<p>Let’s be clear: Our adversaries are already using this technology — not to save lives but to take them. Russia <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/10/1166189\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">uses drone swarms</a> to attack Ukraine’s infrastructure. China <a href=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/china/2025/02/20/china-ai-neuro-quantum-surveillance-security-threat/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">integrates AI into its naval and surveillance systems</a> and shares it with governments, using it for population control.  </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, we and our allies hesitate. Our doctrines remain anchored to an era when deterrence meant soldiers and sanctions. </p>\n<p>The new challenge isn’t our ability to get our military to the next hot spot. It’s machine coordination. The balance of power around the world is about to be determined by our approach to AI governance.</p>\n<p>From Ukraine to Gaza, the international community faces the same challenge: civilians stranded between opposing forces, and humanitarian agencies unable to provide aid. Yet, technology already exists to change that. Autonomous systems could patrol ceasefire zones, protect evacuation routes, deliver aid and detect incoming threats, creating buffer zones where humans can safely operate.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>This isn’t fantasy. It’s a moral and strategic imperative. Western democracies must find ways to deter aggression without risking American lives.  </p>\n<p>The foundation for this future is what we call Omni Cities — democratic, interoperable infrastructures where civic AI integrates across transportation, energy, health and defense systems. It’s not about surveillance, but about saving lives and protecting the peacemaker. It doesn’t control; it coordinates. It is is the civic answer to authoritarian implementations of AI.   </p>\n<p>The U.S. needs to lead this effort and set standards for interoperability, data ethics, and autonomous deterrence. Under United Nations oversight, AI-enabled drones and humanoid guardians could be deployed to regions such as Gaza to secure humanitarian corridors and enforce ceasefires. </p>\n\n<p>They would act not as instruments of war, but as intermediaries for peace — enforcing accountability through presence, not violence.</p>\n<p>Such a framework would extend beyond conflict zones. Domestic applications could include rapid disaster response to floods, wildfires or hurricanes, where AI could coordinate public infrastructure and autonomous assets to save lives. </p>\n<p>If the nuclear age was about avoiding mutual assured destruction, the civic AI era must be about preserving life. </p>\n\n<p>Public perception is understandably based on what we’ve seen in movies like “The Terminator.” Skeptics warn machines lack human morality and autonomy risks AI becoming more powerful than our ability to control it. Those concerns are legitimate, but inaction carries its own risk. </p>\n<p>Failing to define the ethics of AI deployment leaves it to authoritarian regimes that already use this technology to repress. The challenge isn’t whether to use AI but ensuring that it serves us. </p>\n<p>The new “Space Race” isn’t a contest between capitalism and communism, but rather between authoritarian AI and civic AI. The nations leading in building interoperable, ethical systems will shape the moral frontier of technology.</p>\n\n<p>So far, President Trump has rejected calls to cooperate in that venture with international partners. But the time has come for the U.S. and its allies to build Omni Cities and deploy these guardians of peace, not to replace humans, but to protect them. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>The civic AI Era is emerging.

Although Affordable Care Act subsidies have been at the center of the debate, one of the most basic questions remains unanswered: Where is the money actually going? </p>\n<p>And we cannot answer that, because the U.S. still lacks real price transparency in health care.  </p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://waysandmeans.house.gov/2024/06/24/cbo-and-jct-confirm-the-debt-driving-cost-of-bidens-plan-to-permanently-expand-obamacare-subsidies-for-the-wealthy/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2024, the federal government spent roughly $125 billion on Affordable Care Act subsidies</a>. According to the Congressional Budget Office, federal spending on these subsidies will <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-07/60523-2024-07-premium-tax-credit.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">exceed $1 trillion over the next decade.</a> These numbers are far higher than initial cost estimates, and increases in premiums are at least part of the story. <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/state-indicator/marketplace-average-benchmark-premiums/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Benchmark plans’ premium rose between 70 and 90 percent in the last decade,</a> <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/43083\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">defying early budget expectations</a> that competition among health care exchanges would restrain increases. But neither the government nor businesses nor patients can benefit from competition if we don’t have markets. And we can’t have markets if we don’t have actual prices we can see in advance. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The Affordable Care Act was sold as a way to help families afford coverage, but it’s become a guaranteed revenue stream for insurers. <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-107194\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Most markets remain dominated by just a few insurers</a>. Subsidies were paid directly to insurance companies — not as flat fee vouchers but as a percentage of the annual premium. The Affordable Care Act expansion led to millions more covered lives — new customers for insurers — and these companies returned the favor by hiking their rates, knowing that taxpayers would make up the difference. </p>\n<p>What’s the reason for the increase in premiums since Obamacare began? We could cynically assume greed, but there are multiple plausible explanations, none of which we can quantify with great confidence. Some argue that because the subsidies rise with premiums, insurers face less pressure to keep prices down. Insurers point to rising hospital and pharmaceutical prices, consolidation among health systems, and the increasing number of high-cost enrollees. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>All of these may be true to a degree, but the real problem is we can’t say for sure. </p>\n<p>Federal law requires insurers and hospitals to disclose negotiated prices, under the <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/hospital-price-transparency\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hospital Price Transparency Rule (2021)</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/healthplan-price-transparency\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Transparency in Coverage Rule (2022)</a>. But unfortunately, compliance has been largely performative. Insurers post massive “machine-readable” files that are nearly impossible to download, let alone interpret. The information exists in theory, but in practice it is unusable for patients, employers and policymakers trying to answer the most basic question: What does care actually cost? </p>\n<p>The prospect of premiums going up by hundreds of dollars each month frightens families. But we need to balance compassion for those individual circumstances with the reality that we are spending billions of dollars each year to prop up a fundamentally broken system. The largest beneficiaries of taxpayer subsidies are not hospitals, doctors or even patients — they are insurers.</p>\n\n<p>If Congress extends the Affordable Care Act subsidies that families have come to depend on, it should demand something in return: real price-transparency. Reporting should be mandatory, not voluntary. Readable, easy-to-understand disclosures should be made public of what insurers pay for care and what patients are expected to pay. Ordinary people should be able to tell exactly how much of every subsidy dollar is going to patient premiums and patient care, and how much is funding administrative costs, executive bonuses and shareholder revenue. Taxpayers deserve to see where their money is going. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>Empathy for families facing rate hikes and a demand for fiscal responsibility are not mutually exclusive.

Or it can seize the opportunity to make a basic correction that should have happened years ago.

Our digital consumption fuels a rapidly growing carbon footprint hiding in plain sight.</p>\n\n<p>The information and communication technology sector, which makes the internet run, now accounts for an <a href=\"https://greenly.earth/en-gb/leaf-media/data-stories/the-carbon-cost-of-streaming\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">estimated 3.7 percent</a> of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Cooling systems can account for nearly half of a facility’s total energy use and draw <a href=\"https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/data-centers-and-water-consumption\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">billions of gallons of water annually</a> to maintain internal temperatures, anchoring the “cloud” to local power and water supplies. </li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>The network:</strong> Fiber-optic cables, routers and switching stations transmit gigabytes of data across the globe. This “always-on” network consumes power continuously, even when idle. The longer data travels and the more digital “hops” it makes, the greater the energy required. </li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>The device:</strong> The device itself is the most overlooked piece of the carbon puzzle, <a href=\"https://www.carbontrust.com/our-work-and-impact/guides-reports-and-tools/carbon-impact-of-video-streaming\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">responsible for the largest share of streaming-associated emissions</a>. Larger, higher-resolution screens demand more power.

It is inequitable for corporations to <a href=\"https://greencitizen.com/blog/digital-carbon-footprint/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reap digital profits while externalizing the environmental cost to the public</a> — especially to communities without affordable access to the very systems creating the pollution. </p>\n<p>How do we fix a problem that is invisible to users? The answer lies in redesigning incentives for corporations and consumers. </p>\n<p>First, regulators should require tech giants to disclose the energy and water use of their data centers, breaking it down by service (such as streaming, search and cloud storage). Companies should face stricter power usage effectiveness mandates, the standard measure of efficiency. Transparency provides data for accountability and targeted regulation. </p>\n\n<p>Second, we must provide an incentive by making renewable power profitable. Companies like Google and Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.landapp.com/post/data-centers-are-driving-renewable-energy-development\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">already lead in purchasing green energy</a>, setting an example for their supply chains. Policies should promote development of clean energy sources to meet <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/meta-data-center-louisiana-power-costs-4ce76b73c102727d71edbbb56abe1388\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rising data center demand</a> and prevent construction of new natural gas power plants.</p>\n<p>Third, we must encourage efficient content delivery. Streaming platforms should default to standard definition, with users having to opt in for high definition or 4K. This small design change could dramatically reduce network traffic and energy use without affecting most viewing experiences.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, consumers can do their part as well in ways that are <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/gdo/clean-energy-resources-meet-data-center-electricity-demand\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">easy and intuitive</a>. For example, when watching on a small screen or listening to background videos, they can switch to SD. This single action cuts data use and energy consumption across the network.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>If you plan to watch something multiple times, just download it once over Wi-Fi rather than streaming it repeatedly.

Now, the rupture with the U.S. was complete.</p>\n<p>The Axis of Evil had found its modern-day South American upstart first in Chávez and then in Maduro. Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2006-09/venezuela-russia-sign-weapons-deal\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sealed a deal</a> with Chávez in 2006 to sell combat planes and helicopters to Venezuela.</p>\n\n<p>By late 2009, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna32809912\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chávez had secured</a> a “$2.2 billion line of credit for Venezuela to purchase [Russian] weapons including armored vehicles and surface-to-air missiles.” For all of Putin’s recent complaints against NATO member-states arming Ukraine, the Kremlin — 17 years ago — was arming Venezuela to counter neighboring Colombia’s decision “to give U.S. troops greater access to its military bases.”</p>\n<p>During that same timeframe, Chávez <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/aug/25/venezuela.china\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">solidified economic ties</a> with China. Beginning in 2006, he signed multiple trade agreements with Beijing and referred to them as a “Great Wall” protecting Venezuela from “American hegemonism.” By then, Chávez was openly calling President George W. Bush “the devil” and was establishing Venezuela alongside Iran, Syria and North Korea as junior members of the Axis of Evil.</p>\n<p>Chinese purchases of Venezuelan oil proved decisive in letting Maduro skirt past U.S. oil sanctions aimed at ending his regime. Likewise, it gave oil-hungry Beijing another source of oil imports.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Fast-forward to March 2022. Putin’s armies had invaded Ukraine. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was putting his finishing touches on his <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/what-is-irans-axis-resistance-which-groups-are-involved-2024-01-29/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Axis of Resistance</a> — Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis in Yemen. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was <a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/publications/strategic-comments/2022/north-koreas-missile-activity-in-2022/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">test-firing</a> an unprecedented number of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles over Japanese territory.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3533783-the-dangers-of-bidens-permissive-environment/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">permissive environment</a> that President Joe Biden had created was backfiring on him. He was looking for wins. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/11/04/1134421149/russias-invasion-has-prompted-biden-to-offer-reconciliation-to-venezuelas-presid\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fearing spikes in global oil prices</a>, Biden abandoned Trump’s maximum pressure approach against Caracas and naively sought to peel off Maduro from the anti-Western axis.</p>\n<p>Predictably, Maduro took everything he could from Biden and then stiffed him. Despite U.S. energy sanctions relief, Maduro continued to ban Maria Corina Machado (winner of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize) as a presidential candidate. By July 2024 the Venezuelan dictator was even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jul/21/venezuela-guyana-latin-america-tensions-rise-maduro-essequibo-border-dispute-support-elections-oil-indigenous\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">threatening to militarily seize</a> Essequibo, a province of Guyana where U.S.-based Exxon has invested billions. </p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/blog/bidens-tragic-mistake-venezuela-calling-new-election-instead-respect-election-opposition-won\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Elliot Abrams noted</a>, President Biden last year nonetheless “gave oxygen to the Maduro regime.” Ironically, it took a fellow leftist government in Brazil to keep Caracas in check — it <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c624m4kgrg3o\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">vetoed Venezuela’s bid</a> to join BRICS after Maduro’s flagrant theft of the 2024 election from winner Edmundo González.</p>\n<p>That was then. This is now. Trump’s maximum pressure campaign against Maduro is back, and this time, he is casting a wider net. The Pentagon’s show of force is also squarely aimed at Moscow and Beijing — an assertion of a modern Monroe Doctrine.</p>\n<p>The White House’s messaging to the Axis of Evil is as simple as it is blunt: hands off of the Western Hemisphere. As <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/01/12/opinion/trumps-greenland-push-about-growing-china-threat/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">we noted last January</a>, Trump began sending that message to Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping when he refused to rule out military force in Greenland or the Panama Canal.</p>\n\n<p>So far, neither Putin nor Xi appear willing to accept the message. Significantly, over the weekend, a <a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/global/the-americas/2025/10/28/heavy-russian-cargo-plane-lands-in-caracas-amid-us-venezuela-tensions/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Russian cargo plane</a> linked in the past to the Wagner Group and other Russian paramilitary companies landed in Caracas. In the past, these planes have been used to ship “rockets, warheads, and helicopter parts globally.”</p>\n<p>Notably, the cargo plane took a circuitous route from Moscow to Caracas “via Armenia, Algeria, Morocco, Senegal and Mauritania to Latin America.” Although its contents remain unknown, Putin’s messaging to Trump is obvious. He is willing to bring his <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6341171078112\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">global war against the West</a> to the Americas.</p>\n<p>Beijing is also weighing in on Trump’s buildup in the Caribbean. Mao Ning, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/venezuela-china-us-maduro-xi-jinping-trump-intl-latam\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said last week</a> that “China opposes any move that violates the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and a country’s sovereignty and security. We oppose the use or threat of force in international relations and the interference of external forces in Venezuela’s internal affairs under any pretext.”</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n\n<p>No doubt Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines wish China would live up to Ning’s laughably hollow statement and stop encroaching on their waters while maneuvering against Taipei.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Team Trump can book a win here.
