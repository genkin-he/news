Kennedy Jr. and the Make America Healthy Movement have effectively united the country around the urgent need to address our nation’s costly chronic disease epidemic. Where there is less agreement is the debate over saturated fat. </p>\n<p>Leading health authorities like the American Heart Association argue that it is a<a href=\"https://www.heart.org/-/media/files/healthy-living/company-collaboration/inap/fats-white-paper-ucm_475005.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> major driver of heart disease</a>.

Although there is broad agreement on the need to cut down on ultra-processed foods made with seed oils, Kennedy and other MAHA advocates pushing full fat animal products are failing to acknowledge the toxic load that comes with industrial meat and dairy products, which make up<a href=\"https://insideanimalag.org/percentage-of-farmed-animals-on-factory-farms/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> at least 95 percent</a> of the animal foods people eat. </p>\n<p>The MAHA Commission’s Report identified cumulative chemical exposure as a key driver of the rise in childhood chronic disease, but fat’s capacity to store environmental toxins means that eating more fat increases one’s exposure to those very same chemicals. Dioxins, heavy metals like mercury and cadmium, and pesticide residues build up in the fatty tissues of animals, especially those raised in industrial settings. These risks have been well-documented by the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/dioxin/learn-about-dioxin\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>, and National Institutes of Health.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Dioxins are among the most toxic substances known to science. According to <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/dioxin\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the EPA</a>, more than 90 percent of typical human exposure is through the intake of animal fats. Dioxins are produced as byproducts of waste incineration and industrial manufacturing, and they concentrate in animal fat through contaminated feed and environmental exposure. Long-term exposure to even low levels of dioxins is linked to <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/dioxin/learn-about-dioxin\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cancer, immune dysfunction</a> and <a href=\"https://iris.epa.gov/ChemicalLanding/&amp;substance_nmbr=1024\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reproductive</a> and development harm. That means, a family’s Sunday roast, or the burger a teenager grabs after practice, is the primary route by which these poisons enter the body.</p>\n<p>Heavy metals like cadmium and mercury also concentrate up the food chain, particularly in organ meats, dairy and seafood. A tuna sandwich tucked into a child’s lunchbox or a glass of milk poured at breakfast may seem wholesome, but these can deliver trace metals the body struggles to eliminate. Add to that insecticides like malathion, which is used widely on genetically engineered corn for animal feed.</p>\n<p>Those chemicals don’t just stay in the soil — they accumulate in animal tissue, fat and milk, eventually <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38128207/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ending up on our plates</a> and in our bodies and those of our children. A comprehensive<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38128207/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 2024 study</a> found that meat and dairy contribute significantly to human pesticide exposure, with livestock and poultry accounting for 39 percent of overall exposure and whole milk and dairy products accounting for 22 percent of all exposures.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the most dangerous pesticides, such as DDT and other persistent organic pollutants, don’t simply vanish when they’re banned. They are lipophilic, meaning they dissolve and store in fat, <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxguides/toxguide-35.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">especially animal fats</a>. Even decades after DDT was banned, it is still found in measurable levels in<a href=\"https://toxinfreeusa.org/pesticides-in-butter-getting-worse-not-better/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> butter</a>, meat and<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mcn.13759\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> breast milk</a>.</p>\n<p>For example, in 2023, out of 531 butter samples,<a href=\"https://www.afdo.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/800-1615-Food-Chemistry-101-Jason-Kong.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> DDE (a DDT metabolite) was detected in 188 samples (35 percent)</a> and in 2021, bifenthrin (a neurotoxic insecticide) was found in 37 percent of butter samples tested. Essentially, foods that should be simple staples, such as a pat of butter on your toast, can still carry the chemical legacy of dangerous farming practices from generations ago.</p>\n<p>Worse still, these chemicals don’t act alone. Meat and dairy often contain traces of multiple pesticides, antibiotics, and veterinary drugs like ractopamine — creating a toxic cocktail whose combined effects scientists are only beginning to understand. The FDA has approved over<a href=\"https://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/files/animal_drug_10_26_77838.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 450 drugs</a> for use in industrial livestock systems. Some, like ractopamine, are banned in China, the EU and many countries around the world. This isn’t about a single bad actor, it’s about layering risks on top of each other — and hoping for the best. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>If we are serious about health, we need to stop exposing animals — and, by extension, people, especially babies and children — to a cocktail of persistent industrial pollutants and animal drugs. That means advancing policies that support farmer transitions away from chemical-intensive factory farming to diversified, regenerative systems as well as increased production of organic and plant-based foods, including animal feed, while reducing toxic chemical use across agriculture. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>Given all the pollutants that accumulate in the fatty tissue of animals, we also need dietary guidelines that educate consumers about these risks and urge Americans to eat more whole plant-based proteins, fewer factory-farmed animal foods and more organic, pasture-raised meat and dairy products produced without harmful pesticides, antibiotics and growth-promoting drugs.</p>\n<p>This is especially important since these guidelines influence the foods offered to younger school children, who are most vulnerable to the cumulative impacts of these toxic chemicals, as President Trump’s MAHA Commission report has acknowledged. The truth is, whether you believe that saturated fat is or is not a desirable nutrient, everyone should be concerned about the contaminants that accumulate in the fatty tissues of animals — and in all of us. </p>\n\n<p><em>Kari Hamerschlag is deputy director of food and agriculture at Friends of the Earth and Liam Gray is founder and executive director of Wilberforce Institute, a nonprofit profit organization focused on free market and pro-liberty solutions to end animal suffering</em>.</p>\n</div>",

He did not receive any pushback from Carlson.”</p>\n\n<p>Carlson on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efBB0D4tf1Y\">podcast</a> said that he wanted to understand Fuentes’s views, saying that while he also questioned the U.S. relationship with Israel, to say “well actually it’s the Jews” goes “against my Christian faith.”</p>\n<p>After the interview, a post on X started circulating that said the Heritage Foundation had <a href=\"https://x.com/jasonahart/status/1983655537784058064?s=46&amp;t=s27cFPVMxDTz4BmWHLglMQ\">scrubbed</a> a reference to Carlson from a donation page. </p>\n<p>Roberts, in a post accompanying his video, said he wanted to put to rest speculation that Heritage was distancing itself from Carlson. Roberts and Carlson are personal friends, and he has featured Carlson at Heritage events in the past.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>“The Heritage Foundation didn’t become the intellectual backbone of the conservative movement by canceling our own people or policing the consciences of Christians, and we won’t start doing that now,” Roberts said, adding that Heritage won’t “take direction from comments on X” or “take direction from members or donors.” </p>\n<p>“We will always defend our friends against the slander of bad actors who serve someone else’s agenda,” Roberts said.</p>\n<p>Roberts also weighed in on the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/newsletters/the-movement/5458571-gop-division-israel-support/\">bubbling debate on the right</a> over Israel.</p>\n\n<p>“Christians can critique the state of Israel without being antisemitic, and of course, antisemitism should be condemned,” Roberts said.</p>\n<p>“When it serves the interests of the United States to cooperate with Israel and other allies, we should do so with partnerships on security, intelligence, and technology,” Roberts said. “But when it doesn’t, conservatives should feel no obligation to reflexively support any foreign government, no matter how loud the pressure becomes from the globalist class or from their mouthpieces in Washington.”</p>\n</div>",

The plan directs agencies to mobilize federal financing tools and provide various subsidies for AI infrastructure, declaring that “Winning the AI race will usher in a new golden age of human flourishing.”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>President Trump has signed <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-accelerates-federal-permitting-of-data-center-infrastructure/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">executive orders</a> directing the Commerce Department to provide “financial support, such as loans, grants and tax incentives” for AI data centers requiring over 100 megawatts of power.</p>\n<p>The U.S. isn’t alone. Canada is allocating <a href=\"https://canadiandefencereview.com/canada-launches-canadian-sovereign-ai-compute-strategy/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$2 billion</a> for AI compute infrastructure, and the EU launched InvestAI to put <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/eu-launches-investai-initiative-mobilise-eu200-billion-investment-artificial-intelligence\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$263 billion</a> toward artificial intelligence investment.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>But the very excitement driving these proposals suggests that private markets are already working well. Subsidies make sense only when private markets systematically underfund something society needs, not when they’re already pouring in capital. </p>\n<p>Rigorous policy would identify specific costs or benefits that private investors can’t capture and target only those gaps. Instead, the AI Action Plan and executive orders take a scattershot approach, subsidizing everything from data centers to workforce training without demonstrating where private investment falls short.</p>\n<p>A deeper question is whether the government can identify underfunded yet socially beneficial projects. Private investors risk billions of their own dollars, backed by domain expertise and rigorous due diligence. Politicians, in contrast, spread taxpayer money across regions and politically important interest groups. Betting taxpayer dollars on selecting winners when the private sector is already all-in is a recipe for inefficiency, not for innovation.</p>\n\n<p>We have seen this before. The Obama-era push for solar manufacturing led to <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2011/10/obamas-solyndra-problem/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$535 million</a> in loan guarantees for Solyndra, which collapsed into <a href=\"http://bankruptcy.so/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bankruptcy.</a> Some defend this kind of failure as the price of taking risks on socially valuable industries, but that logic doesn’t apply to AI. </p>\n<p>Unlike solar at that time, AI today is awash in private capital. Subsidies here aren’t addressing what some argue is an underfunded social goal. They simply pile taxpayer money on top of investments that private markets are already making on their own.</p>\n<p>The government does, of course, have an important role to play in AI development. Concerns about the Chinese government dominating AI are real. But Chinese competition in AI is most relevant in military applications and cutting-edge research, not the commercial data centers that private investors are already racing to fund.</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>If subsidies are justified anywhere, it is in areas private markets are less likely to cover, like defense research, basic science and national security applications where private investors can’t capture the full benefits.

Taxpayer dollars should go where private investors won’t — defense, basic research and security — not into data centers already awash in capital.

The Trump administration has generally <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5571008-trump-congress-drug-strikes/\">dismissed these concerns</a>, but to provide legal rationale for the strikes, the White House earlier this month <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5535523-trump-armed-conflict-drug-cartels-caribbean/\">declared</a> the U.S. in “non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels it deems as terrorist groups. </p>\n<p>Republicans and Democrats have criticized the administration for the strikes, even <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5512242-venezuela-boat-strikes-congress-resolution/\">introducing a resolution</a> that challenged the Trump administration’s authority to carry out its hits against the boats.

Senate Democrats continue to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5579707-senate-democrats-legality-boat-strikes/\">question</a> the boat strikes’ adherence to international law. </p>\n\n<p>Members of both parties also <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5583076-turner-frustration-boat-strikes-briefing/\">expressed</a> <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5582059-democrats-seek-legal-rationale/\">frustration</a> with the Trump administration’s explanations of the boat strikes during a Thursday briefing. </p>\n<p>Türk echoed these concerns in his Friday statement, saying the strikes were taking place “outside the context” of active hostilities or armed conflict. Shamdasani also said Türk believed the strikes “violate international human rights law.”</p>\n<p>Fights against illicit drug-enforcement trafficking had “careful limits” on lethal force, which should only be used as a last resort against someone posing “an imminent threat to life,” Shamdasani said on Türk’s behalf. “Otherwise, it would amount to a violation of the right of life and constitute extrajudicial killings.”</p>\n</div>",

The Office of Special Education Programs isn’t just a bureaucratic office; it’s the backbone of special education oversight in the United States. It guides states and school districts, supports families, and allocates <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/blog/trump-administration-threatens-support-for-children-with-disabilities\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$15 billion in funding for special education services nationwide.</a></p>\n\n<p>Compared to the attention given to potential cuts to Medicaid or food assistance, this move has flown under the radar.

For millions of children with disabilities, it’s their best chance at independence and future success. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Since 1975, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act has guaranteed that children with disabilities cannot be excluded from public education. Today, <a href=\"https://sites.ed.gov/idea/2023-individuals-with-disabilities-education-act-annual-report-to-congress/#Ages-5-21\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">approximately 10 percent of students</a> — roughly 6.6 million children aged 6 to 21 — receive special education and related services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. <a href=\"https://sites.ed.gov/idea/2023-individuals-with-disabilities-education-act-annual-report-to-congress/#Part-C\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nearly half a million infants and toddlers</a> receive early education services to help reduce lifelong learning challenges. </p>\n<p>But the federal government has never lived up to its commitment to fully fund these services.

Without federal leadership, responsibility for compliance and funding would fall to a patchwork of state systems, some capable, others not. Families would have little recourse but to pursue costly private litigation to secure services, a route inaccessible to most. </p>\n<p>Before the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act became law, many <a href=\"https://sites.ed.gov/idea/regs/b/a/300.8\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">children with disabilities</a> were shut out of public schools or left to fail in classrooms unequipped to meet their needs.

I worked with parents of children with severe disabilities who, through specialized education and therapy, gained the ability to walk, feed themselves, or communicate. These are not isolated stories; they are the everyday results of federal investment in special education.</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n\n<p>If the Office of Special Education Programs is dismantled, who will ensure those outcomes remain possible?

And aspiring authoritarians use other excesses, like a cowed legislature and judiciary, to lock in their power.”</p>\n<p>The Times laid out a dozen different ways Trump has changed the operations of the U.S. government, arguing he is moving America away from democracy and toward a more centralized system of power among its leaders. These examples included “stifling speech and dissent,” “prosecuting political enemies,” “bypassing the legislature” and “using the military for domestic control.” </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“Our country is still not close to being a true autocracy, in the mold of Russia or China. But once countries begin taking steps away from democracy, the march often continues,” the outlet wrote. “We offer these 12 markers as a warning of how much Americans have already lost and how much more we still could lose.” </p>\n<p>The Times’ editorial board has been sharply critical of Trump, who earlier this year sued the newspaper for defamation over its coverage of his first run for president, journalism the president and his attorneys have argued is defamatory. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The newspaper has stood by its reporting on the president, and its leaders have indicated they are prepared to defend their stories in court.</p>\n</div>",
