            "description": "<p>Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) on Thursday unveiled a <a href=\"https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/MNGOV/2026/02/26/file_attachments/3566317/Anti-Fraud%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf\">legislative package</a> intended to mitigate fraud a day after the Trump administration <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5755651-vance-oz-minnesota-medicaid-funds-fraud/\">paused</a> $259.5 million in Medicaid funds for the North Star State. </p>\n<p>Walz’s package would create a new statute that increases penalties for public fraud by 20 percent and extends statutes of limitations to seven years for certain fraud-related crimes.</p>\n<p>It also establishes an Office of Inspector General aimed at statewide fraud prevention in the wake of a $250 million fraud scheme where the nonprofit Feeding Our Future falsely claimed to be providing meals to thousands of schoolchildren with federal funds.</p>\n<p>During a Thursday press conference, Walz addressed the Trump administration’s decision to pull back Medicaid funds amid concerns of rampant fraud.</p>\n<p>“How does taking and punishing children and elderly have anything to do with fighting fraud when that’s not where this issue is taking place?” Walz said. </p>\n<p>The Minnesota governor, who campaigned as the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 2024, suggested the funding rollback was tied to political retribution and deemed the administration’s attempt to lower the rate of scams as “absolutely not serious.”</p>\n<p>“If you’re serious about fighting fraud, you can help us work on this package, get this package passed,” Walz told reporters after previously citing the state’s Medicaid <a href=\"https://mn.gov/dhs/assets/2025-medicaid-error-notification_tcm1053-720555.pdf\">error rates</a>, which sit at 2.1 percent.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/fiscal-year-2025-improper-payments-fact-sheet\">national average</a> was recently over 6 percent.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Walz said he believes Minnesota has met all the requirements outlined by the Trump administration to unfreeze Medicaid funds, noting that cuts will be “devastating” for veterans, families with young kids, individuals with disabilities and working people.</p>\n<p>Walz is set to tesitify before House Oversight Committee on Wednesday on the general subject of fraud.</p>",

Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) argued that the measure, which President Trump <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5384512-trump-signs-big-beautiful-bill/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5384512-trump-signs-big-beautiful-bill/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">signed into law in July</a>, prioritizes corporations, including fossil fuel companies, over everyday Americans.</p>\n<p>“In 2024, Donald Trump stood before a room of wealthy oil executives and promised to protect their interests if they spent $1 billion to help elect him. He has now upheld his end of the bargain — slashing health care and food assistance for struggling families in the Republicans’ Big, Ugly Betrayal bill to deliver a massive $3.5 billion tax giveaway per year to the fossil fuel industry,” Merkley, the top Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, said in a written statement. </p>\n<p>“President Trump and Republicans are handing billions of dollars to the corporations responsible for poisoning our planet and profiting off the cost-of-living crisis facing hardworking Americans,” he added.</p>\n<p>Republicans have argued that the bill will bolster the economy.</p>\n<p>“This bill will fuel massive economic growth,” Trump said upon signing it, specifically touting its help for coal.</p>\n<p>Reached for comment on the Democrats’ report, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers touted the administration’s pro-fossil fuel policies.</p>\n<p>“Thanks to President Trump’s energy dominance agenda, American oil production has hit record highs and gas prices are at multi-year lows. After four years of Democrats waging war on America’s energy independence, the President has stopped costly and unpopular Green New Scam handouts while delivering on his promises to unleash American energy,” Rogers said. </p>\n<p>“President Trump is protecting our national security by boosting our domestic fossil fuel production to reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries, secure our vital supply chains, and ensure we have the necessary resources to meet both our energy and defense needs,” she added.</p>\n<p>The White House also noted that the fossil fuel spending pales in comparison to green subsidies that were passed as part of the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act. The 2022 Democratic bill included a total of <u><a href=\"https://earthjustice.org/article/the-biggest-climate-spending-bill-ever-just-turned-two-heres-what-it-has-achieved\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$391 billion</a></u> over 10 years for low-carbon energy and other efforts to combat climate change.</p>\n<p>The new report highlights estimates from authorities such as Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation. It points to the joint committee’s estimate that the bill’s increase in tax credits for sequestering and using carbon dioxide to pump more oil could be worth a total of $14.2 billion over 10 years. </p>\n<p>It also points to an estimate from climate think tank Resources For the Future that reductions in royalties for producing oil and gas on public lands and in public waters will <a href=\"https://www.resources.org/common-resources/if-then-new-cuts-to-oil-and-gas-royalty-rates-in-budget-reconciliation-will-reduce-federal-revenues/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">save the industry</a> billions more. The estimate finds that federal revenues will be cut by $6 billion over 10 years.</p>\n<p>The Democrats extrapolate that this means a total of $12 billion in savings, as revenues are split between states and the federal government, though the think tank’s own estimates of state losses appear to be a bit lower.</p>\n<p>It also highlights estimates of the cost of policies like the $1.5 billion in <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5378898-gop-megabill-coal-subsidy-steel-trump/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tax credits for coal</a>.</p>\n<p>The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature economic policy legislation, was passed with only Republican support last year.

            "title": "Whistleblower: Kash Patel tied up FBI resources during Kirk investigation?",
            "description": "<p>Let’s start with what matters most: when a political activist is murdered on a college campus, the American people expect the FBI to move immediately. No delays. No distractions. Just action.  </p>\n<p>Now, there are serious allegations that in the aftermath of the assassination of Charlie Kirk at a Utah university, the FBI’s elite shooting reconstruction team was delayed in getting to the scene — not because they weren’t ready, but because of a pilot shortage tied to FBI Director Kash Patel’s use of bureau aircraft.  </p>\n<p>According to Sen. Dick Durbin, a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5753195-whistleblower-allege-fbi-jet-misuse/amp/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">whistleblower told his office</a> that FBI pilots who had flown Patel hit federally mandated flight-hour limits, triggering required FAA rest periods. That meant the team tasked with analyzing and reconstructing the shooting scene couldn’t deploy for at least a day. Reuters has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-chief-patels-travel-decision-making-hampered-investigations-senate-democrat-2026-02-24/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> it could not independently verify those claims. The FBI has strongly denied the allegations, with spokesperson Ben Williamson calling them “ridiculous” and saying Director Patel was on official travel at the time.  </p>\n<p>Here’s why this matters.  </p>\n<p>The FBI director is required, for security reasons, to travel on government aircraft, even for personal trips, and must reimburse the government at the cost of a commercial flight. That’s not new. What is new is the scrutiny over how frequently those planes are being used and whether those decisions are affecting operations.  </p>\n<p>Durbin alleges this isn’t an isolated concern. He also points to the response to the Brown University shooting, <a href=\"https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/report-patels-sfl-flight-delayed-fbi-response-to-brown-university-shooting-40527333/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claiming</a> Patel’s decision to put the Hostage Rescue Team on standby, instead of activating closer regional SWAT teams, effectively tied up bureau aircraft and forced other responders to drive overnight. The FBI disputes that characterization, noting the incident was initially state-led and saying resources were not delayed because of director travel.  </p>\n<p>So at this point, we have competing narratives. On one side: a senior senator citing whistleblower claims of operational strain and delayed deployments. On the other: the bureau flatly rejecting the accusations and defending Patel’s travel as official and appropriate.  </p>\n<p>But let’s zoom out for a second.  </p>\n<p>The head of the FBI sets the tone. And <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5753195-whistleblower-allege-fbi-jet-misuse/amp/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to Durbin</a>, Patel once told field offices, “If you have golf, hockey, fishing, or hunting and beautiful sights, you’re going to see a lot of me.” Maybe that was a joke. Maybe it wasn’t. But leadership optics matter, especially when you’re overseeing time-sensitive, life-and-death investigations.  </p>\n<p>This isn’t about beer in a locker room or optics at the Olympics. It’s about whether taxpayer-funded resources are being managed in a way that prioritizes mission first, every single time.  </p>\n<p>If even the perception exists that travel decisions could delay justice in a murder case, that’s not partisan. That’s a governance issue.  </p>\n<p>The Government Accountability Office and the Justice Department’s inspector general are now being asked to look into it. That’s appropriate.   </p>\n<p>At the end of the day, this is simple: leadership is about judgment. And when you run the nation’s top law enforcement agency, judgment isn’t a side issue — it’s the job.  </p>\n<p><em>Lindsey Granger is a NewsNation contributor and co-host of The Hill’s commentary show “Rising.” This column is an edited transcription of her on-air commentary.  </em> </p>",

But a New York Times columnist for their Athletic subsection, Jerry Brewer, wrote a column saying that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/7068426/2026/02/24/usa-mens-olympics-hockey-gold-donald-trump/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the team “won gold — and then lost the room.”</a>  </p>\n<p>What? What room, the feminist studies department at some sports-hating, fun-killing liberal arts college? Because I think most people are pretty happy about the win, even if you don’t like or care about hockey. I fully admit this is the most interested I’ve been in hockey since I was a kid in Detroit in the ’ 90s, watching our Red Wings win the Stanley Cup. </p>\n<p>So what gives?  </p>\n<p>Well, The New York Times, and some other liberals, are mad that some members of our hockey team had the audacity to meet with President Trump. Shake his hand, even. Accept medals from him, and praise. How shocking! How horrifying! Don’t they know they are helping to normalize fascism!?! </p>\n<p>Seriously, that’s it. That’s the problem. </p>\n<p>Brewer writes: “These are men who thrilled a nation and rocked the world, and as adults, they need to be more savvy. Trump, perhaps more than most modern presidents, understands the optics of standing next to winners. It normalizes him. It softens his cruel instincts and crude jokes, recasting them as locker-room banter. It washes his reputation and reduces the impact of polls that indicate a significant majority of Americans disapprove of his second term.  </p>\n<p>These champions have agency. In the afterglow of triumph, they have more agency than they ever will. They should be wary of giving it away so casually.” </p>\n<p>OK, but here’s the problem with that: supporters of Trump are the majority of the country. He won the election and the popular vote. Trump is normal now. Sorry about that. </p>\n<p>I would agree that it doesn’t help us at all for professional athletes to lean way into politics, or start talking about their views on issues. In fact, the hockey team avoided doing just that. But coming to the State of the Union, taking a photo with Trump — come on. That is normal. It’s normal no matter who the president is. Remember Barack Obama <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Barack_Obama_with_artistic_gymnastic_McKayla_Maroney_2.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">taking a photo</a> with Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney?  </p>\n<p>I don’t remember people being upset about that. I wasn’t. I thought it was a cool photo! </p>\n<p>The New York Times needs to get over itself. Chill out. There’s nothing wrong with the president being excited about the performance of our Olympians, and our athletes receiving some much deserved admiration. </p>\n<p>Ironically, the one athlete the liberal media did seem eager to celebrate was Eileen Gu, a traitor <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/19/sport/eileen-gu-china-us-controversy-winter-olympics-intl-hnk\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">who chose to compete on China’s Olympic team.</a> You’d think that if we’re so worried about normalizing totalitarianism, we’d be more upset about an athlete choosing to associate herself with one of the world’s most brutal and authoritarian regimes: Communist China. </p>\n<p>But liberal Vox <a href=\"https://x.com/AGHamilton29/status/2026487801684889941\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hailed Gu as a “winner”</a> of the narrative surrounding the Olympics. And they said the US Men’s hockey team were losers because they met with Trump. Losers.  </p>\n<p>Ridiculous. And mainstream media wonders why so many Americans hate them? </p>\n<p><em>Robby Soave is co-host of The Hill’s commentary show “Rising” and a senior editor for Reason Magazine.

            "description": "<p>Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.) said Thursday the Trump administration lacks a “clear objective” with respect to its <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5755665-live-updates-trump-iran-hillary-clinton/\">pressure campaign towards Iran</a>. </p>\n<p>“The president hasn’t made the case to the American public, and they don’t have a clear objective,” Kaine <a href=\"https://www.ms.now/morning-joe/watch/no-war-in-iran-without-a-vote-of-congress-sen-kaine-on-his-war-powers-resolution-2489345091839\">said on MS NOW</a>.</p>\n<p>“This looks like [the] Iraq [War], which was a disaster, but without the work done at the front end to try to convince the American public and Congress that it’s a good idea,” he added later.</p>\n<p>Special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law, met Thursday with Omani and Iranian officials in Geneva, Switzerland. Omani Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi <a href=\"https://x.com/badralbusaidi/status/2027089708392579576?s=20\">wrote on social media</a> after the meeting that the sides made “significant progress” and “will resume soon after consultation in the respective capitals.”</p>\n<p>The foreign minister added that “technical” discussions will take place next week in Vienna, Austria. </p>\n<p>The meeting came two days after Trump again <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5755742-trump-iran-nuclear-threat/\">vowed to ensure</a> that Iran never develops a nuclear weapon. Last June, the president said that <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5363831-iran-nuclear-site-damage-trump-iran/\">U.S. strikes obliterated</a> three Iranian nuclear sites.</p>\n<p>“My preference is to solve this problem through diplomacy,” the president said Tuesday during his <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754101-trump-state-union-address-takeaways/\">State of the Union address</a>. “But one thing is certain, I will never allow the world’s No. 1 sponsor of terror, which they are by far, to have a nuclear weapon.”</p>\n<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said Wednesday that while the Islamic Republic is not currently enriching uranium, it is “trying to get to the point” where it can. </p>\n<p>“After their nuclear program was obliterated, they were told not to try to restart it, and here they are,” Rubio told reporters. “You can see them always trying to rebuild elements of it.”</p>\n<p>But Kaine, who said his war powers resolution on preventing the president from going to war with Iran without congressional approval will “likely” hit the Senate floor next week, pointed out Thursday that the rhetoric from the administration does not line up with Trump’s assertions last summer that the sites were obliterated.</p>\n<p>He also noted the administration is deporting Iranians, despite the president pledging to stand with the Iranian people amid widespread protests against the repressive regime.</p>\n<p>“They don’t care about how Iranians are treated,” said the Virginia Democrat.</p>",
