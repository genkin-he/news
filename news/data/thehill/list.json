            "title": "Atlantic reporter says Crockett campaign ejected her from event",
            "description": "<p>Atlantic journalist Elaine Godfrey reported in a piece published on Friday that she had been ejected from a campaign event for Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas), one of the two Democrats vying for Texas Senate this year – a claim Crockett’s campaign has denied.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/02/texas-senate-democratic-primary-talarico-crockett/686154/?gift=zYCTBrO_7y7KHmiTPdBdgy4WhHAIcXijFBHeV034_ys\">In the piece</a>, Godfrey said a woman with a “badge” had asked her to leave the Crockett campaign event in Lubbock, Texas. </p>\n<p>“They just said, ‘Elaine from Atlantic, white girl with a hat and notepad. She’s interviewing people in the crowd. She’s a top-notch hater and will spin. She needs to leave,’” the woman told Godfrey, according to the Atlantic report.</p>\n<p>Godfrey said she agreed to leave, and was then escorted by guards to a highway near the event. </p>\n<p>The congresswoman in an interview with CBS News denied that her campaign had ejected the reporter. </p>\n<p>“I’ll just say that it’s silly season,” Crockett <a href=\"https://x.com/shawnamizelle/status/2026850494849622342\">told CBS News</a> on Wednesday. She did not mention Godfrey by the name in the interview.  </p>\n<p>“I will say that, you know, there is a specific journalist who is — she has a history of being less than truthful, and frankly, there’s no evidence of anything that she’s talking about. I’ve not seen anything,” Crockett said. </p>\n<p>Crockett also claimed that Godfrey had been sued for defamation and lost. The Atlantic reputed that account on X. </p>\n<p>“We are not sure who this video is describing: Elaine Godfrey has never been sued for defamation, and she was in fact removed from a campaign rally in Lubbock this week,” Anna Bross, senior vice president of communications at The Atlantic, <a href=\"https://x.com/AnnaCBross/status/2027150296405737976\">wrote on X.</a> </p>\n<p>A Crockett campaign spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill.   </p>\n<p>In her story in the Atlantic, Godfrey wrote that a Crockett campaign spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about the incident. </p>\n<p>The series of events sparked criticism of Crockett from some Democrats. </p>\n<p>“Kicking out a reporter is bad. Blatantly lying about it is even worse,” “Pod Save America” podcast co-host Jon Favreau, who served as a speechwriter to former President Obama, <a href=\"https://x.com/jonfavs/status/2027389423692939762\">wrote on X.</a>  </p>\n<p>Democratic strategist Max Burns <a href=\"https://x.com/themaxburns/status/2027410414531653707\">suggested on X</a> that “the more the press consciously frames Crockett as violating the ‘rules’ of the game, the more her supporters rally,” drawing parallels to “Trump’s MAGA core strategy.” </p>\n<p>Godfrey’s piece came after Semafor <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/02/24/2026/texas-senate-candidate-jasmine-crockett-escalates-her-war-on-the-press\">reported</a> on the incident<a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/02/24/2026/texas-senate-candidate-jasmine-crockett-escalates-her-war-on-the-press\"> </a>this week. The outlet also said that Crockett’s campaign had called the Capitol Police on a CNN reporter for possible trespassing when he attempted to visit a campaign office location. CNN and Crockett’s team declined to comment on the matter for Semafor’s piece. </p>\n<p>“The Atlantic confirms our story in more detail. Crockett and her spokesperson pretty brazenly lied here. A bizarre move knowing, as I told them, that the Atlantic was going to publish their piece pretty soon anyway,” Semafor’s Max Tani <a href=\"https://x.com/maxwelltani/status/2027169064389337257\">wrote on X.</a></p>\n<p>The controversy comes as Crockett campaigns in the closely watched Democratic primary for Senate in Texas, as her party grows bullish about its chances of flipping incumbent Sen. Jon Cornyn’s (R) seat in the red stronghold. </p>\n<p>One recent survey from the University of Texas/Texas Politics Project found Crockett up by double-digits over her rival, Democrat James Talarico, in a race that’s been seen as a clash between competing approaches for the party in a state that went to Trump by double digits in 2024. </p>\n<p></p>",

            "title": "'I did nothing wrong': Bill Clinton denies knowledge of Epstein abuse in deposition",
            "description": "<p>Former President Clinton said he “did nothing wrong” and had “no idea of the crimes” Jeffrey Epstein was committing as he kicked off a deposition with the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Friday.</p>\n<p>“Though my brief acquaintance with Epstein ended years before his crimes came to light, and though I never witnessed during our interactions any indication of what was truly going on, I am here to offer what little I know so that it might prevent anything like this from ever happening again,” Clinton said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/BillClinton/status/2027424128559452573/photo/1\">prepared opening statement</a> posted on social media.</p>\n<p>He went on to say that he had “no idea of the crimes Epstein was committing,” and “saw nothing that ever gave me pause.”</p>\n<p>“I saw nothing, and I did nothing wrong,” Clinton said.</p>\n<p>Clinton is sitting for a deposition with the committee in Chappaqua, N.Y., after he and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, reversed course and agreed to interviews as they faced being held in contempt of Congress for defying a congressional subpoena.</p>\n<p>Hillary Clinton on Thursday sat for an hours-long deposition with the committee, in which she told the panel that <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5756577-clintons-questioned-epstein-links/\">she did not recall ever meeting</a> Epstein, only knew Ghislaine Maxwell as a casual acquaintance, and had no knowledge of their criminal activities. </p>\n<p>The former president bristled at his wife being called to appear.</p>\n<p>“But before we start, I have to get personal. You made Hillary come in. She had nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein. Nothing,” Clinton said. “Whether you subpoenaed 10 people or 10,000, including her was simply not right.”</p>\n<p>Bill Clinton, however, had a documented friendship with Epstein in the 1990s through about 2003. Epstein visited the White House during the Clinton administration; Clinton flew on Epstein’s plane multiple times; and photos have emerged of Clinton and Epstein. Clinton has said that he never visited Epstein’s island.</p>\n<p>“As someone who grew up in a home with domestic abuse, not only would I not have flown on his plane if I had any inkling of what he was doing—I would have turned him in myself and led the call for justice for his crimes, not sweetheart deals,” Clinton said.</p>\n<p>“No matter how many photos you show me, I have two things at the end of the day matter more than your interpretation of those 20-year-old photos,” Clinton added. “I know what I saw, and more importantly, what I didn’t see. I know what I did, and more importantly, what I didn’t do.”</p>\n<p>Hillary Clinton told reporters on Thursday that she was confident that her husband did not know anything about Epstein’s crimes, noting the chronology of their connection. Bill Clinton’s relationship with Epstein ended “several years” before the late financier was convicted of procuring a minor for prostitution in 2008.</p>\n<p>Bill Clinton noted that too.</p>\n<p>“We are only here because he hid it from everyone so well for so long. And by the time it came to light with his 2008 guilty plea, I had long stopped associating with him,” Clinton said.</p>\n<p>House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) said that Hillary Clinton’s deposition will inform their line of questioning of the former president.</p>\n<p>“Yesterday, Ms. Clinton deferred a lot of questions to her husband today. There were at least a dozen times when she said, ‘You’ll have to ask my husband that, I can’t answer that,’” Comer said in a press conference ahead of the deposition. “So, we already had a big portfolio of questions for him, and that increased yesterday.”</p>\n<p>Democrats on the Oversight panel have warned that by compelling a former president to comply with a congressional subpoena, Republicans have set a new precedent — one that could lead to Democrats eventually forcing President Trump to testify when they are back in power. </p>\n<p>Oversight ranking member Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) and other Democrats are calling for Trump to testify to the committee about documents they allege are missing from the Department of Justice’s disclosure of the so-called Epstein Files, which include unverified allegations of sexual abuse against Trump. The DOJ said Wednesday that it is <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5756249-doj-investigates-withheld-fbi-interviews/\">reviewing the files</a> that appear to be missing.</p>\n<p>“Before this, we had the Trump rule. Trump defied, as all of you know, a congressional subpoena with the January 6 Committee. He said, presidents don’t have to testify,” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) said in a press conference before the deposition. “Now we have the Clinton rule, which is that presidents and their families have to testify when Congress issues a subpoena, and that means that Donald Trump needs to come before our committee and explain what he knew about Epstein and explain why we have not had a full release of the documents.”</p>\n<p>The Oversight panel had voted on a bipartisan basis to subpoena the Clintons and several other former government officials last year, and spent months negotiating with the Clintons over how they could provide testimony about their links to Epstein.</p>\n<p>As they attempted to avoid depositions, the Clintons argued that they had already provided the committee with all the information they had about Epstein and Maxwell, provided sworn statements that they had no knowledge of their criminal activities, and argued that the subpoenas were invalid. </p>\n<p>Later, they <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5718848-clintons-reject-deposition-offer/\">sought</a> to have Hillary Clinton provide a sworn statement instead of testifying, and sought to limit the former president’s deposition to a four-hour interview. </p>\n<p>In January, nine <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5699996-democrats-clintons-contempt-vote/\">Democrats on the panel voted</a> with Republicans to hold the former president in contempt of Congress over the refusal to sit for a deposition, while three Democrats voted to hold Hillary Clinton in contempt of Congress.</p>\n<p>Hillary Clinton on Thursday also bristled at Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5757287-hillary-clinton-deposition-boebert-photo/\">leaking a photo of her during the deposition</a>, in violation of agreed-upon rules, and about Republican members asking about UFOs and the Pizzagate conspiracy theory.</p>",

            "description": "<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Friday that he agrees with Anthropic’s red lines in its increasingly contentious negotiations with the Pentagon over the terms of use for the company’s AI models.</p>\n<p>As the feud between Anthropic and the Defense Department (DOD) has reached a boiling point, the AI firm has refused to budge on lifting restrictions on two issues — mass surveillance and lethal autonomous weapons.</p>\n<p>The Pentagon has pushed for the company to agree to language that allows for “all lawful uses” of its technology. The DOD has given Anthropic until Friday at 5:01 p.m. ET to agree to its terms.</p>\n<p>If the company does not, the department is threatening to cancel a $200 million contract, in addition to warning it could label the AI firm a “supply chain risk” or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA), a federal power typically reserved for wartime or emergencies. </p>\n<p>“I don’t personally think the Pentagon should be threatening DPA against these companies,” Altman told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Friday morning.</p>\n<p>“But I also think that companies that choose to work with the Pentagon, as long as it is going to comply with legal protections and the few red lines that the field, we have, I think we share with Anthropic and that other companies also independently agree with, I think it is important to do that,” he continued.</p>\n<p>“For all the differences I have with Anthropic, I mostly trust them as a company, and I think they really do care about safety, and I’ve been happy that they’ve been supporting our warfighters,” the OpenAI CEO added.</p>\n<p>OpenAI and Anthropic are major competitors in the commercial AI race, a rivalry highlighted by Anthropic’s Super Bowl ad knocking OpenAI’s plan to introduce advertising to it’s free ChatGPT tool. Altman and Amodei notably declined to clasp hands during a group photo shoot at India’s AI summit last week. </p>\n<p>Ahead of the Friday deadline, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a lengthy statement that the company “cannot in good conscience accede” to the Pentagon’s terms.</p>\n<p>“Anthropic understands that the Department of War, not private companies, makes military decisions,” he wrote in the statement released late Thursday. “We have never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an ad hoc manner.”</p>\n<p>“However, in a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values,” he added. “Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do.”</p>\n<p>The Pentagon has argued that it has “no interest” in using AI to conduct mass surveillance or develop autonomous weapons.</p>\n<p>Following Amodei’s statement Thursday, Under Secretary of War Emil Michael accused the Anthropic CEO of having a “God-complex.”</p>\n<p>“He wants nothing more than to try to personally control the US Military and is ok putting our nation’s safety at risk,” he wrote in a post on the social platform X. “The @DeptofWar will ALWAYS adhere to the law but not bend to whims of any one for-profit tech company.”</p>",

            "description": "<p>TAMPA, Fla. (<a href=\"https://fox8.com/news/had-enough-airport-says-its-time-to-ban-pajamas/\">WJW</a>) – “It’s time to ban pajamas at Tampa International Airport.”</p>\n<p>A Florida airport <a href=\"https://x.com/FlyTPA/status/2027037182091731286/photo/1\">said on social media Thursday</a> that it wanted to prohibit people from wearing PJs, but it wasn’t being serious.</p>\n<div class=\"nlp-ignore-block article-content rich-text\">\n\n</div>\n<p>In a cheeky social media post, the airport claimed to have already banned Crocs and given “everyone the amazing opportunity to experience the world’s first Crocs-free airport.”</p>\n<p>“Pajamas. At the airport. In the middle of the day,” the airport wrote in a <a href=\"https://x.com/FlyTPA/status/2027037182091731286/photo/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">social media post</a>. “We’ve seen enough, we’ve had enough,” adding that “the madness stops today.” </p>\n<p>“Help Tampa International Airport become the first Crocs-free and pajama-free airport,” the post continued. “Do your part. Say no to pajamas at TPA.”</p>\n<div class=\"nlp-ignore-block article-content rich-text\">\n\n</div>\n<p>Of course, travelers looking for comfort may have a different opinion on the matter. Commenters on the post added some reasons they’re traveling in comfort.</p>\n<p>“I realize that in the days of yore, people dressed up for air travel. This was also the first cabin then. People only care about price. The PJs stay,” <a href=\"https://x.com/FlyTPA/status/2027037182091731286/photo/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">one wrote</a>.</p>\n<p>“I can’t support this, having sat at the terminal from 10 PM until nearly 4 AM on a flight delay,” <a href=\"https://x.com/FlyTPA/status/2027037182091731286/photo/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wrote another</a>. According to FlightAware, there were nearly 1,800 <a href=\"https://www.flightaware.com/live/cancelled/today\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">delays in the U.S. before noon on Thursday</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/FlyTPA/status/2027037182091731286/photo/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Another commenter said</a>, “I think a lot of people have also had enough. Of airports and airlines. We’re treated like cattle with rare exceptions, stuffed into tiny little seats. … We pay exorbitant prices for food and drink at the airport and then receive peanuts and a biscuit for a meal on the plane.”</p>\n<p>Beau Zimmer, an airport spokesperson, told The Associated Press the post was part of the airport’s longstanding social media persona — a tongue-in-cheek voice it has cultivated since its early days on Twitter, before the platform rebranded as X. The account has attracted a loyal global following, he said.</p>\n<p>“Our regular social media followers just eat this stuff up,” Zimmer said. “But obviously, this is all in fun, and we encourage our travelers to be comfortable.”</p>\n<p>Nexstar’s WJW sister station, WFLA, got a statement from Tampa International Airport as well.</p>\n<p>“Tampa International Airport regularly shares lighthearted, satirical social media content as part of our ongoing effort to engage with our followers. Today’s post about ‘banning’ pajamas was another playful nod to day-of-travel fashion debates. We encourage our passengers to travel comfortably and appreciate our loyal followers who enjoy the online humor.”</p>\n<p>U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy reacted to the post with a GIF of actor John Krasinski from the TV show “The Office” looking into the camera and saying, “Yes!”</p>\n<p>Last year, before holiday travel, Duffy <a href=\"https://www.livenowfox.com/news/transportation-secretary-americans-ditch-pajamas-slippers-airport-travel-holidays\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">issued a plea</a>.</p>\n<p>“I call this, just maybe dressing with some respect.

Let’s try not to wear slippers and pajamas as we come to the airport.” </p>\n<p><em>The Associated Press contributed to this report. </em></p>",

In some cases, major changes have been introduced with <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/Press/Reports/2025NTE.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">little notice</a> and no meaningful implementation period, creating immediate operational disruptions across North American supply chains. </p>\n<p>To compound these matters, Mexico’s <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/events/justice-ballot-impact-mexicos-judicial-reform-rule-law-and-business-environment\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">judicial overhaul</a>, under which every justice in the country is popularly elected, with an initial round of elections in 2025 and a second in 2027, has consolidated the ruling Morena Party’s <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/no-checks-power-effects-mexicos-judicial-reform-foreign-investment-and-usmca/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">control</a> over all branches of Mexico’s government.</p>\n<p>Companies must pursue remediation in a court system increasingly favoring a Mexican state pursuing occasionally predatory policies. Aggressive audits and the denial of refund requests serve to intimidate companies and send the message that payment is the path of least resistance. The result is that expansion plans are put on hold, and profits are immobilized to remain in reserve as a hedge against enforcement risk.  </p>\n<p>Not even Mexico’s vaunted special economic zones have been spared. Long recognized as responsible for driving much of the country’s export-oriented growth and increasing its competitiveness, companies report the Mexican government ignoring tax deductions and exemptions recognized under previous Mexican administrations and even engaging in <a href=\"https://www.cta.tech/media/bicb4rey/cta-comments-on-the-usmca-joint-review.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">double taxation</a> against some companies operating in these manufacturing-oriented zones.  </p>\n<p>As my organization <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/nearshoring-without-growth-why-investment-uncertainty-holding-mexico-back\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">noted</a> in a recent analysis: “Industry submissions to the U.S. Trade Representative illustrate this dynamic, with firms reporting retroactive reinterpretations of value-added tax rules, in some instances extending back nearly a decade.” To complicate matters, retroactivity has been <a href=\"https://www.jornada.com.mx/noticia/2025/10/01/politica/pospone-corte-discusion-sobre-doble-cobro-tributario-a-maquiladoras\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">supported</a> by Mexican justices before. </p>\n<p>Mexico’s policy choices are inevitably a North America problem. During the <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/usmca-review-2026\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">upcoming USMCA review</a>, Mexico’s investment climate and the impacts on U.S. and Canadian companies will be under intense scrutiny. Indeed, in recent testimony before the U.S. Congress, United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/about/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2025/december/ambassador-greer-reported-congress-operation-united-states-mexico-canada-agreement\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">referenced</a> investment uncertainty casting a shadow over the future of the USMCA. Mexico’s policy choices, by extension, risk tainting broader perceptions of North America as an investment destination. </p>\n<p>Since much of this pain is self-inflicted, the solutions are well known. To be sure, tax enforcement has been a challenge for multiple Mexican administrations, but the fiscal shortfall cannot and should not come from squeezing companies operating in North America under established rules and prior agreements reached with previous governments. Instead, the Morena Party should work to reduce informality in Mexico’s economy and enforce compliance against wealthy individuals who have evaded payment for years — some of whom are even <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/es/post-opinion/2019/09/24/manuel-bartlett-sus-empresas-propiedades-e-historia/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">major figures</a> within the party itself. </p>\n<p>Uncertain audits, aggressive tax claims and shifting rules may seem like quick fixes to wring resources from companies, but they will not solve Morena’s fiscal woes and will likely only damage Mexico’s long-term reputation. Only a regulatory climate capable of generating conditions for further investment can help Mexico reach its full potential. </p>\n<p><em>Ryan C. Berg, Ph.D. is director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies.</em></p>",

Senate Democrats on Monday <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5751002-senate-democrats-trump-tariff-refunds/\">rolled out legislation</a> with a 180-day deadline for the Trump administration to pay back the $175 billion it collected through tariffs. </p>\n<p>“Senate Democrats will continue fighting to rein in Donald Trump’s price-hiking trade and economic policies,” said Sen.

This included the announcement of a 10 percent universal tariff he imposed through Section 122 of the Trade Act, which expire in 150 days without congressional approval. </p>\n<p>“In order to protect our country, a president can actually charge more tariffs than I was charging in the past period of a year under the various tariffs authorities,” Trump told reporters after the ruling last week, adding, “we can use other of the statutes, other of the tariff authorities, which have also been confirmed and are fully allowed.”</p>",

            "description": "<p>Scouting America has agreed to change several of its policies to maintain financial backing from the Pentagon, including that membership in the organization will be based solely on “biological sex at birth and not gender identity,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Friday morning. </p>\n<p>Hegseth, who has threatened to cut ties with Scouting America over its policies of inclusion, said in a video posted on X that the group has agreed to comply with President Trump’s executive order titled “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity.” </p>\n<p>He said the group will review and replace “politicized, divisive and discriminatory language,” end its Citizenship in Society merit badge, introduce a Military Service merit badge and waive registration fees for children of active duty, guard and reserve families, the Pentagon chief said in a 6-minute video. </p>\n<p>“Scouting will also make clear that biological boys and girls will not be allowed to occupy or share intimate spaces together, toilets, showers, tents, anywhere like that,” Hegseth said. </p>\n<p>Scouting America, which is based in Texas, allowed gay youth in 2013 and said that it would begin accepting transgender students in 2017. Girls of all ages were allowed to join the organization starting in 2019. Co-ed explorer and venturing programs have operated for decades. </p>\n<p>Hegseth’s announcement comes as the Pentagon said earlier this month it <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5720505-scouting-america-pentagon-agreement-near/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">was close to an agreement</a> with Scounting America, previously called Boy Scouts, after reviewing its partnership over the past several months, saying the group has made choices in the last decade that “run counter to the values of this administration and this Department of War, including an embrace of DEl and other social justice, gender-fluid ideological stances.”</p>\n<p>Scouting America said in a statement to The Hill that it would implement the changes, including “reinforcing our commitment to Scouting’s foundational ideas: leadership, character, duty to God, duty to country and service.” </p>\n<p>“Throughout this engagement, Scouting America held firm on the core commitments that define us. We maintained our name as ‘Scouting America’ and preserved our service to the more than 200,000 girls who participate in our programs,” the group said in a lengthy statement. </p>\n<p>“Girls have been an integral part of Scouting since the 1960s and have served as leaders and program developers for decades. That commitment is unwavering.”  </p>\n<p>The connection between Scouting American and the U.S. military is deep, as the U.S. military has sponsored Scout troops and supported their activities on military bases for decades. The military has long backed the organization’s National Boy Scout Jamboree. </p>\n<p>Hegseth said the department’s support for Scouting America will be contingent upon making and maintaining the proposed changes in the next six months. After six months, the Pentagon will review its progress and reassess its support.</p>\n<p>“If we’re unsatisfied with scouting America’s progress toward and commitment to the agreed upon reforms, we will find them in violation of the president’s executive order and cease our support,” Hegseth said. “We hope that doesn’t happen, but it could.” </p>\n<p>The Pentagon chief said he thinks the organization should go back to being the Boy Scouts. </p>\n<p>“A group that develops boys into men. Maybe someday,” he said.</p>",
