Critics call it self-aggrandizing. When asked about the project, President Trump quipped that <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-admits-hes-building-arc-de-trump-for-me.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">it is for him</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Whatever is intended by the memorial and the symbolism of its location, it will be the American people who ultimately decide what this monument means.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/white-house-fires-all-commission-of-fine-arts-members-362ea9e1?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfz1JS3agyYiG8BQKhKdTSaN9UIbjepXhdpVoAmUDGGDyhF8er4CxYUBoZTYiY%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6903820e&amp;gaa_sig=EAPG3qA6CZzGUdf6HeCkstjhfhEs3Ps-2WFQOWDZUusDxfqPVaK9G5aZPqapMlyMbUVjPt97KjOabbfR-RDSaA%3D%3D\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claims</a> that “every time somebody rides over that beautiful bridge to the Lincoln Memorial, they literally say, something is supposed to be here,” the proposed site — Memorial Circle, at the Virginia end of the Arlington Memorial Bridge — is not a blank canvas. </p>\n<p>For a century, Lincoln’s temple to freedom and Lee’s former plantation — Arlington House, once home to the Confederate general Robert E. Lee — have faced each other across the river in a dialogue about emancipation, slavery and reunion. The bridge that joins them was meant to symbolically and literally join the North and South.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The National Park Service <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gwmp/learn/management/history.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">explains</a> that the bridge “also serves as the ceremonial entrance to Arlington National Cemetery, our nation’s most hallowed ground and the final resting place for more than 400,000 active-duty service members, veterans and their family members.” When unveiling the design to an audience of fundraisers, the president <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-ballroom-dinner-robert-e-lee-statue-b2846627.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">remarked</a> that he would have been fine with a statue to Lee in the same location.</p>\n<p>A massive triumphal arch in this location would intrude upon and dramatically reinterpret this symbolism of reunification. Americans might therefore question the intention behind it, and whether it carries a political or ideological signal through its choice of location. This is especially understandable because of recent efforts by the current administration to revisit Civil War memory by questioning <a href=\"https://www.military.com/history/trump-renaming-7-army-installations-here-are-stories-behind-names-being-scrubbed.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the renaming of military bases</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/us/politics/confederate-statue-trump.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">restoring certain Confederate monuments</a>.</p>\n<p>The current site is also a confusing selection because a more suitable one immediately comes to mind, along the same axis but east of the Capitol instead of west. The former RFK Stadium redevelopment comprises nearly 200 acres slated for mixed use with parks, housing, and a proposed stadium for the Washington Commanders. It would provide expansive space for a monumental arch and pedestrian-friendly park, along with unobstructed vistas toward the U.S. Capitol rotunda — a fitting gateway to the city, in the classical tradition of arches marking civic entrances.</p>\n\n<p>To many, the proposed arch is akin to the White House ballroom, It evinces a desire to monumentalize the self, to transform shared civic spaces into reflections of personal power and to do so without permission from the American people. A triumphal arch — especially one front-loaded by a president, unveiled at a donor gala and paired with the 90,000-square-foot White House ballroom — sounds less like national commemoration and more like personal aggrandizement.</p>\n<p>But previous national birthdays have been punctuated by great monuments and movements. At 100 years, <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/06/17/day-history-statue-liberty-came-america#:~:text=The%20Statue%20of%20Liberty%2C%20a%20gift%20from,the%20French%20to%20support%20the%20same%20ideals.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">France gifted us the Statue of Liberty</a>, a beacon linking freedom, immigration and democracy. At 200 years, the <a href=\"https://blog.nixonfoundation.org/2010/06/legacy-of-parks/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Legacy of Parks</a> program invested in hundreds of community spaces across the country, expanding public land and recreation for millions. Both commemorations reflected humility and inclusion. </p>\n<p>Democracies build monuments and memorials through consent, deliberation and the slow work of compromise. Since 1986, the <a href=\"https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title40/subtitle2/partD/chapter89&amp;edition=prelim\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Commemorative Works Act</a> has required that new national memorials undergo public hearings, congressional authorization and scrutiny by independent design commissions.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Dozens of steps in the process are not bureaucratic hurdles. They are democratic safeguards ensuring that national symbols remain national.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.usace.army.mil/About/History/Historical-Vignettes/Parks-and-Monuments/152-Lincoln-Memorial/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Lincoln Memorial took decades</a> of debate and legislation. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mlkm/learn/building-the-memorial.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The King Memorial</a> emerged after years of organizing and bipartisan cooperation. Those deliberate rhythms are proof that our monuments belong to the people.</p>\n<p>Regardless of where this monument might eventually stand on our national landscape, and regardless of whether it is imposed on the vista or endorsed by its people, the narrative arc for this moment in our national history, the moment it is intended to represent, is still being written. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n\n<p>Martin Luther King Jr. famously reminded us that the arc of the moral universe bends toward justice.

In response to a question about the due process rights of those killed in the U.S. boat strikes, she said there was “a very cruel war” going on.</p>\n<p>“Maduro is not a conventional dictator,” she added. “We’re facing a narcoterrorist structure that has turned Venezuelan territory, Venezuelan resources, Venezuelan institutions into the activities of a criminal cartel.”</p>\n</div>",

In a few instances, nominees have been withdrawn. That is the case regarding Jeffrey Bornstein, whose nomination for Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and Chief Financial Officer the White House withdrew ten days ago.</p>\n<p>Why Bornstein’s name was withdrawn remains a mystery, reportedly even to the man himself. He was certainly well qualified. He is a managing director of a private equity investment firm and previously had been chief financial officer of General Electric. He not only has a long standing relationship with Deputy Secretary Steve Feinberg — a relationship that is critical to the success of any comptroller — but also is reported to have had a good meeting with President Trump, who then nominated him. </p>\n<p>But more than ten months since Trump took the oath of office, the War Department still does not have a comptroller, nor for that matter, a deputy under secretary either. It does not even have an acting comptroller, someone in the comptroller’s chain of command, to carry out that responsibility until the White House nominates and the Senate confirms one.</p>\n<p>Instead, the office is being filled by Jules Hurst, who is “performing the duties of” the comptroller. Hurst certainly has a strong defense background, having served in the Army, as a defense contractor, and as legislative director and defense advisor to Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.). But he is not only filling the empty comptroller slot. He is also “performing the duties of” assistant secretary of war for manpower and reserve affairs, in which role he serves as the principal advisor to Secretary Pete Hegseth and to Anthony Tata, Under Secretary for Personnel and Readiness, on all issues relating to military and civilian personnel policies. In addition, Hurst leads the department’s task force on eliminating DEI initiatives. </p>\n<p>Jay Hurst has quite a lot on his plate, yet with the government shutdown, and no immediate end in sight, the Comptroller job is far more challenging than in normal circumstances. The president has indicated that he wants the troops paid even as the government is closed. To that end, the Pentagon redirected $6.5 billion in unexpended research and development funds to the manpower and personnel accounts in order to pay the troops. There remain some $3.5 billion for research and development that could be transferred, but the fiscal 2025 National Defense Authorization Act limits transfers to $8 billion, meaning that only $1.5 billion can be transferred unless Congress issues a waiver.</p>\n<p>The remaining, limited ceiling on transfers between defense appropriations accounts indicates that if the shutdown lasts for much longer, it will be a major challenge to keep paying the troops. Indeed, Speaker Johnson has indicated as much, stating that the funding transfers are only a “temporary fix” and that troops might not get paid if the shutdown extends past October 31. Private donations, such as $130 million “anonymous” gift that the media are attributing to a member of the Mellon family, will not make much of a dent in the shortfall. It is unlikely that private donors can provide the billions needed until the government reopens.</p>\n<p>With no end in sight to the shutdown, which could soon break the record of 35 days set during the first Trump administration, there is an urgent need for creativity in the comptroller’s office to ensure that the armed forces continue to be paid. That would involve continuing coordination with the Senate and House armed services committees and especially their staffs. Whether Jay Hurst can do all that while also performing his personnel-related tasks is an open question. It will certainly place him under tremendous strain. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>Perhaps the White House and Secretary Hegseth should reconsider placing so great a burden on one individual.

John Curtis (R-Utah) says he is a “firm no” on eliminating the Senate filibuster, which requires legislation to have 60 votes to advance, pushing back on President Trump’s call to deploy the “nuclear option” to change Senate rules and reopen the government.</p>\n<p>“The filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate. Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t. I’m a firm no on eliminating it,” Curtis <a href=\"https://x.com/SenJohnCurtis/status/1984234593248248281\">wrote on X</a>, the social media platform, responding to a Fox News story on Trump’s demand to get rid of the filibuster to fund government.</p>\n\n<p>Senate Republicans have voted 13 times on a House-passed continuing resolution to reopen the government and keep it funded through Nov. 21.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Democrats have blocked the legislation every time by denying Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) the 60 votes he needs to advance the funding bill.</p>\n<p>Thune pledged last year to preserve the Senate filibuster when he campaigned to become the Senate majority leader after Republicans wrested control of the chamber away from Democrats.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Members of his leadership team, including Sens. James Lankford (R-Okla.), the Senate Republican Policy Committee vice chairman, and John Cornyn (R-Texas), an advisor to Thune’s leadership team, earlier this month ruled out a potential change to the filibuster.</p>\n<p>Some Republicans, however, predicted that Trump would ramp up pressure on the Senate GOP leadership to eliminate the filibuster if the shutdown dragged into November.</p>\n<p>“I think the pressure from the White House will become pretty enormous,” one Republican senator, who requested anonymity, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5566292-senate-republicans-filibuster-reform/\">told The Hill last week</a>, predicting that Trump would demand that GOP leaders blow up the filibuster to end the shutdown.  </p>\n\n<p>Thune told reporters last week that getting rid of the filibuster to reopen government would be a “bad idea.”</p>\n<p>Senate Republicans control 53 seats and could change the chamber’s rules by voting to set a new precedent that the filibuster does not apply to government-funding legislation.</p>\n<p>Changing the rules with a simple-majority vote instead of the 67 votes normally required under regular order is viewed as such a drastic step that it’s compared to detonating a nuclear weapon in a military conflict.</p>\n<p>Doing so would radically change the Senate by opening the door to passing legislation with a simple majority instead of 60, which would allow any party that wins control of the White House and both chambers of Congress to rewrite the nation’s laws in a relatively short period of time.</p>\n</div>",

Not all: The Gaza ceasefire is a good thing and I hope it holds. But in general, I have a grudging respect for his ability to underperform even my low expectations for his behavior.  </p>\n<p>Seriously, I don’t know how he does it. He is behaving outrageously and ignoring the laws, but you have to admire the creativity. Two weeks ago, did anyone have “<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-white-house-ballroom-57512e0d91432f75529946fddfbfe2c5\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tear down</a> part of the White House” or “punish Canada <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/25/world/canada/trump-tariffs-reagan-ad.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">for quoting Ronald Reagan</a>” on their bingo card? </p>\n\n<p>Trump’s <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115436697060819133\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">decision to impose</a> additional tariffs on Canada for running a television ad is exceptional on multiple levels. In short, Canada ran an ad on American TV stations featuring a 1987 speech in which President Reagan explained why tariffs, in general, are a bad policy that hurts American workers. Trump was so furious about this “fraudulent” ad that he imposed an additional 10 percent tariff on Canadian goods as a punishment and demanded it be taken down “IMMEDIATELY.” </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>You can imagine what happened. Trump may be able to ignore the Constitution, but he can’t ignore the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Streisand-effect\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Streisand Effect</a>. Had Trump done nothing, the ad would hardly have been noticed. Now it’s one of the biggest stories in the country, and millions of people are actively discussing Reagan’s thoughts on free trade. </p>\n<p>Trump’s plans for punishing Canada are <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-adds-10-tariff-canada-004143702.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">probably illegal</a>.  Although non-U.S. citizens acting outside the U.S. are <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2019/19-177\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">not protected</a> by the Constitution, Canada acted <a href=\"https://www.syracuse.com/us-news/2025/10/ontario-runs-anti-tariff-ads-on-us-tv-stations-with-a-surprising-voice.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">inside the U.S.</a> There is also a First Amendment “<a href=\"https://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/censorship\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">right to hear</a>.” So punishing a foreign government for communicating directly and openly with the American people on a topic of immense public interest may well violate the Constitution. It certainly violates the spirit of the Constitution. If someone inside the U.S. had run that ad, they would have unquestionably enjoyed all the protections that the First Amendment has to offer. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>That’s particularly true because the ad was neither incorrect <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fact-checking-claims-that-a-canadian-ad-was-misleading-about-reagans-tariff-warning\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">nor misleading</a>. It uses accurate quotes from a Reagan presidential address and correctly represents Reagan’s views on tariffs in general. Here’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hN_CVvzExpM\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the ad</a>. Here’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5t5QK03KXPc\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Reagan’s speech</a>. Judge for yourself.</p>\n<p>And let’s not forget that even under Trump’s reading of the law, he only has authority to impose tariffs when there is an “<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1701\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unusual and extraordinary threat</a>.” Canada running an ad quoting Reagan is not a threat, extraordinary or otherwise. </p>\n<p>But there is an even more fundamental question here. Trump claims that tariffs are part of his “America First” policy and are designed to make the U.S. economy stronger. Yet he is using them here to punish Canada because he’s personally offended by its efforts to speak directly to the American people. </p>\n\n<p>Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/oct-26-sec-scott-bessent-and-sen-ruben-gallego-plus-marcus-samuelsson-250654277998\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said as much</a>, claiming, “This is a kind of propaganda against U.S. citizens. It’s psy-ops. … What was the purpose of that other than to sway public opinion?” Heaven forbid someone should use a reasoned argument against the Trump administration in public. It is both tragic and hilarious that the Trump White House now considers an effort to foster a discussion as a “psy-op.”</p>\n<p>Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115436697060819133\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">also claims</a> that this ad might influence the Supreme Court as it <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/major-questions-dog-trump-tariff-war-as-scotus-wades-in/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">considers a challenge</a> to his authority to impose tariffs at all. I have serious concerns about the conservative majority’s objectivity, but even I have to admit that the idea the court will be swayed by a TV ad is ludicrous.</p>\n<p>This new tariff on Canada is part of a pattern. Trump also imposed a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/brazil-lula-trump-popularity-16a7cdc30ffd1812c43d9c84d0572520\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">50 percent punitive tariff</a> on Brazil — in the process increasing the <a href=\"https://www.nationalbeefwire.com/beef-imports\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cost of hamburger</a> in American supermarkets — because he was mad that former president Jair Bolsonaro was being prosecuted for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xrqxk9p4xo\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">attempting to overthrow the Brazilian government after losing an election</a>. There is no economic justification for this tariff, and Trump never pretended there was.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Indeed, there is no economic justification for any of this. Neither the Brazilian tariff nor the Canadian tariff will protect a single American job. They will, however, cost American businesses and consumers billions of dollars as things like lumber, fertilizer, coffee and beef become more expensive. Trump is using American trade policy simply for his own amusement.  </p>\n<p>There is some encouraging news, however. On Wednesday, the Senate <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5580167-senate-vote-trump-canada-tariffs/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">voted to rebuke Trump</a> by expressly removing his authority to impose such tariffs. But if you are expecting congressional Republicans to finally stand up to Trump, don’t get your hopes up. This effort garnered a total of four Republican votes, meaning 49 Republican senators still show no signs of an ethical pulse. </p>\n<p>Whether imposing tariffs or tearing down parts of the White House, Trump has made the entire federal government his own personal vanity project. Once you divorce American policy from American interests and make it about Trump’s whims, there’s no telling what you are going to get.   </p>\n\n<p>It is going to be a long three years. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fliberaldemocracy.substack.com%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7CCKulat%40thehill.com%7Cf3bf282d6bd045d7301508de17edbd05%7C9e5488e2e83844f6886cc7608242767e%7C1%7C0%7C638974507892777561%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C60000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=9x05yQjhyJ3hyaudGwLpF7FWaTHe93fS%2F4khQEEfTyY%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Chris Truax</em></a><em> is an appellate attorney who served as Southern California chair for John McCain’s primary campaign in 2008.</em>  </p>\n</div>",
