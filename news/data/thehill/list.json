These commissioners were supposed to serve through 2028 and were the people expected to review President Trump’s new projects, including a <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/10/26/37-white-house-ballroom-donors-funding-300-million-build-tech-ceos-trump/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$300 million White House ballroom</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7e8lv176go\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">triumphal arch near Arlington National Cemetery</a>.  </p>\n<p>Now, they’re gone.  </p>\n\n<p>In an email reviewed by The Washington Post, the White House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/29/trump-fires-arts-board-arc-ballroom\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">made it plain</a>, saying: “On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as a member of the Commission of Fine Arts is terminated, effective immediately.”  </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>A White House official later confirmed the move, saying: “We are preparing to appoint a new slate of members to the commission that are more aligned with President Trump’s America First Policies.”  </p>\n<p>Translation? Trump doesn’t just want to design buildings — he wants to design the people who approve them.  </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The Commission of Fine Arts isn’t political by nature. It’s the body that weighs in on monuments, memorials and historic buildings, from the Lincoln Memorial to the National Mall. It’s been an independent voice since 1910, advising presidents but not serving them. Until now.  </p>\n<p>Trump’s team has already <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/27/nx-s1-5583793/the-white-houses-east-wing-has-been-demolished-heres-how-americans-feel-about-it\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">torn down the White House’s East Wing</a> to make room for the ballroom, before any formal review could take place. One fired commissioner, Bruce Becker, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/28/trump-arts-commission-firings-ballroom-arch/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> his group “would look forward to a full review of the plans for the new structure that will replace the East Wing” — well, now he’s been terminated.  </p>\n<p>If this feels familiar, it’s because it is. President Biden <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/28/trump-arts-commission-firings-ballroom-arch/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">also fired</a> Trump appointees from the same commission in 2021, and critics accused him of politicizing the arts. But here’s the difference: Biden wasn’t preparing to build a ballroom with his name all over it.  </p>\n\n<p>Trump’s firing spree also extends to another key body, the National Capital Planning Commission, where his allies now hold the majority. That board will likely decide whether the ballroom gets approved. In other words, Trump now controls the referees and the field.  </p>\n<p>This isn’t just about art or architecture. It’s about legacy — and who gets to define it. When you control how Washington looks, you shape how history remembers you. And that’s the real story here: The man who once promised to “drain the swamp” is now redesigning it — in marble, gold, and his own reflection. </p>\n<p><em>Lindsey Granger is a NewsNation contributor and co-host of The Hill’s commentary show “Rising.” This column is an edited transcription of her on-air commentary.</em> </p>\n</div>",

Millions of people will see major price hikes on their plans.</p>\n\n<p>The ACA’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5579055-window-shopping-2026-affordable-care-act-plans/\">window-shopping period</a> started Wednesday, revealing the extent to which expiring tax credits will drive up monthly premiums.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The health research nonprofit KFF said the average increase in premiums for ACA plans will be 26 percent next year. The amount of people who pay for coverage, however, will rise by 114 percent on average.</p>\n<p>The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found in a new analysis this week that annual out-of-pocket premium payments would <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5579826-aca-premiums-more-than-double-without-credits/\">more than double</a>, exceeding $1,000 on average if the credits aren’t extended.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Here’s what to know ahead of open enrollment: </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Premiums are rising despite extended subsidies </h2>\n<p>Insurers’ rates were submitted and finalized earlier this year, so premiums are locked in, and any deal to extend the enhanced tax credits won’t change those rates.  </p>\n<p>According to a KFF analysis, 2026 premiums are set to increase 18 percent on average. </p>\n\n<p>The Washington Post, citing internal administration documents, reported the average ObamaCare premiums for the most popular midlevel “Silver” plan will increase 30 percent.  </p>\n<p>Insurers have cited the expiration of the enhanced tax credits as one reason why premiums are rising, because they anticipate healthy people dropping coverage if it’s too expensive. That would leave a smaller and sicker group of people, who are ultimately more expensive for the insurance company to cover. </p>\n<p>But the expected end to enhanced subsidies is not the only reason costs have increased. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Insurers have also cited higher drug prices and hospital costs, as well as overall medical inflation. According to Jessica Altman, executive director of Covered California, higher health costs account for 7 percent to 8 percent of the state’s average 10 percent premium increase.</p>\n<p>Premiums for private employer-sponsored plans are spiking for many of the same reasons — people are using their insurance more; labor costs are growing; and drug prices are high, especially for popular GLP-1s. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A shutdown deal to extend subsidies could blunt the financial hit</h2>\n<p>An extension of the subsidies won’t change premium rates, but most consumers only care about how much they contribute out-of-pocket.<br/><br/>No matter what the average premium increase is, people are going to be paying dramatically higher amounts if the enhanced subsidies are not renewed.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, Covered California’s Altman said the amount people pay each month will rise on average by 97 percent next year.  </p>\n<p>According to KFF, 22 million subsidized enrollees will see an average out-of-pocket premium increase of 114 percent in 2026.  </p>\n<p>Most people enrolled in Affordable Care Act plans are eligible for financial assistance, so they are not paying full price. Even if the extra subsidies expire at the end of the year, a majority of enrollees will still be eligible for assistance to lower their monthly premium costs. </p>\n\n<p>But the enhanced premiums made insurance much more affordable. For those at the poverty line — earning between $15,000 to $20,000 a year — instead of contributing between 2 percent and 3 percent of their income, they were eligible for “zero premiums” plans.   </p>\n<p>Someone earning $28,000 this year pays about $27 per month for a benchmark plan. Without the enhanced tax credit, that would jump to more than $130 per month in 2026. </p>\n<p>“The bottom line is that over 90 percent of marketplace enrollees are currently getting enhanced premium tax credits, which have reduced the amount of their income that they’re expected to contribute to premiums,” said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor and co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms (CHIR) at Georgetown University.  </p>\n\n<p>If Congress doesn’t extend the tax credits, that level of contribution “is going to be much, much higher, up and down the income scale,” Corlette said.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trump administration has done little outreach</h2>\n<p>By the end of October, almost all state-based exchanges will have sent notices to current enrollees informing them of higher premiums and reduced tax credits.</p>\n<p>But the Trump administration this year told insurers on the federal exchange that including premium information in their notices to consumers is voluntary.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, many enrollees won’t know about premium increases unless they log into their HealthCare.gov accounts; people who auto-enroll in plans may not find out until they receive their first bill. </p>\n<p>Less than a week away from open enrollment, the administration has also not yet opened the HealthCare.gov window-shopping period. For each of the past eight years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has launched Affordable Care Act (ACA) window-shopping on either Oct. 25 or 26. </p>\n<p>Senate Democrats on Monday called on the Trump administration to “stop hiding” premium increases and open window shopping immediately. </p>\n\n<p>“The over 24 million Americans relying on the ACA Marketplace for health coverage need clear information from CMS and their health insurance plans, and they need it now,” they wrote in a letter to CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz. </p>\n<p>The administration also slashed funding by 90 percent for federal navigators who help consumers enroll in plans. </p>\n<p>The Trump administration similarly cut ACA navigator funding every year during his first term and cut advertising to HealthCare.gov by 90 percent. When enrollments dropped, the administration said it was evidence the law was failing. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Impacts of subsidy loss will vary by states</h2>\n<p>Some states will fare worse than others. Window-shopping periods have already begun in more than a dozen states. The prices that customers are logging on to see are telling. </p>\n<p>KFF identified five congressional districts in Wyoming, West Virginia, Connecticut and Illinois where a 60-year-old couple making $85,000 would see the largest increases in their monthly premiums, ranging from 535 percent to nearly 700 percent. </p>\n<p>Gideon Lukens, director of research and data analysis on the health policy team for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, gave The Hill the example of a 60-year-old couple and said, “The average increase for that same example couple is typically over $20,000 annually.”</p>\n\n<p>Whether a state has opted to adopt Medicaid expansion, another provision of the ACA, will factor in to how the loss of subsidies will affect states. People in nonexpansion states who are ineligible for Medicaid coverage were particularly reliant on the ACA tax credits and won’t have the added safety net to fall back on.</p>\n<p>The majority of states and Washington, D.C., have already chosen to expand Medicaid, leaving only 10 states that haven’t adopted expansion: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming. </p>\n<p><em>This story was posted at 6 a.m. on Oct. 28 and updated at 1:30 p.m. on Oct. 30. </em></p>\n</div>",

I think that’s very telling.  </p>\n\n<p>GOP voters do not want feckless establishment leadership to succumb to Democrats’ efforts at emotional blackmailing over healthcare coverage, welfare payments and federal employee salaries. Because let’s keep in mind, Democrats are asking for everything. They want to maintain healthcare insurance subsidies that were intended to be a temporary COVID measure.

Vance fielded numerous questions from attendees, in a nod to the late TPUSA co-founder Charlie Kirk, who held similar “Prove Me Wrong” events on college campuses.</p>\n<p>The final question of the event addressed Trump’s primary endorsement against Massie, who has bucked his party on numerous issues, including calling for the release of the full Jeffrey Epstein files and voting against Trump’s signature tax and spending bill earlier this year.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The student noted the endorsement and asked: “How would you address those who fear that principled disagreement or independent thinking is discouraged within the party because of how it can be framed as a betrayal, instead of as internal accountability or an opportunity for debate and negotiation?”</p>\n<p>Vance thanked the student for her question, responding “this one is hard for me” because of his extensive relationship with Massie. He said Massie was one of the first people to reach out to him about running for political office, and the vice president said he tried to return the favor, when Massie’s wife died in recent years.</p>\n<p>“She died very unexpectedly, was a very sweet and kind woman, and I was probably one of the first people that called Thomas to offer my condolences,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, Vance said, Massie has bucked the party on so many high-profile issues that the party can no longer rely on him.</p>\n<p>“Being independent, having your own opinions, is one thing,” Vance said. “Voting against the party on every single issue — you’re eventually going to make too many enemies, and that is the problem that Thomas has had.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not one issue. It’s not three or four issues. It’s that every time that we’ve needed Thomas for a vote, he has been completely unwilling to provide it,” he continued.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Vance defended the president, saying loyalty in politics is a two-way street.</p>\n<p>“That is why the President United States has trained his ire on Thomas Massie. It’s because we can never count on him for some of the most difficult votes,” Vance said. “I wish that that weren’t the case. I say that as somebody who’s known Thomas well before I got into politics.”</p>\n<p>“But politics is politics,” he continued, “and when you always vote against the party, you can’t expect the party to actually back you. That’s the reality.”</p>\n\n</div>",

On Oct. 22 and into the following day, Russian missiles and drones hit cities from Kharkiv to Odesa, <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-war-chemical-plant-kyiv/33566126.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">killing at least seven people</a>, including children, and leaving millions without electricity.</p>\n<p>Ukraine’s military had earlier claimed a successful <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/ukrainian-military-says-it-struck-chemical-plant-southern-russias-bryansk-region-2025-10-21/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">strike on a gunpowder plant</a> deep inside Russia, using long-range Franco-British Storm Shadow missiles. The attack was hailed by some as a tactical success, but the response was devastating.</p>\n\n<p>These exchanges are becoming painfully routine. Each “reprisal” triggers another. Each round of strikes pushes the boundaries of escalation. This latest episode coincided with the <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/22/why-planned-trump-putin-talks-collapsed-and-what-it-means-for-ukraine\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">collapse of proposed U.S.-Russia ceasefire talks in Budapest</a>. Negotiations fell apart over irreconcilable demands, and with them went another flicker of hope for ending a war that has already claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and displaced millions more.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>It is now clear that this conflict has become a proxy war in all but name. The United States and its allies continue to pour weapons into Ukraine — Javelins, HIMARS, ATACMS — while promising that these will hasten peace. Instead, the result has been a prolonged stalemate that destroys cities, drains economies, and entrenches divisions. The moral cost is unbearable. I have spoken to Ukrainian families resettled in American cities who still scroll through messages from relatives hiding in basements. A father in Chicago described how his daughter’s school in Zaporizhzhia was leveled by a drone strike. “We have nothing left to rebuild,” he said quietly.</p>\n<p>What these stories reveal is that the suffering endures far beyond the battlefields. More than a million Ukrainians have been displaced again this year alone. Homes are gone, hospitals crippled, and energy systems shattered. Yet the flow of arms continues, as if this were the only language Washington knows how to speak. America’s military-first reflex is not a strategy; it is a habit.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The U.S. spends more on defense than <a href=\"https://www.pgpf.org/article/chart-pack-defense-spending/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the next nine countries combined</a>. Much of that goes to sustain global commitments that yield little long-term stability. The Pentagon’s vast budget fuels the illusion that every geopolitical problem can be solved with a missile or a military base. But each dollar spent on weapons is one not spent on domestic renewal — on rebuilding bridges, improving health care, or tackling climate resilience at home.</p>\n<p>In Ukraine’s case, that habit has translated into a war without an endgame. Every new shipment of advanced weaponry raises expectations of victory and invites Russian retaliation. The strike in Bryansk, followed by Moscow’s barrage of 405 drones and 28 missiles, showed just how swiftly escalation cycles spin out of control. Russian nuclear drills this week sent another ominous signal. The human cost of this spiral is staggering. In Kharkiv, emergency workers pulled bodies from the rubble. In Odesa, power cuts shut down hospital wards mid-operation.</p>\n<p>This is not strategy — it is endurance testing, financed by American taxpayers.</p>\n\n<p>There are alternatives. If even a fraction of U.S. defense spending were redirected toward diplomacy and reconstruction, it could create the framework for peace. That means funding humanitarian corridors, empowering neutral mediators, and backing UN-led negotiations that involve major regional players like China and India. True diplomacy doesn’t require surrender; it requires realism. It means accepting that no side will achieve absolute victory and that compromise, however distasteful, is the only path to stability.</p>\n<p>Recent history supports this. Détente during the Cold War showed that engagement, not escalation, can ease tensions between nuclear rivals. Restraint is not weakness — it’s wisdom learned from experience. Yet in Washington, political courage is often measured by how many weapons one can authorize, not how many lives one can save.</p>\n<p>Critics argue that dialing back arms shipments would embolden Moscow. But what, exactly, has the current strategy achieved? Russia’s war machine continues to grind on despite unprecedented sanctions. Ukraine, though resilient, is exhausted. Europe faces energy strains and rising costs. The Global South sees Western double standards laid bare: calls for rules-based order ring hollow when paired with selective intervention.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Instead of perpetuating this destructive loop, the U.S. could lead in rebuilding. It could focus on helping Ukraine become energy independent, supporting its agriculture, and preventing food insecurity that spills across borders. That form of leadership would restore credibility to American diplomacy. It would also recognize that security built on cooperation is more durable than security built on arms.</p>\n<p>The global consequences of this war are already immense. Energy prices are climbing again, inflation is squeezing developing economies, and the refugee crisis is straining Europe’s social fabric. The specter of nuclear escalation remains ever-present. These are not distant problems. They shape markets, elections, and the world our children will inherit.</p>\n<p>As winter closes in, blackouts and shortages will make life in Ukraine even harsher. Families will huddle in freezing apartments, lit by candlelight, waiting for the next air raid. The moral question facing Washington is simple: will the United States continue to bankroll destruction, or will it invest in peace?</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n\n<p>America has the power to shift the trajectory.

Every explosion is a reminder that endless militarism is not strength but failure. The world doesn’t need another arms race; it needs a race for peace. The United States, with all its influence and resources, still has a choice: continue feeding the cycle of violence or lead the way toward restraint and renewal.
