Leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom urged the U.S. to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5760393-uk-france-germany-iran-strikes-negotiations/\">return to the negotiating table</a> with Iran. </p>\n<p>The support from Carney is also notable as Ottawa and Washington have repeatedly clashed during Trump’s first year back in office, with a rollercoaster relationship marked by sharp disagreements over trade and Trump’s steep tariffs.</p>\n<p>Tensions escalated last month after Carney delivered a speech in Davos, Switzerland, in which he declared a “rupture” in the old world order.</p>\n<p>Trump in his own speech said Canada <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5703219-carney-trump-tensions-rise/\">“should be grateful to us”</a> and declared “Canada lives because of the United States,” telling the prime minister to “remember that.” </p>\n<p>After the president earlier this month threatened to block the opening of a major bridge between Detroit and Ontario, Carney said he had a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5732140-us-canada-bridge-dispute/\">“positive” conversation</a> with Trump.</p>\n<p>Carney on Saturday urged Canadians in Iran to shelter in place while calling for “the protection of all civilians in this conflict.” </p>",

            "title": "Why the Mamdani-Trump 'bromance' makes sense right now",
            "description": "<p>NEW YORK — When he was campaigning to be mayor of the nation’s largest city, Zohran  Mamdani liked to say he was President Trump’s “worst nightmare.” </p>\n<p>In his victory speech in November, Mamdani took it a step further — calling Trump a “despot” and declaring that if anyone could show how to defeat him, “it’s the city that gave rise to him.” </p>\n<p>Trump returned the fire.</p>\n<p>He called Mamdani a “communist” and someone “who doesn’t know a damn thing” while threatening to withhold federal funds from New York. </p>\n<p>But on Thursday — for the second time since the mayor was elected in November — Trump and Mamdani not only met at the White House. Both sides emerged claiming to have a productive meeting. </p>\n<p>“It is the most fascinating bromance in America right now,” New York Democratic strategist Trip Yang said. </p>\n<p>To go from sparring as Mamdani campaigned “to where they are now, which looks like best buddies in a romcom, it’s simply remarkable.” </p>\n<p>It’s an unusual turn of events: Two politicians who have built their brands and support by opposing the other side were suddenly collaborative.</p>\n<p>And yet, political observers say the relationship makes sense.</p>\n<p>“Game recognizes game, and what I mean by that is they see something kindred in each other,” said Basil Smikle, a former executive director of the New York State Democratic Party. </p>\n<p>“They’re populist leaders. They appeal to very different bases for very different reasons, but they both have been able to create very strong movements around their respective candidacies, and are in firm control of that. I think they each recognize that, in attempting to go after the other person, their respective supporters are unshakeable.” </p>\n<p>During Thursday’s unscheduled meeting, Mamdani proposed a plan to build 12,000 units of housing in Queens. The plan would cost more than $21 billion, one of the largest federal investments in recent history. </p>\n<p>When he arrived at the White House for the closed-door Oval Office meeting, Mamdani also brought a copy of a 1975 New York Daily News front page that screamed: [Gerald] Ford to City: Drop Dead. He paired it with a mock Daily News cover featuring Trump’s face and another headline: “Trump to City: Let’s Rebuild.” </p>\n<p>A smiling Trump ended up holding both front pages in a photo that Mamdani shared on X, the social media site. </p>\n<p>“I’m looking forward to building more housing in New York City,” Mamdani wrote in the post. </p>\n<p>During their first White House meeting in November, Trump told Mamdani to come back to him with “some big ideas on how we can build some things together in New York City,” Joe Calvello, the mayor’s spokesperson, told reporters after the meeting, according to the New York Post. </p>\n<p>“And that’s what he did today,” Calvello said, adding that Trump was “enthusiastic” about the plan. “The mayor took him up on his offer and went to D.C.” </p>\n<p>Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University, said the mayor had a good idea in taking the development proposal to a former real estate figure who was raised in Gotham and is known for his real estate empire there. </p>\n<p>“You’ve got the fact that they both care about New York, and you’ve got the fact [Mamdani] is coming to Trump with an idea about doing something that is in Trump’s wheelhouse,” Reeher said. </p>\n<p>Susan Del Percio, the longtime Republican strategist who is based in New York, said it is “quite smart” to go straight to Trump with proposals because “anything he can get from Trump makes him not as beholden to [New York Gov. Kathy] Hochul.” </p>\n<p>What does Trump get out of the deal? Del Percio was asked. </p>\n<p>“Probably his name on a building,” she said. </p>\n<p>Calvello said that during the meeting, Mamdani also swayed Trump to release a Columbia University student who had been obtained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers earlier in the day. He also provided the president with a list of four others who had been apprehended by ICE officers. </p>\n<p>The Trump-Mamdani meeting came two days after Trump called the mayor in his State of the Union address “a nice guy.”</p>\n<p>“Actually speak to him a lot,” the president said. “Bad policy, but nice guy.” </p>\n<p>As he pushed for Congress to pass his voter-ID bill, the president pointed out Mamdani’s emergency snow-shoveling program in the Big Apple, arguing “if you apply for that job, you need to show two original forms of ID and a Social Security card.” </p>\n<p>“I can tell you, I didn’t expect this much attention nationwide on our emergency snow shoveler program,” Mamdani <a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fmayors-office%2Fnews%2F2026%2F02%2Ftranscript--mayor-mamdani-ahead-of-feb--27-deadline--mayor-mamda&amp;data=05%7C02%7Ciswanson%40thehill.com%7C1dc76e9271164c2cee9308de763cebe9%7C9e5488e2e83844f6886cc7608242767e%7C1%7C0%7C639078201242847982%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=eBSaZ3mL%2B85pKitMCex%2Fj7NDKy8BWgwKGrqFvGHVw4w%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">quipped the next day</a>. </p>\n<p>Smikle also said New Yorkers seem generally approving, if not somewhat in awe, of Mamdani’s Trump approach. </p>\n<p>“Mamdani seems to have defanged Donald Trump. I think New Yorkers are proud of their mayor, but there’s also a curiosity: What is it about him that is so disarming?” </p>\n<p>But he cautioned that the mayor should still tread carefully with the unpredictable president.</p>\n<p>“Trump has, historically, tried to make sure that he feels he’s in control, and that people are paying appropriate deference to him,” he said. “What is very possible is that Trump could have this relationship with him today, on the surface, and then come around and try to test his resolve by doing other things that would make it seem that the relationship has been fractured, and that it’s Mamdani’s fault, and then force him into a situation where he then has to very publicly capitulate.” </p>\n<p>While Mamdani and Trump clearly see some positives in the bromance, Yang questioned how much further the relationship can progress as a win-win for both figures.</p>\n<p>“How long can the buddy cop saga play out? There may be times where that relationship is tested, so seeing how sustainable it is probably the biggest question mark.” </p>\n<p>More than 2 million New Yorkers voted in November’s election, marking the highest turnout for a mayoral election since 1969. Throughout his campaign, Mamdani, who is the youngest mayor of New York in more than a century, built his victory on an unusually diverse coalition, even attracting some Republicans by centering his campaign on economic issues including affordable housing. </p>\n<p>Since securing a surprise win in the primary in June, Mamdani has become one of the most visible faces of the progressive movement within the Democratic Party. That prominence has led some Democrats to wonder whether his newfound relationship with Trump could alienate parts of his base.</p>\n<p>But Del Percio poured cold water on that idea.</p>\n<p>“No one is thinking Mamdani is becoming a closet conservative,” she said.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Gulf countries expressed outrage on Saturday in the face of military attacks from the Islamic Republic of Iran, a rare show of unity in pushing back against Tehran in the wake of U.S. and Israeli strikes against the country. </p>\n<p>Iran is retaliating in the face of President Trump’s early Saturday decision to launch a major military operation with Israel aimed at toppling the regime in Tehran.</p>\n<p>Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait all appeared to have been targeted by Iranian attacks. Iran also targeted sites in Jordan. All of these countries host U.S. bases or forces in the region. </p>\n<p>“The regime has not capitulated in the least. At least not yet,” said Jonathan Schanzer, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington based thinktank. </p>\n<p>“They are fighting back and so what we’re watching is this sort of test of wills,” he said in a briefing on Saturday, responding to Iran’s targeting of Gulf states. </p>\n<p>Saudi Arabia announced it would aid countries in repelling Iranian attacks. </p>\n<p>“Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs affirmed the Kingdom’s full solidarity with the countries concerned and its firm support for them, stating that it would mobilize all its capabilities to assist them in any measures they undertake,” the ministry said in a statement. </p>\n<p>The UAE, in a statement, emphasized that the country’s security is “indivisible” from its Gulf neighbors “and that any infringement on the sovereignty of any state constitutes a direct threat to the security and stability of the entire region.”</p>\n<p>Schanzer said it’s interesting to see the countries “banding together with the United States.” </p>\n<p>“The Emiratis and the Saudis are now speaking the same language,” he said.</p>\n<p>“They have been at odds with one another over the last several weeks, they are issuing statements of support for one another as Iranian missiles and drones are getting shot across the region.” </p>\n<p>Here’s a breakdown of attacks so far as this story develops: </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Saudi Arabia</strong></h2>\n<p>Saudi Arabia said Iranian attacks targeted the capital city of Riyadh and the Eastern Province. The Kingdom said it had successfully intercepted Iranian attacks. </p>\n<p>In a statement on X, the Saudi Foreign Ministry condemned Iranian strikes on its territory, calling them unjustified because the Kingdom had affirmed it would not allow its airspace to be used for any U.S. or Israeli attacks against the country. </p>\n<p>“These attacks cannot be justified under any pretext or in any way whatsoever, and they came despite the Iranian authorities’ knowledge that the Kingdom had affirmed it would not allow its airspace or territory to be used to target Iran,” <a href=\"https://x.com/KSAmofaEN/status/2027750941047349501?s=20\">the statement read.</a></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bahrain</strong></h2>\n<p>Iran managed a strike against a service center of the U.S. Fifth Fleet naval base in Bahrain, Reuters reported </p>\n<p>The Kingdom of Bahrain said in a statement it “had been subjected to external attacks targeting sites and installations within its borders” but said it successfully intercepted some Iranian attacks. </p>\n<p>“The Government affirmed its full right to respond and to take all necessary measures to defend its national security and safeguard its sovereignty, in coordination with its allies and partners.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Qatar</strong></h2>\n<p>Qatar reportedly intercepted Iranian ballistic missiles targeting the Al-Udeid airbase in Doha, which hosts the U.S. Central Command. </p>\n<p>Qatar warned it reserves the right to retaliate in the face of Iranian strikes, but called for a cessation of hostilities and warned of a wider regional war. </p>\n<p>Qatar called for “efforts to contain the crisis in a manner that preserves the security of the region, safeguards the interests of its peoples, and prevents a slide into broader confrontations.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>UAE</strong></h2>\n<p>Explosions were reported across Dubai and Abu Dhabi and the Emirati government said it reserved the right to respond. A Pakistani citizen was reportedly killed in the UAE related to the interception of an Iranian missile. </p>\n<p>“The UAE will not tolerate any compromise to its security or sovereignty under any circumstances,” the foreign ministry said in a statement on X. </p>\n<p>Reuters reported at least five booms in rapid succession that caused windows to vibrate in a house near Abu Dhabi’s Corniche, its premier waterfront promenade. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Kuwait</strong></h2>\n<p>A drone targeted Kuwait’s International Airport on Saturday, resulting in minor injuries to a number of workers and limited material damage to the passenger termina, the General Authority of Civil Aviation said in a statement. </p>\n<p>Earlier on Saturday, Kuwait’s Armed Forces said it had “engaged aerial missiles detected in the airpsace.”</p>",

            "description": "<p>Democrats reacting to U.S. strikes early Saturday morning on Iran criticized President Trump, saying he has failed to learn from multiple failed U.S. interventions in the Middle East and accusing the president of sidestepping Congress in launching the attacks. </p>\n<p>Sen. <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/mark-warner/\">Mark Warner </a>(D-Va.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, questioned the need for the attack in his statement, and warned the U.S. could be repeating “mistakes of the past” in a nod to the Iraq War launched by former President George W. Bush.</p>\n<p>“The American people have seen this playbook before – claims of urgency, misrepresented intelligence, and military action that pulls the United States into regime change and prolonged, costly nation-building,” Warner wrote. </p>\n<p>“We owe it to our service members, and to every American family, to ensure that we are not repeating the mistakes of the past. The president owes the country clear answers: What is the objective? What is the strategy to prevent escalation? And how does this make Americans safer?”</p>\n<p>Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee also said the president had failed to learn “the lessons of history.”</p>\n<p>“Everything I have heard from the Administration before and after these strikes on Iran confirms this is a war of choice with no strategic endgame,” Himes said in a statement.</p>\n<p>“Military action in this region almost never ends well for the United States, and conflict with Iran can easily spiral and escalate in ways we cannot anticipate. It does not appear that Donald Trump has learned the lessons of history.”</p>\n<p>Trump, in <a href=\"https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/full-text-trump-announces-major-combat-operations-in-iran/\">a video</a> <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116147082884192486\">posted to Truth Social</a> overnight, said the U.S. was “going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground” and also called for regime change in Iran.</p>\n<p>But Democratic critics called those goals unrealistic.</p>\n<p>“The goals laid out by President Trump — ending Iran’s destabilizing nuclear weapons program, dismantling its missile arsenal, crushing its proxy network, and regime change — are not the objectives of a limited strike,” said Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. </p>\n<p>“They are the objectives of a prolonged war. Military force can degrade Iran’s capabilities, but without a defined end state and real diplomacy, these objectives invite escalation.” </p>\n<p>Several Democrats also faulted Trump for failing to account for his own actions that set the stage for the growth of Iran’s nuclear program as well as inconsistencies in his statements about the both risks of its nuclear capabilities and U.S. success in thwarting them.</p>\n<p>Sen Tim Kaine (D-Va.), one of the sponsors of a war powers resolution, noted it was Trump who in 2018 withdrew the U.S. from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) initially signed in 2015, a deal that was effectively blocking Iran’s pathway to building a bomb.</p>\n<p>“Has President Trump learned nothing from decades of U.S. meddling in Iran and forever wars in the Middle East? Is he too mentally incapacitated to realize that we had a diplomatic agreement with Iran that was keeping its nuclear program in check, until he ripped it up during his first term?” <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5760434-kaine-trump-us-iran-strikes-nuclear/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5760434-kaine-trump-us-iran-strikes-nuclear/\">Kaine said</a>.</p>\n<p> Trump last June launched strikes on Iran, with the president at the time asserting the U.S. had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>That claim generated much pushback, with skeptics arguing Iran wasn’t on the brink of developing a weapon, while additional intelligence showed the strikes landed in other Iranian facilities set their nuclear development back only by a few months.</p>\n<p>Others argued Trump simply didn’t have the military background to understand the commitment he was making of U.S. troops.</p>\n<p>“I went to war three times for this country and learned that when elites in Washington bang the war drums, working class folks pay the price. The tough talk of a five-time draft dodger falls flat for Americans tired of military adventurism. Americans want us out of the regime change business,” said Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), a former Army Ranger who did tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>“Trump is plunging us into another war in the Middle East. He’s learned nothing from decades of failed conflicts. It’s a war of choice with no clear end game, no authorization from Congress, and little support from Americans.”</p>\n<p>Several Democrats raised constitutional issues with the strikes, stressing that the president must come to lawmakers to authorize war.</p>\n<p>“Congress must be fully briefed, and the administration must come forward with a clear legal justification, a defined end state, and a plan that avoids dragging the United States into yet another costly and unnecessary war,” Warner wrote.</p>\n<p>“Iran’s leadership has long supported terrorism across the region, undermined regional stability, continued to advance its nuclear ambitions, and brutally repressed its own people,” Warner said. “But acknowledging those realities does not relieve any president of the responsibility to act within the law, with a clear strategy, and with Congress.</p>\n<p>Sen. <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/ed-markey/\">Ed Markey </a>(D-Mass.) called the U.S. attack “illegal and unconstitutional” because it was not approved by Congress.</p>\n<p>“Trump’s illegal actions raise the threat of escalation into a wider regional war with grave risks for U.S. troops and civilians in the region,” he wrote in a statement that also called for an immediate vote on a war powers resolution that has been introduced by Kaine and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/adam-schiff/\">Adam Schiff </a>(D-Calif.).</p>\n<p>“A diplomatic solution remains the best way to permanently and verifiably prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon,” Markey stated. “This is a crisis of Trump’s creation. Americans do not want another endless war in the Middle East.”</p>\n<p>Sen. <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/ruben-gallego/\">Ruben Gallego </a>(D-Ariz.), a former Marine who served in Iraq, said in a statement posted on X also warned of the possibility the U.S. could be drawn into a bigger war.</p>\n<p>“The Iranian people deserve freedom and dignity. But we cannot send our men and women to die at the whim of the President,” he wrote. “The regime’s actions shouldn’t become an excuse for a wider war that punishes civilians and puts our troops at risk.”</p>\n<p>Trump has been <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5760326-republican-reaction-us-iran-strikes/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5760326-republican-reaction-us-iran-strikes/\">seeing support</a> for his actions from a number of Republican lawmakers, however, and at least one Democrat.</p>\n<p>Sen. <u><a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/john-fetterman/\">John Fetterman </a></u>(D-Pa.) in a statement offered support for the action.</p>\n<p>“Operation Epic Fury.

All high-ranking officials are alive,” Araghchi <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/video/full-interview-iranian-foreign-minister-reacts-to-u-s-and-israeli-strikes-in-iran-258481733776\">told NBC New</a>s said when asked specifically of President Masoud Pezeshkian and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>\n<p>When asked if he believed he was one of the targets, Araghchi responded: “Well I don’t know. They have targeted everybody,” citing an attack on a girls elementary school in southern Iran that he says killed 57, upping a previous death toll of 40, according to Iranian state media.</p>\n<p>Araghchi characterized the situation on the ground thus far as “under control.”</p>\n<p>“I think Americans and Israelis failed to… hit their targets,” he said, adding that Iran began its retaliation around two hours after the initial strikes on nearby American bases in neighboring Gulf states.</p>\n<p>“Almost all officials are safe and sound and alive. We may have lost one or two commanders but that is not a big problem,” Araghchi said.</p>\n<p>Iran has launched a number of missile strikes in neighboring countries that host U.S. bases including in Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar and United Arab Emirates, some of which were intercepted.</p>\n<p>Explosions were also heard in and around Jerusalem with Israeli defense forces also reporting missile interceptions in Haifa in northern Israel.</p>\n<p>Araghchi said he had been in contact with Persian Gulf states about retaliatory attacks, expressing his intent to not attack them and instead target American bases “in the act of self-defense.”</p>\n<p>“We cannot just sit and watch,” he said.</p>\n<p>He also criticized the Trump administration for launching the attack as negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program were underway, citing a recent meeting in Geneva with Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner that he said went well. </p>\n<p>“Everybody was happy,” Araghchi said. “A deal was at our reach.”</p>",

            "title": "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's brave fight against narcoterrorism",
            "description": "<p>When Mexican forces killed Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes — known as “El Mencho,” the longtime head of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel — the retaliation by one of the most violent criminal organizations in the Western Hemisphere was immediate and brutal.</p>\n<p>Gunfire erupted in crowded streets. Highways were blocked with burning vehicles. Armed convoys menaced neighborhoods. Entire cities shut down as cartel gunmen sought to reassert their reach. In the first 24 hours alone, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/el-mencho-killed-25-mexican-national-guard-troops-killed-jalisco-cartel/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dozens of Mexican National Guard members</a> were killed in coordinated counterattacks — a stark reminder that this cartel operates not as a street gang, but as a heavily armed insurgent enterprise.</p>\n<p>Mexico’s operation against Jalisco New Generation is part of a truly courageous and successful campaign by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum since taking office: direct action against cartel leadership combined with expanded cooperation with the U.S.</p>\n<p>To be clear, this was not a unilateral strike carried out in isolation. Targeting cartel leadership was undertaken in close partnership with U.S. authorities, relying on shared intelligence, coordinated targeting, and operational synchronization. The campaign underscores a maturing bilateral security relationship to counter a common threat.</p>\n<p>Her administration has also <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-us-trump-cartel-members-garcia-harfuch-e6af78fd8a5c851a81f7174324d55e51\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">accelerated extraditions</a> of senior cartel figures to U.S. courts — a consequential step that disrupts command structures and removes high-level operators from Mexican territory. These extraditions are politically sensitive, diplomatically complex, and life-threatening to Sheinbaum personally. She has proceeded anyway.</p>\n<p>Last month, after Mexican authorities helped arrest a major trafficker on the U.S. most wanted list, FBI Director Kash Patel traveled to Mexico, underscoring an increasingly operational partnership. Senior-level dialogue, intelligence fusion, and coordinated enforcement actions now define the relationship more than public friction does.</p>\n<p>For President Donald Trump, dismantling fentanyl networks and cartel supply chains has been central to his national security agenda. For Mexico, cartel dominance has eroded public safety and seriously undermined state authority. Our joint strategic interests align.</p>\n<p>Groups like Jalisco New Generation operate with paramilitary capability. They field armored vehicles, deploy military-grade weapons, buy off and threaten officials, and use spectacular violence to intimidate governments and populations alike. Authorizing operations against senior leadership invites brutal retaliation, carrying risk well beyond the battlefield. Cartels have assassinated local officials, infiltrated institutions, and issued threats that reach into every facet of national politics.</p>\n<p>The deadly response following El Mencho’s killing demonstrates both the scale of the threat and the seriousness of Mexico’s current approach. Sheinbaum is escalating pressure and delivering tangible blows against organizations that have long relied on fear as a governing tool.</p>\n<p>That makes Washington’s posture critical.</p>\n<p>Public threats of unilateral U.S. military action inside Mexico would complicate the very strategy currently underway. Sheinbaum is taking significant political and personal risk by targeting cartel leadership, increasing extraditions, and deepening cooperation with U.S. authorities. Her credibility at home matters. Strengthening it advances shared objectives. Undermining it weakens a partner engaged in a high-stakes confrontation with transnational criminal networks.</p>\n<p>Cooperation is already functioning at a serious level. Escalatory rhetoric could disrupt intelligence sharing and embolden criminal organizations eager to portray bilateral tension as opportunity.</p>\n<p>Fentanyl continues to devastate American communities. But we must recognize that drug users in the United States demand Mexican drugs, supply the money to pay for them and the chemicals to make them. Likewise, the vast majority of weapons in the hands of the cartels comes from the United States. It is reasonable therefore for Mexicans to believe we are part of the problem, and have every reason to expect us to do our part to help them end the scourge threatening their own country.</p>\n<p>Enforcement alone will not solve either the supply or demand challenge; long-term progress requires institutional reform, fighting addiction, anti-corruption measures, and economic resilience. But enforcement remains essential. Removing leadership, disrupting logistics, and severing financial pipelines are prerequisites for broader reform.</p>\n<p>Sheinbaum’s current course reflects that understanding. Targeting high-level figures, facilitating extraditions, and coordinating closely with U.S. counterparts represent sustained strategic decisions, not isolated gestures.</p>\n<p>The U.S. benefits when Mexico acts decisively against narcoterrorism. Mexico benefits when the partnership is steady and credible. Cartels benefit when political friction disrupts coordinated pressure.</p>\n<p>This is a moment for alignment.</p>\n<p>Sheinbaum is pressing against some of the most powerful criminal organizations in the hemisphere. Doing so exposes her government — and her personally — to retaliation. It also reinforces the principle that the Mexican state, not armed syndicates, governs Mexican territory.</p>\n<p>Washington should reinforce that effort. Support, intelligence cooperation, and disciplined messaging will advance shared security goals more effectively than threats of unilateral action.</p>\n<p>Narcoterrorism is a transnational problem that demands sustained cooperation. To that end, Claudia Sheinbaum has proven herself a fearless and capable partner. With the cartels on the run, Mexico needs an ally not an adversary.</p>\n<p><em>Richard Swett served as the U.S. representative for <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/New_Hampshire%27s_2nd_Congressional_District\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">New Hampshire’s 2nd District</a> from 1991 to 1995.

The administration pushed back on agreeing to these limits, saying the terms would limit the military’s work. </p>\n<p>The Pentagon gave Anthropic a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5752960-pentagon-threatens-anthropic-contract/\">deadline</a> of Friday at 5:01 p.m. EST to agree to lift the restrictions. President Trump <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5759399-trump-bans-anthropic-tech/\">directed</a> all federal agencies to cease using the company’s products on Friday and Hegseth <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5759630-pentagon-designates-anthropic-risk/\">categorized</a> it as a supply chain risk. </p>\n<p>“Anthropic’s stance is fundamentally incompatible with American principles,” Hegseth said in a post on <a href=\"https://x.com/secwar/status/2027507717469049070?s=46\">social platform X</a>. “Their relationship with the United States Armed Forces and the Federal Government has therefore been <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5758006-anthropic-pentagon-ai-talks-stall/\">permanently altered</a>.” </p>\n<p>Some of Anthropic’s competitors have come out <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5759106-google-openai-anthropic-pentagon-ai/\">in support</a> of the AI company’s push for these safeguards. Hundreds of employees from Google and OpenAI signed an <a href=\"https://notdivided.org/\">open letter</a>, titled “We Will Not Be Divided,” accusing the Pentagon of pushing similar demands for their companies’ AI models. </p>\n<p>“The Pentagon is <a href=\"https://removepaywalls.com/https://www.axios.com/2026/02/23/ai-defense-department-deal-musk-xai-grok\">negotiating</a> with Google and OpenAI to try to get them to agree to what Anthropic has refused,” the employees wrote. </p>\n<p>“They’re trying to divide each company with fear that the other will give in,” they continued. “That strategy only works if none of us know where the others stand.
