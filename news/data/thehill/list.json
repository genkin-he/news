            "description": "<p>Sports commentator Stephen A. Smith on Thursday addressed rumors that he could <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5737806-stephen-a-smith-2028-trump/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">launch a bid</a> to run for president in 2028 but said he needs to think up of a way for him to keep his money.</p>\n<p>“I’m telling you, if there was a way for me to be on that big debate stage and I didn’t have to give up my money to be on that debate stage, my brother, you look out,” Smith said in an interview on “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1FYZA84f6U\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Rubin Report</a>” podcast with host Dave Rubin.</p>\n<p>Rubin asked Smith if he was doing a “media play” to see if running is a viable option or if he is serious about tossing his hat in the race.</p>\n<p>“What I’m saying, Mr. Rubin, is this: Come up with a way for me to keep my money,” he exclaimed. “And I’m like, ‘I’ll show up!'”</p>\n<p>The two talked about Smith’s politics, referring to himself as socially liberal and fiscally conservative. He said he would run as a Democrat. </p>\n<p>“Well, first of all, I’ve never considered myself conservative when it came to social issues, anything outside of fiscal issues,” Smith said when Rubin asked why he would run as a Democrat. “I’ve always considered myself a liberal.”</p>\n<p>He said he was pro-choice despite being against abortion because he doesn’t “believe in telling a woman what to do with her body.” Smith added that he is also supportive of the LGBTQ community and said free-market capitalism and national security are issues that “matter” to him</p>\n<p>Smith made similar remarks during an <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/5620799-stephen-smith-politics-2028/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">interview with The Hill</a> in November. He said at the time, which he has repeated since, that he is not ruling out a run and a chance to be on the debate stage next year.</p>\n<p>“I love what I do, and I’m not willing to give up my money,” said Smith, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6634775/2025/09/17/stephen-a-smith-espn-politics-sirius/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">who reportedly makes</a> $40 million a year.</p>\n<p>Smith has floated the idea of running for president in 2028 for several months now, becoming more outspoken about current politics and the divisions between Democrats and Republicans. </p>\n<p>On Wednesday, he said President Trump played Democrats “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5757144-donald-trump-democrats-immigration-stephen-a-smith/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">like a fiddle</a>” when the president pressed Democrats on the issue of immigration during his State of the Union address the night before.</p>\n<p>Smith accused Democrats of hating Trump so much and expressing their “own personal feelings and animus towards him.”</p>\n<p>“And every time you do that, he smiles and mocks you and has a field day,” the commentator said.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Hillary Clinton’s spokesperson, Nick Merrill, said Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) is “full of s‑‑‑” for alleging the former secretary of State was “screaming” and “unhinged” during a deposition she gave related to an investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. </p>\n<p>“Was she appalled that Congresswoman Mace wouldn’t let her answer a question about her work as a senator after the murder of 3,000 Americans on 9/11? Absolutely,” Merrill <a href=\"https://x.com/alivitali/status/2027427201902112937?s=20\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly told</a> Ali Vitali, the host of MS NOW’s “Way Too Early.”</p>\n<p>“If Hillary Clinton’s spokesperson is scared about my line of questioning from yesterday and how unglued Hillary became (screaming at me); just wait until I get in front of Bill,” Mace <a href=\"https://x.com/RepNancyMace/status/2027437649980453153\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wrote in response</a> to her reported questions.</p>\n<p>The Clintons were <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5755536-clintons-depositions-epstein-investigation/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">subpoenaed to give depositions</a> before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee after former President Clinton appeared in photos released with the Epstein files.</p>\n<p>In her deposition Thursday, Hillary Clinton said she did not have any information regarding Epstein and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5756577-clintons-questioned-epstein-links/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">denied having ever encountered him</a>.

I corrected you,” Merrill <a href=\"https://x.com/NickMerrill/status/2027439184001085669?s=20\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">responded to Mace on social platform X</a> less than 10 minutes later. “You can become unglued all you want today, just tell the truth.”</p>\n<p>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) backed up Mace’s claims, <a href=\"https://x.com/RepLuna/status/2027438931050950674\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">saying in a post on X</a> that “Secretary Clinton did lose her cool” and “You’ll hear it on the audio.”</p>\n<p>“Even your Republican colleague is hedging in her agreement,” Merrill <a href=\"https://x.com/NickMerrill/status/2027442195314196956\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">responded to Luna’s post</a>. </p>\n<p>Mace later posted a more detailed explanation of her claims after Merrill’s jabs that the congresswoman called a “spin” on “Hillary’s meltdown.” </p>\n<p>“Let me be abundantly clear: Hillary Clinton shamefully used the terrorist attack of 9/11 as a scapegoat to cover for her and her family’s close relationship with Howard Lutnick, Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell,” Mace <a href=\"https://x.com/RepNancyMace/status/2027443637928243401?s=20\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wrote on X</a>. “In fact, Lutnick appeared to be key to Hillary trying to fundraise off Epstein for her failed presidential campaign LONG after Epstein was a well-known convicted pedophile (2015).”</p>\n<p>“Keep spinning Hillary, cause that’s what you have to do your part in one of the greatest cover ups in American history,” Mace concluded.</p>",

Wesley Hunt (R-Texas), who is also running in the primary with Cornyn and Paxton. </p>\n<p>“Another friend of mine who’s doing really well, Wesley Hunt. Where’s Wesley?” he said, adding “You’re doing a good job.” </p>\n<p>“Well, you do have an interesting election. You have a couple of them going on,” the president continued. </p>\n<p>Trump’s comments come days before Cornyn, Paxton and Hunt face off against each other in the primary Tuesday. </p>\n<p>The president told reporters before the speech that he has “pretty much” decided on whom to endorse in the primary, but he declined to name a candidate. </p>",

John Cornyn’s (R-Texas) seat.</p>\n<p>“Texas has the chance to send a fighter like Jasmine Crockett to the United States Senate,” Harris says in the call, <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2026/02/27/kamala-harris-jasmine-crockett-robocall-texas-senate-democratic-primary/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Texas Tribune</a> reported. “Jasmine has the experience and record to hold Donald Trump and his billionaire cronies accountable.”</p>\n<p>Harris urged Democrats to cast their ballots early Friday or in person Tuesday.</p>\n<p>“It’s time to turn Texas blue,” the former vice president says at the end of the call.</p>\n<p>The Hill has reached out to Harris’s and Crockett’s offices for comment.</p>\n<p>The two have been political allies since Crockett served as the national co-chair on Harris’s 2024 presidential campaign.

            "description": "<p>The Trump administration is releasing billions of dollars in disaster aid that were previously awaiting approval from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.</p>\n<p>A source familiar with the situation told The Hill that billions in combined public assistance and hazard mitigation funds are being awarded from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and that the funds were previously held up under Noem’s policy of personally reviewing major expenditures.</p>\n<p>FEMA’s public assistance funds <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/fema_public-assistance-fact-sheet_10-2019.pdf\">help communities recover from disasters</a> while its hazard mitigation funds <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation\">help communities better prepare for future disasters</a>.</p>\n<p>The source said that more than $10 billion in public assistance funds are still awaiting approval. </p>\n<p>The source also said that Minnesota, Illinois, California, Colorado and the Virgin Islands are the only U.S. states and territories that would not receive public assistance awards in the tranche of funding.</p>\n<p>Spokespeople for FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees FEMA, did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment.</p>\n<p>However, a FEMA spokesperson confirmed to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/26/politics/disaster-aid-fema-states-trump-shutdown\">CNN</a>, which first reported that some of the funds would be released, that it was doling out more than $5 billion.</p>\n<p>“This week, FEMA released over $5 billion in recovery funding for projects, some dating back as far as 15 years — a significant win for states, local governments, and hospitals,” the spokesperson said. “To be clear, this is about results, not politics.”</p>\n<p>“Regarding which projects are being funded, FEMA is prioritizing based on project readiness and strict oversight. Obligations are made when projects meet all necessary criteria. Decisions are not based on political considerations; the process is focused on merit and accountability,” they told CNN.</p>\n<p>DHS is requiring that all expenditures of more than $100,000 – including but not limited to FEMA funds –  get Noem’s personal approval before their release.</p>\n<p>The controversial policy has made headlines, including when FEMA staff <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5468696-fema-letter-trump-administration-disaster-response/\">released a letter</a> criticizing the administration and saying that the policy ““reduces FEMA’s authorities and capabilities to swiftly deliver our mission.”</p>\n<p>The administration has also indicated that it plans to “reform” FEMA, though it has not yet released its plans for doing so. Reporting indicated that such changes could include cuts to FEMA staff.</p>\n<p>The funding releases come amid a federal government shutdown at DHS as Democrats and Republicans feud over immigration funding. However, FEMA has funding sources beyond the typical appropriations process through its Disaster Relief Fund, which cover many of its operations even if other appropriations have lapsed.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has previously singled out California, Illinois, Colorado and Minnesota, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5725217-trump-blue-states-funding-minnesota-colorado-evs-hiv/\">revoking health and transportation funds</a> from those states earlier this month.</p>",

            "description": "<p>New polling released on Friday reveals that more Americans say they sympathize with Palestinians than they do with Israelis, a new statistic coming several months after Israel and Hamas struck a deal to pause their devastating war in the Gaza Strip.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/702440/israelis-no-longer-ahead-americans-middle-east-sympathies.aspx\">Gallup</a> found that 41 percent of Americans sympathize with the Palestinians compared to the 36 percent who say they sympathize with the Israelis. The polling firm noted that although this difference is not statistically significant, it contrasts with the lead Israelis have had in similar polls over the past 24 years.</p>\n<p>Israelis consistently held a double-digit lead during that time, typically averaging a 43-point gap between 2001 and 2018. This started to narrow down in 2019, years before Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and shifted further during Israel’s sweeping military campaign in Gaza.</p>\n<p>“The cumulative effect of gradual changes in U.S. attitudes since then has led to the Israelis no longer being viewed more sympathetically,” Gallup stated.</p>\n<p>Gallup also found that 37 percent of Americans hold a favorable view of the Palestinian Territories, which is behind the 46 percent who view Israel favorably. Fifty-seven percent of Americans favor an independent Palestinian state, which comes close to the highest percentage on the subject that Gallup has measured.</p>\n<p>Democrats’ views toward Palestinians have jumped since 2023, with 65 percent now sympathizing more with the Palestinians compared to 17 percent who say they sympathize with the Israelis.</p>\n<p>Seven in 10 Republicans, however, told Gallup that they sympathize with the Israelis, while 13 percent say they sympathize with the Palestinians.</p>\n<p>The poll comes just over a week after President Trump held the first <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5746010-trump-board-of-peace-takeaways/\">“Board of Peace” meeting</a> with other world leaders tasked with overseeing the reconstruction of Gaza following two years of war. The board is the next step in Trump’s 20-point peace plan amid the fragile ceasefire, which requires Hamas to demilitarize and eventually allow a new governing body to lead the Gaza Strip. </p>\n<p>“We will make Gaza very successful and safe and we are also going to maybe take it a step further, where we see hotspots around the world, we could probably do that very easily,” Trump said at the meeting.</p>\n<p>The U.S. gave Hamas a 60-day period to disarm, Israeli Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs said last week. He warned that Israel will restart the war if Hamas does not meet the deadline.</p>\n<p>The Gallup survey was conducted Sept. 2-16 and included 1,001 respondents. The margin of error is 4 percentage points.</p>",

Most of the cheap cuts of meat are very inexpensive,” Kennedy said at an event hosted by MAHA Action, a political action committee dedicated to supporting the “Make America Healthy Again” agenda.</p>\n<p>“If you buy, you know, a porterhouse steak, it’s going to, it is going to take you back. You can buy liver or the cheaper cuts of steak that are very, very affordable,” he added.</p>\n<p>Updated Dietary Guidelines for Americans <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5676613-new-dietary-guidelines-kennedy/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">released earlier this year</a> placed proteins like red meat at the top of the new upside-down food pyramid, alongside vegetables and fruits.</p>\n<p>But the cost of red meat has shot up over the last year. The <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000703112\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">average cost of a pound of ground beef</a> went from $5.54 to $6.75 between January 2025 and January 2026, the highest cost on record, despite a statement by President Trump in his State of the Union address that the price of beef is falling.</p>\n<p>Beef liver is not a commonplace food in the U.S., with the industry-funded marketing and research program Beef Checkoff <a href=\"https://www.beefboard.org/2022/09/01/us-beef-across-the-world/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">noting in 2022</a> that there is “very minimal demand for beef variety meats like tongue, lips, liver, heart, kidney, stomach and intestine here in the U.S.,” with most of the demand for those cuts coming from international consumers.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, the Trump administration struck a deal to allow <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5726797-gop-opposes-beef-deal/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an additional 80,000 tons of beef</a> from Argentina to enter the U.S. market. The deal was opposed by the main group representing U.S. cattle ranchers as well as a number of GOP lawmakers.</p>\n<p></p>",

            "description": "<p>Attorney General Pam Bondi said 30 more people have been charged in connection with an anti-ICE protest in Minnesota that interrupted a church service.</p>\n<p>Bondi added that 25 of the 30 indicted individuals have already been arrested. On Jan. 18, protesters interrupted a service at Cities Church in St. Paul, Minn., because the demonstrators believed one of the pastors at the church also served as an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer.</p>\n<p>“YOU CANNOT ATTACK A HOUSE OF WORSHIP,” Bondi <a href=\"https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/2027449934337696099\">wrote in a post on the social platform X</a> Friday afternoon. “If you do so, you cannot hide from us — we will find you, arrest you, and prosecute you.”</p>\n<p>“This Department of Justice STANDS for Christians and all Americans of faith,” she wrote. </p>\n<p>The indictment names former CNN anchor Don Lemon, who was arrested for being at the church protest and already <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5716360-don-lemon-indicted-civil-rights-charges-minnesota-explainer/\">faces federal civil rights charges</a>, which place protections on people in places of worship. He<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5737966-don-lemon-pleads-not-guilty/\"> pleaded not guilty</a> to these charges on Feb. 13, having argued that he was at the protest in his capacity as a journalist. </p>\n<p>Thirty-nine individuals who were at the protest are being charged on two counts, including “Conspiracy Against Right of Religious Freedom at Place of Worship” and “Injure, Intimidate, and Interfere with Exercise of Right of Religious Freedom at Place of Worship,” according to the <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/72213271/144/united-states-v-levy-armstrong/\">superseding indictment</a>. </p>\n<p>The indictment called the demonstrators’ actions at the church “a coordinated takeover-style attack” and stated the protesters engaged in “oppression, intimidation, threats, interference, and physical obstruction alleged herein.”</p>\n<p>“As a result of defendants’ conduct, the pastor and congregation were forced to terminate the Church’s worship service, congregants fled the Church building out of fear for their safety, other congregants took steps to implement an emergency plan, and young children were left to wonder, as one child put it, if their parents were going to die,” the indictment reads.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) announced Friday that they are reviewing a counteroffer from the White House on how to end the shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is about to stretch into its third week.</p>\n<p>“We have received the White House’s counteroffer and are reviewing it closely. Democrats remain committed to keep fighting for real reforms to rein in ICE and stop the violence,” spokespeople for Schumer and Jeffries said in a joint statement.</p>\n<p>Democrats submitted their last offer to the White House on Monday, Feb. 16, and had not heard anything from White House negotiators since then.</p>\n<p>“We sent them a proposal a week ago Monday, still haven’t heard back. Crickets,” Schumer told reporters during a press conference Wednesday.</p>\n<p>“All they have to do is agree to our simple ideas that every police department — just about — in America follows and we’ll get it all done,” Schumer said.</p>\n<p>Republicans had dismissed that offer as little more than a rehash of the demands Democrats had previously laid out.</p>\n<p>Democrats want to require federal immigration enforcement officers to obtain judicial warrants before entering homes to make arrests and to bar officers from wearing face masks.</p>\n<p>They also want to end roving Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) patrols and establish a universal code of conduct for officers to set use-of-force standards. They say they will not approve any additional funding for DHS withint these reforms.</p>",
