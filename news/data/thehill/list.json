He’s elected. Seventy-seven million people voted for him. What’s ‘we got to get rid of him’? Are you talking about impeachment? What are you talking about?” O’Reilly <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/media/news/bill-oreilly-calls-for-trump-doj-to-interrogate-and-possibly-jail-robert-de-niro-for-5-years-make-an-example-of-him/\">said</a> after showing a clip from the interview on his show “No Spin News.”</p>\n<p>During his show, O’Reilly cited a piece of legislation that makes any “knowingly and willfully” made threat against the president or vice president a federal crime. He emphasized the two failed attempts to take Trump’s life as further evidence to the potential gravity of De Niro’s comments. </p>\n<p>“I’d make an example of this guy, De Niro,” O’Reilly said. “And I wouldn’t do it for vindictive or politics. I wouldn’t do that. But enough’s enough on the threats.” </p>\n<p>“He better have a lawyer,” O’Reilly added. He also said he hopes the Secret Service will pull the actor in for an interrogation.</p>\n<p>De Niro has been a loud voice and fierce advocate against Trump, viewing some of the president’s actions as serious threats to democracy. In his interview with Wallace, he <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/5752360-de-niro-trump-never-leaving/\">suggested</a> potentially organizing at polling locations to monitor the midterm elections and encouraged more people to show up to “No Kings” demonstrations. </p>\n<p>De Niro was also the main headliner for a rebuttal event to Trump’s Tuesday evening State of the Union address, organized by Courier Newsroom and other progressive groups.<br/><br/>“I feel betrayed by my country,” De Niro said at the event. “It doesn’t have to be perfect but it does need to return to the values that gave us our strength and humanity.”</p>",

Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) have both indicated to reporters since the hearing that they are not yet “yes” votes. </p>\n<p>Murkowski pointed to her concerns about the Department of Health and Human Services — which the surgeon general post is under — and its handling of vaccines as a reason for her undecided status.</p>\n<p>“These issues are important to me,” Murkowski told <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/26/surgeon-general-casey-means-vaccines-nomination-rfk-00801331?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Politico of Means’s positions</a> on vaccines. “Last year when the secretary was going through his confirmations, he made certain assurances about vaccines that in fairness I am not seeing have been kept.” </p>\n<p>A Collins spokesperson told The Hill that she has yet to make a decision. </p>\n<p>A “no” vote by either would likely doom Means at the committee level. There are 12 Republicans and 11 Democrats on the HELP panel, meaning that a single “no” vote would spike her confirmation, assuming Democrats vote en masse against her as expected. </p>\n<p>At her hearing, Means refused to rule out a link between vaccines and rising autism rates during a back-and-forth with HELP Committee Chair Bill Cassidy (R-La.).</p>\n<p>“We do not know, as a medical community, what causes autism,” Means said. “Until we have a clear understanding of why kids are developing this at higher rates, I think we should not leave any stones unturned.”</p>\n<p>Means also told Cassidy, who brought up the outbreaks of measles and whooping cough on top of a difficult flu season, that while she supports vaccinations, those decisions should be made by families and their physicians. </p>\n<p>“Like you, I’m a physician. I believe vaccines save lives. I believe that vaccines are a key part of … any infectious disease public health strategy,” Means said. “I’m supportive of vaccination. I do believe that each patient, mother or parent needs to have a conversation with their pediatrician about any medication they’re putting in their body and their children’s body.”</p>\n<p>It would not be the first time Collins or Murkowski has put up roadblocks to a top Trump health nominee getting confirmed. The pair signaled that they would not support former Rep. Dave Weldon (R-Fla.) to run the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention early last year because of his stances on vaccines. </p>\n<p>His nomination was pulled shortly before his confirmation hearing in March.</p>",

            "description": "<p>President Trump on Friday suggested the U.S. could carry out a “friendly takeover” of Cuba, as the president has used a fuel blockade to increase the pressure on the communist regime in Havana.</p>\n<p>“The Cuban government is talking with us. They’re in a big deal of trouble, as you know. They have no money, no anything right now,” Trump told reporters. “Maybe we’ll have a friendly takeover of Cuba. We could very well end up having a friendly takeover Cuba.”</p>\n<p>Trump imposed a fuel blockade on the island in an executive order at the end of January in a push to collapse the regime, which relies heavily on energy and food imports. </p>\n<p>The United Nations’ top official for Cuba <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2026/02/1167046\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">warned on Wednesday</a> that daily life on the island is “becoming fragile” with increased strains on healthcare, water services and food distribution.</p>\n<p>U.S. officials reportedly met on Thursday with the grandson of 94-year-old former president Raul Castro, considered the de facto leader of the totalitarian regime, on the sidelines of a conference in the Caribbean attended by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. </p>\n<p>Castro’s grandson, Raúl Guillermo Rodriguez Castro, serves as his grandfather’s bodyguard and is believed to oversee Cuba’s armed forces’s conglomerate, known as GAESA, which controls much of the island’s economy. The Miami Herald <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article314747226.html#storylink=cpy\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported that in 2024,</a> GAESA had about $18 billion in assets and in unknown bank accounts. </p>\n<p>The Cuban government has instituted emergency measures to deal with the U.S. fuel quarantine and is said to have between six and seven weeks of fuel left before falling into a major blackout. </p>\n<p>Trump’s remarks come after a deadly confrontation Wednesday between the Cuban Coast Guard and a group of U.S. citizens, permanent residents and visa holders. At least four people aboard a boat were killed and others wounded, taken into custody and accused of “terrorism” against the island. </p>\n<p>Both governments have made statements seeming to cool tensions over the incident, emphasizing both sides are cooperating in clarifying what the Cuban government called “regrettable events.”</p>",

            "description": "<p>Hundreds of<strong> </strong>employees at Google and OpenAI are backing artificial intelligence technology company Anthropic, which faces a Friday evening deadline to give the Pentagon permission to use its AI system as it wishes or face repercussions from the department. </p>\n<p>Employees <a href=\"https://notdivided.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">who signed a letter</a> alleged the Pentagon was trying to “get them to agree to what Anthropic has refused,” which could imply the Pentagon has inquired with the top AI companies about similar access to their technology. The letter is still accepting signatures.</p>\n<p>“We hope our leaders will put aside their differences and stand together to continue to refuse the Department of War’s current demands for permission to use our models for domestic mass surveillance and autonomously killing people without human oversight,” reads the letter, signed by more than 430 employees.</p>\n<p>The Pentagon has <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5757667-pentagon-threatens-anthropic-dpa/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">remained in a standoff</a> with Anthropic for weeks over military access to its AI model Claude, which the company has made so that it cannot be used to conduct mass surveillance or develop lethal autonomous weapons.</p>\n<p>The Pentagon put a 5:01 p.m. EST Friday deadline for the company to grant the Pentagon access to Claude and threatened to enact the Defense Production Act (DPA), rescind a $200 million contract and label the company as a “supply chain risk” if it does not comply. </p>\n<p>Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5757667-pentagon-threatens-anthropic-dpa/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Thursday statement</a> that his company “cannot in good conscience accede to their request.” Sean Parnell, chief Pentagon spokesperson, responded Thursday that the department has “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5757667-pentagon-threatens-anthropic-dpa/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">no interest</a>” in using AI to conduct mass surveillance of U.S. citizens nor to develop and operate autonomous weapons. </p>\n<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Friday that <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5758898-altman-backs-anthropic-pentagon-stand/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">he agrees with Anthropic’s red lines</a> for its AI model. The companies are competitors in the AI industry. </p>\n<p>“I don’t personally think the Pentagon should be threatening DPA against these companies,” Altman told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Friday morning. “As long as it is going to comply with legal protections and the few red lines that the field, we have, I think we share with Anthropic and that other companies also independently agree with, I think it is important to do that.” </p>\n<p>More than 100 employees on Google’s AI team signed an internal letter they sent to Jeff Dean, the chief scientist of Google DeepMind, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/26/technology/google-deepmind-letter-pentagon.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times report</a>. The report said employees who signed the letter didn’t want Google to allow military access to Google’s Gemini AI to surveil U.S. citizens or to steer autonomous lethal weapons. </p>\n<p>“Please do everything in your power to stop any deal which crosses these basic red lines,” the employees reportedly wrote. “We love working at Google and want to be proud of our work.”</p>",
