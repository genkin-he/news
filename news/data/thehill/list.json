Lee — have faced each other across the river in a dialogue about emancipation, slavery and reunion. The bridge that joins them was meant to symbolically and literally join the North and South.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The National Park Service <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gwmp/learn/management/history.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">explains</a> that the bridge “also serves as the ceremonial entrance to Arlington National Cemetery, our nation’s most hallowed ground and the final resting place for more than 400,000 active-duty service members, veterans and their family members.” When unveiling the design to an audience of fundraisers, the president <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-ballroom-dinner-robert-e-lee-statue-b2846627.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">remarked</a> that he would have been fine with a statue to Lee in the same location.</p>\n<p>A massive triumphal arch in this location would intrude upon and dramatically reinterpret this symbolism of reunification. Americans might therefore question the intention behind it, and whether it carries a political or ideological signal through its choice of location. This is especially understandable because of recent efforts by the current administration to revisit Civil War memory by questioning <a href=\"https://www.military.com/history/trump-renaming-7-army-installations-here-are-stories-behind-names-being-scrubbed.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the renaming of military bases</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/us/politics/confederate-statue-trump.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">restoring certain Confederate monuments</a>.</p>\n<p>The current site is also a confusing selection because a more suitable one immediately comes to mind, along the same axis but east of the Capitol instead of west. The former RFK Stadium redevelopment comprises nearly 200 acres slated for mixed use with parks, housing, and a proposed stadium for the Washington Commanders. It would provide expansive space for a monumental arch and pedestrian-friendly park, along with unobstructed vistas toward the U.S. Capitol rotunda — a fitting gateway to the city, in the classical tradition of arches marking civic entrances.</p>\n\n<p>To many, the proposed arch is akin to the White House ballroom, It evinces a desire to monumentalize the self, to transform shared civic spaces into reflections of personal power and to do so without permission from the American people. A triumphal arch — especially one front-loaded by a president, unveiled at a donor gala and paired with the 90,000-square-foot White House ballroom — sounds less like national commemoration and more like personal aggrandizement.</p>\n<p>But previous national birthdays have been punctuated by great monuments and movements. At 100 years, <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/06/17/day-history-statue-liberty-came-america#:~:text=The%20Statue%20of%20Liberty%2C%20a%20gift%20from,the%20French%20to%20support%20the%20same%20ideals.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">France gifted us the Statue of Liberty</a>, a beacon linking freedom, immigration and democracy.

Both commemorations reflected humility and inclusion. </p>\n<p>Democracies build monuments and memorials through consent, deliberation and the slow work of compromise. Since 1986, the <a href=\"https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title40/subtitle2/partD/chapter89&amp;edition=prelim\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Commemorative Works Act</a> has required that new national memorials undergo public hearings, congressional authorization and scrutiny by independent design commissions.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Dozens of steps in the process are not bureaucratic hurdles.

Those deliberate rhythms are proof that our monuments belong to the people.</p>\n<p>Regardless of where this monument might eventually stand on our national landscape, and regardless of whether it is imposed on the vista or endorsed by its people, the narrative arc for this moment in our national history, the moment it is intended to represent, is still being written. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n\n<p>Martin Luther King Jr. famously reminded us that the arc of the moral universe bends toward justice.

The Trump administration previously declared the U.S. to be <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5535523-trump-armed-conflict-drug-cartels-caribbean/\">at war with drug cartels</a> to provide a legal rationale for the strikes, but Senate Democrats <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5579707-senate-democrats-legality-boat-strikes/\">have argued</a> that it violates the law, including those barring assassinations. </p>\n<p>The boat strikes are part of a U.S. campaign applying increased pressure against Maduro’s government, which the Trump administration has called “illegitimate.” The administration has also <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5575511-trump-venezuela-military-pressure-maduro/\">significantly increased</a> its military presence in the Caribbean, in an apparent effort to intimidate the Venezuelan president.</p>\n\n<p>Trump also revealed earlier this month that <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5557409-trump-venezuela-covert-operations/\">he authorized</a> the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to conduct covert operations in Venezuela and also signaled that the U.S. might <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5568471-congress-authorization-drug-smuggling/\">conduct land strikes</a> in the country.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK?” Trump <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5571008-trump-congress-drug-strikes/\">told reporters</a> last week. “We’re going to kill them.”</p>\n<p>Machado — a heavy critic of Maduro’s government — won the Nobel Peace Prize earlier this month after Trump and his allies <a href=\"https://thehill.com/newsletters/morning-report/5548909-trump-loses-nobel-bid/\">led a campaign</a> seeking the prize for the president’s involvement in <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5547121-trump-7-wars-nobel-peace-prize/\">ending several global conflicts</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>She <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5549522-trump-machado-nobel-peace-prize/\">thanked Trump</a> in her acceptance speech, praising him for his “decisive support” of democracy in Venezuela. Machado has been living in hiding in the South American nation since last year after Maduro ascended once again to the presidential seat in a vote widely criticized as rigged.</p>\n<p>In her conversation with Husain, Machado said she had been in touch with several U.S. government officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio. In response to a question about the due process rights of those killed in the U.S. boat strikes, she said there was “a very cruel war” going on.</p>\n<p>“Maduro is not a conventional dictator,” she added. “We’re facing a narcoterrorist structure that has turned Venezuelan territory, Venezuelan resources, Venezuelan institutions into the activities of a criminal cartel.”</p>\n</div>",

In a few instances, nominees have been withdrawn. That is the case regarding Jeffrey Bornstein, whose nomination for Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and Chief Financial Officer the White House withdrew ten days ago.</p>\n<p>Why Bornstein’s name was withdrawn remains a mystery, reportedly even to the man himself. He was certainly well qualified. He is a managing director of a private equity investment firm and previously had been chief financial officer of General Electric. He not only has a long standing relationship with Deputy Secretary Steve Feinberg — a relationship that is critical to the success of any comptroller — but also is reported to have had a good meeting with President Trump, who then nominated him. </p>\n<p>But more than ten months since Trump took the oath of office, the War Department still does not have a comptroller, nor for that matter, a deputy under secretary either. It does not even have an acting comptroller, someone in the comptroller’s chain of command, to carry out that responsibility until the White House nominates and the Senate confirms one.</p>\n<p>Instead, the office is being filled by Jules Hurst, who is “performing the duties of” the comptroller. Hurst certainly has a strong defense background, having served in the Army, as a defense contractor, and as legislative director and defense advisor to Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.). But he is not only filling the empty comptroller slot. He is also “performing the duties of” assistant secretary of war for manpower and reserve affairs, in which role he serves as the principal advisor to Secretary Pete Hegseth and to Anthony Tata, Under Secretary for Personnel and Readiness, on all issues relating to military and civilian personnel policies. In addition, Hurst leads the department’s task force on eliminating DEI initiatives. </p>\n<p>Jay Hurst has quite a lot on his plate, yet with the government shutdown, and no immediate end in sight, the Comptroller job is far more challenging than in normal circumstances. The president has indicated that he wants the troops paid even as the government is closed. To that end, the Pentagon redirected $6.5 billion in unexpended research and development funds to the manpower and personnel accounts in order to pay the troops. There remain some $3.5 billion for research and development that could be transferred, but the fiscal 2025 National Defense Authorization Act limits transfers to $8 billion, meaning that only $1.5 billion can be transferred unless Congress issues a waiver.</p>\n<p>The remaining, limited ceiling on transfers between defense appropriations accounts indicates that if the shutdown lasts for much longer, it will be a major challenge to keep paying the troops. Indeed, Speaker Johnson has indicated as much, stating that the funding transfers are only a “temporary fix” and that troops might not get paid if the shutdown extends past October 31. Private donations, such as $130 million “anonymous” gift that the media are attributing to a member of the Mellon family, will not make much of a dent in the shortfall. It is unlikely that private donors can provide the billions needed until the government reopens.</p>\n<p>With no end in sight to the shutdown, which could soon break the record of 35 days set during the first Trump administration, there is an urgent need for creativity in the comptroller’s office to ensure that the armed forces continue to be paid. That would involve continuing coordination with the Senate and House armed services committees and especially their staffs. Whether Jay Hurst can do all that while also performing his personnel-related tasks is an open question. It will certainly place him under tremendous strain. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>Perhaps the White House and Secretary Hegseth should reconsider placing so great a burden on one individual.

James Lankford (R-Okla.), the Senate Republican Policy Committee vice chairman, and John Cornyn (R-Texas), an advisor to Thune’s leadership team, earlier this month ruled out a potential change to the filibuster.</p>\n<p>Some Republicans, however, predicted that Trump would ramp up pressure on the Senate GOP leadership to eliminate the filibuster if the shutdown dragged into November.</p>\n<p>“I think the pressure from the White House will become pretty enormous,” one Republican senator, who requested anonymity, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5566292-senate-republicans-filibuster-reform/\">told The Hill last week</a>, predicting that Trump would demand that GOP leaders blow up the filibuster to end the shutdown.  </p>\n\n<p>Thune told reporters last week that getting rid of the filibuster to reopen government would be a “bad idea.”</p>\n<p>Senate Republicans control 53 seats and could change the chamber’s rules by voting to set a new precedent that the filibuster does not apply to government-funding legislation.</p>\n<p>Changing the rules with a simple-majority vote instead of the 67 votes normally required under regular order is viewed as such a drastic step that it’s compared to detonating a nuclear weapon in a military conflict.</p>\n<p>Doing so would radically change the Senate by opening the door to passing legislation with a simple majority instead of 60, which would allow any party that wins control of the White House and both chambers of Congress to rewrite the nation’s laws in a relatively short period of time.</p>\n</div>",
