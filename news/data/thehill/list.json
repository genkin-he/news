He must know that, unless his pricey Bowdoin College education left him appallingly ignorant of how the real world works.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/mamdani-may-freeze-rents-another-issue-looms-10933362\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">freeze rents on subsidized housing</a>, as he has said he wants to do, without driving landlords to abandon unprofitable buildings, reducing the housing stock and driving up rents. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>You cannot <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/26/upshot/fast-free-buses.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">make buses “free”</a> without presumably extending the same benefit to other modes of public transportation and driving the expense through the roof. </p>\n<p>You cannot <a href=\"https://indypendent.org/2025/08/what-does-the-climate-movement-want-from-a-mamdani-mayoralty/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">push green energy</a> without seeing electricity costs soar. And you cannot hope to fund all the wonderful freebies with tax hikes on high earners and businesses without then watching many of them exit the city. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Mamdani’s platform is absurd, and every grown-up in New York knows it. But it is dispiriting that, when proposals are put before voters that actually might move the needle on bringing rents down, Mamdani does not leap aboard.</p>\n<p>The proposals in question aim to unclog the process of building new housing in New York City, an undertaking that today makes the Big Apple <a href=\"https://publications.turnerandtownsend.com/international-construction-market-survey-2024/global-construction-cost-performance#block-b4e981d0-aff8-4780-acf8-559cba413450\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the slowest and most costly place in the world to build</a>. Putting up a new condominium or office tower in the city can <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/nyregion/housing-crunch-zoning-new-york.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">take more than a decade</a>; in real estate development, time is money, and the costs of those delays, brought on by onerous approval and permitting requirements, cause the price of any project to skyrocket.  </p>\n<p>One would think that democratic socialist Mamdani would exult at the chance to lower building costs and expand the housing stock, thus alleviating the high price of rents. After all, although many laws have been suspended in New York City, the law of supply and demand still rules. </p>\n\n<p>A survey of New York rents and housing from 2023 found that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/nyregion/apartment-vacancy-rate-housing-crisis.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fewer than 2 percent of the city’s apartments were available to rent</a> — the lowest rate since 1968. Worse, the number was even lower for cheaper units. A more normal vacancy rate would be 5 to 6 percent; in 2021, the rate was 4.5 percent.</p>\n<p>The lack of available housing is pushing out lower- and middle-income earners. Median city incomes are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/nyregion/housing-crunch-affordable-housing.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$70,000 per year</a>; the majority cannot afford to pay <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/rental-manager/market-trends/new-york-ny/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$3,600 per month</a>, which is today’s average cost — more than twice the national average.  </p>\n<p>To Mamdani’s credit, he latched onto the “affordability” issue in New York City and has campaigned on it successfully. The cost of living in New York City is indeed high — at least <a href=\"https://www.rentcafe.com/cost-of-living-calculator/us/ny/new-york-city/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">70 percent higher than the national average</a> — and young people, in particular, have lined up to vote for the 34-year-old in hopes that he can change that.  </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>But reducing the cost of living, and in particular the cost of housing, may require taking on New York’s City Council, which is mainly made up of <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/watch-scathing-report-exposes-what-new-yorkers-think-sanctuary-policies-mamdani-victory-looms\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">extreme leftists</a> and opposes nearly anything that might be construed as business-friendly.   </p>\n<p>The ballot proposals under consideration were written by a Charter Revision Commission set up by Mayor Eric Adams late last year. The commission, which includes 13 members, tackles changes to the city charter, the organizing document for New York’s government. It held public forums throughout the year, aiming to change provisions of the charter that could <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/nyregion/nyc-charter-revision-commission-housing-crisis.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">expedite building</a>; the result is the slate of proposals appearing on the back of New Yorkers’ ballots. </p>\n<p>Proposal 2, titled <a href=\"https://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/what-the-charter-revision-commissions-ballot-proposals-may-mean-for-new-york-citys-housing-production\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“Fast track Affordable Housing,”</a> would grant zoning relief and expedited approval for housing projects financed by the city, which tend to be lower-cost. The city council would be excluded from the approvals process involving mixed-income housing developments in the 12 community districts where the fewest new housing units have been added over the preceding five years.</p>\n\n<p>Proposal 3 would allow an expedited review process for another group of projects, and again   get the city council out of the review process in most cases. </p>\n<p>Proposal 4 would create a new “Affordable Housing Appeals Board,” which would consist of the mayor, the Speaker of the city council, and the president of the relevant borough. Under this provision, a decision by the city council on land use could be overturned by the mayor and the borough president.</p>\n<p>These three ballot initiatives in effect strip power from the city council and enhance the ability of city hall to push through projects. Today, it can take <a href=\"https://www.amny.com/news/city-hall-city-council-ballot-proposals/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">up to nine months</a> to navigate the arcane approval process for new development; the commission wants to change that.  </p>\n\n<p>The net effect would be to release the city council’s grip on real estate development in New York City — a grip that <a href=\"https://nysfocus.com/2025/06/05/rafael-salamanca-bronx-developer-donations\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fattens campaign coffers</a> and is vehemently protected by council members.  </p>\n<p>Mamdani does not dare to cross the powerful city council, which is packed with progressives who support his candidacy. But for someone pitching affordability, his indifference to the success of these ballot proposals is appalling.  </p>\n<p>But then nearly everything about Mamdani’s candidacy, from his <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/22/critics-say-zohran-mamdani-is-antisemitic-he-says-hes-simply-holding-israel-accountable-00416388\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">apparent antisemitism</a> to his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3814417/zohran-mamdani-law-enforcement-nyc-election/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">antagonism toward law enforcement</a>, is appalling.

The FBI arrested five people in connection with what a Homeland Security spokeswoman alleged was “an illegal horse-racing, animal fighting, and gambling enterprise operation.” In addition, ICE detained 105 people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally.</p>\n<p>It didn’t take long for local news media to settle on a narrative. Just after 10:00 a.m. Monday, the Idaho Statesman published an article titled, “<a href=\"https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/community/canyon-county/article312569587.html\">Child separation, zip ties and rubber bullets: Inside the Idaho racetrack raid</a>.” KBOI, the local CBS affiliate in Boise, quickly <a href=\"https://idahonews.com/newsletter-daily/report-children-among-hundreds-of-people-reportedly-detained-in-wilder-raid\">amplified</a> the story.</p>\n\n<p>By Monday afternoon, local NBC affiliate KTVB had published an article titled, “<a href=\"https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/local/fbi-aclu-of-idaho-press-conferences-wilder-arrests-horse-betting-investigation/277-2b1c845b-f92d-4c14-ab58-969e83f3cc77\">Idaho lawyers, families face more questions than answers after large detainment in Wilder</a>.” The story noted that the ACLU was coordinating with a pro–illegal-immigration organization called PODER of Idaho on a press conference outside the Canyon County Courthouse that afternoon.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>At that <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/aclu-holds-press-conference-following-massive-raid-in-wilder/vi-AA1OQKhi\">press conference</a>, protesters held signs that said things like, “Save America: Dump Trump!” PODER, <a href=\"https://www.poderofidaho.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">whose website</a> uses the word “Latinx,” states that “<a href=\"https://x.com/PoderofID/status/1427338427603701767\">no person is illegal</a>” and has previously lobbied the Idaho Legislature <a href=\"https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/local/idaho-poder-launches-campaign-supporting-legislation-to-allow-a-restricted-drivers-license-for-undocumented-idahoans/277-b020aadf-8941-4ca6-b008-6b73f7632c27\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to allow illegal aliens to receive driver’s licenses</a>. </p>\n<p>By Tuesday, the narrative was firmly set. KIVI, the local ABC affiliate, <a href=\"https://www.kivitv.com/canyon-county/father-speaks-out-after-son-arrested-in-fbi-raid-at-wilder-racetrack\">aired an interview</a> with a father whose son had been arrested by the FBI. The Idaho Press published an article with the headline “<a href=\"https://www.idahopress.com/news/local/families-were-separated-children-were-left-terrified-advocates-speak-at-protest-of-ice-raid/article_89bc6980-edc4-48c2-9e44-5460219471c6.html\">Families were separated. Children were left terrified: Advocates speak at protest of ICE raid</a>.” Even local media from the other end of the state joined in, with KIFI Idaho Falls publishing, “<a href=\"https://localnews8.com/news/2025/10/20/increased-ice-raids-raises-concerns-in-eastern-idaho-following-federal-raid-in-wilder/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Increased ICE raids raise concerns in Eastern Idaho following federal raid in Wilder</a>.”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Governor Brad Little <a href=\"https://gov.idaho.gov/pressrelease/gov-little-comments-on-arrests-in-wilder/\">has defended the raid</a>, explaining that illegal gambling operations “often accompany drug trafficking, animal abuse, illegal weapons trafficking, and large sums of money that end up in the hands of cartel bosses.” The release noted that officers will sometimes “detain others present while processing the scene to ensure the safety of both civilians and officers and to preserve evidence” and added that no children had been taken into custody.</p>\n<p>That same day, the Statesman’s weighed in with <a href=\"https://www.idahostatesman.com/opinion/editorials/article312577546.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an editorial</a> calling the law enforcement action “heartless” and “authoritarianism in action.” </p>\n<p>This sort of cookie-cutter, one-sided left-wing coverage would not surprise anyone in a big blue city like Los Angeles, New York, or Chicago. But this is Idaho, one of the reddest states in the nation. President Trump, who campaigned on mass deportations and strict immigration enforcement, won our state with 67 percent of the vote. He won Canyon County, where the raid occurred, with 72 percent of the vote.</p>\n\n<p>It is fair for Idahoans to ask why our local mainstream media headlines sound like ACLU press releases or Democratic talking points. Despite their local focus, most television and print outlets in Idaho are owned by national conglomerates or hedge funds and staffed from a talent pool that is steeped in left-leaning ideology. Yet for many Idahoans, these outlets remain the only trusted sources for local news — largely because there is so little competition.</p>\n<p>Conservatives have complained of media bias for decades, and this story helps illustrate why. Local journalists rallied around a single narrative — that ICE is immoral, that enforcement of our laws is illegitimate, and that we should just turn a blind eye to alleged criminality rather than hurt people’s feelings by arresting them. It’s as if they all got the same memo, and they all regurgitated its contents.</p>\n<p>How stories are framed can dramatically shape perceptions. Under President Barack Obama, the media described “temporary detention centers,” which under Trump became “kids in cages.” The same policy, reported in different ways, produced very different reactions.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Even Idahoans who voted for Trump and support deportations in principle might second-guess themselves after reading such headlines. And that is the entire point. It goes without saying that none of these outlets published anything remotely sympathetic about the families of the two local women who were arrested and charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol. </p>\n<p>The U.S. is an incredibly diverse country. Americans from New York City, Miami, rural Kansas, and Wilder, Idaho may lead very different lives and hold vastly different opinions. Yet news narratives today are consolidated and packaged from a single perspective, then disseminated through local outlets nationwide. Idahoans who subscribe to the Statesman for local news and high-school sports scores are given controversial stories framed exactly the same way The New York Times frames stories for its readers.</p>\n<p>When reporting so dramatically diverges from the deeply held values of a community, it erodes trust not only in the press but in society itself. All Americans — whether in red states or blue, cities, suburbs, or rural areas — deserve journalism that reports facts before framing them, separates news from opinion, and reflects the perspectives of the whole community, not just a small but very politically active minority.</p>\n\n<p><em>Brian Almon is chairman of Idaho’s District 14 Republican Party, a trustee of the Eagle Public Library Board, and editor of the <a href=\"https://gemstatechronicle.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gem State Chronicle</a>.</em> </p>\n</div>",

The toxic atmosphere poisoned Carter’s general election campaign against Ronald Reagan — and it took Democrats 12 years to recover.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Yes, Kennedy was a defeated rival, not a sitting partner. But the communications lesson still stands: A weak or delayed endorsement creates space for dissent to gain momentum. </p>\n<p>Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) understood this in 2020. When <a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fcampaign%2F484684-clyburn-endorses-biden-ahead-of-south-carolina-primary%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7CCKulat%40TheHill.com%7Cd09b00e391ac4d303ef308de0abd0817%7C9e5488e2e83844f6886cc7608242767e%7C1%7C0%7C638960006109913997%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C60000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=X5Obt9Coac31RkRStabnyIE0WHh1D7hRo9GtQiikfkg%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">he endorsed</a> Biden just three days before the pivotal South Carolina primary, with <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/26/808856350/clyburn-endorses-biden-ahead-of-south-carolina-primary\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Biden’s campaign on life support,</a> the timing was surgical. Clyburn didn’t wait until after the primary, when it wouldn’t matter. He moved when his endorsement would have maximum impact, cutting off an emerging narrative of Biden’s inevitable collapse. Biden <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/01/810813892/4-takeaways-from-joe-bidens-big-win-in-south-carolina\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">won South Carolina decisively</a>, then went on to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/485912-five-takeaways-from-bidens-super-tuesday/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sweep Super Tuesday</a>.  </p>\n<p>The business world tells a similar story. When Steve Jobs <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2011/08/24Steve-Jobs-Resigns-as-CEO-of-Apple/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">resigned as Apple CEO</a> in 2011, the company announced Tim Cook as his successor the same day, with Jobs’s strong recommendation in the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2011/08/24Letter-from-Steve-Jobs/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">resignation letter</a> itself. The clarity was needed; Jobs died just six weeks later. Critically, Cook had also been publicly positioned as the successor long before the announcement, <a href=\"https://quartr.com/insights/business-philosophy/tim-cook-s-impact-on-apple-and-his-special-bond-with-steve-jobs\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">serving as acting CEO</a> during Jobs’s medical leaves. This gave the market and the company time to see him in the role. When the formal transition came, it was definitive, but not shocking.</p>\n\n<p>Although corporate transitions are different, the same communications principle applies: Clarity prevents confusion.</p>\n<p>Harris faced a perfect storm. With just 107 days until the election, there was no time for a prolonged contest or even a hint of ambiguity. Yet despite being vice president, she hadn’t been clearly positioned as Biden’s heir apparent. </p>\n<p>This lack of clarity gave rise to speculation. Governors like Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom were already being floated as alternatives. Every hour of silence gave that chatter more room to grow. </p>\n<p>In that environment, delay was dangerous, and it ultimately cost Harris the election. </p>\n<p><em>Candice Bryant is a strategic communications leader with 20 years of experience at the CIA and Google.</em> </p>\n</div>",

The statewide contests in Virginia and New Jersey, as well as some other races around the country, put us at the one-year mark since Trump’s 2024 victory and give us the first straight-up contest between the parties to compete for voters’ support.</p>\n<p>The elections aren’t <em>just </em>about Trump, but going back to the 19th century, these off-cycle votes have been referenda on the party in power. In 2021, when Republican <strong>Glenn Youngkin</strong> won an upset over Democrat <strong>Terry McAuliffe </strong>for governor in Virginia, it was a serious warning sign for a Biden administration that was suffering from delusions of grandeur. Same for the surprisingly close race in New Jersey, where former Assemblyman <strong>Jack Ciattarelli </strong>threw a serious scare into incumbent Democratic Gov. <strong>Phil Murphy</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The pretty evident takeaway in both places was that voters had grown tired of restrictive COVID policies, especially in schools, and that Biden and the Democrats were wearing out their welcomes with persuadable voters — and that Republicans were fired up. It is a lesson that the blue team should have taken to heart, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/newsletters/whole-hog-politics/5510790-swing-voters-political-moderation/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">but did not</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Four years later, Trump and the Republicans have been on a tear unlike anything we’ve seen in politics at least since the Obama blitz of 2009, if not the start of the New Deal. Trump is literally and figuratively tearing Washington down, jamming through unpopular legislation and claiming executive authorities that would have made his predecessors blush. And he’s doing it all without the benefit of a massive win behind him. If Biden was taking a risk by going big after a popular-vote win of less than 5 points, Trump is going for broke by trying to transform the country after winning by a point and a half.</p>\n<p>Tuesday, we see how it’s paying off.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>If the Trump-aligned option wins in any of the key races — the Republican gubernatorial nominees in Virginia and New Jersey, independent New York City mayoral candidate <strong>Andrew Cuomo</strong> or “no” on California Gov. <strong>Gavin Newsom</strong>’s (D) gerrymandering ballot initiative, Proposition 50 — it would be a very encouraging sign for a Republican Party that right now is bracing for a lot of bad news on Tuesday. Even a substantial overperformance in those contests would be a sign that the Trump transformation has political staying power. </p>\n<p>If the expected outcome occurs — an easy win for Democrats in Virginia, a closer but still decisive margin in New Jersey, a dominant performance by Democrat<strong> Zohran Mamdani </strong>and a double-digit victory for Newsom’s Prop 50 — it will be a sign that the ordinary gravity of politics still applies even in this very unusual moment. And if expected advantages turn into blowouts, it will be the strongest indicator yet that Republicans are facing a reckoning in 2026.</p>\n<p>Thought of that way, the results in these races will provide cues to national politicians. If Republicans get skunked on Tuesday, you can bet that the existing GOP dissent over Trump’s policy of executing suspected drug runners, tariffs, the case files from the <strong>Jeffrey Epstein </strong>investigation, ethical lapses and other issues will grow. There won’t be a revolt, since the 2026 primaries start in just a few months, but there could be more resistance from a party that has been extraordinarily obedient to its president. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, Democrats would very surely overinterpret a good night on Tuesday as a sign that they’re on the right track, a fact very much not in evidence. And a Newsom win in California and a victory by Rep. <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</strong>’s (D-N.Y.) ally Mamdani will speed up the tempo for both of their expected presidential candidacies. The fight for 2028 is going to be bruising, and it will start to get rougher after Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Any big surprises in Republicans’ favor, meanwhile, would be jet fuel for Trump’s agenda. Republicans wouldn’t need much prodding to go even deeper down the MAGA mine and Democratic despair has been the norm since last November. </p>\n<p>On Tuesday, we get to find out which way things are heading. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>[<strong>Programming alert:</strong> Watch “<a href=\"https://x.com/thehillsunday/status/1979289066324791751?s=46&amp;t=Zd3W0ly33_L7lQTR75bKPA\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Hill Sunday with Chris Stirewalt</a>” for the first look at new polls from our partners at Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ) and guests including Sen. <strong>Shelley Moore Capito</strong> (R-W.Va.), candidates from Virginia’s election, and our best-in-the-business panel of journalists, including the great <strong>George Will</strong>.

And while the Hindenburg didn’t sink, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fURATK5Yt30\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">exactly, I certainly get your point</a>. I also imagine that being what sounds like a very right-leaning independent in a place <strong>Kamala Harris </strong>won by 26 points last year might make a highly politically engaged person of your kind very tetchy about perceived political bias. Hawaii might have great weather, but the political climate would be forbidding for a right winger.</p>\n<p>I’m also sorry to see you go. We strive in this note and at The Hill generally to provide news coverage and analysis that is actually independent. That’s good for keeping our covenant with the audience we serve, but also essential for the members of that audience, too. </p>\n\n<p>If we get too accustomed to having our own biases reinforced and seek out only voices that align with our way of thinking, we tend to become hard-hearted in our views of those with whom we disagree. American self-governance depends not on unity, but rather productive disagreement. In this sprawling nation of 340 million, on the edge of which you are lucky to reside, we need to find enough respect for each other to engage on important matters with the understanding that the people with whom we disagree are almost always sincere in their beliefs and believe they are helping. Democrats should know that about you, and you should know that about Democrats.</p>\n<p>It’s very easy for me these days to favor neither of our once-great parties, but it’s imperative for all of us that we can see where other people are coming from.</p>\n<p>Aloha,</p>\n\n<p>c</p>\n<p><strong>“Why do I keep seeing ‘the Democrats caused the shutdown!’ Or ‘the Democrats are unwilling to negotiate.’ Statements like these are wrong! As many who are paying attention, it’s obvious the Republicans are the majority in the Congress, the Senate, the Supreme Court, and the president. So, why won’t House speaker Mike Johnson call the Republicans back from their vacation that started right at the same day as the shutdown? … The Republicans are perpetuating this shutdown, and passing the blame. I’m one of millions, who are fed up with all of the Republicans posing as their hands tied. You want to negotiate? Then negotiate! …” — </strong><em>Stephen Griswold<strong>, Winsted, Conn.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Mr. Griswold,</p>\n<p>I would love to get you together with Dr. Kindrachuk and see you all debate what the worst part of last week’s note was, but I would definitely watch from a safe distance!</p>\n<p>I think it is fair to say that the Democrats caused the shutdown because they are the ones who are asking for credit for doing so. They can’t have credit without blame. While there are increasing calls to finally abolish the Senate filibuster once and for all, the truth is that Democrats control enough seats in the Senate to block legislation. </p>\n<p>I’m a big fan of the filibuster because it makes it harder for the government to make big changes without at least some bipartisan buy-in. We have an anti-majoritarian system of government, and I think that’s a good thing. Senate Democrats are using the power still vested in the minority to try to force Republicans to extend the COVID-era ObamaCare subsidies.</p>\n<p>That’s a legitimate use of power but not one that comes at no cost. In this case, there is a direct cost to the federal employees and beneficiaries of welfare programs who are suffering  — suffering being intentionally exacerbated by the majority party. There is also the potential political cost to the party driving the shutdown, though I tend to think that these effects will be long forgotten by midterms next year. And I believe the Democrats will eventually “win” the shutdown since Republicans seem increasingly likely to extend those subsidies. And if they don’t, the high cost of health insurance will help Democrats next year far more than any lingering annoyance at the shutdown itself.</p>\n<p>If Republicans do come across with more ObamaCare money, that will come at a cost, too. America has become a fiscal basket case, and neither party is offering any kind of serious solution for a disaster that is already contributing to brutal inflation and may one day crush the value of the dollar. That’s a bipartisan bummer.</p>\n<p>All best,</p>\n<p>c</p>\n<p><strong>“Why do the Democrats not end the shutdown? Perhaps I am missing something? It seems that if they end the shutdown and the Republicans deliver (subsidy extension) [Democrats] can take credit. If they end the shutdown and the Republicans say no. The Dems are in a sweet position of pointing the finger at the Republicans for not catering to their own voter base etc.. I am assuming the stats publicized are correct about the majority red states being affected … Not related to this article. I am not really focusing on the potential historical ruining of the White House, but it appears a bit crass to facilitate in the middle of a shutdown? Not well thought out! Thanks for listening as my wife is tired of hearing me talk!” — </strong><em>B.D. Frank<strong>, Roan Mountain, Tenn.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Mr. Frank,</p>\n<p>We’re all for keeping you out of the dog house, so I’m glad you wrote in.</p>\n<p>As for the Democrats, I think they will do exactly what you suggest, and very soon. This Saturday has been the obvious point of diminishing returns for Democrats since the start of this shutdown. Not only is it the point of maximum pain for Republicans on health insurance as it marks the beginning of open enrollment, which will include robust premium hikes, but it also comes just days before key off-cycle elections in Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere. This shutdown has fired up the party’s base and made Democrats feel like there’s <em>something</em> they can do after a demoralizing election defeat and nine months of watching President Trump bulldoze (sometimes literally) the opposition.</p>\n<p>By Wednesday, the point will have been made about health insurance and the Democrats will have already swarmed the polls in Virginia and New Jersey. The pain to federal workers, air travelers, and, most agonizingly, families receiving food assistance will no longer be worth the perceived benefits. Plus, if they hold out much longer, the Republicans will withdraw the existing short-term spending package, which runs until Nov. 21, and replace it with a new, longer one.</p>\n<p>Next week, look for five additional Democrats, probably including the Senate minority leader and several of the retiring members who don’t have primaries to worry about, agree to go along with the continuing resolution. </p>\n<p>All best,</p>\n<p>c</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p>You should email us!

He was part of a legal team representing retailer Claire’s. But Sussberg had something else on his mind. The 47-year-old Kirkland &amp; Ellis attorney launched into a story about how about 30 years ago, when he still had hair, he got an ear pierced at the now bankrupt mall fixture. ‘The ear has nothing in it at this moment,’ the restructuring partner told the court via video from his office. Then he threw down a gauntlet. ‘I’m prepared to head back to Claire’s’ for another piercing if a buyer is found and keeps at least some of its roughly 1,300 U.S. stores open, Sussberg vowed. Most corporate bankruptcy hearings are all business. But when the failing company has been a piercer of more than 100 million ears, nobody can stick to courtroom decorum. Over the course of the proceedings, attorneys billing upwards of $2,600 an hour veered off topic to share their Claire’s stories.”</p>\n</div>",

It said in a memo that it can only provide those funds during other events like natural disasters.</p>\n<p>Democrats have rejected that explanation, and Democratic officials in 25 states have <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5576829-states-sue-trump-snap-benefits/\">sued the Trump administration</a> to force the USDA to spend the contingency fund, which has been estimated to contain between $5 billion and $6 billion. That wouldn’t be enough to fully cover November benefits, which are estimated to cost $8 billion, but the states argued it could cover a “significant portion.”</p>\n<p>A federal judge indicated on Thursday that she would likely <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/30/snap-funds-government-shutdown/\">order the administration</a> to distribute the funds, but they would take a few days to get to the states and then the recipients.</p>\n\n<p>Republicans and Democrats have <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5579092-democrats-republicans-snap-funding-bills/\">introduced competing proposals</a> to cover SNAP while the shutdown continues, but the Senate adjourned on Thursday afternoon and isn’t set to return until Monday.

Eliminating it would mark a major shift, and set precedent for the next time Democrats control the chamber.</p>\n<p>But it’s not clear if Senate Republicans, holding 53 seats in the body, would have the votes to change the chamber’s rules. Thune has said he doesn’t support weakening the filibuster.</p>\n\n<p>Still, some Republicans have expressed openness to creating a carveout specifically to reopen the government as the shutdown has continued.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Smart Take with Blake Burman</h2>\n<p>It’s Halloween, so instead of some politics tricks, let’s go for a football treat. Louisiana Gov. <strong>Jeff Landry</strong> (R) is acknowledging that the decision to fire Louisiana State University head football coach <strong>Brian Kelly</strong> involved <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5580305-louisiana-lsu-football-coach-search/\">conversations<em> inside </em>the governor’s mansion</a>. Kelly’s buyout is $53 million. Landry told ESPN’s <strong>Pat McAfee</strong> he spoke with lawyers for one reason in particular. <em>“All I cared about were the taxpayers of our state, and that contract binds the state of Louisiana,”</em> Landry said.<em> “If we have to pay $53 million and somebody else doesn’t step up to foot that bill, the state of Louisiana has to foot that bill.” </em></p>\n<p>There are lots of conversations on both sides of the aisle right now in D.C. about how to potentially regulate the new world of college sports, as the athletes can now be compensated. <strong>President Trump</strong> even <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5418997-trump-nil-pay-for-play-college-sports/\">signed an executive order</a> on the topic this summer.</p>\n\n<p>However, a conversation in a governor’s mansion on the fate of the football coach is a new angle. Will this be a one-off in Louisiana, or are governors about to enter a world in which they deal with lawmakers Monday through Friday and then the scoreboards on fall Saturdays?</p>\n<p><em>Burman hosts “The Hill” weeknights, 6p/5c on NewsNation.</em></p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3 Things to Know Today</h2>\n<p>1. <strong>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

(Mark Schiefelbein, Associated Press)</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>TRUMP’S NUCLEAR TESTING</strong>: Democrats and peace activists are denouncing Trump’s order for the Pentagon to resume nuclear weapons testing after more than 30 years of a moratorium.</p>\n\n<p>Trump made the announcement just before his meeting with Chinese President <strong>Xi Jinping</strong> in South Korea at the end of his Asia trip this week. He said the Defense Department would test nuclear weapons on an equal basis to Russia and China.</p>\n<p>It came after Russian President <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> said the Kremlin tested a nuclear-capable cruise missile and nuclear-powered underwater drone. The New York Times reports the tests Putin confirmed Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/russia-nuclear-weapons-tests.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">did not involve a detonation</a>, and a Kremlin spokesman told Russian news agencies he hoped Trump had been properly briefed on the tests. Russia would respond in kind if another country resumed nuclear testing for the first time since the 1990s, he said.</p>\n<p>China has also doubled the size of its nuclear arsenal in the past five years, according to the <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/parading-chinas-nuclear-arsenal-out-shadows\">Center for Strategic and International Studies</a>, but it hasn’t conducted a nuclear weapons test since 1996. Of the world’s nine nuclear-armed countries, only North Korea has tested a nuclear weapon since 1998, according to an analysis last year from the <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2024-09/features/preventing-resumption-nuclear-testing\">Arms Control Association</a>.</p>\n\n<p>House Minority Leader <strong>Hakeem Jeffries</strong> (D-N.Y.) slammed Trump’s decision to resume testing as a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5581938-jeffries-trump-nuclear-tests/\">violation of international law</a>.</p>\n<p>Most countries around the world have joined the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty to prohibit nuclear tests. The United States has signed the treaty but not ratified it.</p>\n<p><em>“It appears the resumption of nuclear testing would be a massive breach of international treaties that have been in place for decades,” </em>Jeffries told reporters at the Capitol. <em>“And it’s just another example of Donald Trump and Republican policies going too far [and] being divorced from reality.”</em></p>\n\n<p>Peace organizations and advocates also criticized the move, arguing that it could restart an arms race with U.S. adversaries and take a long time to restart testing.</p>\n<p><strong>Daryl Kimball</strong>, the director of the Arms Control Association, said it would take at least 36 months before contained nuclear tests could resume at the former nuclear test site in Nevada.</p>\n<p><em>“By foolishly announcing his intention resume nuclear testing, Trump will trigger strong public opposition in Nevada, from all U.S. allies, and it could trigger a chain reaction of nuclear testing by U.S. adversaries, and blow apart the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty,”</em> Kimball <a href=\"https://x.com/DarylGKimball/status/1983716991421571322\">wrote on</a> the social platform X.</p>\n\n<p>But Trump’s allies defended the move, with Johnson saying that testing would <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5581689-johnson-backs-trump-nuclear-testing/\">act as a deterrent</a>.</p>\n<p><em>“The commander in chief wants us to be fully prepared. We are the last great superpower on the earth. China intends to be a near peer-to-peer advisory to us. But in order to maintain peace around the world, you have to show strength, and that’s what the president believes in. That’s what he’s demonstrated over and over,”</em> Johnson told reporters.</p>\n<p>Johnson said members of the military would be willing to contribute to help make the tests happen.</p>\n<p>If the tests ultimately happen, it would mark a significant change in U.S. policy, as former President <strong>George H.W. Bush</strong> started the moratorium on tests in 1992, one year after the end of the Cold War.</p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5582215-trump-nuclear-weapons-testing-putin-congress/\">The Hill</a>: <em>“Trump’s frustration with Putin goes nuclear, dividing Congress.”</em></p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/russia-on-guard-after-trumps-call-to-resume-nuclear-weapons-testing.html\">CNBC</a>: <em>Russia on guard after Trump’s renewal of nuclear testing.</em></p>\n<p><strong>DEMS FRUSTRATED ABOUT BOAT STRIKES</strong>: Democrats are also irritated following a classified briefing on the Trump administration’s military strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p>The Hill’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5582059-democrats-seek-legal-rationale/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Filip Timotija reports</a> that Democratic members of the House Armed Services Committee said they weren’t satisfied with the answers they received about the strikes, and they remained unclear about their legality.</p>\n<p>For weeks, the administration has conducted a series of strikes on boats that it alleges were attempting to smuggle drugs into the U.S., killing dozens. But the administration hasn’t provided evidence that the boats were smuggling drugs and hasn’t publicly revealed a legal rationale for the strikes.</p>\n<p><em>“Our job is to oversee the use of lethal force by our military outside of the United States, and I’m walking away without an understanding of how and why they’re making an assessment that the use of lethal force is adequate here,”</em> Rep. <strong>Jason Crow</strong> (D-Colo.), a former U.S. Army officer, told reporters after the briefing.</p>\n<p>Rep. <strong>Seth Moulton</strong> (D-Mass.) said administration lawyers were set to explain the legal backing for the strikes on both sides of South America, but “they canceled at the last minute.”</p>\n<p>The strikes have come as tensions are reaching a boiling point between the U.S. and Venezuelan President <strong>Nicolás Maduro</strong>. The U.S. has increased its military presence in the Caribbean, recently <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5571893-uss-gerald-ford-caribbean-deployment/\">directing the USS Gerald R. Ford</a> and its strike group into the region.</p>\n<p>That’s along with warships, spy planes, F-35s and a submarine that have also been sent to the area.</p>\n<p>The U.S. has accused Maduro of being involved in the flow of fentanyl into the country, which Maduro has denied.</p>\n<p>A White House spokesperson told The Hill that Democrats are pushing “bogus claims” about the strikes to distract the public and said the Pentagon has held nine bipartisan briefings on them.</p>\n<p>But lawmakers in both parties have for weeks asked the administration for a legal rationale for the strikes and more evidence that those on the boats were smuggling drugs.</p>\n<p>Rep. <strong>Mike Rogers</strong> (R-Ala.), the chair of the Armed Services Committee, said more briefings would occur.</p>\n<p><strong>DOJ PRESSURE</strong>: The Department of Justice (DOJ) is facing pressure to reject Trump’s request for a $230 million settlement for its investigations into the president, as critics note various ethics issues with the request.</p>\n<p>Trump has portrayed himself as a victim of the department’s investigations into his 2016 campaign’s alleged ties to Russia, which were ultimately unproven, and his alleged mishandling of classified and sensitive documents at Mar-a-Lago.</p>\n<p>But The Hill’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/?p=5582035\">Rebecca Beitsch reports</a> that the decision about whether Trump should receive a settlement would fall to a group of attorneys who formerly represented him. And one former department staffer said most agreements from the department are for tens of thousands or at most hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>\n<p><em>“What is unusual here is the fact that the president is making a demand for money from his own administration, which raises all sorts of ethical problems,”</em> said <strong>Rupa Bhattacharyya</strong>, who worked in the Torts Branch of the department’s Civil Division.</p>\n<p>Beitsch reports that it’s the type of decision that would fall to top-ranking officials such as Deputy Attorney General <strong>Todd Blanche</strong> and Associate Attorney General <strong>Stanley Woodward</strong>.</p>\n<p>Blanche served as Trump’s personal attorney, while Woodward represented one of Trump’s alleged co-conspirators in the Mar-a-Lago documents case. Both signed agreements requiring them to recuse themselves from matters involving the president for one year.</p>\n<p>The department has said it would follow ethical obligations, and what progress has been made on the request is unclear. It has six months to consider a claim for a settlement, after which the party can pursue a claim in court.</p>\n<p>But the department would have the same ethical issues in court. Trump could turn to Congress to ask for the money, but that would face constitutional issues, making the path ahead uncertain.</p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/29/trump-justice-department-230m-legal-claims\">The Guardian</a>: <em>Experts say Trump’s settlement request would be rejected if he were anyone else.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SENATE TARIFF VOTE</strong>: Four Senate Republicans on Thursday <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5581377-trump-tariffs-senate-republicans/\">broke ranks to vote</a> with all Democrats to repeal Trump’s global tariffs, approving the bipartisan resolution.</p>\n<p>The tariffs that the resolution calls to repeal include those on long-time allies such as the European Union, Japan and South Korea.

It now goes to the state Senate, where it is also expected to pass.</p>\n<p>Timing is tight for this to get through, as Virginia Democrats will have to pass the measure first before Election Day next week and then again in the next legislative session to send a ballot measure to voters before the 2026 midterms. Legal challenges are also likely, but the commonwealth is a step closer to redistricting.</p>\n<p>Democrats also may have caught a break in Ohio, which is the one state that is required by state law to redraw its lines before next year’s election.</p>\n<p>Republicans on its redistricting commission offered Democrats a map that would only make two currently Democratic-held districts slightly more conservative, while keeping another Democratic-held district competitive. That would give Democrats a chance to win all three seats next year, as opposed to a potential map that could have made all three districts much more conservative.</p>\n<p>Democrats accepted the offer, and state leaders seem <a href=\"https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/29/ohio-leader-hopeful-about-bipartisan-compromise-on-congressional-map-kaptur-landsman-sykes/86970982007/\">poised to approve</a> the new map, reducing the possible damage for Democrats.</p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2025/10/29/virginia-redistricting-judge-whats-going-on\">Axios</a>: <em>“Virginia judge lets Democrats’ redistricting plan move forward.”</em></p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.stlpr.org/government-politics-issues/2025-10-28/missouri-republicans-redrawing-congressional-lines-redistricting-trump\">St. Louis Public Radio</a>: <em>Missouri Republicans learn redrawing lines isn’t easy.</em></p>\n<p><strong>TEXAS COURT RULING</strong>: The Texas Supreme Court has ruled that judges and justices of the peace <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5582521-texas-supreme-court-allows-judges-to-refuse-performing-same-sex-marriages/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">won’t be penalized</a> for refusing to perform ceremonies for same-sex marriages.</p>\n<p>The court reinterpreted in Judicial Code of Conduct, saying it’s not a violation for a judge to “publicly refrain from performing a wedding ceremony based upon a sincerely held religious belief.”</p>\n<p>The decision most likely will have implications for same-sex couples, but the language was non-specific, potentially allowing for judges to refuse to grant marriages in other cases.</p>\n<p>Same-sex marriage remains legal in Texas, but LGBTQ advocates sounded alarms from the decision, warning that it permits discrimination against the LGBTQ community.</p>\n<p>It comes as the U.S. Supreme Court will hold a hearing next week to decide whether to take up a case that could lead them to revisit the Obergefell v.

Andrew surrendered his Duke of York title earlier this month, but Charles went a step further in stripping him of the prince title that he’s held for his entire life.</p>\n<p><em>“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,”</em> Buckingham Palace said. <em>“Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”</em></p>\n<p>The last time that a British royal had their title stripped was in 1919, when <strong>Prince Ernest Augustus</strong> had his title removed for supporting Germany during World War I.</p>\n<p>It’s a stunning fall for Andrew, the son of the late <strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong> who at one point was second in line to the throne. He stepped down from royal duties in 2019 amid Giuffre’s allegations against him and later paid an out-of-court settlement to settle a civil lawsuit she filed against him, though he didn’t admit wrongdoing.</p>\n<p>He will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor and is expected to move to a property on the king’s Sandringham estate.</p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/30/not-in-this-together-king-charles-cuts-andrew-loose-to-save-royal-familys-repute\">The Guardian</a>: <em>“King Charles cuts Andrew loose to save royal family’s repute.”</em></p>\n<p><strong>ISRAELI REMAINS RETURNED</strong>: The remains of two additional deceased hostages <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gj90j2g8jo\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">have been returned</a> to Israel after brief fighting renewed days earlier over allegations that Hamas violated the ceasefire.</p>\n<p>Israel positively identified the two bodies, officially bringing the total number of returned deceased hostages to 17.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) and John Fetterman (D-Pa.).</p>\n<p>Now they are providing guidance for Mamdani, who has come out of nowhere to become the favorite to be New York City’s next mayor.</p>\n<p>If Mamdani wins, Fight Agency believes they will prove again that a candidate with a clear, authentic message and brand can prevail no matter the odds.</p>\n\n<p>Morris Katz said the broader narrative on Mamdani’s campaign is, “Life doesn’t have to be this hard. New York can be more affordable and it’s government’s job to deliver that.” </p>\n<p>“If you watch Zohran’s launch video, and then you watch the first ad of the primary campaign and then if you look at our messaging in the general, it has been the same campaign the entire campaign,” Katz said. “And we are not the first campaign to do it, but I think it’s something that has been lost a little bit in the flow of modern campaigns.” </p>\n<p>Reinventing the playbook for Democrats also means moving past “the days of a thousand points of broadcast TV alone being the battlefront on which campaigns are fought,” Katz said.  </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>The strategists also took a canvassing approach not just to door knocking but to paid media. This fall, they tailored Mamdani’s ad campaign to prime-time programming ranging from New York Knicks games to NBC’s “Law &amp; Order” and ABC’s “The Golden Bachelor.” </p>\n<p>“New York, will you accept this rose?” Mamdani says in one spot, echoing the famous “Bachelor” line. </p>\n<p>During opening night for the Knicks last week, Mamdani aired an ad declaring “New York, this is our year,” while showing a pickup basketball game in black and white. </p>\n\n<p>And while Mamdani is a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, his campaign is also running ads on Fox News. </p>\n<p>“It isn’t just a cute gimmick,” said one source familiar with the firm’s strategy. “It’s a gesture that we believe every single voter is [worthwhile]. We don’t expect everyone to meet us where we are. We’re going to come to where you are.” </p>\n<p>Mamdani’s campaign this week became the first to hold a press conference specifically for “content creators and new media,” part of an effort to expand their reach beyond news outlets. </p>\n\n<p>The news conference — which included more than 70 ‘creators’ — generated more than 31,000 livestreams and had a combined reach in the tens of millions, his campaign said. </p>\n<p>Sources close to the Mamdani campaign say there are lessons to be learned from former Vice President Kamala Harris’s loss in last year’s presidential race.</p>\n<p>“The main thing was there was no larger story of the Harris campaign and when there’s no larger story that’s when you’re vulnerable to attack on a brand and it’s when you’re vulnerable to losing people who have been with you,” one source close to the campaign said. “It’s when everything starts to kind of slip away. When there’s not a fabric holding things together.” </p>\n\n<p>The source pointed to how Harris worked at McDonald’s when she was in her 20s, but President Trump owned the narrative by giving out orders at a drive-thru in Pennsylvania one day.</p>\n<p>“That’s malpractice,” the source said. “There’s a story of this real person who understands how hard it is in an economy that’s only getting harder who’s had to take on and overcome realities of a broken status quo their entire life. And yet none of that was communicated.”</p>\n<p>Mamdani hasn’t faced those problems, and some Democrats point to the strategy team around him. </p>\n\n<p>Rebecca Katz, one of the Fight partners, is used to imperfect campaigns and nontraditional candidates. </p>\n<p>She gained notoriety when she helped Fetterman win a tough Senate campaign in 2022. Katz later went on to help Gallego win a seat in the upper chamber after another nail-biter.  </p>\n<p>“The secret sauce is that she and her team can do cool sh– and aren’t 100 years old,” said Democratic strategist Eddie Vale. “But also she has worked on a ton of real campaigns and knows how to win in non-lefty places.”</p>\n\n<p>Mamdani holds a sizable lead in polls against Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor who is running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. </p>\n<p>An Emerson College/Pix 11/The Hill poll out on Thursday showed Mamdani with a 25 point lead over Cuomo, with 50 percent support to the former governor’s 25 percent, while a Quinnipiac University poll showed Mamdani with a 10 point lead. </p>\n<p>At a time when Democrats are trying to find their way back from the devastating losses of 2024 and are trying to rebuild, Morris Katz said Mamdani has taught some lessons and has served as an inspiration to his party. </p>\n\n<p>“I think he has helped challenge the party on the ways in which it communicates, and I think he’s helped to reinvigorate the party,” Morris Katz said, adding that the candidate helps “give clarity and a focus on an affordability crisis that can’t be ignored.” </p>\n</div>",

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who has previously publicly criticized the recess strategy, again confronted Johnson on how he was handling the shutdown.</p>\n\n<p>But the concerns were also raised by members like Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas), a source confirmed and Axios previously <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/10/28/mike-johnson-republicans-government-shutdown\">reported</a>, who questioned how lawmakers will make up for lost time.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The House last voted on Sept. 19. It’s the longest break in a House session since a six-week recess ahead of the 2024 election — and an unscheduled one.</p>\n<p>Johnson has canceled five weeks of previously scheduled votes as he aims to put pressure on Senate Democrats, who are demanding negotiations on expiring enhanced ObamaCare subsidies, to accept a House-passed, Republican-crafted “clean” continuing resolution to fund the government through Nov. 21.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Rep. Stephanie Bice (R-Okla.) told reporters this week that she “of course” likes being able to spend more time in her district, and that members are still working on committee business and other issues while the House is out, but “we are all built to work here.”</p>\n<p>One House Republican familiar with leadership conversations said that members should brace for a jam-packed schedule when the chamber returns — likening it to “two-a-day” football practices.</p>\n<p>“It’s not going to be business as usual. It’s going to be long nights, long days,” the GOP member said.</p>\n\n<p>House Appropriations Committee Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said that he would meet with Johnson on Thursday about all the work left to do on appropriations bills when the shutdown ends. All 12 appropriations bills have cleared committee, but only a few have hit the House floor.</p>\n<p>“We’re just going to have to hit the accelerator,” Cole told The Hill in an interview on Thursday, adding that he would meet with the Speaker on appropriations later in the afternoon.</p>\n<p>Cole said that there hasn’t been much negotiation with Democrats on the details of spending bills during the shutdown, accusing Democratic leaders of keeping their members from working on spending bills in earnest during the shutdown. For that reason, he did not think that being in session during the shutdown would have made a difference in how much work the Appropriations Committee will have to do when it ends, unlike other committees.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>But Cole is seeking more guidance from leadership in both parties and chambers on sequencing for those bills and whether appropriations or party leaders would negotiate the topline.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to move and we’re wasting a lot of time,” Cole said.</p>\n<p>While the Speaker insists that keeping the House out is not a “strategy” and argues that there is nothing else for the House to be working on while the government is shut down, members and staff privately say there is plenty of work that could be done inside the building. </p>\n\n<p>Some members lament that leaders have not only blocked floor votes, but kept committees from holding hearings and markups during the shutdown.</p>\n<p>But they also acknowledge that Johnson’s move to keep members from voting also avoids the headache of having vocal, attention-seeking members distract from the shutdown message — and also discourages more moderate members working without the blessing of leadership to strike a deal with Democrats on the health care subsidy issue.</p>\n<p>And by declining to swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva (D-Ariz.) while the House is out of session, Johnson also avoids the problem of a discharge petition getting enough signatures to force a vote on releasing the “Epstein Files” — though he contends the swearing-in delay has nothing to do with the petition.</p>\n\n<p>Johnson, while lamenting that the weekly House GOP conference calls are routinely leaked to reporters, said in a press conference on Wednesday that there are only about “three to four members of the House Republican Conference who have only mildly questioned working in the districts as opposed to being here on the floor.”</p>\n<p>“I can tell you that 99 percent of all the Republicans in the Senate and the House heartily agree with what we are doing,” Johnson said.</p>\n<p>Johnson has pointed to work being done by the committees amid the shutdown, such as the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee releasing more transcripts and documents from its investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He noted that the House Energy and Commerce Committee, on a bipartisan basis, also requested a briefing from NBA Commissioner to Adam Silver on the basketball league’s players and coaches being indicted on charges relating to sports fixing and illegal gambling.</p>\n\n<p>Consensus is also growing that the Nov. 21 stopgap end-date will <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5566100-government-shutdown-republican-plans/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">have to be pushed back</a> once lawmakers find a resolution to the government shutdown, with the Republican familiar with leadership discussions saying end of January or early February looks most likely.</p>\n<p>Some members of the House Freedom Caucus and beyond have floated another long-term continuing resolution extending through the end of the fiscal year, or even December 2026.</p>\n<p>Cole said he is “adamantly opposed” to that kind of long-term CR, but that an end-of-January CR “sounds reasonable to me.” </p>\n\n<p>He added that the bipartisan Appropriations Committee leaders believe “once we’re allowed to negotiate, we can get these bills done. We’ve done it before.”   </p>\n<p>“If there’s any silver lining in this, they’ll probably be even more of a sense of urgency to get stuff done,” Cole said.</p>\n</div>",
