The agent shot at Routh, which caused the defendant to flee without firing his own weapon. Routh was later arrested while driving on a nearby highway. </p>\n<p>It marked the second assassination attempt against Trump, after a bullet grazed his ear at a campaign rally in Butler, Pa.</p>\n</div>",

These commissioners were supposed to serve through 2028 and were the people expected to review President Trump’s new projects, including a <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/10/26/37-white-house-ballroom-donors-funding-300-million-build-tech-ceos-trump/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$300 million White House ballroom</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7e8lv176go\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">triumphal arch near Arlington National Cemetery</a>.  </p>\n<p>Now, they’re gone.  </p>\n\n<p>In an email reviewed by The Washington Post, the White House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/29/trump-fires-arts-board-arc-ballroom\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">made it plain</a>, saying: “On behalf of President Donald J.

Trump doesn’t just want to design buildings — he wants to design the people who approve them.  </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The Commission of Fine Arts isn’t political by nature. It’s the body that weighs in on monuments, memorials and historic buildings, from the Lincoln Memorial to the National Mall. It’s been an independent voice since 1910, advising presidents but not serving them. Until now.  </p>\n<p>Trump’s team has already <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/27/nx-s1-5583793/the-white-houses-east-wing-has-been-demolished-heres-how-americans-feel-about-it\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">torn down the White House’s East Wing</a> to make room for the ballroom, before any formal review could take place. One fired commissioner, Bruce Becker, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/28/trump-arts-commission-firings-ballroom-arch/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> his group “would look forward to a full review of the plans for the new structure that will replace the East Wing” — well, now he’s been terminated.  </p>\n<p>If this feels familiar, it’s because it is. President Biden <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/28/trump-arts-commission-firings-ballroom-arch/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">also fired</a> Trump appointees from the same commission in 2021, and critics accused him of politicizing the arts. But here’s the difference: Biden wasn’t preparing to build a ballroom with his name all over it.  </p>\n\n<p>Trump’s firing spree also extends to another key body, the National Capital Planning Commission, where his allies now hold the majority. That board will likely decide whether the ballroom gets approved. In other words, Trump now controls the referees and the field.  </p>\n<p>This isn’t just about art or architecture. It’s about legacy — and who gets to define it. When you control how Washington looks, you shape how history remembers you. And that’s the real story here: The man who once promised to “drain the swamp” is now redesigning it — in marble, gold, and his own reflection. </p>\n<p><em>Lindsey Granger is a NewsNation contributor and co-host of The Hill’s commentary show “Rising.” This column is an edited transcription of her on-air commentary.</em> </p>\n</div>",

Millions of people will see major price hikes on their plans.</p>\n\n<p>The ACA’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5579055-window-shopping-2026-affordable-care-act-plans/\">window-shopping period</a> started Wednesday, revealing the extent to which expiring tax credits will drive up monthly premiums.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The health research nonprofit KFF said the average increase in premiums for ACA plans will be 26 percent next year. The amount of people who pay for coverage, however, will rise by 114 percent on average.</p>\n<p>The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found in a new analysis this week that annual out-of-pocket premium payments would <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5579826-aca-premiums-more-than-double-without-credits/\">more than double</a>, exceeding $1,000 on average if the credits aren’t extended.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Here’s what to know ahead of open enrollment: </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Premiums are rising despite extended subsidies </h2>\n<p>Insurers’ rates were submitted and finalized earlier this year, so premiums are locked in, and any deal to extend the enhanced tax credits won’t change those rates.  </p>\n<p>According to a KFF analysis, 2026 premiums are set to increase 18 percent on average. </p>\n\n<p>The Washington Post, citing internal administration documents, reported the average ObamaCare premiums for the most popular midlevel “Silver” plan will increase 30 percent.  </p>\n<p>Insurers have cited the expiration of the enhanced tax credits as one reason why premiums are rising, because they anticipate healthy people dropping coverage if it’s too expensive. That would leave a smaller and sicker group of people, who are ultimately more expensive for the insurance company to cover. </p>\n<p>But the expected end to enhanced subsidies is not the only reason costs have increased. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Insurers have also cited higher drug prices and hospital costs, as well as overall medical inflation. According to Jessica Altman, executive director of Covered California, higher health costs account for 7 percent to 8 percent of the state’s average 10 percent premium increase.</p>\n<p>Premiums for private employer-sponsored plans are spiking for many of the same reasons — people are using their insurance more; labor costs are growing; and drug prices are high, especially for popular GLP-1s. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A shutdown deal to extend subsidies could blunt the financial hit</h2>\n<p>An extension of the subsidies won’t change premium rates, but most consumers only care about how much they contribute out-of-pocket.<br/><br/>No matter what the average premium increase is, people are going to be paying dramatically higher amounts if the enhanced subsidies are not renewed.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, Covered California’s Altman said the amount people pay each month will rise on average by 97 percent next year.  </p>\n<p>According to KFF, 22 million subsidized enrollees will see an average out-of-pocket premium increase of 114 percent in 2026.  </p>\n<p>Most people enrolled in Affordable Care Act plans are eligible for financial assistance, so they are not paying full price. Even if the extra subsidies expire at the end of the year, a majority of enrollees will still be eligible for assistance to lower their monthly premium costs. </p>\n\n<p>But the enhanced premiums made insurance much more affordable. For those at the poverty line — earning between $15,000 to $20,000 a year — instead of contributing between 2 percent and 3 percent of their income, they were eligible for “zero premiums” plans.   </p>\n<p>Someone earning $28,000 this year pays about $27 per month for a benchmark plan. Without the enhanced tax credit, that would jump to more than $130 per month in 2026. </p>\n<p>“The bottom line is that over 90 percent of marketplace enrollees are currently getting enhanced premium tax credits, which have reduced the amount of their income that they’re expected to contribute to premiums,” said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor and co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms (CHIR) at Georgetown University.  </p>\n\n<p>If Congress doesn’t extend the tax credits, that level of contribution “is going to be much, much higher, up and down the income scale,” Corlette said.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trump administration has done little outreach</h2>\n<p>By the end of October, almost all state-based exchanges will have sent notices to current enrollees informing them of higher premiums and reduced tax credits.</p>\n<p>But the Trump administration this year told insurers on the federal exchange that including premium information in their notices to consumers is voluntary.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, many enrollees won’t know about premium increases unless they log into their HealthCare.gov accounts; people who auto-enroll in plans may not find out until they receive their first bill. </p>\n<p>Less than a week away from open enrollment, the administration has also not yet opened the HealthCare.gov window-shopping period. For each of the past eight years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has launched Affordable Care Act (ACA) window-shopping on either Oct. 25 or 26. </p>\n<p>Senate Democrats on Monday called on the Trump administration to “stop hiding” premium increases and open window shopping immediately. </p>\n\n<p>“The over 24 million Americans relying on the ACA Marketplace for health coverage need clear information from CMS and their health insurance plans, and they need it now,” they wrote in a letter to CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz. </p>\n<p>The administration also slashed funding by 90 percent for federal navigators who help consumers enroll in plans. </p>\n<p>The Trump administration similarly cut ACA navigator funding every year during his first term and cut advertising to HealthCare.gov by 90 percent. When enrollments dropped, the administration said it was evidence the law was failing. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Impacts of subsidy loss will vary by states</h2>\n<p>Some states will fare worse than others. Window-shopping periods have already begun in more than a dozen states. The prices that customers are logging on to see are telling. </p>\n<p>KFF identified five congressional districts in Wyoming, West Virginia, Connecticut and Illinois where a 60-year-old couple making $85,000 would see the largest increases in their monthly premiums, ranging from 535 percent to nearly 700 percent. </p>\n<p>Gideon Lukens, director of research and data analysis on the health policy team for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, gave The Hill the example of a 60-year-old couple and said, “The average increase for that same example couple is typically over $20,000 annually.”</p>\n\n<p>Whether a state has opted to adopt Medicaid expansion, another provision of the ACA, will factor in to how the loss of subsidies will affect states. People in nonexpansion states who are ineligible for Medicaid coverage were particularly reliant on the ACA tax credits and won’t have the added safety net to fall back on.</p>\n<p>The majority of states and Washington, D.C., have already chosen to expand Medicaid, leaving only 10 states that haven’t adopted expansion: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming. </p>\n<p><em>This story was posted at 6 a.m. on Oct. 28 and updated at 1:30 p.m. on Oct. 30. </em></p>\n</div>",

We turn now to my favorite pollster, Harry Enten, who has some shocking news for his colleagues at the network. <a href=\"https://x.com/OpenSourceZone/status/1983200505678483794\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Take a look.</a> </p>\n<p>That’s right: GOP poll numbers are actually up! The way Republicans are choosing to handle the shutdown is actually resonating with voters. And not just their own voters, but <a href=\"https://x.com/OpenSourceZone/status/1983200505678483794\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">also with independents.</a> Republican voters, the MAGA base, they’re excited that the party is sticking to its guns, and independents are also rewarding them for it. I think that’s very telling.  </p>\n\n<p>GOP voters do not want feckless establishment leadership to succumb to Democrats’ efforts at emotional blackmailing over healthcare coverage, welfare payments and federal employee salaries. Because let’s keep in mind, Democrats are asking for everything. They want to maintain healthcare insurance subsidies that were intended to be a temporary COVID measure. But like most temporary government spending programs, Democrats now expect them to become permanent.  </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Democrats were willing to let the government shut down and say, look voters! Look what those mean Republicans are doing to you! They’re willing to withhold your paycheck, if you’re a government employee. They’re willing to take away your welfare! Blame them! </p>\n<p>Well, it’s not working. Republican and independent voters know that, at this point, the Democrats own the government shutdown. They could vote to end it anytime — Republicans are ready! But Democratic members of Congress are afraid to go along with this, because they fear the anger of their furthest left voters, who are demanding they stand up to the Republicans, even in performative and self-sabotaging ways. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Well, they’re only hurting themselves, because a majority of voters — not everyone clearly, but enough people — are with the GOP on this one.

Vance fielded numerous questions from attendees, in a nod to the late TPUSA co-founder Charlie Kirk, who held similar “Prove Me Wrong” events on college campuses.</p>\n<p>The final question of the event addressed Trump’s primary endorsement against Massie, who has bucked his party on numerous issues, including calling for the release of the full Jeffrey Epstein files and voting against Trump’s signature tax and spending bill earlier this year.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The student noted the endorsement and asked: “How would you address those who fear that principled disagreement or independent thinking is discouraged within the party because of how it can be framed as a betrayal, instead of as internal accountability or an opportunity for debate and negotiation?”</p>\n<p>Vance thanked the student for her question, responding “this one is hard for me” because of his extensive relationship with Massie. He said Massie was one of the first people to reach out to him about running for political office, and the vice president said he tried to return the favor, when Massie’s wife died in recent years.</p>\n<p>“She died very unexpectedly, was a very sweet and kind woman, and I was probably one of the first people that called Thomas to offer my condolences,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, Vance said, Massie has bucked the party on so many high-profile issues that the party can no longer rely on him.</p>\n<p>“Being independent, having your own opinions, is one thing,” Vance said. “Voting against the party on every single issue — you’re eventually going to make too many enemies, and that is the problem that Thomas has had.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not one issue. It’s not three or four issues. It’s that every time that we’ve needed Thomas for a vote, he has been completely unwilling to provide it,” he continued.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Vance defended the president, saying loyalty in politics is a two-way street.</p>\n<p>“That is why the President United States has trained his ire on Thomas Massie. It’s because we can never count on him for some of the most difficult votes,” Vance said. “I wish that that weren’t the case. I say that as somebody who’s known Thomas well before I got into politics.”</p>\n<p>“But politics is politics,” he continued, “and when you always vote against the party, you can’t expect the party to actually back you. That’s the reality.”</p>\n\n</div>",
