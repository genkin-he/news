In 48 states, these laws are unilateral, sanctioning one spouse to divorce the other, merely by alleging the marriage is irretrievably broken or irreconcilable.

Meanwhile, heterosexual marriages and the traditional family have begun to disintegrate.</p>\n<p>Only a few conservatives, like Vice-President <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/some-worry-no-fault-divorce-could-change-under-trump-after-vance-said-divorce-is-too-easily-accessible\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">JD Vance</a> and former HUD Secretary <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Perilous-Fight-Overcoming-Cultures-American/dp/0310368375\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Carson</a>, who spoke at Charlie Kirk’s memorial, even criticize no-fault divorce. For most conservative leaders, divorce reform is a personal and political bridge too far.</p>\n<p>Some are clearly guided by self-interest. Divorce is <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2636456/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">big business</a> for family courts and family lawyers.</p>\n\n<p>Two decades ago, my husband and the father of my children had an affair and left. At the time, New York had not adopted no-fault divorce. But I had made a sacred promise, so I <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/no-fault-divorce-my-fight-to-save-my-marriage/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">contested</a> my husband’s lawsuit and prevailed. But he moved to New Jersey, which had adopted no-fault, and we were eventually divorced. New York enacted no-fault divorce one year later.</p>\n<p>I began writing about my experiences in liberal outlets. Chris Gersten, former Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, saw my articles and reached out. This could be an <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-most-pioneering-divor_b_863024\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">opportunity</a> for liberals and conservatives to join forces in educating the public about marriage and advocating for <a href=\"https://divorcereform.us/parental-divorce-reduction-act/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">modest</a> reforms to help troubled parents in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2005/11/06/just-whom-is-this-divorce-good-for/32da3ae3-b15e-491f-a897-96b62a23fe57/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">low-conflict marriages</a>?

Pope Francis reiterated many times that marriage and family were in crisis. Early on, <a href=\"https://www.ncregister.com/news/leo-xiv-at-one-month\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pope Leo XIV</a> said that the world needs marriage “to defeat … the forces that break down relationships and societies.”</p>\n<p>Catholics were once the guardians of marriage. Until New York enacted no-fault divorce, the <a href=\"https://catholiccourier.com/articles/ny-bishops-oppose-no-fault-divorce-bill/#:~:text=By%20Jennifer%20Burke/Catholic%20Courier,custody%20issues%20have%20been%20resolved.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">New York Catholic dioceses</a> stood strong against this heinous law. But today, Catholic marriage and annulment <a href=\"https://www.ewtnreligiouscatalogue.com/betrayed-without-a-kiss/p/BKFAM03158\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">statistics</a> track the secular culture. Over 426,000 U.S. Catholic weddings occurred in 1969; today, weddings total less than 100,000 per year. In 1968, hardly 350 annulments were granted nationwide; by 1989, the tally had risen to 70,000.

As the <a href=\"https://www.usccb.org/sites/default/files/flipbooks/catechism/402/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Catholic Catechism</a> states, marriage is an “image of the absolute and unfailing love with which God loves man.” And so, if, by our actions, we show our nation the beauty of marriage, we will inevitably show them God.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://beverlywillett.com/\">Beverly Willett</a> is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Disassembly-Required-Memoir-Midlife-Resurrection/dp/1642931500\">an author</a>, a retired <em>New York City </em>litigator and entertainment attorney, and a divorce reform advocate. </em></p>\n</div>",

I’m a big believer that there are things out there that we can’t explain. And so if another person sees an alien, maybe I see an angel or a demon. So, I’m a big believer that there are like spiritual forces working on the physical world that a lot of us don’t see and a lot of us don’t understand and a lot of us don’t appreciate.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“Is it aliens or is it our guardian angel, or is it aliens or is it a not so guardian force that doesn’t care about us or in fact actively wishes us harm?” Vance continued. “I don’t know the answer to that question. What I try to do is I try to say my prayers, I try to be as good of a person as I can be and I try to do a good job. And, hopefully, that’s all I need to do.”</p>\n<p>Vance also said that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was also interested in the topic, saying it is something they both talked about since their days working together in Senate.</p>\n<p>“There’s certainly an interest there, there’s certainly an intrigue,” Vance said. “But I really haven’t yet had time to dig in. Things have been so busy. But this is the crazy person inside me. All of us put the tinfoil hat on from time to time.”</p>\n\n<p>Miranda brought up the topic in reference <a href=\"https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/jd-vance-ufo-video-2024-investigation-trump/\">to an interview Vance had on the “Ruthless Podcast” on Aug. 1,</a> where he said he was “obsessed with the whole UFO thing.”</p>\n<p>“What’s actually going on? What were those videos all about? What’s actually happening?” Vance said at the time. “I haven’t gotten to the bottom of it yet, but we’re only six months in.”</p>\n<p>In September, Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) accused the federal government of lying about its knowledge of unexplained aerial phenomenon (UAP), commonly called UFOs. He made the accusation during a Task Force for the Declassification of Federal Secrets hearing, where he defended veterans who testified on seeing UAPs while in the military.</p>\n<p>“The narrative has changed, right?” Moskowitz said. “It’s politically convenient for the government if you all weren’t military folks in suits. It would be much better if you pulled up in Winnebagos and were wearing hats. This is now the second or third committee where we have former military folks with impeccable records with information and knowledge.”</p>\n<p>During Vance’s interview on “Pod Force One,” Rubio’s name also came up when the vice president referred to him as <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5578600-rubio-vance-trump-succession/\">his “best friend” in the administration</a>, spurred by the question of a Vance-Rubio 2028 ticket to succeed President Trump. Vance called any discussion about a future presidential run “premature.”</p>\n\n</div>",

Anti-U.S. terrorist groups such as Hezbollah in Venezuela have been active for decades and pose a growing danger.

France recently joined in the fight against the Venezuelan criminal organizations by sending <a href=\"https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20250831-how-the-caribbean-became-a-front-line-in-frances-fight-against-the-cocaine-trade\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">military reinforcements</a>.  </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>In September, the United Nations Human Rights Council’s <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/venezuela-only-hope-victims-find-justice-lies-international-community-says\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> on politically motivated persecution in Venezuela concluded that “the only hope to find justice for the victims lies with the international community.” </p>\n<p>It detailed gruesome accounts of detentions of protesters, torture, sexual violations and murders. Human Rights Watch has documented thousands of <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2023/country-chapters/venezuela\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">extrajudicial killings</a> at the hands of the Maduro regime.</p>\n<p>The Washington-based non-profit think tank <a href=\"https://insightcrime.org/news/behind-the-curtain-venezuelas-cartels-and-the-us-missile-strike-explained/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Insight Crime</a> reported that Maduro presides over a “regime of state-embedded drug trafficking.” </p>\n\n<p>Their research found that Venezuela’s Cartel of the Suns is “a system of hybrid criminal governance in which the current regime has created alliances with criminal actors,” and “the Maduro system regulates these criminal economies, including the cocaine trade. </p>\n<p>The allegation that Maduro is connected to terrorism is not incorrect, either.
