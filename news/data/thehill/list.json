It doesn’t hide behind euphemisms or coded language. It mocks, it smears and it flourishes in the open. That hatred is Islamophobia. Today, it remains one of the last socially and publicly acceptable forms of bigotry.</p>\n<p>Muslims are a community that leading political figures can still slander on air, that journalists can frame as suspect by default, and that candidates can use as props in their culture-war campaigns without major consequences or jeopardizing their careers.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, Andrew Cuomo, New York City mayoral candidate and the former governor of New York, went on conservative radio, and remarked, “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5570431-mamdani-calls-out-cuomo-for-disgusting-9-11-comments/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">God forbid, another 9/11, can you imagine Mamdani in the seat</a>?” referring to assemblymember and fellow New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. His host Sid Rosenberg responded, “He’d be cheering.” Cuomo chuckled and added, “That’s another problem.”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Two grown men, both long-time fixtures in New York’s media and political ecosystem, casually and publicly imagined a Muslim lawmaker “cheering” during a mass-casualty terror attack, simply because of his faith, and they treated it like small talk. The insinuation is vile and dehumanizing — that an elected official would celebrate the slaughter of his fellow New Yorkers just because he is Muslim.</p>\n<p>Even CNN’s Dana Bash reportedly could not resist framing Mamdani as a “controversial candidate” who, if elected, would be New York City’s first Muslim mayor “<a href=\"https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/ip/date/2025-10-24/segment/02\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on the 25th anniversary of 9/11</a>” — provocatively manufacturing a connection between his faith identity and the terror attacks.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>These are not isolated lapses and misspeaks. They are symptomatic of a society and culture that has normalized exploiting religious identity for political clout and currency. They are fodder for talk radio, a rallying cry for bigots and extremists, and cheap shots by pundits and politicians desperate to maintain fading relevance.</p>\n<p>In Georgia, far-right Islamophobe Laura Loomer recently declared on X that “<a href=\"https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1981193948845523356\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">our entire country is being Islamified</a>,” claiming that the “Islamic takeover of America” is underway simply because Muslim Americans are running for local office. The targets of this dramatized hysteria are candidates for public office like Georgia state Rep. Ruwa Roman and Johns Creek Councilmember Shafiq Jadavji who happened to be invited to a “Candidate Meet &amp; Greet” — public servants who spend their days improving schools, infrastructure and services, rather than plotting “sharia takeovers” as implied by these attacks.</p>\n<p>The reality is that when Muslims seek public office, their patriotism is questioned. When they speak out against genocide and war crimes, they’re labeled anti-Semites and extremists. When they rise in polls, they’re smeared as infiltrators. </p>\n\n<p>Imagine, for a moment, if Cuomo had said the same thing about a Jewish, Black, or gay elected official, suggesting they would “cheer” during a tragedy. The backlash would be instantaneous, the apologies swift, the condemnations bipartisan. But when the target is Muslim, silence reigns.</p>\n<p>Why? Because Islamophobia has been institutionalized. It has been reinforced through more than two decades of “War on Terror” narratives, sensationalist headlines, and the political calculus that fear wins votes and helps control the masses. Even when Muslims are praised, it’s often through the “good Muslim, bad Muslim” lens, where only those who mute their faith or condemn their fellow Muslims on demand are deemed acceptable.</p>\n<p>That conditional inclusion is a quiet cruelty of Islamophobia. It paints a story of American Muslims that no matter how many elections we win, how many patients we heal, how many children we mentor, how many communities we feed, how many ways we serve our country, we will always be seen as potential threats rather than equal citizens. The insinuation is that Muslims can serve America, but can never represent it.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Words like Cuomo’s or Loomer’s don’t exist in a vacuum. Every time this rhetoric goes unchallenged, it trickles downward — into classrooms where Muslim students are bullied, into workplaces where Muslims face discrimination or are sidelined for promotions, and into neighborhoods where mosques face opposition.</p>\n<p>When politicians and pundits classify Muslims as threatening and dangerous, they are not just insulting individuals — they’re building the cultural scaffolding that allows violence and injustice to feel justified. That is, after all, one of the end goals of Islamophobes.</p>\n<p>The attacks on Mamdani and other Muslim candidates are not just smears; they are stress tests for the soul of American democracy. If participation by American Muslims is automatically equated to national security, then our democracy is not pluralistic — it is conditional.</p>\n\n<p>Mamdani’s composed response at Friday’s press conference outside a New York City mosque in response to these smear attacks captures what’s truly at stake: “This isn’t about me,” he said. “It’s about whether Muslim kids growing up in this city can believe they belong here.”</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>That is the question up for debate for every American. Do we still believe that faith can disqualify someone from serving their country? How long will we quietly accept that some forms of bigotry — so long as they’re aimed at Muslims — are politically expedient, good for ratings, and even entertaining?</p>\n<p>Islamophobia thrives because too few Americans find it offensive enough to confront. Until it becomes socially unacceptable, America will continue to betray its own ideals — one smear, one slur, one “joke” at a time.</p>\n\n<p><em>Zainab Chaudry is CAIR Action Maryland advisory member.</em></p>\n</div>",

Over the last few decades, the Democrats — with a massive assist from the liberal mainstream media — have done an excellent job selling the idea that the Republican Party sides with “corporations over the people.”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Perception is everything in politics. The echo in the minds of tens of millions of Americans is still this Democratic sales job — despite the concurrent perception today that much of corporate America now leans left, or is <a data-id=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2025/10/30/david_sacks_institutional_shareholder_services_iss_and_glass_lewis_are_to_blame_for_woke_corporate_america.html\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2025/10/30/david_sacks_institutional_shareholder_services_iss_and_glass_lewis_are_to_blame_for_woke_corporate_america.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">completely “woke.”</a> That in turn causes countless people to reflexively blame the Republicans for anything that goes wrong. The reality is, Republicans are still swimming upstream against decades of Democratic propaganda spread far and wide by media allies.</p>\n<p>With regard to Enten’s second warning — that the Democrats are facing stiff headwinds come the midterms — I fear the opposite might happen. <a data-id=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-history-tells-us-about-the-2026-midterm-elections/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-history-tells-us-about-the-2026-midterm-elections/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Basic history shows</a> that since 1938, the sitting president’s party lost seats in 20 of the last 22 midterm elections.</p>\n<p>As much as I hope I’m wrong, I believe the Democrats have a very good chance of pulling off a political trifecta this coming Tuesday, where Zohran Mamdani wins in New York City, Abigail Spanberger wins in Virginia, and Mikie Sherrill wins in New Jersey. While some are saying that won’t affect the midterms, I most humbly disagree.</p>\n\n<p>If the Democrats do cash in on the trifecta, they can ride that momentum for a very long time. More than that, it will give socialist “populists” like Mamdani and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez an even larger soapbox to stand upon. They push the concept of “free for me” while blaming the wealthy — spot-welded to the GOP, of course — for all the problems plaguing those same hurting working-class Americans.</p>\n<p>I speak with highly experienced Republicans on a regular basis; many do worry that the GOP has become complacent, unorganized or and tone-deaf. Others worry that “Trump fatigue” is settling in. And still others, who truly love the president, worry that when he is off the political stage come 2028, millions of 2024 MAGA voters will stay home.</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>I also speak with a great many incredibly talented Democratic operatives, who have contributed to an impressive number of local and national victories over the years.

Only then can you hate completely without restraint or regret.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that the left has learned how to hate. Hateful speech is in vogue as Democratic leaders <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/james-carville-fantasizes-trump-collaborators-140317382.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ramp up violent rhetoric</a> and political violence rises. The key is to get voters to hate your opponent so much that they forget how much they dislike you.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The irony is crushing. For years, liberals have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8ns76RCmWs&amp;t=210s\">sought to criminalize</a> hate speech while expanding the range of viewpoints considered to fall within this category. Democratic leaders, from senators to former presidential candidates, have falsely claimed that hate speech is not protected under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>In “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1668047047?tag=simonsayscom\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage,</a>” I write about rage and the uncomfortable fact: “What few today want to admit is that they like it. They like the freedom that it affords, the ability to hate and harass without a sense of responsibility.” Rage is addictive, and it is contagious.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>What rage-addicts cannot tolerate are those who cling to residual impulses of decency or humanity. In an age of rage, reason is viewed as a reactionary tendency.</p>\n<p>This week, Bravo star and liberal podcast host Jennifer Welch praised footage of a “No Kings” protester celebrating the death of Charlie Kirk, holding her up as an example for all liberals. </p>\n<p>In the clip, the elderly woman said, “Charlie Kirk is horrible. Yes. I’m glad he’s not here.” When pressed if she was actually happy that the husband and father of two had been murdered, the woman said “Yes…because he was horrible on the campuses. Horrible person.”</p>\n\n<p>After playing the clip, Welch laughed with joy and declared, “So listen up, Democratic establishment. You can either jump on board with this s—, or we’re coming after you in the same way that we come after MAGA. Period.”</p>\n<p>Celebrities like Jamie Lee Curtis certainly got that message. The actress was facing a social and professional meltdown <a href=\"https://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-1678-jamie-lee-curtis\">after openly mourning Kirk’s death</a> in a podcast interview. “I disagreed with him on almost every point I ever heard him say,” she said. “But I believe he was a man of faith, and I hope in that moment when he died, that he felt connected to his faith, even though his ideas were abhorrent to me.”</p>\n<p>It appeared to be a moment of weakness that briefly overrode wokeness. Curtis quickly found herself persona non grata in Hollywood, as an angry liberal mob began to circle her. Curtis quickly saw the light and effectively retracted her fleeting expression of humanity, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/5577677-jamie-lee-curtis-charlie-kirk-comments/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claiming</a> it had been “mistranslated.” It is said that in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. But that does not apply if you then gouge out your own eye. Now fully and comfortably blinded by her own hand, Curtis is back as a member of good standing in Hollywood.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Internationally, the left has pushed for criminalizing the speech of those with opposing views as hateful and harmful. UNESCO works off <a href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/countering-hate-speech/need-know\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a definition</a> of hate speech as including “pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender or other identity factor.” This includes “scapegoating, stereotyping, stigmatization and the use of derogatory language” based on any “identity factor.”</p>\n<p>Countries are also “required to prohibit” speech tied to “conspiracy theories, disinformation and denial and distortion of historical events.”</p>\n<p>In the past, some leftists have included political criticism or parodies of their leaders as hate speech. For example, when a rodeo clown, Tuffy Gessling, donned a President Barack Obama mask at the Missouri State Fair as part of a skit years ago, the response was calls for his arrest. The President of the Missouri chapter of the NAACP, Mary Radliff, <a href=\"https://jonathanturley.org/2013/08/16/round-up-the-rodeo-clowns-naacp-official-calls-for-rodeo-employees-to-be-prosecuted-for-hate-crime/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">insisted</a> that it constituted criminal hate speech.</p>\n\n<p>But things have changed. The left has now discovered the thrill of uninhibited hate.</p>\n<p>Recently, in Chicago, elementary school teacher Lucy Martinez was <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15207753/chicago-teacher-mocking-charlie-kirk-assassination-school.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shown on video</a> reacting to an image of Kirk by mockingly making a gesture akin to being shot in the neck, mimicking how Kirk had been assassinated.</p>\n<p>Another educator, Wilbur Wright College Adult Education Manager Moises Bernal, <a href=\"https://x.com/AshFarms/status/1980266507062980970\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">screamed</a> to a crowd that “ICE agents gotta get shot and wiped out.” Bernal told the crowd, “You gotta grab a gun!” and “We gotta turn around the guns on this fascist system!”</p>\n\n<p>In academia, hateful speech has long been a way to establish one’s bona fides as a faculty member. By attacking and excluding others, you reaffirm your own protected status.</p>\n<p>Faculty have thrilled their colleagues and students by talking about “<a href=\"https://www.thecollegefix.com/barnard-college-instructor-discusses-blowing-up-and-gassing-whites-in-coming-race-war/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">detonating white people</a>,” <a href=\"https://www.thecollegefix.com/video-uc-berkeley-professor-under-fire-for-abolish-white-people-comments/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">abolishing white people</a>,  <a href=\"https://theiowastandard.com/breaking-drake-university-president-emails-campus-about-professor-who-said-she-hates-republicans-and-they-need-to-suffer-among-other-things/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">calling for Republicans to suffer</a>,  <a href=\"https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20201010215021154\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">strangling police officers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thecollegefix.com/professor-who-hoped-rush-limbaugh-suffered-until-his-last-breath-hides-twitter-account/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">celebrating the death of conservatives</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thecollegefix.com/professor-wishes-for-death-of-trump-supporters-while-studying-intellectual-humility-funded-by-large-grant/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">calling for the killing of Trump supporters</a>, and supporting the <a href=\"https://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2020/09/why-was-michael-reinoehl-killed\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">murder of conservative protesters</a>.</p>\n<p>Even school board members have referred to taking faculty “<a href=\"https://jonathanturley.org/2023/01/03/put-a-rope-on-them-and-take-them-to-the-slaughterhouse-college-board-trustee-calls-for-culling-dei-critics/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to the slaughterhouse</a>” for questioning diversity, equity and inclusion policies.</p>\n\n<p>Last week, Democratic strategist James Carville went on a hate-filled rant, to the delight of his podcast audience. He declared that anyone supporting Trump and the Republicans will be treated like collaborators in World War II who were publicly abused and paraded by mobs.</p>\n<p>“You know what we do with collaborators?” he said. “I think <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/23/us/trump-white-house-ballroom-donors-invs\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">these corporations</a> [funding White House renovations] — my fantasy dream is that this nightmare ends in 2029 and I think we ought to have radical things. I think they all ought to have their heads shaven, they should be put in orange pajamas and they should be marched down Pennsylvania Avenue and the public should be invited to spit on them.”</p>\n<p>Carville later repeated the call that “The universities, the corporations, the law firms, all of these collaborators should be shaved, pajamaed and spit on.”</p>\n\n<p>For years, Democratic leaders have given their base the license for such blind rage by calling Republicans “Nazis” and claiming that democracy will die unless their opponents are stopped.</p>\n<p>The effect has been transformative across the party. In the current race for <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/virginia-ag-candidate-once-referenced-putting-two-bullets-head-gop-leader-texts-show\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Virginia Attorney General</a>, Democratic nominee Jay Jones admitted to sending text messages expressing the desire to kill a political opponent, “piss on the grave” of a dead Republican, and kill his children, whom he dismissed as “little fascists,” in their mother’s arms.</p>\n<p>There was a time when such a candidate would be denounced by those on the ticket from his party and made a nonentity in politics. Instead, the Virginia Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Abigail Spanberger (who had previously told her supporters to “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/5524115-let-your-rage-fuel-you-politicians-and-pundits-embrace-demonization-politics/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Let your rage fuel you</a>”), has refused to withdraw her endorsement. Moreover, the race <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/polls/virginia-attorney-general-election-polls-2025.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">remains close</a>, with most Democratic voters still planning to cast their ballots for him. </p>\n\n<p>It is a lesson many hope will take hold in the midterm elections. Like Queen Elizabeth, these voters have overcome all inhibitions and can now teach others “how to curse.”</p>\n<p><em>Jonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University.
