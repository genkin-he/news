He did not receive any pushback from Carlson.”</p>\n\n<p>Carlson on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efBB0D4tf1Y\">podcast</a> said that he wanted to understand Fuentes’s views, saying that while he also questioned the U.S. relationship with Israel, to say “well actually it’s the Jews” goes “against my Christian faith.”</p>\n<p>After the interview, a post on X started circulating that said the Heritage Foundation had <a href=\"https://x.com/jasonahart/status/1983655537784058064?s=46&amp;t=s27cFPVMxDTz4BmWHLglMQ\">scrubbed</a> a reference to Carlson from a donation page. </p>\n<p>Roberts, in a post accompanying his video, said he wanted to put to rest speculation that Heritage was distancing itself from Carlson. Roberts and Carlson are personal friends, and he has featured Carlson at Heritage events in the past.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>“The Heritage Foundation didn’t become the intellectual backbone of the conservative movement by canceling our own people or policing the consciences of Christians, and we won’t start doing that now,” Roberts said, adding that Heritage won’t “take direction from comments on X” or “take direction from members or donors.” </p>\n<p>“We will always defend our friends against the slander of bad actors who serve someone else’s agenda,” Roberts said.</p>\n<p>Roberts also weighed in on the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/newsletters/the-movement/5458571-gop-division-israel-support/\">bubbling debate on the right</a> over Israel.</p>\n\n<p>“Christians can critique the state of Israel without being antisemitic, and of course, antisemitism should be condemned,” Roberts said.</p>\n<p>“When it serves the interests of the United States to cooperate with Israel and other allies, we should do so with partnerships on security, intelligence, and technology,” Roberts said. “But when it doesn’t, conservatives should feel no obligation to reflexively support any foreign government, no matter how loud the pressure becomes from the globalist class or from their mouthpieces in Washington.”</p>\n</div>",

The plan directs agencies to mobilize federal financing tools and provide various subsidies for AI infrastructure, declaring that “Winning the AI race will usher in a new golden age of human flourishing.”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>President Trump has signed <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-accelerates-federal-permitting-of-data-center-infrastructure/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">executive orders</a> directing the Commerce Department to provide “financial support, such as loans, grants and tax incentives” for AI data centers requiring over 100 megawatts of power.</p>\n<p>The U.S. isn’t alone. Canada is allocating <a href=\"https://canadiandefencereview.com/canada-launches-canadian-sovereign-ai-compute-strategy/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$2 billion</a> for AI compute infrastructure, and the EU launched InvestAI to put <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/eu-launches-investai-initiative-mobilise-eu200-billion-investment-artificial-intelligence\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$263 billion</a> toward artificial intelligence investment.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>But the very excitement driving these proposals suggests that private markets are already working well. Subsidies make sense only when private markets systematically underfund something society needs, not when they’re already pouring in capital. </p>\n<p>Rigorous policy would identify specific costs or benefits that private investors can’t capture and target only those gaps. Instead, the AI Action Plan and executive orders take a scattershot approach, subsidizing everything from data centers to workforce training without demonstrating where private investment falls short.</p>\n<p>A deeper question is whether the government can identify underfunded yet socially beneficial projects. Private investors risk billions of their own dollars, backed by domain expertise and rigorous due diligence. Politicians, in contrast, spread taxpayer money across regions and politically important interest groups. Betting taxpayer dollars on selecting winners when the private sector is already all-in is a recipe for inefficiency, not for innovation.</p>\n\n<p>We have seen this before. The Obama-era push for solar manufacturing led to <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2011/10/obamas-solyndra-problem/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$535 million</a> in loan guarantees for Solyndra, which collapsed into <a href=\"http://bankruptcy.so/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bankruptcy.</a> Some defend this kind of failure as the price of taking risks on socially valuable industries, but that logic doesn’t apply to AI. </p>\n<p>Unlike solar at that time, AI today is awash in private capital. Subsidies here aren’t addressing what some argue is an underfunded social goal. They simply pile taxpayer money on top of investments that private markets are already making on their own.</p>\n<p>The government does, of course, have an important role to play in AI development. Concerns about the Chinese government dominating AI are real. But Chinese competition in AI is most relevant in military applications and cutting-edge research, not the commercial data centers that private investors are already racing to fund.</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>If subsidies are justified anywhere, it is in areas private markets are less likely to cover, like defense research, basic science and national security applications where private investors can’t capture the full benefits.

Taxpayer dollars should go where private investors won’t — defense, basic research and security — not into data centers already awash in capital.

The Trump administration has generally <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5571008-trump-congress-drug-strikes/\">dismissed these concerns</a>, but to provide legal rationale for the strikes, the White House earlier this month <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5535523-trump-armed-conflict-drug-cartels-caribbean/\">declared</a> the U.S. in “non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels it deems as terrorist groups. </p>\n<p>Republicans and Democrats have criticized the administration for the strikes, even <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5512242-venezuela-boat-strikes-congress-resolution/\">introducing a resolution</a> that challenged the Trump administration’s authority to carry out its hits against the boats.

Senate Democrats continue to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5579707-senate-democrats-legality-boat-strikes/\">question</a> the boat strikes’ adherence to international law. </p>\n\n<p>Members of both parties also <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5583076-turner-frustration-boat-strikes-briefing/\">expressed</a> <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5582059-democrats-seek-legal-rationale/\">frustration</a> with the Trump administration’s explanations of the boat strikes during a Thursday briefing. </p>\n<p>Türk echoed these concerns in his Friday statement, saying the strikes were taking place “outside the context” of active hostilities or armed conflict. Shamdasani also said Türk believed the strikes “violate international human rights law.”</p>\n<p>Fights against illicit drug-enforcement trafficking had “careful limits” on lethal force, which should only be used as a last resort against someone posing “an imminent threat to life,” Shamdasani said on Türk’s behalf. “Otherwise, it would amount to a violation of the right of life and constitute extrajudicial killings.”</p>\n</div>",

The Office of Special Education Programs isn’t just a bureaucratic office; it’s the backbone of special education oversight in the United States. It guides states and school districts, supports families, and allocates <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/blog/trump-administration-threatens-support-for-children-with-disabilities\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$15 billion in funding for special education services nationwide.</a></p>\n\n<p>Compared to the attention given to potential cuts to Medicaid or food assistance, this move has flown under the radar.

For millions of children with disabilities, it’s their best chance at independence and future success. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Since 1975, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act has guaranteed that children with disabilities cannot be excluded from public education. Today, <a href=\"https://sites.ed.gov/idea/2023-individuals-with-disabilities-education-act-annual-report-to-congress/#Ages-5-21\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">approximately 10 percent of students</a> — roughly 6.6 million children aged 6 to 21 — receive special education and related services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. <a href=\"https://sites.ed.gov/idea/2023-individuals-with-disabilities-education-act-annual-report-to-congress/#Part-C\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nearly half a million infants and toddlers</a> receive early education services to help reduce lifelong learning challenges. </p>\n<p>But the federal government has never lived up to its commitment to fully fund these services.

Without federal leadership, responsibility for compliance and funding would fall to a patchwork of state systems, some capable, others not. Families would have little recourse but to pursue costly private litigation to secure services, a route inaccessible to most. </p>\n<p>Before the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act became law, many <a href=\"https://sites.ed.gov/idea/regs/b/a/300.8\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">children with disabilities</a> were shut out of public schools or left to fail in classrooms unequipped to meet their needs.

I worked with parents of children with severe disabilities who, through specialized education and therapy, gained the ability to walk, feed themselves, or communicate. These are not isolated stories; they are the everyday results of federal investment in special education.</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n\n<p>If the Office of Special Education Programs is dismantled, who will ensure those outcomes remain possible?

And aspiring authoritarians use other excesses, like a cowed legislature and judiciary, to lock in their power.”</p>\n<p>The Times laid out a dozen different ways Trump has changed the operations of the U.S. government, arguing he is moving America away from democracy and toward a more centralized system of power among its leaders. These examples included “stifling speech and dissent,” “prosecuting political enemies,” “bypassing the legislature” and “using the military for domestic control.” </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“Our country is still not close to being a true autocracy, in the mold of Russia or China.

She then hinted it might be her: “<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n7k2veywo\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">I am not done</a>,” she said.</p>\n<p>To which America collectively sighed, “Please, for the love of God, don’t do this to us again!”</p>\n\n<p>I say this as someone who rode the Harris rollercoaster. I was skeptical at first, then briefly impressed when she didn’t implode in the summer of 2024. Ultimately, we received a brutal reminder of why President Trump is still the equivalent of a political wrecking ball. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>But this isn’t just about Harris. I’m just going to say the thing I probably shouldn’t say: If Democrats really believe Trump and MAGA represent an existential threat to liberal democracy, they should try something different next time. Like, nominating a man. </p>\n<p>Before you start sketching out your think piece, I am not saying this from a place of misogyny. I supported Sarah Palin back in 2008 (a confession that ages as well as milk) and pulled the lever for Nikki Haley in the 2024 primary.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>My point is simpler and sadder: There’s a growing sense that the Democratic Party has, to borrow James Carville’s phrase, “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4552950-carville-too-many-preachy-females-are-dominating-the-culture-of-the-democratic-party/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">too many preachy females</a>.” In a political era obsessed with toughness and masculinity, that perception is electoral kryptonite.</p>\n<p>For example, one participant in a Third Way focus group conducted in 2024 <a href=\"https://www.thirdway.org/memo/young-men-in-2025-not-sold-on-trump-alienated-by-democrats\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>, “I think being a masculine leader is, like, outlawed in the Democratic Party right now.”</p>\n<p>This might sound ridiculous, but the feelings — and the findings — both seem to align. Trump is 0-for-1 against male Democrats. Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris, while both capable, couldn’t close the deal. And yes, I acknowledge the counterarguments. That is a small sample size, and correlation isn’t causation. Yes, Hillary won the popular vote and Trump would have trounced Joe Biden in 2024 if he had stayed on the ticket. And yes, Harris got handed a tough assignment at a late date. </p>\n\n<p>But still, it is a pattern that feels like fate.</p>\n<p>The thing is, Trump’s obsession with dominance and cruelty, coupled with the backlash to the #MeToo movement, has changed attitudes. For example, a <a href=\"https://prri.substack.com/p/our-increasingly-gendered-politics\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2024 PRRI survey</a> found that 73 percent of Republicans now agree that society has become “too soft and feminine” — a belief that doubtless affects people’s voting decisions. It is telling that this number is up 13 points since 2016.</p>\n<p>And it’s not just white Republican men who are less inclined to vote for woman. Sarah Longwell from The Bulwark held focus group panels last fall that <a href=\"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/is-america-ready-to-elect-a-female-president-kamala-harris-glass-ceiling\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">revealed a bleak consensus</a>, even among Democratic women.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>A Georgia voter put it bluntly: “Women … don’t want to see another woman in office.”</p>\n<p>Another woman, a black Clinton-Biden voter, added, “I feel like Kamala wouldn’t win … because just in the black community, there’s still a struggle with men [wanting] to see women as leaders.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps it’s no coincidence that our culture has recently turned the word “Karen” into a national punchline — a shorthand way to call a woman bossy, humorless, and entitled. Carville, ever the Cajun oracle, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4552950-carville-too-many-preachy-females-are-dominating-the-culture-of-the-democratic-party/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">summed up the perception bluntly</a>: Too many Democrats sound like someone’s scolding aunt. “Don’t drink beer, don’t watch football, don’t eat hamburgers, this is not good for you. … You’ve got to eat your peas.”</p>\n\n<p>Fair or not, that image has infected how voters perceive Democratic women.</p>\n<p>Case in point, a recent episode of the Commentary podcast, focusing on Tuesday’s elections, was titled, “<a href=\"https://www.commentary.org/john-podhoretz/democrat-karens-and-islamist-zohrans/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Democrat Karens and Islamic Zohrans</a>.”</p>\n<p>The reference to “Karens” was in regards to the two Democratic women running for governor right now, New Jersey’s Mikie Sherrill and Virginia’s Abigail Spanberger. Both women are accomplished, grounded, and capable — yet, both are running campaigns so cautious that they might as well be wrapped in bubble wrap.</p>\n\n<p>Both will probably still win (although Sherrill’s race is too close, especially when you consider that New Jersey is a Democratic state and 2025 should be a Democratic year), but no one will remember how.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, up in Maine, there’s an incipient 2026 Democratic Senate primary where a scandal-plagued upstart named <a href=\"https://www.commentary.org/john-podhoretz/democrat-karens-and-islamist-zohrans/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Graham Platner is somehow trouncing Gov. Janet Mills</a> by double digits in a recent poll. </p>\n<p>That’s not normal politics. That’s a symptom — or a sign. </p>\n\n<p>And sure, part of the story might be that Platner is an outsider running against an aging establishment politician. But let’s not pretend his identity (oysterman, tattooed veteran, Joe Six-Pack) isn’t at least part of his appeal. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>The point is this: Until the fever breaks, Democrats might want to give more consideration to what they’re saying (please, no more <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5465386-democrats-avoid-political-correctness/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">words like “birthing person” or “cisgender</a>”) and to who is speaking.</p>\n<p>This is especially true when it comes to renominating a particular 2028 presidential candidate.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) for a “fundamentally ambiguous” line of questioning.</p>\n\n<p>“Fundamental to any false statement charge are both clear questions and false answers. Neither exists here,” Comey’s attorneys wrote in the Thursday filing, noting that the statute requires “false answers to precise questions.”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/71459121/1/united-states-v-comey/\">two-page indictment</a> of Comey was brought after a career prosecutor left the Justice Department over concerns in the case, with President Trump then appointing one of his former personal attorneys to oversee it. In an unusual move, Lindsey Halligan, who is now leading the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, is the only attorney to have signed the indictment.</p>\n<p>The sparse indictment doesn’t offer specifics about the exchange on which Comey’s charges are based. But it references questions about whether Comey authorized his deputy Andrew McCabe to leak to the media about an investigation into the 2016 Trump campaign, a line of inquiry only touched on by Cruz.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Cruz initially summarizes testimony Comey gave during a 2017 appearance before Congress, when Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) asked if he’d ever been the source for leaks on the Trump campaign probe. </p>\n<p>Cruz went on to summarize statements from Comey’s then-deputy, Andrew McCabe, statements the filing said “McCabe simply had not made.” Cruz then asked the FBI director who was telling the truth about the alleged leaks. </p>\n<p>Comey said only that he stood by his original testimony.</p>\n\n<p>“After speaking for more than a minute, Senator Ted Cruz asked Mr. Comey to recall statements he had made three years earlier and to simultaneously address statements that Senator Cruz incorrectly claimed were made by Andrew McCabe,” the filing states.</p>\n<p>“In doing so, Senator Cruz never indicated that he wanted Mr. Comey to address the statements or activities of any person except for Mr. McCabe.”</p>\n<p>The Grassley exchange is now beyond the statute of limitations, while Comey was charged just days before the clock would have run out on the 2020 testimony.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>However, confusing matters further, prosecutors have since said in court that Person 1 and 3 referenced in the indictment are not McCabe and Trump but rather a close friend of Comey’s, Daniel Richman, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p>While Cruz’s session included broad statements about authorizing FBI leaks about either investigation, his questions only referenced McCabe.</p>\n<p>“A reasonable person could have understood Senator Cruz’s questions to be entirely unrelated to Mr. Richman or anyone else at the FBI—and to have focused on Mr. McCabe alone,” Comey’s filing states.</p>\n\n<p>“On that reasonable understanding, the indictment contains no allegations that Mr. Comey’s answers were false: it never alleges that Mr. Comey made a false statement regarding Mr. McCabe.”</p>\n<p>Comey is facing another charge of obstructing a congressional proceeding, and his filing complains that his defense team still does not know the basis for the charge and whether it’s even related to the Cruz line of questioning, hindering their defense.</p>\n<p>“To the extent Count Two rests on the same false statements as Count One, that count should also be dismissed for the reasons set forth herein,” Comey’s team wrote in the filing.</p>\n\n<p>“But as it stands, Count Two’s lack of specificity renders it inherently and separately defective for failing to provide adequate notice to Mr. Comey of the charge against which he must defend.”</p>\n</div>",
