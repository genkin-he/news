Seth Moulton (D-Mass.). </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“They just said that they can’t answer these questions because the lawyers aren’t here. They canceled having the lawyers here,” Moulton, a former Marine Corps officer, told reporters.</p>\n<p>He said those doing the briefing were “some policy folks” from the administration and the deputy commander of the U.S. Southern Command (Southcom). </p>\n<p>“The last word that I gave to the admiral is, I hope you recognize the constitutional peril that you are in and the peril you are putting our troops in,” Moulton said. </p>\n\n<p>The latest strike occurred Wednesday, when four “narco-terrorists” were killed in a strike in the Eastern Pacific, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5580409-hegseth-new-strike-alleged-narco-trafficking-boat-killing-4/\">according</a> to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. </p>\n<p>The military action come as the Trump administration has signaled its intent to end the regime of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The U.S. has <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5575511-trump-venezuela-military-pressure-maduro/\">amassed a massive U.S. military presence</a> in the Caribbean, sending warships, spy planes, F-35s, at least one submarine and recently <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5571893-uss-gerald-ford-caribbean-deployment/\">directing the USS Gerald R. Ford</a> and its strike group to the region.</p>\n<p>The administration has said the boat attacks are aimed at preventing fentanyl from reaching the United States, though Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) after the briefing said most of the narcotics involve cocaine.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>“So they admitted that all of the narcotics coming out of this part of the world is cocaine. They, you know, talked a little bit about the connection between cocaine and fentanyl, although I’m not convinced that what they said was accurate,” Jacobs told reporters. “And I think it goes to show that this is actually not about addressing fentanyl and the deaths of Americans, which is a really huge problem that we should be addressing.” </p>\n<p>Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), the chair of the House Armed Services Commitee, said “yes” when asked if there will be more briefings. Both he and the committee ranking member, Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.), declined to elaborate on what transpired in the briefing. </p>\n<p>Lawmakers who spoke to reporters after the briefing said its tone was “fairly collegial,” with Jacobs saying that Republicans were “equally frustrated with the lack of answers.”</p>\n\n<p>Lawmakers in both parties for weeks have asked the administration to provide a legal reasoning for the strikes and more evidence that the targeted individuals on vessels are drug traffickers. </p>\n<p>Anna Kelly, the spokesperson for the White House, hammered Democrats, saying they are pushing “bogus claims” about the campaign to “distract” the public from the shutdown. </p>\n<p>In a statement to The Hill, she said the Pentagon has held nine “bipartisan” briefings on the boat strikes and the department “individually works through requests” from lawmakers.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s pathetic that these Democrats care more about running cover for foreign drug smugglers and illegal immigrants seeking taxpayer-funded health care than paying federal workers and protecting American citizens from deadly narcotics,” Kelly said. </p>\n<p>A senior administration official said the Pentagon has made senior officials available to answer questions about the strikes and that classified briefings have included members and staff of House and Senate leadership, House and Senate Intelligence Committees, House and Senate Armed Services Committees and House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations Committees.</p>\n<p>Sen. Mark Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5581587-senate-intelligence-committee-law/\">slammed the administration for holding</a> a Wednesday evening briefing on the legality of strikes that only included GOP senators. </p>\n\n<p>“Somebody needs to be held accountable on this,” Warner said Thursday during a press conference.</p>\n<p>“Didn’t somebody raise their hand and say, ‘Well, holy crap, where are the Democrats?’ Who was willing to say, you know, ‘Isn’t there a constitutional obligation here?’ You know it is about separation of powers,” Warner said. </p>\n<p>During the briefing, the administration shared an opinion drafted by Justice Department lawyers that argues the strikes are within the bounds of the law.</p>\n\n<p>“If you’ve got a valid legal opinion, wouldn’t you want to share it with every member,” Warner said. </p>\n<p>Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that Democrats can ask for a briefing on intelligence matters whenever they want and praised the officials who briefed the senators. </p>\n<p>“Some of the people wanted to hear about the law and the president’s authority, which was a minority of people,” Risch told reporters on Thursday. “The other group, which I’m in, wanted to hear about, hey, how many drugs did you sink to the bottom of the sea? And they gave us information on both. It’s a good briefing.” </p>\n\n<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a close ally of Trump, said the administration should provide the briefing to both Democrats and Republicans. </p>\n<p>“I think there should be a briefing of the Congress about what’s going on,” Graham, who did not attend the Wednesday briefing, told reporters on Thursday. </p>\n<p>There have been three known survivors of the strikes. Two <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5562016-trump-administration-repatriate-alleged-drug-traffickers/\">were repatriated back</a> to Ecuador and Colombia earlier this month. A third this week was <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5576347-us-military-strikes-pacific/\">accepted</a> by Mexican search and rescue authorities. </p>\n\n<p>Jacobs on Thursday argued “part of why they could not actually hold or try the individuals that survived one of the attacks was because they don’t have evidentiary burden.”</p>\n<p>Rep. Gregory Meeks (N.Y.), the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, declined to speak to reporters right after the briefing, but released a statement later ripping the administration for not providing more information. </p>\n<p>“The briefing was incredible; incredible for how little information was shared, how little time the briefers stayed to answer questions, and how completely absent any credible legal rationale was for the administration’s unauthorized, ongoing expansion of these strikes,” Meeks said. </p>\n\n<p>Rep. Gil Cisneros (D-Calif.) told The Hill after the briefing that the officials did not discuss what weapons systems the U.S. military is using to take out the vessels. </p>\n</div>",

I have a Black daughter. Right now, she’s celebrated at her school. People love her. She’s like a rockstar, and that’s great. But I’m also starting to see high schools in the middle of the country rename themselves Robert E. Lee,” Michaels said, referring to the general of the Confederate Army during the Civil War.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“Like, that’s not good, not happy about that, don’t like that at all,” she added.</p>\n<p>Michaels said she has separate concerns for her son, who hears often that he bears blame for crimes committed by other white people.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“And I have a son who’s white, and you know, when people tell him, ‘You guys are the problem’ — and he hears that narrative a lot — obviously, kids are super switched on. They’re watching politics on YouTube,” she said, pointing to the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk.</p>\n<p>“Why do you think Charlie Kirk was so beloved? Not because he’s a bad guy. I’m saying because he was able to reach kids. They’re finding them on things like TikTok and YouTube,” she said.</p>\n<p>“So when they’re exposed to that messaging, and you tell them they’re all bad, they will become tribal. That’s the kind of stuff that alarms me,” she continued.</p>\n\n<p>Michaels expressed grave concern, especially as a parent, about the rise in political violence and the “othering of people who don’t agree with you and the dehumanization.”</p>\n<p>She blamed the so-called “woke culture” for what she perceives to be a rise in racism, saying the narrative that there’s something wrong with being a white person is “going to breed the next generation of racists.”</p>\n<p>“I think that racism, I’m sorry, is on the rise, and I think it’s not because of Trump, actually. I think it’s because kids are choking on woke culture and the narrative that they’re inherently bad for the color of their skin,” Michaels said.</p>\n<p>“It’s not about putting white people’s feelings at the center of a conversation,” she continued. “It’s about the fact that you are going to breed the next generation of racists with this narrative, and that’s what’s actually scary. You know, we need to stop using this to rally a base and start looking at what it’s doing to our kids.”</p>\n</div>",
