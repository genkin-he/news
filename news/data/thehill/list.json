Kennedy Jr. <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5393095-hhs-kennedy-cancels-uspstf-meeting/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cancelled a July meeting</a> that was supposed to discuss steps to prevent cardiovascular disease. </p>\n\n<p>Task force members meet in person three times a year — in March, July and November. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“The USPSTF’s November meeting has been postponed due to the Democrat-led shutdown. The Trump Administration is committed to reopening the government so meetings like this one can occur,” HHS spokeswoman Emily Hilliard said in an email. </p>\n<p>“The Secretary looks forward to working with the USPSTF to Make America Healthy Again.” </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The task force is composed of medical experts who serve four-year terms on a volunteer basis. They are appointed by the HHS secretary and are supposed to be shielded from political influence. </p>\n<p>The task force reviews reams of scientific evidence to make recommendations on services such as cancer screenings, HIV-prevention medications and more. It makes its recommendations using a grading scale, and ObamaCare requires insurers to cover services the task force recommends with a “grade” of A or B at no cost to patients.  </p>\n<p>The Wall Street Journal reported in July that Kennedy was considering firing the panelists because they were too “woke,” but no action has been taken. </p>\n\n<p>“The task force has done very little over the past five years, and we want to make sure it is performing, and it is approving interventions that are actually going to prevent the health decline of the American public. And it hasn’t,” Kennedy said at a press conference in August. </p>\n<p>The Supreme Court in June <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5369966-supreme-court-braidwood-hhs-preventive-care/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5369966-supreme-court-braidwood-hhs-preventive-care/\">upheld the structure</a> of the panel in a case originally focused on a recommendation to cover certain HIV-prevention drugs. The ruling asserted Kennedy has the power to hire and dismiss panelists at will, as well as to potentially delay or veto the recommendations they issue — something no prior administration has done.</p>\n<p>Aaron Carroll, president and CEO of AcademyHealth, an organization that advocates for health services researchers, questioned why the shutdown would impact the task force, as its members aren’t government employees.  </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Carroll said that task force has been trusted by patients and clinicians across the country for the past 40 years, and he is concerned HHS could undermine that credibility. </p>\n<p>“I would hope that an administration which wants to focus on, how do we improve chronic disease, how do we prevent bad things from happening, would be interested in having the task force that focuses on preventive care meet and make changes,” Carroll said.  </p>\n<p>“This directly affects the practice of clinical care and the health of Americans,” Carroll added. “The reason that we do prostate cancer screening the way we do is the USPSTF. The reason that we have colon cancer screening is the USPSTF … And when the meetings don’t happen, the work doesn’t happen and therefore nothing gets improved in any way for the American people.” </p>\n</div>",

Speaking on “Pod Force One,” Vance said that while he and Rubio are “best friends,” any speculation on 2028 was “premature.”</p>\n\n<p>Republican lawmakers have had mixed reactions to the idea of Trump running for a third time. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told Fox News’s Sean Hannity in September that he hopes “it never ends” and declared <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5519134-lindsey-graham-donald-trump-2028/\">“Trump 2028.”</a></p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) called a third term run <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5578045-tuberville-trump-constitution-third-term/\">“very unlikely, but don’t ever close the book on President Trump.”</a></p>\n<p>“You know, if you read the Constitution, it says it’s not, but if he says he has some, some different circumstances that might be able to go around the Constitution, but that’s up to him,” Tuberville told a <a href=\"https://x.com/DailyCaller/status/1983217065373680016\">reporter</a>. “We got a long way to go before that happens.”</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5576672-johnson-trump-third-term/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">poured cold water over Trump’s chances.</a> Johnson told reporters on Tuesday that he does not see a path to change the 22nd Amendment, which requires two-thirds of the House of Representatives and the Senate or a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the state legislatures.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a great run, but I think the president knows — and he and I’ve talked about the constrictions of the Constitution, as much as so many of the American people lament that,” Johnson said. “…I don’t see a path for that.”</p>\n<p>The 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1951 to limit the president of the United States to two terms.

That’s what he’s demonstrated over and over,” Johnson told reporters on Thursday morning.</p>\n\n<p>“So the idea that he would make a public statement stating that he would want our nuclear arsenal to be fully prepared, it’s a deterrent, and that’s an important show of force for us,” Johnson said.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href=\"http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/78301\">confirmed</a> the Kremlin had <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5580076-markey-calls-nuclear-disarmament/\">resumed nuclear weapons testing</a> and by Wednesday said they’d successfully tested both the nuclear-powered cruise missile and nuclear-powered underwater drone.</p>\n<p>“I say, well, if they’re going to test, I guess we have to test,” the president told reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>China has also doubled the size of its nuclear arsenal in the past five years, according to the <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/parading-chinas-nuclear-arsenal-out-shadows\">Center for Strategic International Studies</a>. The Department of Defense (DOD) <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2024/Dec/18/2003615520/-1/-1/0/MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA-2024.PDF\">estimates</a> that China will have over 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.</p>\n<p>Of the world’s nine nuclear-armed countries, only North Korea has tested since 1998, according to a 2024 analysis by the <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2024-09/features/preventing-resumption-nuclear-testing\">Arms Control Association</a>. </p>\n<p>For decades, the U.S. has adhered to a global moratorium on nuclear testing for 33 years in an effort to deescalate international tensions after the Cold War maintaining only scientific testing and supercomputer simulations to make sure bombs are still intact.</p>\n\n<p>Only the Nevada National Security Site is suitable for present day tests, Robert Peters, a senior research fellow for strategic deterrence at the Heritage Foundation, told <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/30/nx-s1-5590818/trump-nuclear-testing\">NPR</a>. </p>\n<p>However, Johnson said Thursday there are members of the military from across the nation who are willing to contribute. </p>\n<p>“I represent Barksdale Air Force Base in my district. It’s home to two-thirds of the nuclear triad and global strike command there. I can tell you, they are ready and they are on the ready, but we need to have that as a daily reminder and a daily process,” Johnson continued. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>“And so, I’m glad that we have a president who understands the necessity of that. I think it sends a strong message to our adversaries around the world. And it’s an important time to do that,” he added. </p>\n<p>Trump’s announcement Thursday has been met with criticism from peace organizations and advocates who say the resumption of nuclear testing will poorly impact the U.S.</p>\n<p>“By foolishly announcing his intention resume nuclear testing, Trump will trigger strong public opposition in Nevada, from all U.S. allies, and it could trigger a chain reaction of nuclear testing by U.S. adversaries, and blow apart the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty,” Daryl Kimball, Director of Arms Control Association, wrote in a <a href=\"https://x.com/DarylGKimball/status/1983716991421571322\">Thursday statement</a> on X.</p>\n\n<p>He said it would take at least 36 months to resume contained nuclear tests underground at the former test site in Nevada.</p>\n<p>“Note: Trump’s post is not clear about whether he is talking about n-explosive testing (which the NNSA would do) or flight testing of n-capable missiles (which the DoD does). Trump’s policy is incoherent: calling for denuclearization talks one day; threatening n-tests the next,” he added in a <a href=\"https://x.com/DarylGKimball/status/1983725406583701731\">follow up post</a>.</p>\n</div>",

Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.) holds an 8-point lead over former GOP Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli in the New Jersey gubernatorial race ahead of next Tuesday, according to a new poll. </p>\n<p>A Quinnipiac University poll <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3941\">released on Thursday</a> found Sherrill ahead of Ciattarelli 51 percent to 43 percent among likely voters. Three percent said they were undecided while both longshot candidates — Socialist Worker Party candidate Joanne Kuniansky and Libertarian Party candidate Vic Kaplan – each received 1 percent. </p>\n\n<p>The polling offers a minor shift from the last poll Quinnipiac University released earlier this month, which showed Ciattarelli at 44 percent and Sherrill at 50 percent.  </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The poll offers several other bright spots for Sherrill. For one, Sherrill enjoys a higher favorability rating, 47 percent, compared to Ciattarelli at 43 percent. Ciattarelli also has a higher unfavorable rating, 47 percent, than Sherrill at 38 percent. More people haven’t heard of Sherrill, 13 percent, than Ciattarelli at 9 percent.</p>\n<p>The latest Quinnipiac University poll found that term-limited New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) enjoyed a higher approval rating – 45 percent – compared to President Trump at 40 percent. Still, both men’s approval ratings are underwater in the state. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Trump has a higher disapproval rating – 56 percent – compared to Murphy, who has a 47 percent disapproval rating. </p>\n<p>The top issue that respondents said was the most important in their selection for governor was taxes at 25 percent. That was followed by ethics in government at 16 percent and health care at 14 percent.  </p>\n<p>Sherrill and Ciattarelli are vying for Murphy’s seat on Tuesday to helm the Garden State. The race has turned increasingly competitive in the final stretch as more voters are tuning into the race and both campaigns bring in last-minute surrogates to rally their bases.  </p>\n\n<p>The poll shows Sherrill with a more comfortable lead over her GOP opponent compared to most recent public polls, which have shown her leading by less than 8 percent. An Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill survey <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5579199-sherrill-ciattarelli-nj-governor/\">released on Thursday</a> showed Sherrill barely edging out Ciattarelli 49 percent to 48 percent, well within the poll’s margin of error. </p>\n<p>A Decision Desk HQ polling <a href=\"https://polls.decisiondeskhq.com/averages/general-ballot-test/new-jersey/lv-rv-adults\">average of surveys</a> on the race shows Sherrill at 50 percent while Ciattarelli is at 45 percent.  </p>\n<p>The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted between Oct. 23 and Oct. 28 with 1,166 New Jersey likely voters surveyed. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.  </p>\n</div>",
