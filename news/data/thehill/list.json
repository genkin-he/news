            "description": "<p>Vice President Vance on Thursday defended the U.S. <a href=\"https://thehill.com/newsletters/defense-national-security/5755848-on-eve-of-nuclear-talks-trump-hits-iran-with-new-sanctions/\">potentially</a> launching military strikes on Iran, saying there was “no chance” that it would lead to a longer war in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>Vance said in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2026/02/26/vance-no-chance-us-will-be-drawn-out-war-middle-east/\">The Washington Post</a> that the strikes would be a deterrent to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon unless the issue is solved diplomatically. </p>\n<p>“The idea that we’re going to be in a Middle Eastern war for years with no end in sight — there is no chance that will happen,” he said.</p>\n<p>The vice president said he does not know how President Trump will act on Iran, saying that he and the president are “skeptic[s] of foreign military interventions.”</p>\n<p>Vance chuckled when the Post asked if he, given the Marine veteran’s past criticisms of the Iraq War, could have seen himself as part of an administration interested in bringing about regime change. He said that life “has all kinds of crazy twists and turns” and said Trump is an “America First president.”</p>\n<p>“I do think we have to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past,” Vance added. “I also think that we have to avoid overlearning the lessons of the past. Just because one president screwed up a military conflict doesn’t mean we can never engage in military conflict again. We’ve got to be careful about it, but I think the president is being careful.”</p>\n<p>Vance reiterated that the administration prefers a diplomatic outcome to the current standoff. But, he said, that “depends on what the Iranians do and what they say.”</p>\n<p>Tensions have risen between leaders in Washington, D.C., and in Tehran over Iran’s nuclear program. Trump has threatened Iran with military action over the program, despite previously claiming the U.S. “obliterated” it <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5362470-us-iran-bombing-takeaways/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">during strikes against the country</a> in June.</p>\n<p>The president also threatened military actions over the government’s crackdown on dissent following massive anti-government protests last month. </p>\n<p>The administration has <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5709342-iran-us-strike-tension-middle-east/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">amassed a major military contingent</a> in the Middle East amid negotiations, with Trump previously saying he is considering a limited strike. </p>\n<p>Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned of retaliation if the U.S. were to strike. Iranian officials have argued that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, claiming that uranium enrichment is a national right.</p>\n<p>Talks on Thursday in Oman showed “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5757110-us-iran-talks-oman-complete/\">significant progress</a>,” according to Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi. </p>\n<p>Some congressional lawmakers plan to hold a vote on a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5753315-trump-iran-military-force-resolution-fails/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">war powers resolution</a> to block Trump from carrying out strikes on Iran without approval from Congress. Democrats largely back the bipartisan call for a resolution, co-led by Reps. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.). </p>\n<p>Republican Rep. Warren Davidson (Ohio) joined Massie in <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5757526-davidson-massie-back-resolution-iran/\">pledging to support</a> the resolution. He argued that “no case has been made” in favor of striking Iran.</p>\n<p>House Democrats have said they will <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5756657-democrats-trump-iran-war-powers/\">force a vote</a> to limit the president’s war powers next week.</p>",

Four men on the boat were killed while six others were wounded and taken into custody. </p>\n<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also Cuban American, said the U.S. government is conducting their own investigation into the incident because it does not trust the Cuban version of events.</p>\n<p>Thursday, the Cuban Ministry of the Interior identified the individuals as:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Cristian Ernesto Acosta Guevara</li>\n<li>Conrado Galindo Serrior</li>\n<li>José Manuel Rodríguez Castelló</li>\n<li>Leordán Cruz Gomez of Tampa</li>\n<li>Amijail Sanchez Gonzalez</li>\n<li>Roberto Alvarez Avila</li>\n<li>Pavel Alling Peña</li>\n<li>Michael Ortega Casanova of Tampa</li>\n<li>Ledián Padrón Guevara</li>\n<li>Hector Duani Cruz Correa</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last four people on the list were said to be deceased. The others are in Cuban custody.</p>\n<p>According to the Cuban government, weapons were found on the boat, including “assault rifles, sniper rifles, pistols, Molotov cocktails, multiple assault equipment including night vision equipment, bulletproof vests, assault bayonets, camouflage clothing, ammunition of various calibers, food for combat use, means of communication, and a large number of monograms of counterrevolutionary terrorist organizations.”</p>\n<p>The statement continued:</p>\n<p>“Right from the start, Cuban authorities have been in touch with their U.S. counterparts, including the State Department and the Coast Guard, about this terrorist attempt. An investigation is underway to clarify the facts with the utmost rigor. The Cuban government is willing to exchange information with the US government on this matter. Among other requirements, we will request information on those involved, the means used, and other details from the US authorities through the mechanisms in place between the two countries.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-nexstar-video\"> <div class=\"nexstar-video\" data-player-location=\"Story Embed\" id=\"story-embed-2\"> <video class=\"video-js vjs-nexstar-skin\" data-nexstar-video=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;11559703&quot;,&quot;provider&quot;:&quot;anvato&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;11559703&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;video&quot;,&quot;provider&quot;:&quot;anvato&quot;,&quot;station&quot;:&quot;hill&quot;,&quot;playlistId&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;preRoll&quot;:true,&quot;autoplay&quot;:false,&quot;titleVisible&quot;:true,&quot;recommendations&quot;:false,&quot;player_location&quot;:&quot;Story Embed&quot;,&quot;has_auth&quot;:false,&quot;htmlEmbed&quot;:true,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister says US is working with them to investigate attack&quot;,&quot;adTagUrl&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;player&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;autoplay&quot;:false,&quot;pluginConfig&quot;:{&quot;recommendations&quot;:{&quot;enabled&quot;:false,&quot;items&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;11553706&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;RISING: Top Stories for Feb 25, 2026&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/h104216-fcdn.mp.lura.live\\/1\\/938892\\/pvw_lin\\/2CA\\/DA6\\/2CADA613BE26D6350B8677AD0D8893B6_1_160x90.jpg?aktaexp=2082787200&amp;aktasgn=7f0c724c40b9cbc3aa062a3c96abb444&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/tkx.mp.lura.live\\/rest\\/v2\\/mcp\\/video\\/11553706.m3u8?anvack=Rawk5AaXamlYMHRoV0UeKfkdB3KQ0dnD&amp;eud=NExlctJX0MT7X8mwrM3XdzqUHVjPM0Frsq9TRUEb4ak%2FKJgRKZ%2B64LxwkKEbw%2B0YTyO8KsbFw40vgX8hrw%2Bxqw%3D%3D&quot;,&quot;videoType&quot;:&quot;recommendation&quot;,&quot;renderMethod&quot;:&quot;static&quot;}],&quot;ad_unit&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;11553626&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Hill's Headlines \\u2014 February 25, 2026&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/h104216-fcdn.mp.lura.live\\/1\\/938892\\/pvw_lin\\/2AD\\/B07\\/2ADB07CF359AC521115AE56E517ABB76_4_160x90.jpg?aktaexp=2082787200&amp;aktasgn=c833cc5600a9cedad5e5e5e843532dc9&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/tkx.mp.lura.live\\/rest\\/v2\\/mcp\\/video\\/11553626.m3u8?anvack=Rawk5AaXamlYMHRoV0UeKfkdB3KQ0dnD&amp;eud=NExlctJX0MT7X8mwrM3XdzqUHVjPM0Frsq9TRUEb4ak%2FKJgRKZ%2B64LxwkKEbw%2B0YTyO8KsbFw40vgX8hrw%2Bxqw%3D%3D&quot;,&quot;videoType&quot;:&quot;recommendation&quot;,&quot;renderMethod&quot;:&quot;static&quot;}],&quot;ad_unit&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;11553980&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Spanberger Americans Are Paying The Price SOT&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/h104216-fcdn.mp.lura.live\\/1\\/938892\\/pvw_lin\\/2B4\\/BFD\\/2B4BFDB18E671CA9EEF3E365792E3115_2_160x90.jpg?aktaexp=2082787200&amp;aktasgn=b3faddb7d662d794c7d9f8fe0878ff41&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/tkx.mp.lura.live\\/rest\\/v2\\/mcp\\/video\\/11553980.m3u8?anvack=Rawk5AaXamlYMHRoV0UeKfkdB3KQ0dnD&amp;eud=NExlctJX0MT7X8mwrM3XdzqUHVjPM0Frsq9TRUEb4ak%2FKJgRKZ%2B64LxwkKEbw%2B0YTyO8KsbFw40vgX8hrw%2Bxqw%3D%3D&quot;,&quot;videoType&quot;:&quot;recommendation&quot;,&quot;renderMethod&quot;:&quot;static&quot;}],&quot;ad_unit&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;11552682&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Rep.

            "description": "<p>Denver Mayor Mike Johnston (D) on Thursday announced that federal <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5143719-denver-public-schools-dhs-ice-policy-trump-immigration-crackdown/\">immigration agents</a> are banned from city property while also mandating Denver law enforcement to protect protesters.</p>\n<p>Johnston issued the ban via an executive order. The order mandates that Denver police and sheriff’s deputies document federal immigration officers with body cameras, give life-saving aid to someone harmed by federal officers and “to intervene in instances of force that could cause death or serious bodily injury by immigration enforcement agents,” among other provisions. </p>\n<p>“We seek not to provoke but to protect,” Johnston said in a <a href=\"https://denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Mayors-Office/News/2026/Executive-Order-152\">statement</a>. “In a time of great fear, we are reminding Denverites that there are still those you can trust and lines you can’t cross. Our law enforcement and legal teams will stand up for civil liberties, and, if necessary, step in to protect the life and safety of our residents.</p>\n<p>“This is our city, and we will defend the rights of every person in it,” he added.</p>\n<p>A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson called the executive order “legally illiterate.”</p>\n<p>“Enforcing federal immigration laws is a clear federal responsibility under Article I, Article II and the Supremacy Clause,” the spokesperson said in a statement to The Hill. “While Mayor Johnston continues to release pedophiles, rapists, gang members, and murderers onto their streets, our brave law enforcement will continue to risk their lives to arrest these heinous criminals and make Denver safe again.”</p>\n<p>The order <strong>is</strong> symbolic, as Denver and the state of Colorado do not have the power to stop federal immigration officers from conducting operations, even in the face of the state’s sanctuary laws.</p>\n<p>Johnston’s executive order comes amid President Trump’s immigration crackdown in Democratic-led states. His deportation agenda faced major pushback in Minnesota, after officials accused the administration of federal overreach. </p>\n<p>This was exacerbated by the shooting deaths of two U.S. citizens, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, in Minneapolis last month, which led to further outcry after Trump administration officials accused them of “domestic terrorism.”</p>\n<p>Other states have acted on how local law enforcement will interact with ICE. Earlier this month, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) signed into law a bill banning cooperation agreements between sheriffs and ICE. Wicomico County Sheriff Michael Lewis on Wednesday <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5758182-ice-maryland-sheriffs-law-enforcement/\">accused the new law</a> of putting “politics over public safety.”</p>\n<p>Democratic lawmakers called for dramatic reform within DHS and for ICE. Some House Democrats backed an appropriations bill to fund DHS last month. Pretti’s death drew Democratic senators away from the backing the bill, resulting in an ongoing shutdown.</p>",

Lawmakers need to wake up and realize the American people want public safety over politics, and they’re not getting it!”</p>\n<p>Sheriffs from seven Maryland counties gathered in Annapolis on Wednesday to speak out against another bill, the Community Trust Act, that would restrict ICE’s interaction with local police even further, <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/2026/02/25/maryland-sheriffs-opposition-immigration-bills/\">The Baltimore Sun</a> reported. </p>\n<p>The bill would prohibit local police from investigating or arresting a person based on their citizenship status and would prevent them from notifying or transferring potential suspects to ICE without a warrant.</p>\n<p>Gov. Wes Moore (D) signed a law banning 287(g) agreements in the state, which allows ICE to deputize local law enforcement officers to carry out immigration enforcement. In the two weeks since it became law, local sheriffs have vowed to continue working with ICE in an informal capacity, which could soon also be prohibited.</p>\n<p>“Federal law enforcement handcuffs are considerably larger than state police handcuffs, than sheriff’s deputies’ handcuffs, than local law enforcement handcuffs,” Lewis said, according to the Sun. “Who are we to tell them how to do their job?”</p>\n<p>Even Moore’s predecessor, former Gov. Larry Hogan (R), said that local police will “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5746598-hogan-moore-ice-law-dispute/\">ignore</a>” the new law. </p>\n<p>“So I get the whole, you know, overreach and overstep and doing the wrong things, but, you know, when they have violent criminals that they’re holding in jail that ICE wants to be detained, they, you know, they shouldn’t be let back on the street,” Hogan said at Politico Live’s “Governors Summit.” “So there’s two sides to this argument.”</p>\n<p>Moore <a href=\"https://governor.maryland.gov/news/press/pages/Governor-Moore-Signs-Legislation-to-Prohibit-Maryland-Jurisdictions-from-Deputizing-Officers-for-Federal-Civil-Immigration-.aspx\">previously said</a> the new law “draws a clear line: we will continue to work with federal partners to hold violent offenders accountable, but we refuse to blur the lines between state and federal authority in ways that undermine the trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.”</p>\n<p>Moore and other Democrats have accused ICE officers of breaking the law in recent months, citing an excessive use of force and racial discrimination. And after two U.S. citizens were killed by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis last month, the Maryland governor and others have also condemned the actions by the Department of Homeland Security’s agencies.</p>\n<p>Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) last month called for “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5695169-van-hollen-ice-reform-criticism/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dramatic reform</a>” within ICE and accused ICE officers of breaking the law and acting “completely lawless.”</p>",

            "description": "<p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Thursday criticized questions she said she got from House Republicans about UFOs and the “Pizzagate” conspiracy <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5756577-clintons-questioned-epstein-links/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">during her deposition</a> as part of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee’s investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>\n<p>“It then got, at the end, quite unusual because I started being asked about UFOs and a series of questions about Pizzagate — one of the most vile bogus conspiracy theories that was propagated on the internet — that was serving as the basis of a member’s questions to me,” Clinton told reporters after her deposition in Chappaqua, N.Y.</p>\n<p>She added, however, “I want to commend Chairman [James] Comer [R-Ky.] for raising a series of significant questions that I responded to about the nature of the investigation and the areas that I thought should be explored. So I appreciated that, I want to see the truth come out. So that was a reassuring way to end a very long, repetitive deposition.” </p>\n<p>Clinton said she answered “every one” of the committee’s questions as fully as she could based on what she knew.</p>\n<p>“I thought it was very repetitive,” Clinton later said. “I thought that they literally asked the same questions over and over again, which didn’t seem to me to be very productive. And then, as I said toward the end, there were several questions that were off-subject.”</p>\n<p>She said she never met with Epstein and that she knew his associate Ghislaine Maxwell “casually, as an aquaintance.” </p>\n<p>She later said she was confident that the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) files related to Epstein do not reveal anything that suggests her husband, former President Clinton, knew about Epstein’s crimes. </p>\n<p>Clinton said she will not testify again and slammed the committee for not allowing the hearing to be in public, as she and Bill Clinton had pushed for, saying they could have “spent their day more productively.”</p>\n<p>Rep. Suhas Subramanyam (D-Va.) hinted at the questions Clinton was asked during an appearance on CNN. Anchor Jake Tapper asked if it was true that the questions about UFOs and “Pizzagate” were asked during the deposition. </p>\n<p>“I hope that the transcript will be released within 24 hours,” Subramanyam told Tapper. “I‘m not allowed to say specifics about it, but I will just say that the transcript will be very revealing about that.”</p>\n<p>The Clintons agreed to sit for depositions under threat of being held in contempt of Congress for defying a congressional subpoena. The former president, who flew on Epstein’s plane a few times during the early 2000s and who appears in photos released as part of the Epstein files, is scheduled to sit for a deposition Friday.</p>\n<p>Controversy <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5757287-hillary-clinton-deposition-boebert-photo/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">boiled over earlier in the deposition</a> Thursday after Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) leaked a photo from inside the room, which was against the rules set out for the interview. Oversight Democrats called it “unnacceptable” that Republicans broke “their own committee rules that they established with the Secretary and her team,” ranking member Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) said.</p>\n<p>When later asked about the photo, Boebert made a reference to the FBI’s investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server while serving in the Obama administration. The issue became a key controversy during the final stretch of her 2016 presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>“I just returned to my hotel room and installed the BleachBit software … So, I guess in regards to taking photos, I do not recall,” Boebert quipped to reporters.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Netflix on Thursday said it would not match a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5757758-paramount-hostile-bid-warner-discovery/\">bid from Paramount</a> seeking to acquire Warner Brothers Discovery, the sprawling media empire that includes legacy brands in news and entertainment like CNN and HBO.</p>\n<p>News of the streamer bowing out of its deal with Warner Bros. Discovery came just minutes after the David Zaslav-led company said it considered the hostile bid mounted by Paramount to be a “superior” offer to the one it struck with the streamer <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5652023-netflix-warner-deal-paramount-bid/\">late last year</a>.</p>\n<p>Netflix’s deal would have given the streamer control of Warner Bros. Discovery’s premier movie and television studios at a price of more than $70 billion.</p>\n<p>“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” Netflix said in a statement. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.” </p>\n<p>Paramount’s bid, which seeks to purchase the entire Warner Bros. Discovery portfolio including its linear television assets like CNN and TNT Sports, comes with a purchase price of $31 per share in cash, as well as a $7 billion regulatory termination fee for the previous deal with Netflix.</p>\n<p>Paramount was sold last year to Skydance, the rapidly growing media conglomerate owned by Larry Ellison, an ally of President Trump and one of the richest people on earth. </p>\n<p>Since the sale, led by Larry’s son David Ellison, Paramount has worked to implement sweeping changes to the company’s news and entertainment divisions at CBS.</p>\n<p>The company has vowed to retool its news coverage and entertainment content offerings to appeal to a more politically diverse customer base, a sentiment many elected Democrats and media critics have warned signals as a rightward shift at the legacy media giant. </p>\n<p>“We are pleased WBD’s Board has unanimously affirmed the superior value of our offer, which delivers to WBD shareholders superior value, certainty and speed to closing,” David Ellison said in a statement on Thursday.</p>\n<p>A merger between Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery would require approval by President Trump’s Justice Department, which earlier this month ousted the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5735535-gail-slater-leaves-doj-antitrust/\">head of its antitrust division</a>.</p>\n<p>Trump has spoken positively about the Ellison’s efforts to retool CBS under Paramount, and said he wishes to see CNN operate under new ownership. </p>\n<p>As Paramount mounted its hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, the president and his allies railed against Netflix over what they argued is left-leaning bias at the streamer, while some Democrats on Capitol Hill raised anti-trust concerns about the proposed merger. </p>\n<p>“Netflix’s business is healthy, strong and growing organically, powered by our slate and best-in-class streaming service,” the company said. “This year, we’ll invest approximately $20 billion in quality films and series and will expand our entertainment offering. Consistent with our capital allocation policy, we’ll also resume our share repurchase program.”</p>",

            "description": "<p>Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) on Wednesday pressed Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Administrator Terry Cole for answers on an investigation into possible drug trafficking and suspicious financial transactions involving the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>\n<p>Wyden sent a letter to Cole requesting an unredacted version of a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00173953.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2015 memorandum</a> that references a probe entitled “Chain Reaction,” in which Epstein is named alongside 14 other alleged co-conspirators.</p>\n<p>“Since Epstein and his 14 co-conspirators were never charged by the DOJ for drug trafficking or financial crimes, I am concerned that the DEA and DOJ during the first Trump Administration moved to terminate this investigation in order to protect pedophiles,” Wyden wrote.</p>\n<p>“I am also concerned that the excessive redactions of this memorandum for operation ‘Chain Reaction’ go well beyond the intent of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which allows for redactions to protect the identity of victims, not members of a criminal sex trafficking organization. Since this memorandum is designated as ‘sensitive but unclassified’ there is no reason to withhold an unredacted version of this document from the U.S. Congress,” he added.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5612631-epstein-files-transparency-act/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Epstein Files Transparency Act</a> requires the Department of Justice (DOJ) to provide Congress with an explanation for all redactions and the release of any immunity deals, nonprosecution agreements, plea bargains and sealed settlements provided to Epstein or his associates.</p>\n<p>Multiple redactions submitted by the DOJ have been contested by Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), in some cases leading to the information being released. </p>\n<p>In addition to a redacted copy of the DEA memo, Wyden asked for clarity regarding whether Epstein and his associates were buying or selling narcotics and why none of the 14 co-conspirators were prosecuted when the DEA’s “Chain Reaction” operation concluded.</p>\n<p>The memo in question notes that the case was opened in 2010 in New York and suggested it remained active when the memo was drafted in 2015. The co-conspirators, it said, were being investigated for “illegitimate wire transfers which are tied to illicit drug and/or prostitution activities occurring in the U.S. Virgin Islands and New York City.”</p>\n<p>The names of other co-conspirators and many other details in the memo are blacked out in the released files.</p>\n<p>The DEA did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment.</p>",
