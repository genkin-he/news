While speaking to reporters on Air Force One en route back to Washington, Trump said the 10 percent reduction was a result of him agreeing to lower fentanyl-related tariffs on Beijing from 20 percent to 10 percent. </p>\n<p>The president said Thursday’s announced tariff cut would be effective “immediately.” </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Trump weeks before the meeting had<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5549365-trump-threatens-china-tariffs/\"> threatened</a> to increase tariffs on China over export control concerns.</p>\n<p>Trump and his Republicans allies in Washington have looked to fiercely combat the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. during his second administration, making Thursday’s announcement on lowering fentanyl tariffs notable. The president said he was optimistic Xi would work hard to stop the illegal flow of fentanyl going forward. </p>\n<p>“On fentanyl, we agreed he was going to work very hard to stop the flow,” Trump told reporters. “You know it’s a very complex subject because it’s used for lots of different reasons including anesthetics. But he’s going to work very hard on it.” </p>\n\n<p>“I think you’re going to see some real action taken,” the president predicted. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">China pauses rare earth controls for one year</h2>\n<p>A major source of tension heading into the meeting was China’s recent announcement that it would<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-business/ap-china-outlines-more-controls-on-exports-of-rare-earths-and-technology/\"> tighten its control</a> over the export of critical minerals and rare earth materials.</p>\n<p>Trump appeared to score a major win in announcing that Beijing had agreed to delay the implementation of those changes for one year. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>The president said on Truth Social that China had agreed to “continue the flow of Rare Earth, Critical Minerals, Magnets, etc., openly and freely.”</p>\n<p>China is not expected to roll back existing export controls, but the delay provides the U.S. a reprieve while it shores up other supply chains.</p>\n<p>Rare earths and critical minerals are used in numerous products, including cars, semiconductors and electronics like laptops.</p>\n\n<p>China accounts for nearly 70 percent of the world’s rare earth mining as of 2024, and Beijing announced earlier this month tighter restrictions on what foreign entities could export products containing even a small percentage of critical minerals mined in China.</p>\n<p>Trump in response sought to<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5575798-trump-signs-critical-minerals-deal-japan/\"> sign deals</a> with Australia, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia to increase cooperation on the mining and processing of critical minerals and rare earth material.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trump’s nuclear testing casts shadow</h2>\n<p>Trump made news roughly an hour before his meeting with Xi when he announced in a TruthSocial post that he was directing the Pentagon to immediately begin testing U.S. nuclear weapons on an equal basis to China and Russia. </p>\n\n<p>“The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” Trump wrote. “This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice! Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.” </p>\n<p>Trump initially ignored a question from a reporter on the announcement during his meeting with Xi, but told reporters after that news “had to do with others” when asked whether it had to do with Xi. </p>\n<p>“They seem to all be nuclear testing. We have more nuclear weapons than anybody,” the president said. </p>\n\n<p>“We don’t do testing, and we halted it many years ago but with others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also,” he continued. </p>\n<p>It’s unclear what type of testing Trump is alluding to. No country has conducted nuclear testing since the 1990s except North Korea. Russia has been testing nuclear-capable weapons tests which does not include setting off actual bombs. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, meanwhile, has been testing missiles capable of having nuclear war heads as recently as this week.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Soybean purchases boost US farmers</h2>\n<p>U.S. soybean farmers had high hopes for the Trump-Xi meeting, as trade tensions between Washington and Beijing had hit them particularly hard.</p>\n\n<p>Trump said following the meeting that Xi had authorized the purchase of soybeans, sorghum and “other farm products.”</p>\n<p>“We’re in agreement on so many elements,” Trump said aboard Air Force One after the meeting. “Large amounts, tremendous amounts of the soybeans and other farm products are going to be purchased immediately, starting immediately.”</p>\n<p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Fox Business Network on Thursday that China had agreed to buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans through the remainder of the year and 25 million tons per year for the next three years.</p>\n\n<p>The announcement will come as a relief to farmers and to farm state lawmakers who had<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5522503-grassley-trump-argentina-soybean-farmers/\"> expressed frustration</a> with the ripple effects of Trump’s trade policies.</p>\n<p>Agriculture Department data showed soybeans were the largest agricultural export from the U.S. in 2024. Roughly half those exports went to China, but that number dropped to zero earlier this year after Beijing stopped purchasing U.S. soybeans, turning instead to places like Argentina. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Not discussed: Taiwan, Russian oil, Blackwell chips</h2>\n<p>While a lot of ground was covered during the over hour long meeting between the U.S. and Chinese delegations, there were a number of key issues that did not come up among officials. </p>\n\n<p>Trump told reporters that Taiwan, Russian oil, and Blackwell chips were not discussed during the sitdown with his Chinese counterpart. </p>\n<p>“Taiwan never came up. It was not discussed actually,” Trump said, noting that Russia’s war in Ukraine was a topic of conversation. </p>\n<p>“We’re both going to work together to see if we can get something done,” Trump said. “We agree that the sides are locked in, fighting, and sometimes you have to let them fight, I guess. Crazy. But he’s going to help us and we’re going to work together on Ukraine.”</p>\n\n<p>When asked about China’s history of purchasing Russian oil, Trump said, “we really didn’t discuss the oil” talking instead about trying to end the war. </p>\n<p>“He’s been buying oil from Russia for a long time. It takes care of a big part of China,” he said. </p>\n<p>A third issue that Trump said did not come up with Xi was approving the sale of Nvidia’s Blackwell chips to China. </p>\n\n<p>“We’re not talking about the Blackwell. That just came out yesterday,” the president said. </p>\n<p>Trump did say he discussed the issue of chips, generally, with Xi. </p>\n<p>“[China is] going to be talking to Nvidia and others about taking chips.”</p>\n</div>",

Amid significant employee concerns for medical privacy, Google retracted this policy, making disclosure optional. But worker medical privacy remains under attack nationally. </p>\n<p>Despite over <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/iif/#:~:text=The%20Injuries%2C%20Illnesses%2C%20and%20Fatalities%20%28IIF%29%20program%20produces,and%20the%20Census%20of%20Fatal%20Occupational%20Injuries%20%28CFOI%29.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2.5 million job-related injuries and illnesses annually</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2021/08/06/the-skyrocketing-volume-of-healthcare-data-makes-privacy-imperative/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">proliferation of patient medical information as technology grows</a>, injured workers often do not enjoy medical privacy protections that even prisoners can count on.</p>\n\n<p>This surprising denial of medical privacy is the result of our current approach to workers’ compensation. State constitutional and statutory privacy protections may not apply to workers who file for workers’ compensation. And federal medical privacy protections are judicially construed to exempt workers’ compensation processes. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>As a result, injured workers — many with severe disabilities — face a difficult choice: file for workers’ compensation benefits for their injuries or else protect their medical privacy. </p>\n<p>The situation is different for almost all other patients who seek medical care. The <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act’s privacy rule</a> requires that physicians who maintain electronic health or billing records must protect “<a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-C/part-160/subpart-A/section-160.103\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">individually identifiable health information</a>.”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Such information includes diagnoses and even demographic information, such as residential addresses, which may be used to identify a patient. Outside patient treatment, disclosures are often limited to the “<a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-C/part-164\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">minimum necessary</a>.” The goal is to protect patients from unwanted disclosures that may be stigmatizing or otherwise harmful.</p>\n<p>Medical disclosures may indeed prove very stigmatizing. Without protection, unrelated medical information such as mental health information could be prejudicially used to deny workers’ compensation claims. Stigmatizing information could be disclosed to third parties affecting future employment and insurability. Prejudicial communications may also occur between employers and their agents and treating physicians. </p>\n<p>In fact, these types of disclosures <a href=\"https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/ga-supreme-court/1525927.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">are routinely outlawed in medical malpractice</a> and employment discrimination claims due to the potential harms they may cause. </p>\n\n<p>Further, lack of medical privacy for workplace injuries is especially concerning because, in most states, workers cannot sue their employers for their injuries and may only obtain <a href=\"https://scholarlycommons.law.emory.edu/faculty-articles/305/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">compensation and medical care for workplace injuries through workers’ compensation</a>.</p>\n<p>How we arrived here is a <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3601896\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">complex story of federalism, judicial interpretation and state inaction.</a> </p>\n<p>States historically protected the privacy of their citizens and administered their own workers’ compensation systems under their 10th Amendment powers. Federal medical privacy regulations thus contain an <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/164.512\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">exception for workers’ compensation</a> that assumes states will address injured workers’ privacy through their own laws. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>This exception has been widely misinterpreted by courts as eliminating federal privacy protections if states fail to act. And states have not filled in the gaps of privacy protection. </p>\n<p>In a 2025 published <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5679122\">survey</a>, states failed to protect workers’ privacy in five areas: scope of disclosure, authorization for disclosure, ex parte communications (i.e., communications between opposing parties and treating physicians), notice of such communications and protective orders (i.e., orders issued by a court to limit the scope of disclosure).</p>\n<p>To be sure, states have the power to administer their own workers’ compensation schemes and must be able to process claims efficiently. Many states impose a limited window on obtaining medical information and distributing benefits. </p>\n\n<p>It would not be in the spirit of the federal medical privacy laws to let workers impede the administration of claims by failing to disclose information or delay its disclosure — perhaps by pressuring their physicians to limit or not disclose relevant medical information. But there is a significant difference between the efficient administration of workers’ compensation claims and voiding medical privacy requirements altogether.</p>\n<p>The solution could be judicial, legislative or both. Courts could adopt the federal privacy standards as a floor for privacy protections, perhaps following clarification from Health and Human Services that the exemption for workers’ compensation was not intended as a waiver of medical privacy.</p>\n<p>States could pass laws consistent with this standard, but responsive to their unique circumstances. If states fail to adopt privacy protections, the federal standards could apply. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n\n<p>Alternatively, states could promulgate their own standards and rules to protect privacy, informed by the best practices of some states.

Democrats hold majorities in both chambers. </p>\n<p>Top GOP leadership in the Virginia state legislature filed a lawsuit on Monday, which argues that the Virginia House of Delegates does not have constitutional authority over redistricting and takes issue with how the state legislature convened over the issue. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Republicans sought to temporarily halt the state legislature from moving forward with advancing their constitutional amendment while the merits of their case were being heard, though a circuit court judge declined that request, <a href=\"https://cardinalnews.org/2025/10/29/day-three-of-the-general-assembly-special-session-judge-declines-a-request-from-republicans-for-an-emergency-injunction-to-halt-redistricting-effort/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to Cardinal News.</a> However, the judge has set a Nov. 5 hearing date for a declaratory judgement trial. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares (R), who’s running a tight reelection bid against Democrat Jay Jones, <a href=\"https://www.oag.state.va.us/files/Opinions/2025/25-029-Kilgore-Issued.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">issued an opinion on Monday</a> arguing that Democrats wouldn’t be able to pass their constitutional amendment in time for the 2026 election.</p>\n<p>Virginia Democrats are looking to quickly tee up a constitutional amendment before voters ahead of the 2026 midterms. The goal for Democrats is to pass the constitutional amendment ahead of Election Day next week and quickly pass it again early next year during the start of the new legislative session before setting up a vote before Virginians soon afterward, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/us/virginia-congress-redistricting-midterms.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to The New York Times.</a></p>\n\n<p>Texas became the first state to fire off the first salvo in a broader redistricting war before next year’s midterms after much pressure from the White House and national Republicans.
