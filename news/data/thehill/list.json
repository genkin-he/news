            "description": "<p>CHICAGO (AP) — Crowds of mourners lined up in Chicago as cross-country <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jesse-jackson-memorial-funeral-south-carolina-washington-dc690a5153483549898d1dfc548015bb\">memorial services</a> for the Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. began Thursday in the city the late civil rights leader called home.</p>\n<p>The protege of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jesse-jackson-legacy-politics-race-ethnicity-7c88b376fbfc94697f2b57797edb24bf\">two-time presidential candidate</a> will lie in repose for two days at the headquarters of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition before events in Washington, D.C., and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jesse-jackson-lie-state-south-carolina-memorial-30e29a259b5f843c087e9201bd08b5c4\">South Carolina</a>, where he was born.</p>\n<p>Family members wiped away tears as the casket was brought into the stately brick building. Flowers lined the sidewalks where people waiting to enter watched a large video screen playing excerpts of Jackson’s notable speeches.</p>\n<p>“The outpouring of love and support received from around the globe has been abundant and deeply felt,” Jackson’s family members said in a recent statement.</p>\n<p>Jackson <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jesse-jackson-dies-43abb84d2ffc76d967f9a5596ebd0be1\">died last week</a> at age 84 after battling a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/chicago-jesse-jackson-hospital-c3a34dc716b6d90c61459f226f266f48\">rare neurological disorder</a> that affected his mobility and ability to speak in his later years.</p>\n<p>Remembrances have already poured in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jesse-jackson-famous-quotes-keep-hope-alive-76e116cbbfe5fc67adf34d86b72393b7\">from around the globe,</a> and several U.S. states, including Minnesota, Iowa and North Carolina, are flying flags at half-staff in his honor.</p>\n<p>But perhaps nowhere has his death been felt as strongly as in the nation’s third-largest city, where Jackson lived for decades and raised his six children, including a son who is a congressman.</p>\n<p>Bouquets have been left outside the family’s Tudor-style home on the city’s South Side for days. Public schools have offered condolences, and city trains have used digital screens to display Jackson’s portrait and his well-known mantra, “I am Somebody!”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jesse-jackson-dead-8ed88b7da0b911ed842f3c219cee77e8\">His causes</a>, both in the United States and abroad, were countless: Advocating for the poor and underrepresented on issues including voting rights, job opportunities, education and health care. He scored diplomatic victories with world leaders, and through his Rainbow PUSH Coalition, he channeled cries for Black pride and self-determination into corporate boardrooms, pressuring executives to make America a more open and equitable society.</p>\n<p>“We honor him, and his hard-earned legacy as a freedom fighter, philosopher, and faithful shepherd of his family and community here in Chicago,” Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Next week, Jackson will <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jesse-jackson-funeral-plans-capitol-rotunda-2910a8ff9df4531f9fa4ed76404a9887\">lie in honor at the South Carolina Statehouse</a>, followed by public services. According to Rainbow PUSH’s agenda, Gov. Henry McMaster is expected to deliver remarks, however the governor’s office said Thursday that his participation wasn’t yet confirmed. Jackson spent his childhood and started his activism in South Carolina.</p>\n<p>Details on services in Washington have not yet been made public. However, he will not lie in honor at the United States Capitol rotunda after a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jesse-jackson-funeral-plans-capitol-rotunda-2910a8ff9df4531f9fa4ed76404a9887\">request for the commemoration was denied</a> by the House Speaker Mike Johnson’s office.</p>\n<p>The two weeks of events will wrap up next week with a large celebration of life gathering at a Chicago megachurch and finally, homegoing services at the headquarters of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition.</p>\n<p>Family members said the services will be open to all.</p>\n<p>“His life is broad enough to cover the full spectrum of what it means to be American,” his eldest son, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/primary-illinois-chicago-jesse-jackson-election-ca6fd203e953a9c6352026542309572f\">Jesse Jackson Jr</a>., told reporters recently. “We only ask people to come and be respectful in context of the extraordinary life he lived.”</p>",

            "description": "<p>The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has kicked off its deposition of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in its investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. </p>\n<p>The deposition, taking place Thursday in Chappaqua, New York, comes after the former first lady and former President Bill Clinton reversed course earlier this month and agreed to sit for depositions to avoid being held in contempt of Congress for defying a Congressional subpoena. </p>\n<p>The former president, who had a documented friendship with Epstein and flew on his plane a few times in the early 2000s, is scheduled to sit for a deposition on Friday. </p>\n<p>“No one’s accusing, at this moment, the Clintons of any wrongdoing. They’re going to have due process,” House Oversight Committee chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) said in a press conference before the deposition started. </p>\n<p>“But we have a lot of questions,” Comer continued. “And the purpose of the whole investigation is to try to understand many things about Epstein. How did he accumulate so much wealth? How was he able to surround himself with some of the most powerful men in the world? Was he an asset for our government or any other government?”</p>\n<p>The Hill’s partners at NewsNation reported that the Clintons and the committee agreed to focus on five topic areas in the deposition: How the government handled its inquiry into Epstein and Maxwell; the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death; how the government can tackle sex trafficking; how Epstein and Maxwell worked with powerful figures to protect themselves; and possible ethics rules violations by public officials.</p>\n<p>Clinton spokesman Angel Ureña on social media prodded Comer and made a reference to no Republicans attending a deposition with Epstein’s former employer, billionaire Les Wexner, in Ohio last week — which Comer had missed due to oral surgery.</p>\n<p>“We congratulate the Republicans for showing up today and tomorrow for their first deposition in their Epstein investigation. Glad none of them had pre-scheduled oral surgery,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/angelurena/status/2027044530629874058\">posted on X</a>. “We hope they actually ask questions about Epstein. Up until this point, they haven’t asked a single one.”</p>\n<p>Hillary Clinton has said she cannot recall ever speaking to Epstein and met his co-conspirator Ghislane Maxwell a few times.</p>\n<p>Asked about that, Comer said: “There are a lot of questions pertaining to Secretary Clinton, with respect to Epstein and his involvement in the Clinton initiative and her relationship with Ghislane Maxwell.”</p>\n<p>Republican members in attendance at the deposition included Reps. Anna Paulina Luna (Fla.), Nancy Mace (S.C.), Lauren Boebert (Colo.), William Timmons (S.C.), John McGuire (Va.), Michael Cloud (Texas) and Eric Burlison (Mo.).</p>\n<p>On the Democratic side, Ranking Member Robert Garcia (Calif.) is expedited to attend along with some other Democratic members of the panel.</p>\n<p>The Oversight panel had voted on a bipartisan basis to subpoena the Clintons and several other former government officials last year, and spent months negotiating with the Clintons over how they could provide testimony about their links to Epstein.</p>\n<p>As they attempted to avoid depositions, the Clintons previous Clintons argued that they had already provided the committee with all the information they had about Epstein Maxwell, provided sworn statements that they had no knowledge of their criminal activities, and argued that the subpoenas were invalid. </p>\n<p>Later, they <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5718848-clintons-reject-deposition-offer/\">sought</a> to have Hillary Clinton provide a sworn statement instead of testifying, and sought to limit the former president’s deposition to a four-hour interview. </p>\n<p>In January, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5699996-democrats-clintons-contempt-vote/\">three Democrats on the panel voted</a> with Republicans to hold Hillary Clinton in contempt of Congress over the refusal to sit for a deposition. Nine Democrats voted to hold former President Clinton in contempt of Congress.</p>",

Of course, first and foremost is to prevent them from having a nuclear capability but there are also other threats that they represent in the region,” Thune said.</p>\n<p>Trump told lawmakers at the State of the Union address on Tuesday that Iran has resumed its nuclear weapons program and could soon develop a ballistic missile capable of reaching the United States.</p>\n<p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who has spoken to Trump recently, has urged him to take advantage of what he and foreign policy experts view as the growing weakness of Iran’s regime in the aftermath of a bloody crackdown on anti-government protesters.</p>\n<p>“I said, ‘Listen, the regime has never been weaker. They are teetering,’” Cruz told CNBC in an interview Tuesday, recounted, recounting his conversation with Trump.</p>\n<p>“We are at a moment … where in the next six months we could realistically see the regimes in Iran, Venezuela and Cuba all fall and we could see them replaced with governments that want to be friendly with America,” he said.</p>\n<p>“If that happened, that would be the biggest geopolitical shift since the fall of the Berlin Wall,” Cruz argued.</p>",

The federal government pays the full cost. So this should be an easy call for everyone, including Democrats.</p>\n<p>Instead, in a <a href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/01.26.26-Federal-Privatization-of-K12-Education-Report_final.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">report released by the Senate HELP Committee,</a> Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has urged states to reject the federal dollars. In doing so, he is reversing an argument he once made with moral clarity and political force.</p>\n<p>For more than a decade after passage of the Affordable Care Act, Democrats rightly excoriated Republican governors who refused to embrace Medicaid expansion. The logic was straightforward. When the federal government offers states money to help working families, ideological objections are illegitimate. Take the money and help your constituents. Anything else would be putting politics over people.</p>\n<p>Few Democrats made that case more forcefully than Sanders himself. “This is a federal program, which costs zero dollars,” Sanders <a href=\"https://www.idahocountyfreepress.com/opinion/guest-commentary/support-from-planned-parenthood-pelosi-makes-prop-s-medicaid-expansion/article_2f77b4fb-b37f-540c-8198-b660cb7417b1.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">argued in 2013</a>, criticizing Republicans who rejected Medicaid expansion. He was right. Refusing federal dollars to help struggling families was indefensible.</p>\n<p>Yet that is precisely what Sanders now recommends on education.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/01.26.26-Federal-Privatization-of-K12-Education-Report_final.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">his report</a>, Sanders urges states to reject the federal scholarship tax credit and misrepresents it as a voucher program designed to undermine public schools. The same logic he once condemned, refusing federal support for working families because you oppose the underlying policy, is now his explicit recommendation.</p>\n<p>Democrats should not follow him down this path.</p>\n<p>The federal scholarship tax credit is not a voucher program. Scholarship-granting organizations can fund tutoring, curriculum, technology, transportation and special education services for students who remain enrolled in public schools.</p>\n<p>A student struggling in math can receive targeted tutoring. A child with a disability can access specialized services their district cannot provide. A rural student can enroll in virtual courses unavailable locally. These supports strengthen public education. They do not dismantle it.</p>\n<p>Sanders’s report barely acknowledges this reality. It makes a passing reference to public school students being eligible and then proceeds as if the program exclusively serves students who leave public schools. That omission is not a minor oversight. It fundamentally misrepresents how the program works.</p>\n<p>The report also argues that private school tuition remains out of reach for many working-class families. In some cases, that is true. But that is not an argument for rejecting the program. It is an argument for strengthening it.</p>\n<p>When Medicaid expansion proved insufficient, Democrats did not call for repeal. They fought to expand coverage further. The same logic applies here. If funding levels are too low, the answer is to improve the policy, not abandon it.</p>\n<p>Sanders also warns that education choice creates a two-tiered system. This misses a basic reality. We already have a two-tiered education system, and we have had one for decades. Affluent families exercise choice every day through housing decisions, private tuition and selective enrollment. The families trapped without meaningful alternatives are overwhelmingly working-class, disproportionately Black and Latino, and concentrated in the very communities Democrats claim to champion.</p>\n<p>The federal scholarship tax credit does not create inequality. It addresses one of the most entrenched and least discussed drivers of inequality in American education: the massive gap in out-of-school enrichment spending.</p>\n<p>Wealthy families routinely spend thousands of dollars a year on tutoring, test prep, academic enrichment, summer programs, technology and specialized services for their children. These investments compound over time, accelerating learning and widening achievement gaps. Working-class families understand this. They want to provide the same kinds of support for their kids. Most simply cannot afford to.</p>\n<p>The federal scholarship tax credit is designed to narrow that gap. By allowing funds to be used for tutoring, supplemental instruction, special education services and other learning support, including for students who remain in public schools, the program gives lower-income families access to the very tools affluent families already deploy as a matter of course. That is not privatization. It is equalization.</p>\n<p>Twenty-seven states have already opted in. Working families in those states will soon have access to tutoring, special education services, and learning options that did not exist before. Families in states that refuse to participate will have none of that.</p>\n<p>Once broadly trusted on education, Democrats <a href=\"https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/have-democrats-lost-their-education\">have lost ground</a>. Swing voters and communities of color are increasingly open to alternatives the party refuses to offer. </p>\n<p>Democratic governors face a defining question. Are we the party that puts families first, even when it challenges our preconceptions? Or are we the party that protects institutional orthodoxy, even when families pay the price?</p>\n<p>Voters are watching. And as with Medicaid expansion, they will remember who opted in and helped them, and who did not.</p>\n<p><em>Jorge Elorza is CEO of Democrats for Education Reform.

            "description": "<p>Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) said Wednesday that the focus in Washington on surgeon general nominee Casey Means’s past recommendation for using psilocybin, commonly known as magic mushrooms, is a “red herring.”</p>\n<p>“Look, no way would I support people taking these psychedelics. I think it’s — it’s not part of my practice, it’s nothing that I could recommend. But I think that that’s a red herring, again,” Marshall, who is a physician, told NewsNation’s Blake Burman on “The Hill.”</p>\n<p>“Let’s focus on the fact that she’s a great communicator, that she has a great following, that she is leading this Make America Healthy Again fad that’s going on out there,” he said, adding she’s “going to be a great surgeon general.”</p>\n<div class=\"sailthru_shortcode\"> <div class=\"sailthru-signup-widget sailthru-signup-display-area sailthru-signup-hill-position-main\">\n<span class=\"sailthru-signup-widget-close\"><a href=\"#sailthru-signup-widget\">Close</a></span>\n<div class=\"sailthru_form\">\n<div class=\"sailthru-signup-success-message\" hidden=\"hidden\">\n<div class=\"icon\"></div>\n<p class=\"thanks\">Thank you for signing up!</p>\n<p class=\"watch\">Subscribe to more newsletters <a href=\"http://nxslink.thehill.com/join/7aa/signup\">here</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sailthru-subscribe-grid-display\">\n<div class=\"sailthru-signup-display-message-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"sailthru-signup-display-logo\"></div>\n<div class=\"sailthru-signup-display-message\">\n<span>The latest in politics and policy.\nDirect to your inbox.\nSign up for the Health Care newsletter</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<form action=\"#\" class=\"sailthru-add-subscriber-form\" id=\"sailthru-subscribe-id--1\" method=\"post\">\n<div class=\"sailthru_form_input form-group\">\n<input class=\"form-control sailthru_email\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Enter Your Email\" spellcheck=\"false\" type=\"text\" value=\"\"/>\n<div class=\"sailthru-add-subscriber-errors\"></div>\n</div>\n<input name=\"subsource\" spellcheck=\"false\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"\"/>\n<input name=\"listname_optin_source\" spellcheck=\"false\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"\"/>\n<input name=\"listname_optin_date\" spellcheck=\"false\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"\"/>\n<input name=\"listname_optin_sendstatus\" spellcheck=\"false\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"active\"/>\n<input name=\"sailthru_nonce\" spellcheck=\"false\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"ccd178788f\"/>\n<input name=\"sailthru_email_list\" spellcheck=\"false\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"Health Care\"/>\n<input name=\"action\" spellcheck=\"false\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"add_subscriber\"/>\n<input name=\"source\" spellcheck=\"false\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"sailthru_acqwid_inline\"/>\n<input name=\"lo_event_name\" spellcheck=\"false\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"\"/>\n<input name=\"reset_optout_status\" spellcheck=\"false\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"\"/>\n<input id=\"siteKey\" name=\"site_key\" spellcheck=\"false\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"\"/>\n<input id=\"sailthruToken\" name=\"captcha_token\" spellcheck=\"false\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"\"/>\n<span class=\"input-group-btn\">\n<button class=\"sailthru-signup-display-button\" type=\"submit\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</button>\n</span>\n</form>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>On Wednesday, Sen.

            "description": "<p>The Pentagon this week removed a senior military official who had served on the Joint Staff for about 90 days, returning him to a role in the U.S. Navy. </p>\n<p>Vice Adm. Fred Kacher, who became the director of the Joint Staff in December, was yanked from the post and will “return to service” with the Navy, a spokesperson told The Hill Thursday morning. </p>\n<p>“A distinguished and highly experienced surface warfare leader, Vice Adm. Fred Kacher will return to service with the United States Navy, after most recently serving as the Director of the Joint Staff,” a Joint Staff spokesperson told The Hill Thursday morning. </p>\n<p>It is unclear why Kacher was removed from the position. One source told Reuters, which first <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pentagon-removes-senior-official-joint-staff-post-sources-say-2026-02-26/\">reported</a> on the removal, that Kacher was not the right fit. </p>\n<p>Still, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine, praised the Vice admiral for his “dedicated service” to the Joint Force and “contributions” to the Joint Staff. </p>\n<p>“Since graduating from the United States Naval Academy, Vice Adm. Kacher has answered the call for every kind of selfless service imaginable,” Caine said in a statement to The Hill. “The Navy will be glad to have him back and we thank him and them for the loan of his leadership.”</p>\n<p>The director of the Joint Staff is a low-profile but influential role within the Pentagon. The senior official is part of key meetings and oversees the day-to-day operations of the Joint Staff. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.navy.mil/Leadership/Flag-Officer-Biographies/BioDisplay/Article/2236386/vice-admiral-fred-kacher/\">Kacher</a>, a career Surface Warfare Officer, is a three-star admiral who graduated with honors from the United States Naval Academy in 1990. He was most recently serving as a commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet.</p>\n<p>The move marks another shake-up within the Defense Deparment that has seen senior officals removed or forced into early retirement. CNN <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/25/politics/caine-iran-hegseth-trump\">reported this week</a> that Caine and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have at times disagreed over those moves. </p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Hegseth <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5741827-hegseth-ousts-top-army-advisor/\">ordered</a> Army Secretary Dan Driscoll to oust one of his top advisers, Col. David Butler. </p>\n<p>The removal of Kacher comes as the Pentagon has amassed a massive military presence in the Middle East as President Trump mulls authorizing strikes against Iran. </p>",
