Now, the rupture with the U.S. was complete.</p>\n<p>The Axis of Evil had found its modern-day South American upstart first in Chávez and then in Maduro. Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2006-09/venezuela-russia-sign-weapons-deal\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sealed a deal</a> with Chávez in 2006 to sell combat planes and helicopters to Venezuela.</p>\n\n<p>By late 2009, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna32809912\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chávez had secured</a> a “$2.2 billion line of credit for Venezuela to purchase [Russian] weapons including armored vehicles and surface-to-air missiles.” For all of Putin’s recent complaints against NATO member-states arming Ukraine, the Kremlin — 17 years ago — was arming Venezuela to counter neighboring Colombia’s decision “to give U.S. troops greater access to its military bases.”</p>\n<p>During that same timeframe, Chávez <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/aug/25/venezuela.china\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">solidified economic ties</a> with China. Beginning in 2006, he signed multiple trade agreements with Beijing and referred to them as a “Great Wall” protecting Venezuela from “American hegemonism.” By then, Chávez was openly calling President George W. Bush “the devil” and was establishing Venezuela alongside Iran, Syria and North Korea as junior members of the Axis of Evil.</p>\n<p>Chinese purchases of Venezuelan oil proved decisive in letting Maduro skirt past U.S. oil sanctions aimed at ending his regime. Likewise, it gave oil-hungry Beijing another source of oil imports.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Fast-forward to March 2022. Putin’s armies had invaded Ukraine. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was putting his finishing touches on his <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/what-is-irans-axis-resistance-which-groups-are-involved-2024-01-29/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Axis of Resistance</a> — Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis in Yemen. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was <a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/publications/strategic-comments/2022/north-koreas-missile-activity-in-2022/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">test-firing</a> an unprecedented number of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles over Japanese territory.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3533783-the-dangers-of-bidens-permissive-environment/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">permissive environment</a> that President Joe Biden had created was backfiring on him. He was looking for wins. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/11/04/1134421149/russias-invasion-has-prompted-biden-to-offer-reconciliation-to-venezuelas-presid\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fearing spikes in global oil prices</a>, Biden abandoned Trump’s maximum pressure approach against Caracas and naively sought to peel off Maduro from the anti-Western axis.</p>\n<p>Predictably, Maduro took everything he could from Biden and then stiffed him. Despite U.S. energy sanctions relief, Maduro continued to ban Maria Corina Machado (winner of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize) as a presidential candidate. By July 2024 the Venezuelan dictator was even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jul/21/venezuela-guyana-latin-america-tensions-rise-maduro-essequibo-border-dispute-support-elections-oil-indigenous\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">threatening to militarily seize</a> Essequibo, a province of Guyana where U.S.-based Exxon has invested billions. </p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/blog/bidens-tragic-mistake-venezuela-calling-new-election-instead-respect-election-opposition-won\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Elliot Abrams noted</a>, President Biden last year nonetheless “gave oxygen to the Maduro regime.” Ironically, it took a fellow leftist government in Brazil to keep Caracas in check — it <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c624m4kgrg3o\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">vetoed Venezuela’s bid</a> to join BRICS after Maduro’s flagrant theft of the 2024 election from winner Edmundo González.</p>\n<p>That was then. This is now. Trump’s maximum pressure campaign against Maduro is back, and this time, he is casting a wider net. The Pentagon’s show of force is also squarely aimed at Moscow and Beijing — an assertion of a modern Monroe Doctrine.</p>\n<p>The White House’s messaging to the Axis of Evil is as simple as it is blunt: hands off of the Western Hemisphere. As <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/01/12/opinion/trumps-greenland-push-about-growing-china-threat/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">we noted last January</a>, Trump began sending that message to Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping when he refused to rule out military force in Greenland or the Panama Canal.</p>\n\n<p>So far, neither Putin nor Xi appear willing to accept the message. Significantly, over the weekend, a <a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/global/the-americas/2025/10/28/heavy-russian-cargo-plane-lands-in-caracas-amid-us-venezuela-tensions/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Russian cargo plane</a> linked in the past to the Wagner Group and other Russian paramilitary companies landed in Caracas. In the past, these planes have been used to ship “rockets, warheads, and helicopter parts globally.”</p>\n<p>Notably, the cargo plane took a circuitous route from Moscow to Caracas “via Armenia, Algeria, Morocco, Senegal and Mauritania to Latin America.” Although its contents remain unknown, Putin’s messaging to Trump is obvious. He is willing to bring his <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6341171078112\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">global war against the West</a> to the Americas.</p>\n<p>Beijing is also weighing in on Trump’s buildup in the Caribbean. Mao Ning, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/venezuela-china-us-maduro-xi-jinping-trump-intl-latam\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said last week</a> that “China opposes any move that violates the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and a country’s sovereignty and security. We oppose the use or threat of force in international relations and the interference of external forces in Venezuela’s internal affairs under any pretext.”</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n\n<p>No doubt Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines wish China would live up to Ning’s laughably hollow statement and stop encroaching on their waters while maneuvering against Taipei.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Team Trump can book a win here.

Their relationship has been rocky at times as they’ve been critical of one another, only to later cool tensions as leaders of the world’s two biggest superpowers.</p>\n\n<p>The conference in South Korea came at the end of Trump’s Asia tour, in which he also traveled to Malaysia and Japan.</p>\n<p>Here’s what to know from the meeting:</p>\n<p><strong>Trump hails ‘truly great’ Xi meeting</strong></p>\n\n<p>The president said in a <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115462098072054944\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post on Truth Social</a> following the meeting that the “enormous respect” the two countries have for each other will only be enhanced based on what happened during his meeting.</p>\n<p>He said Xi authorized China to purchase “massive amounts of Soybeans, Sorghum, and other Farm products” that will support U.S. farmers. China had been boycotting these products in protest of the tariffs Trump had placed on the country.</p>\n<p>Trump said Beijing agreed to a one-year pause on new restrictions it enacted earlier this month on the export of rare earth materials and critical minerals, which has been the source of significant tension between Trump and China.</p>\n\n<p>The pause is another win for Trump on this issue as he has prioritized it since China put the restrictions in place. He signed several deals earlier in the trip with Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand and Japan to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5573672-trump-signs-asian-trade-mineral-deals/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gain U.S. access</a> to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5575798-trump-signs-critical-minerals-deal-japan/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">these materials</a> in response to China’s earlier action.</p>\n<p>Trump said on Truth Social that Xi also agreed for China to help stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.</p>\n<p>The president said he would accordingly cut in half the 20 percent tariffs he had imposed to pressure China to take more action to address fentanyl trafficking. That will bring overall tariffs on Chinese goods down from 57 percent to about 47 percent.</p>\n\n<p>Trump said China would also start “the process of purchasing American Energy,” and a “large scale transaction” may happen on the purchase of oil and gas from Alaska. He said the countries’ energy teams would be meeting to try to reach a deal.</p>\n<p>The meeting with Xi concluded after <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5580450-trump-xi-south-korea/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">less than two hours</a>, with the two leaders having a cordial exchange before Xi got into a car and Trump made his way to Air Force One to return to the U.S.</p>\n<p>The leaders seem likely to meet again, as a Chinese readout of the meeting stated that Trump would travel to China next year and Trump invited Xi to visit the U.S.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shadow of Trump’s nuclear announcement</strong></p>\n<p>The meeting began shortly after Trump made news by directing the Pentagon to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5580424-trump-directs-pentagon-to-start-testing-nuclear-weapons/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">resume testing nuclear weapons</a> on an equal basis to Russia and China.</p>\n<p><em>“Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,”</em> he <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115460423936412555\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said on Truth Social</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The renewal of nuclear weapons testing would end a more than three-decade hiatus on tests that started in 1992, just one year after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.</p>\n<p>Trump ignored a question from a reporter about the move while meeting with Xi.</p>\n<p>A recent Russian test of a nuclear-capable cruise missile received international condemnation, including from Trump, who called it “inappropriate” as he’s trying to reach a deal to end the war between Russia and Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Trump touted the “complete update and renovation” of existing nuclear weapons that he conducted during his first term. He said he “hated” to do it but had no choice.</p>\n<p>China has built up its nuclear arsenal in recent years, reaching <a href=\"https://fas.org/publication/nuclear-notebook-china-2025/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">about 600 warheads</a> this year, but it conducted its last nuclear test in 1996. Russia’s test of a nuclear-capable missile didn’t include a detonation.</p>\n<p>But the announcement could signal a return to an arms race and heightened tensions around nuclear weapons that hasn’t been seen in years.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other issues left alone</strong></p>\n<p>Trump and Xi did not announce any major breakthroughs on other issues that received heightened attention heading into the meeting.</p>\n<p>That includes the finalization of the sale of TikTok, which Trump has prioritized and suggested was close. The status of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as Chinese territory but the U.S. considers to be ambiguous, was also viewed as a key topic potentially for the agenda.</p>\n\n<p>Trump also didn’t make any announcement regarding the issue of Americans being unjustly detained in China. As many as 200 U.S. citizens are thought to be unjustly held.</p>\n<p>Ahead of the meeting, Republicans hawkish on China urged Trump to press Xi on releasing Americans unjustly detained and ending religious persecution of civil society activists, The Hill’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5579605-republicans-urge-trump-xi-prisoners/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Laura Kelly reported</a>. </p>\n<p>Trump also left for Washington without meeting North Korean leader <strong>Kim Jong Un </strong>on the trip, as had been speculated. Trump expressed openness to meeting with Kim while in Asia, but nothing was ultimately scheduled. </p>\n\n<p>The president commented on the conflict between North and South Korea, telling the South Korean prime minister that ending the standoff is “common sense.” But he said his and Kim’s schedules didn’t line up. </p>\n<p>Despite the lack of developments on these issues, Trump declared the multi-country trip a success.</p>\n<p>He also took a shot at Senate Minority Leader <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong> (D-N.Y.) for <a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/news/press-releases/leader-schumer-floor-remarks-on-donald-trump-selling-out-the-american-people-through-failed-trade-negotiations-with-china-announcing-democrats-will-force-more-votes-to-end-trumps-disastrous-trade-war\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">calling</a> Trump’s Asia trip a “total dud.” The president called Schumer’s comments “almost treasonous” on Truth Social.</p>\n\n<p><em>“Worked really hard, 24/7, took in Trillions of Dollars, and Chuck Schumer said trip was ‘a total dud,’ even though he knows it was a spectacular success,” </em>Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115462006949579771\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a>.</p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-30/chinese-markets-under-pressure-as-xi-trump-meet-lacks-surprises?embedded-checkout=true\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a>: <em>“Chinese markets under pressure as Xi-Trump meeting lacks surprise.”</em></p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-view-europe-2025-10-30/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Reuters</a>: <em>Trump-Xi meeting cools tensions.</em></p>\n\n<p>Follow The Hill’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/?p=5579438/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">live coverage of the day here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>NEW THIS A.M.:</strong> Democratic Rep. <strong>Mikie Sherrill</strong> (N.J.) and Republican <strong>Jack Ciattarelli</strong> are <a href=\"https://thehill.com/?p=5579199\">essentially tied in the latest poll</a> of the New Jersey gubernatorial race released this morning. </p>\n<p>The survey from Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill showed Sherrill leading by 1 point, 49 percent support to 48 percent, with 2 percent of respondents undecided. The 3-point margin of error means statistically the candidates are even. </p>\n\n<p>Sherrill’s lead grows to 2 points when undecided respondents are asked which candidate they’re leaning toward, still within the margin of error. </p>\n<p>The margin is closer than Sherrill’s lead of roughly 5 points in the <a href=\"https://polls.decisiondeskhq.com/averages/general-ballot-test/2025-nj-governor/new-jersey/lv-rv-adults\">Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ) polling average</a>, but it points to the increasingly competitive nature of the race as it comes down to the wire. </p>\n<p>Ciattarelli is trying to pull off an upset in the Garden State, building off his narrow 3-point loss in the governor’s race to Gov. <strong>Phil Murphy</strong> (D) four years ago. Ciattarelli outperformed polls that year to make it a much closer race than anticipated. </p>\n\n<p>The polls for this year’s race are closer than at this point in 2021, but Ciattarelli will still need to outperform again to pull off a win. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in the Big Apple, Democratic nominee <strong>Zohran Mamdani </strong>holds a comfortable <a href=\"https://thehill.com/?p=5579248\">25-point lead</a> over <strong>Andrew Cuomo</strong>, who’s running as an independent, in New York City’s mayoral race. Mamdani draws 50 percent support to Cuomo’s 25 percent while Republican <strong>Curtis Sliwa</strong> gets 21 percent and 4 percent say they’re undecided.</p>\n<p>The poll, also from Emerson, PIX11 and The Hill, is an improvement for Mamdani from the survey last month, which had him leading by 15 points. It further demonstrates the likelihood that Mamdani is on his way to being elected mayor of the country’s largest city next week. </p>\n<p>The Hill’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5580078-progressives-democratic-party-mamdani-ocasio-cortez/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Niall Stanage reports</a> how the race has become a microcosm of the internal struggles within the Democratic Party, including between the progressive and moderate wings and between the establishment and outsiders. </p>\n<p>Wednesday also marked the last weekly snapshot from DDHQ of the year’s key races ahead of Election Day on Tuesday. </p>\n<p>Other than the New Jersey and New York City races, the DDHQ tracker shows former Rep. <strong>Abigail Spanberger</strong> (D) in a <a href=\"https://polls.decisiondeskhq.com/averages/general-ballot-test/2025-virginia-governor/virginia/lv-rv-adults\">strong position to win</a> the Virginia gubernatorial race next week over Virginia Lt. Gov. <strong>Winsome Earle-Sears</strong> (R). Spanberger leads by almost 8 points on average. </p>\n<p>At the same time, Virginia Attorney General <strong>Jason Miyares</strong> (R) leads Democratic candidate <strong>Jay Jones</strong> <a href=\"https://polls.decisiondeskhq.com/averages/general-ballot-test/2025-virginia-attorney-general/virginia/lv-rv-adults\">by 3 points</a> in the competitive race, which for the past month has been dominated by the texts that Jones sent in 2022 wishing for violence against a political opponent. </p>\n<p>In California, Democrats are feeling optimistic about a ballot measure being voted on next week on whether the state Legislature should be able to redraw its congressional map. The measure, proposed by Gov. <strong>Gavin Newsom</strong> (D) in response to Republican efforts to redraw congressional lines, could add up to five additional Democratic seats in the House in next year’s midterms. </p>\n<p>A new tracker for the proposal, known as Proposition 50, shows <a href=\"https://polls.decisiondeskhq.com/averages/general-ballot-test/2025-ca-proposition-50/california/lv-rv-adults\">almost a 20-point advantage</a> for those in favor of the measure compared with those opposed. </p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/nyregion/nyc-immigrant-mayors-mamdani.html\">The New York Times</a>: <em>Mamdani wouldn’t be New York City’s first immigrant mayor.</em> </p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/new-jersey-governor-race-fundraising-20251029.html\">Philadelphia Inquirer</a>: <em>“New Jersey gubernatorial hopefuls rely on a small slice of the state for cash.”</em> </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3 Things to Know Today</h2>\n<p>1. <strong>The Supreme Court requested additional information</strong> <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5579726-supreme-court-trump-national-guard-chicago-request/?tbref=hp\">before it decides</a> whether Trump can deploy the National Guard in Chicago.

Meanwhile, Democrats are showing some signs of willingness to support measures to reduce the hurt while the shutdown is ongoing. </p>\n<p>Democrats have said they’re <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5576960-federal-workers-pay-during-shutdown/\">open to a proposal</a> from Wisconsin Sen. <strong>Ron Johnson</strong> (R) to pay all federal workers, including those furloughed and deemed essential, during the shutdown. One caveat is that it wouldn’t restrict Trump’s ability to continue layoffs during the shutdown. </p>\n<p>Democrats have said they need time to review it. </p>\n<p>Schumer also said <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5579847-senate-snap-wic-funding/\">Democrats would support</a> a bill proposed by Sen. <strong>Josh Hawley</strong> (R-Mo.) to continue to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) amid the shutdown. Timing is particularly key for that bill as those receiving benefits through the program are due to receive them for November on Saturday, but funding hasn’t been provided for the program. </p>\n<p>Still, Democrats also introduced their <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5579092-democrats-republicans-snap-funding-bills/\">own competing bill</a> to fund SNAP, leading Thune to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5579827-thune-blasts-democrats-snap/\">rail against</a> his Democratic colleagues on the Senate floor. </p>\n<p><em>“This isn’t a political game,” </em>Thune said. <em>“These are real people’s lives that we’re talking about. And you all just figured out 29 days in that, ‘Oh, there might be some consequences. There are people who’ll run out of money?’”</em> </p>\n<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has said it won’t use reserve funds to continue providing benefits for the 40 million Americans who use SNAP, as the funds should only be used in cases of natural disasters and not government shutdowns. </p>\n<p>The bills under consideration show how Democrats are wobbling a bit in the face of increased pressure to end the shutdown after almost a month, The Hill’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5577883-senate-democrats-government-shutdown-pressure/\">Alexander Bolton reports</a>. They show how Democrats are looking to ease the pain of the funding lapse, which is set to affect even more Americans starting in November, without a clear end. </p>\n<p>The Hill’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5579889-government-shutdown-americans-pain/\">Sudiksha Kochi reports</a> on six ways the shutdown could get worse for Americans without government intervention. </p>\n<p>But a continuing resolution to end the funding lapse still seems elusive, as even these proposals under consideration are just measures to reduce the pain of the shutdown but not end it. </p>\n<p>Bolton reports how Republicans and Democrats are each looking for offramps to end the stalemate as soon as next week but are unsure of how to do it. But one thing that is certain is that fatigue with the shutdown is only growing by the day. </p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/us/politics/democrats-republicans-shutdown-impasse.html\">The New York Times</a>: <em>“What can break the shutdown impasse?”</em> </p>\n<p><strong>FED LOWERS INTEREST RATES</strong>: The Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://thehill.com/business/5579280-federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rates/\">lowered interest rates</a> for the second consecutive time Wednesday, despite a lack of data about the state of the jobs market amid the shutdown. </p>\n<p>The Fed lowered rates by a quarter point, down to a range of 3.75 to 4 percent, marking its second interest rate cut this year. The agency had maintained steady rates for most of the year, despite pressure from the president, as inflation continued to be higher than the Fed’s target. </p>\n<p>As inflation eased and the job market weakened, the Fed shifted last month to reduce interest rates for the first time in 2025. Officials suggested in projections at the time that they would cut rates at least one more time this year. </p>\n<p>But this time is a bit different from September with the Bureau of Labor Statistics mostly shuttered because of the shutdown. That means the Fed had no federal jobs report for October to work off of, causing it to have a less clear view of where the economy currently stands. </p>\n<p>But the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel responsible for monetary policy, relied on a patchwork of private sector data, a delayed consumer price index and the Fed’s regular surveys of businesses and nonprofits for insight. </p>\n<p>The decision to cut rates still didn’t come as a surprise for Wall Street traders and analysts, despite the lack of a jobs report. </p>\n<p><em>“Although some important federal government data have been delayed due to the shutdown, the public and private-sector data that have remained available suggests that the outlook for employment and inflation has not changed much since our meeting in September,”</em> Federal Reserve Chair <strong>Jerome Powell</strong> told reporters. </p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/fed-rate-decision-october-2025.html\">CNBC</a>: <em>Powell raises doubts about cutting rates at next meeting.</em> </p>\n<p><strong>FEDERAL PROSECUTORS SUSPENDED</strong>: Two federal prosecutors were <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5579424-doj-prosecutors-jan-6-mob-trump/\">suspended hours after</a> filing a sentencing memo describing Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack defendents as a “mob of rioters.”</p>\n<p>Multiple outlets reported that Assistant U.S. Attorneys <strong>Carlos Valdivia</strong> and <strong>Samuel White</strong> were told Wednesday that they were suspended and were locked out of their government devices. It came after they filed a memo recommending a 27-month sentence for <strong>Taylor Taranto</strong>, who with other Jan. 6 defendents received a pardon earlier this year from Trump.</p>\n<p>Taranto is set to be sentenced on Friday for unrelated crimes, including threatening the National Institute of Standards and Technology and driving through former <strong>President Obama</strong>’s neighborhood with a van containing firearms and munition. </p>\n<p>The prosecutors only discussed the Jan. 6 attack in a few lines of their 14-page sentencing memo, saying that a “mob of rioters” attacked the Capitol and Taranto was accused of participating in the “riot” by entering the Capitol. The memo also included the signature of Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney <strong>Jeanine Pirro</strong>. </p>\n<p><em>“While we don’t comment on personnel decisions, we want to make very clear that we take violence and threats of violence against law enforcement, current or former government officials extremely seriously,”</em> Pirro said in a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/29/jan-6-prosecutors-case-leave-00627086\">statement</a> reported by multiple media outlets. </p>\n<p>The suspensions appear to mark the latest example of the administration reframing the events of the Jan. 6 attack. The president and other allies have repeatedly downplayed the violence of the day, with Trump having called it a “day of love” during the 2024 campaign. </p>\n<p>The Justice Department has also conducted a purge of prosecutors who worked on Jan. 6 cases.</p>\n<p><strong>MELISSA DEATH TOLL RISES</strong>: The death toll from Hurricane Melissa is rising as the storm <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-melissa-cuba-jamaica-flooding-winds-275a4d2d41a0ff3f382053865eefe295\">continues to move</a> through the Caribbean. </p>\n<p>Dozens are dead in Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti amid widespread destruction. The storm hit Jamaica first as a rare Category 5 hurricane, causing life-threatening storm surge and dangerous flooding. </p>\n<p>At least 25 people have been killed and 18 are missing in Haiti, according to the country’s Civil Protection Agency. Twenty of those killed lived in a southern coastal town where flooding caused homes to collapse. </p>\n<p>At least eight people have been killed in Jamaica. </p>\n<p>The storm moved through Cuba and the Bahamas and is now on track to reach Bermuda before going back out into the Atlantic Ocean. It has weakened but is still expected to bring strong winds, rain and storm surge.</p>\n<p>Relief efforts have already started in Jamaica with the storm passed, but more than three-quarters of the island nation lost electricity.

Most recently, she <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5577071-greene-johnson-health-care-plans-shutdown/\">criticized</a> House Speaker <strong>Mike Johnson</strong> (R-La.) for not offering details of an alternative health care plan that he said Republicans are working on. She also slammed Johnson for his decision to keep the House out of session for weeks while the shutdown has dragged on. </p>\n<p><em>“Johnson said he’s got ideas and pages of policy ideas and committees of jurisdiction are working on it, but he refused to give one policy proposal to our GOP conference on our own conference call,”</em> Greene said on X.</p>\n<p><em>“Apparently I have to go into a SCIF to find out the Republican healthcare plan!!!”</em> she added, referring to a secure area used to review classified material.</p>\n<p>Earlier on, she broke with Republicans in calling Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza a “genocide.” </p>\n<p>Sen. <strong>Ted Cruz</strong> (R-Texas) brushed off Greene’s comments on Wednesday, telling CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5578793-ted-cruz-marjorie-taylor-greene/\">people shouldn’t listen</a> to Greene. He also suggested that Greene has shifted leftward politically. </p>\n<p>It came after Ohio Sen. <strong>Bernie Moreno</strong> (R) called on Greene to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5578461-aca-subsidies-gop-debate/\">stop her public criticism</a> of Johnson. He said she should “present an option” rather than simply “criticize what other people are doing.” </p>\n<p>And Johnson himself also voiced exasperation earlier this month after Greene accused him of “hypocrisy” for his handling of controversy surrounding Rep. <strong>Cory Mills</strong> (R-Fla.). </p>\n<p><em>“I try not to react to what Marjorie Taylor Greene says every day,” </em>Johnson <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5560535-mike-johnson-marjorie-taylor-greene/\">said</a>. </p>\n<p>Greene has <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5550346-marjori-taylor-greene-split-republicans/\">defended herself</a> against the criticism, insisting that she hasn’t changed, even as several of her colleagues say they’ve been thrown off by her positions. </p>\n<p>To be sure, Greene is still one of Trump’s most passionate supporters and still demonstrates herself as a true believer in his MAGA and America First agenda. But the split from other Republicans in Congress is still notable. </p>\n<p><em>“I am 100 percent the same person today as I was when I ran for Congress,” </em>Greene said. </p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/29/marjorie-taylor-greene-shutdown-attacks-00628195\">Politico</a>: <em>Republicans are growing tired of Greene’s shutdown attacks.</em> </p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/atlanta/news/rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-urges-gop-to-go-nuclear-slams-partys-lack-of-health-care-plan-amid-shutdown-fight/\">CBS News</a>: <em>Greene calls for Senate Republicans to go nuclear to end shutdown.</em> </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Elsewhere</h2>\n<p><strong>WILDERS’S SETBACK:</strong> Dutch far-right leader <strong>Geert Wilders</strong>’s party sustained notable losses in the Netherlands’s general election, though the race to lead a governing coalition in the Dutch Parliament seems up in the air.</p>\n<p>Wilders’s right-wing populist Party for Freedom and the centrist Democrats 66 (D66) party appear to have tied with each party winning 26 seats each in the Dutch House of Representatives. The party that wins the most seats generally has the first opportunity to form a governing coalition, but what happens from here is unclear as no Dutch election has previously ended with two parties tied for the lead.</p>\n<p>Wilders said his party should play a role in forming a coalition if it is the largest in Parliament.</p>\n<p><em>“As long as there’s no 100% clarity on this, no D66 scout can get started. We will do everything we can to prevent this,”</em> he said.</p>\n<p>A scout is an official that a winning party appoints to look into forming a governing coalition, The Associated Press reported.</p>\n<p>Final results may not be clear for a few days.

Between Oct. 1 and Wednesday, the bureau <a href=\"https://reports.blm.gov/report/AFMSS/81/Approved-APDs-Report-Federal/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">approved</a> 474 permits to drill on public lands.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>That figure is fairly in line with previous months when the government was open, with 494 permits approved in August and 505 in September. </p>\n<p>Interior Secretary Burgum said during a recent event that the administration is scrounging up funding wherever it can to pay people for activities such as approving permits.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“Whether it’s a an entrance fee at a park, I’ve got nobody out there to collect that, whether it’s getting permits done, we’re grabbing any cash that was laying in any drawer to try to pay those essential people, including the people that can do the permitting, so that we can keep going,” Burgum said last week during an event at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.</p>\n<p>“We’re on a track way ahead of last year in terms of permitting, and whether it’s permitting, timber, grazing, oil and gas, infrastructure, easements… if it crosses federal land, we’re trying to do everything we can to not be handicapped,” he added.</p>\n<p>Interior Department spokesperson Kristen Peters said in an email that drilling permits were being processed “using associated filing fees.”</p>\n\n<p>She added that the Bureau of Land Management “collects a non-refundable processing fee when an oil and gas operator submits” a permit application.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Burgum mused that the government may also consider further layoffs as a result of the funding lapse. The Trump administration has broadly sought to lay off workers and shrink the size of the government, though mid-shutdown reductions in force have been halted by the courts.</p>\n<p>“What all of us are doing in the Cabinet is taking a hard look at ‘wow, maybe we actually don’t need all of these resources’” Burgum said while criticizing Democrats amid the ongoing shutdown.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>“So maybe they’re actually helping us get to the point where we can say, ‘We don’t need as many people; we don’t need as much cost.’”</p>\n<p>Interior in particular has sought to keep the Trump administration’s fossil fuel agenda moving forward, even as the shutdown hampers other government services.</p>\n<p>The contingency plan from the Bureau of Land Management, which falls under Interior, says that it is keeping some staffers on in order to “address the National Energy Emergency.”</p>\n\n<p>The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s plan, meanwhile, states that it will have employees available “to work on priority conventional energy projects.” The term “conventional energy” typically refers to fossil fuels. </p>\n<p>These priority projects include preparing the administration’s plan for offshore drilling for the years ahead, as well as “preparation for the anticipated calendar year 2026 offshore critical mineral lease sales and oil and gas development plans.”</p>\n<p>While offshore minerals mining has never been done at a large scale, the White House has <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5266159-trump-executive-order-deep-sea-mining/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">directed Interior</a> to set up a program for mining the ocean floor. The plan indicates that the administration plans to auction off those mining rights next year.</p>\n\n<p>When the shutdown plans were announced, Interior said on social media that it would “ensure permitting and other efforts related to American Energy Dominance are continued.”</p>\n<p>Critics argue that the government should not be continuing to fund fossil fuel approvals while cutting back essential services.</p>\n<p>“They can’t find money for SNAP benefits, but they can find money to keep permitting oil and gas drilling. That’s the priorities for this administration right now,” said Aaron Weiss, deputy director of the conservation group Center for Western Priorities, which has <a href=\"https://westernpriorities.org/2025/10/oil-gas-government-shutdown-tracker/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">published its own tracker</a> of the administration’s approved permits.</p>\n\n<p>President Trump has expressed a fondness for fossil fuels and antipathy toward renewables, particularly repeating his intention to “drill, baby drill.” </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Interior may not be alone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/climate/trump-government-shutdown-energy.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times</a> has reported that at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), staffers are working on a plan that would loosen restrictions on coal plants’ mercury releases.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/epas-staff-focused-on-existing-new-chemicals-despite-shutdown\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg Law</a>, a key EPA official said last week that staffers with jobs related to chemicals are still working during the shutdown.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been intentional and aggressive in establishing a structure to ensure EPA is focused on statutory obligations &amp; Presidential priorities, not the overreach of the previous administration,” an EPA spokesperson said in an email.</p>\n<p>“EPA continues to work to fulfill our statutory obligations, emergency response efforts, and Administration priorities,” the spokesperson added. “Despite the Democrat shutdown, EPA maintains essential operations because we are unwavering in our commitment to our mission of providing clean air, clean land, and clean water for all Americans. Moreover, we’ll continue to dismantle the Biden Administration’s wasteful and costly agenda.”</p>\n\n<p>The spokesperson added that the agency is operating according to its shutdown plan, under <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5531546-government-shutdown-epa-furloughs/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">which 89 percent of the agency’s staff</a> was slated for furlough.</p>\n<p>The shutdown plan states that issuance of “permits, guidance, regulations, and policies” will cease unless they are “necessary for exempted or excepted activities.”</p>\n\n</div>",

Phil Murphy (D-N.J.). Sherrill has the support of 49 percent of likely voters to Ciattarelli’s 48 percent, with 2 percent undecided. Because the margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points, the two are essentially tied in the race. </p>\n\n<p>When undecideds are asked which candidate they’re leaning toward, Sherrill’s support grows to 50 percent, while Ciattarelli receives 48 percent.

An Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill survey <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5519961-sherill-ciattarelli-poll-results/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">released in September</a> found the two tied at 43 percent, while a separate 11 percent were undecided.   </p>\n<p>Both candidates are trying to defy political headwinds. New Jersey hasn’t elected a candidate of the same political party for governor since 1961, a trend Sherrill is looking to overcome next week. Meanwhile, Ciattarelli is trying to put enough distance between himself and President Trump, whose approval rating, like Murphy’s, is low in the state. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>New Jersey in recent years has proven that Democrats can’t take the state for granted. Murphy narrowly beat Ciattarelli in 2021 by 3 percentage points, while former Vice President Harris won the state in November by about 6 points. </p>\n<p>The latest Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill survey, similar to the September survey,  shows that while Trump enjoys a higher approval rating than Murphy in the Garden State, he also has a higher disapproval rating than Murphy. </p>\n<p>The Thursday survey found Trump with a 45 percent approval rating and a 53 percent disapproval rating. The poll found Murphy with a 34 percent approval rating and a 50 percent disapproval rating.  </p>\n\n<p>More than half of respondents — 52 percent — said economy was the most important issue facing the state, followed by 14 percent who said threats to democracy and 11 percent who said housing affordability. </p>\n<p>The latest polling also points to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5561741-new-jersey-minority-voters-sherrill-outreach/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">some potential warning sign</a>s for Sherrill among Black and Hispanic/Latino voters. While the survey shows the New Jersey congresswoman seeing a higher percentage of support among the two groups compared to the September survey — 74 percent and 56 percent respectively in this latest survey — she’s winning both groups by a smaller margin in this latest survey compared to September. </p>\n<p>In the September survey, Sherrill won Black voters by 57 percentage points over Ciattarelli and 21 percentage points over Ciattarelli among Hispanic and Latino voters. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>In Thursday’s survey, Sherrill is winning Black voters by over 50 points and Hispanic and Latino voters by 15 points. </p>\n<p>Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, noted in a release there’s also a stark gender gap between the candidates. </p>\n<p>“Heading into Election Day, the gender divide in the gubernatorial election has solidified: men break for Ciattarelli by 16 points, while women break for Sherrill by 18 points,” Kimball said. “Since last month, Ciattarelli’s lead among men increased by four points, and Sherill’s lead among women grew by eight points.” </p>\n\n<p>The Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill survey was conducted between Oct. 25 and Oct. 28 1,000 respondents who have already voted or are very likely voters.

Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), a member of the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over health insurance tax subsidies.</p>\n<p>“Democrats have won a victory because we have demonstrated that we are fighting for health care for all Americans,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Some Democratic senators are privately speculating that if their party does well in the gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia scheduled for Tuesday, they can declare a political victory and begin to finalize the endgame for reopening government.</p>\n<p>Virginia, which will be a Senate battleground in 2026, is home to approximately 140,000 federal employees.</p>\n<p>Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (Ill.) says voters are “well aware” that their health insurance premiums are going up in 2026 in part because Republicans don’t want to extend the ACA’s enhanced insurance premium subsidies.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>“People are well aware of it on a personal basis,” he said of the Democrats’ argument that Republicans are driving up health care prices by not addressing the expiring subsidies.</p>\n<p>The other factor Democrats are weighing is pressure from the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents 820,000 federal and D.C. government workers, to pass a clean continuing resolution to reopen the government.</p>\n<p>Everett Kelley, the union’s president, said in a statement Monday that “both parties have made their point” and it’s time to pass a clean stopgap funding measure to “end this shutdown today.”</p>\n\n<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) told reporters Wednesday that moderate Democrats are looking for an “off-ramp” to end the shutdown and he’s willing to talk to them about the concessions he has already offered.</p>\n<p>Specifically, Thune has promised to negotiate with Democrats on extending the ACA subsidies once the government is open and has even offered them a vote on their own proposal to extend those tax credits beyond December.</p>\n<p>The GOP leader, however, has stuck to his position that he won’t negotiate specific health care policy concessions with Democrats while the government remains closed.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s just a question of whether or not they are at some point willing to take ‘yes’ for an answer,” Thune said of moderate Democrats who are eager to find a deal to end the shutdown.</p>\n<p>Thune is willing to cut a deal with Democrats to reopen government, but it’s going to consist of the proposals he has already offered them, such as getting the appropriations back on track, voting on the expiring subsidies and pledging to have a discussion on health care once federal departments and agencies are back up and running.</p>\n<p>“The stakes are getting higher, which we knew they would. As the shutdown drags on, it becomes more painful for more people,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>“What I’ve told them all along is as soon as they’re ready to open up the government that we will ensure that they have a process whereby they can have their chance to get their legislation voted on, their policies voted on,” he said of his interactions with Senate Democratic colleagues. “They’ve become more interested and I hope that continues.</p>\n<p>“They’re looking for an off-ramp,” Thune added, noting the expiration of SNAP benefits is creating a sense of urgency to find a deal to reopen the government.</p>\n<p>Moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) said bipartisan talks to end the shutdown have picked up significant momentum this week with the approaching expiration of SNAP benefits.</p>\n\n<p>“There is a good group of folks who realize we are well past time to have this behind us. This is not good. This is not good from a governance perspective. This doesn’t reflect well on anybody and it is hurting real people [in] real time so let’s figure out a way to end it,” she said.</p>\n<p>Murkowski said the disagreements that need to be solved to end the shutdown have been discussed at length.  </p>\n<p>“There have been enough of these pieces that have been talked through that if somebody can just diagram out how it all comes together and present, yes, I do think it’s possible” to end the shutdown next week, she told reporters.</p>\n\n<p>“There’s no great magic in how we get out of this. It’s the same stuff we’ve been talking about for months,” she said, citing a pledge to return to the regular appropriations process and begin working on a “temporary fix” to keep the Affordable Care Act subsidies from expiring.</p>\n<p>Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), a key moderate who has worked for weeks with Republicans to find a middle-ground compromise to reopen government, said Wednesday, “There have been a lot of positive discussions that have been helpful.”</p>\n<p>Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), another centrist in the middle of the talks to reopen the government, said there’s a lot of activity but declined to provide any details about progress made so far.</p>\n\n<p>“We’re continuing,” he said. “There’s still more that has to be done.”</p>\n<p>“Sometimes the path has twists and turns but it is a path in the right direction,” he added. “I think we’ll find an end eventually.”</p>\n<p>Recognizing the financial burdens felt by hundreds of thousands of federal workers, Peters has sponsored a proposal to compensate all federal employees for the paychecks they’ve missed so far during the shutdown.   </p>\n</div>",

They also look back to last fall, when then-Vice President Kamala Harris was cast by Republicans as left of the mainstream on issues such as trans rights.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The prime reason for excitement on the left right now is the New York City mayoral race, where democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani is a strong favorite to win. </p>\n<p>Mamdani, who if elected would become the first Muslim mayor of the nation’s largest city, was seen as a marginal candidate when he entered the Democratic primary as a little-known state assembly member. But a wave of enthusiasm from younger voters, the appeal of his call to make New York City more affordable, and the salience of his opposition to Israel’s actions in Gaza helped create an unlikely juggernaut. Mamdani defeated former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) by double digits in the primary.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Cuomo, a far more establishment-friendly figure, decided to continue his campaign as an independent. Some recent polls have <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5577368-mamdani-cuomo-new-york-poll/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shown the race tightening</a>, but almost all of them show Mamdani retaining the lead. Cuomo supporters have urged Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa to quit the race, but he has shown no inclination to do so.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3940\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Quinnipiac University poll</a> released Wednesday found Mamdani 10 points clear of Cuomo, with the backing of 43 percent of likely voters against Cuomo’s 33 percent. Sliwa was a distant third on 14 percent.</p>\n<p>It isn’t just the New York mayoral race that is buoying progressive spirits, however. </p>\n\n<p>In Maine, left-wing populist Graham Platner, an oyster farmer and military veteran, has caught the public imagination as he battles for the party’s 2026 Senate nomination against the establishment’s preferred candidate, Gov. Janet Mills.</p>\n<p>Platner, who has the backing of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), is 36 years younger than Mills. His fiery rhetoric and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5567179-who-is-graham-platner-maine-senate-candidate/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">no-nonsense demeanor</a> have drawn attention and support. </p>\n<p>Platner has also shown resilience despite a raft of <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5572407-platner-nazi-tattoo-controversy/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recent negative developments</a> in the shape of stories focusing on a chest tattoo resembling a Nazi skull and bones and distasteful old social media posts.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>“I am running as a Democrat, despite my party trying to destroy my life,” Platner <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5576350-platner-accuses-party-smear-campaign/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said during a town hall</a> event Monday.</p>\n<p>Another broad sign of progressive momentum comes with growing speculation that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) could <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5577641-mamdani-win-aoc-future/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">make a serious run</a> for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028. </p>\n<p>The New York congresswoman wowed a huge crowd at a Mamdani rally Sunday, where Sanders also spoke. She would clearly be a top-tier candidate if she enters the presidential race.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1898&amp;context=survey_center_polls\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">new poll of New Hampshire</a> likely Democratic voters, released Monday, put Ocasio-Cortez third, behind former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D).</p>\n<p>Put it all together, and it’s easy to see why the left is confident. </p>\n<p>“We have a movement of the masses,” Mamdani told his supporters at his Sunday rally.</p>\n\n<p>But while most on the left have their spirits lifted by these recent events, they know hard battles beckon.</p>\n<p>For a start, Mamdani hasn’t won yet. He has warned his supporters of the dangers of complacency in the campaign’s final days.</p>\n<p>Even if he does so, some progressive veterans note that the New York race has unusual contours.</p>\n\n<p>“In New York, it’s a particular kind of election that has much to do with a really good candidate [Mamdani] and, to put it mildly, a very flawed candidate [Cuomo] as well as a third whack-job candidate [Sliwa],” sad Jonathan Tasini, a progressive strategist and organizer.</p>\n<p>There are, to be sure, many different vectors of opposition to Cuomo — voters repelled by the numerous allegations of sexual misconduct against him, which the former governor denies; progressives who dislike his centrism; other critics for whom his conduct as governor during the COVID-19 pandemic remains a contentious issue. </p>\n<p>Sliwa, for his part, is best known for his role as the founder of the controversial Guardian Angels, a quasi-vigilante group.</p>\n\n<p>On the national level, Tasini argued, it was important for the left to be clear-eyed about the fact that fury at Trump among liberal voters and public support for a genuinely left-wing policy platform are two different things.</p>\n<p>But, he emphasized, there is at least fertile ground in which the left can plant its seeds — not least widespread economic anxiety and worries about the yawning inequalities in American life.</p>\n<p>“Regular people are saying, ‘How the hell does Elon Musk have all this money, and Jeff Bezos have all this money, and I can’t pay my bills, and my student debt is now in arrears, and I just can’t get by?’” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Voices on the center-left argue that the left is getting carried away. They note that, outside of New York, the two biggest races in the nation show centrist Democrats performing solidly. </p>\n<p>Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.) and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5569221-sherrill-leading-ciattarelli-by-5-points-in-new-jersey-gubernatorial-race-polling/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">are the favorites</a> to win <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5575047-virginia-governor-redistricting-election/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gubernatorial races</a> in their respective states.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, even if Mamdani wins in New York, much scrutiny will be on whether he can deliver on his campaign promise to make the city more affordable — and run the metropolis efficiently.</p>\n\n<p>The left may be on the rise. But its continued ascent is far from assured.</p>\n<p><em>The Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage.</em></p>\n</div>",

This places it behind countries like China, Spain and Russia.</p>\n<p>Where the U.S. scores poorly is transparency, receiving a four out of five in this category.</p>\n\n<p>“The government does not publicly disclose meetings/ interactions with the tobacco industry in cases where such interactions are strictly necessary for regulation,” noted the report.</p>\n<p>Chris Bostic, ASH policy director of action, noted that the tobacco industry’s involvement in the federal government probably doesn’t differ significant when compared to other industries, but said the industry’s core product is what sets it apart.</p>\n<p>“Countries ought to treat the tobacco industry differently because their product kills when used as intended. It shouldn’t be treated as just a normal industry,” Bostic told The Hill.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>In the past year, there has been a 24 percent jump in lobbying registrations by the tobacco industry. According to Bostic, this is likely being spurred by anti-tobacco legislative actions.</p>\n<p>“This fear for the other tobacco industry is the growing number of jurisdictions that are passing tobacco end game laws, and these are laws that are phasing out the sale of commercial tobacco entirely,” Bostic said. “From zero a few years ago, we’re up to 23 jurisdictions that have done that in the U.S. And so that’s a that’s a death sentence for the tobacco industry.”</p>\n<p>To combat the growing interference, ASH recommended raising awareness of the WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, increasing the number of years executive branch appointees before working as lobbyists and that more employees be included in this category.</p>\n\n<p>“Ever since they signed it in 2004 HHS has said that we’re in full compliance with the FCTC, and that’s just demonstrably false,” said Bostic. “And I’m not blaming any single administration. Every administration has said it, and they’ve all been wrong about that. And it’s a terrible shame because it’s the things that are in the FCTC are the blueprint for reducing death and disease from from tobacco.”</p>\n</div>",
