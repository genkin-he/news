He’s stayed busy by traveling to Asia, calling for prosecutions of his political enemies and leading a demolition of the East Wing to make room for his ballroom, among other actions. Meanwhile, lawmakers are frozen in negotiations, with no clear off-ramp to end the impasse. Washington has been wondering — when will the president get involved?</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>That might be now. Trump late Thursday called for Senate Republicans to employ the “nuclear option” by getting rid of the filibuster. That would allow them to reopen the government with just 51 votes, instead of the required 60-vote threshold needed to advance most legislation in the upper chamber.</p>\n<p><strong>What Trump posted</strong>: “It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD,’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option — Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!” the president wrote on Truth Social. 🔎 <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115466450476422202\"><strong>Trump’s full post</strong></a></p>\n<p>Trump for weeks has blamed Democrats for not voting to reopen the government by blocking the GOP’s stopgap bill. In his post last night, he argued that because Republicans are now in power, they should also nix the filibuster for all the benefits for his administration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How easy is it for Republicans to get rid of the filibuster?</strong>: Republicans hold a 53-seat majority<ins>,</ins> but it’s unclear if enough Republicans would support nixing it.</p>\n<p>Ending the filibuster would be a big deal — it would open the floodgates for the Senate, and many members of both parties are wary of taking that route. Though some lawmakers have expressed openness to making a change to reopen the government.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump may have some hurdles in his party: </strong>Senate GOP Leader <strong>John Thune </strong>(S.D.) has repeatedly said he doesn’t want to remove the filibuster, and Speaker <strong>Mike Johnson</strong> (R-La.) in a press conference this morning also warned of the downsides of nixing the filibuster. Johnson noted he hasn’t discussed this with Trump.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Meanwhile, Republicans are questioning the extended break:</strong></h2>\n<p>Speaker Johnson’s shutdown strategy hasn’t changed: keep the House out of session until the shutdown mess is sorted out. His reasoning? House Republicans did their job by passing a funding extension, so now it’s on Senate Democrats to pass it.</p>\n<p>Well, Johnson’s strategy has kept the House out of session for more than a month during a key stretch, and that is making House Republicans increasingly anxious.</p>\n<p>The House’s last vote was on Sept. 19, making this six-week-and-counting recess the longest since a six-week recess during the 2024 election.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How we know frustrations are building</strong>: Rep. <strong>Marjorie Taylor Greene</strong> (R-Ga.), who has been critical of Republicans’ shutdown strategy since it began, confronted Johnson earlier this week. And Rep. <strong>Dan Crenshaw</strong> (R-Texas) questioned Johnson’s strategy, a source confirmed to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5582283-republicans-house-shutdown-recess-johnson/\">The Hill</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Brace yourselves for when they do return</strong>: “One House Republican familiar with leadership conversations said that members should brace for a jam-packed schedule when the chamber returns — likening it to ‘two-a-day’ football practices. ‘It’s not going to be business as usual. It’s going to be long nights, long days,’ the GOP member said.”</p>\n<p>One early order of business will be swearing in Rep.-elect <strong>Adelita Grijalva</strong> (D-Ariz.). Democrats have repeatedly slammed Johnson for not swearing her in, though he says Democrats must first vote to reopen the government.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read Emily Brooks’s reporting: </strong><a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5582283-republicans-house-shutdown-recess-johnson/\"><strong>‘House Republicans grow anxious about Speaker Johnson’s extended shutdown recess’</strong></a><strong></strong></p>\n<p>💬 <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5581955-live-updates-trump-government-shutdown/\"><strong>Follow today’s live blog</strong></a></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Will food stamps end at midnight?:</strong></h2>\n<p>The Senate left town<ins>,</ins> and the House is out. That means that without any last-minute intervention, food stamp benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will end on Saturday.</p>\n\n<p><strong>There’s one last chance to save them</strong>: A federal judge is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/us/politics/federal-judge-food-stamps.html?smid=url-share\">expected to decide today</a> whether the Trump administration must continue to fund the food stamp program.</p>\n<p>The Hill’s <strong>Alexander Bolton</strong> reports that the lapse in food assistance is forming cracks among Senate Republicans. Republicans have been unified so far, but Saturday’s freeze on the food stamp benefits for nearly 42 million Americans, including millions in Republican-led states, has driven a wedge in the GOP.</p>\n<p>Sen. <strong>Josh Hawley</strong> (R-Mo.) is trying to keep SNAP funded by introducing a bill to keep the benefits intact. There are already 14 Republican co-sponsors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why are some Republicans not on board with Hawley’s plan?</strong>: They blame the shutdown on Democrats. “They think Democrats, in blocking the House GOP funding bill, are the ones to blame for any lapse in SNAP.”  They want to keep pressure on Democrats to end the shutdown.</p>\n<p><strong>Read Bolton’s reporting: </strong><a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5582366-snap-benefits-lapse-senate/\"><strong>‘Republicans battling behind scenes over funding SNAP during shutdown’</strong></a><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>HOW CAN YOU HELP?</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Donating money to your local food bank is the best way to help SNAP recipients who need help putting food on their tables.

Once that stage is reached, however, the change is extremely difficult to reverse. And aspiring authoritarians use other excesses, like a cowed legislature and judiciary, to lock in their power.”</p>\n<p><strong>Does the Times think we’ve already reached an autocracy?</strong>: No. “Our country is still not close to being a true autocracy, in the mold of Russia or China,” the editorial board argues. “But once countries begin taking steps away from democracy, the march often continues. We offer these 12 markers as a warning of how much Americans have already lost and how much more we still could lose.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the editorial: </strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/31/opinion/trump-autocracy-democracy-report.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare\"><strong>‘Are we losing our democracy?’</strong></a><strong></strong></p>\n<p>The Atlantic published reporting today with a similar premise: “It’s getting ever harder to avoid connecting the authoritarian dots.”</p>\n<p><strong>Excerpt</strong>: “Trump is in the process of building his own paramilitary force. He is invoking wartime powers to deport people without due process, even suggesting that American citizens may be sent to foreign prisons. He has deployed National Guard troops to cities over the objections of local officials. In a speech to American troops in Japan, he warned: ‘If we need more than the National Guard, we’ll send more than the National Guard.’ Trump has signaled that he is open to invoking the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law that allows the president to deploy the military in the United States. And he has claimed, without legal justification, that he has the right to order the military to summarily kill people suspected of smuggling drugs on boats off the coast of South America.”</p>\n<p><strong>Read: ‘</strong><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/10/trump-authoritarianism/684773/\"><strong>Trump’s Plan Is Now Out in the Open’</strong></a><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>QUICK HITS</strong>:</p>\n<p>— ABC and ESPN <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5582925-youtubetv-disney-networks-dispute/\">have been taken off YouTube<ins> </ins>TV</a> over a carrier dispute with Disney.</p>\n<p>— Ticket sales at the Kennedy Center <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/10/31/kennedy-center-sales/\">have plummeted</a> since President Trump took it over, according to The Washington Post.</p>\n<p>— NASA tested a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/transportation/5583017-nasa-supersonic-jet-travel-time/\">low-volume supersonic jet</a> that could cut air travel time.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE READS:<br/></strong><strong><br/></strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/us/politics/supreme-court-kagan-jackson-liberal-justices.html\"><strong>The New York Times</strong></a>: The Debate Dividing the Supreme Court’s Liberal Justices</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/colleges-face-a-financial-reckoning-the-university-of-chicago-is-exhibit-a-8918b2b0?mod=hp_lead_pos7\"><strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong></a>: Colleges Face a Financial Reckoning.

One cannot yell “fire” in a crowded movie theater because of public safety concerns.  </p>\n<p>Universities regularly ban speakers from campus because they are deemed to be too controversial and risk inciting violence. These concerns, while not patently unreasonable, must be more than thinly veiled attempts to control students’ thinking and squash debate.

I regularly queried students about whether they felt pressured to answer in-class or examination questions to placate the political or social leanings of their professors. On average, 85 percent answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p>The litmus test is whether the educator’s public statements are likely to inhibit the free exchange of ideas in the classroom. An affirmative answer to this question is presumptively disqualifying because it undermines the educational mission.</p>\n<p>The issue is not whether professors are free to express their views; they are. The issue is whether there can still be a reasonable expectation of a classroom experience in which students can express their own, possibly contrary views, with impunity. </p>\n\n<p>This is a slippery slope and gray areas abound.

A professor who poses thoughtful questions and is prepared to weigh in objectively on either side of the issue can encourage enlightening debate even on the most controversial of issues. </p>\n<p>The problem arises when educators impose their own opinions and use them suppress critical discourse.</p>\n<p>I presented the Summers case to my MBA students with some modification. I asked them to assume there is credible empirical evidence that men have a lower mathematical aptitude than women. I then asked them why economists and university administrators would be interested in the answer. </p>\n\n<p>One student noted that if it is known these differences exist, it would be more efficient to have more women in departments with a strong quantitative component and more men in departments that are less quantitatively oriented. The discussion then turned to the importance of role models and whether efficiency should be dispositive.</p>\n<p>I used the Socratic Method to examine other politically charged issues, including affirmative action and <a href=\"https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2022/03/80774/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">diversity</a>.

What was supposed to be a pep talk from the former president <a href=\"https://x.com/VigilantFox/status/1983922315520844208\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">turned into something else entirely</a>.  <br/> <br/>“He went on to talk about a group of people in Pennsylvania who were saying bad things about me, because they heard I was saying bad things about him. And when I hung up the phone — it was just unbelievable, and yes I was angry. Just deeply disappointed”  </p>\n\n<p>Now imagine that — you’re about to go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump on live television, and your predecessor’s biggest concern becomes whether you like him. That’s not exactly the pre-game energy you want heading into a political heavyweight match.  </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Harris explained why that call hit wrong.  </p>\n<p>“There were only two people in the world that other than me that have debated this guy. Hillary Clinton and him. And you know what it’s like, going into a debate with the stakes being that high and Trump hadn’t agreed to another debate. The stakes were so high.”  </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>She described the moment as “so unnecessary.”  </p>\n<p>And she’s right — timing matters. Especially in politics, when every second is an opportunity to either gain ground or lose momentum. The last thing any candidate needs before a national debate is a lecture about gossip in Pennsylvania.  </p>\n<p>This story came up as Harris promoted her new book, “107 Days,” where she reflects on her short-lived 2024 campaign, her frustrations with Biden, and the lessons she’s still processing. She says she and Biden remain friends; he even called for her birthday. But she admits there were times when he angered her.  </p>\n\n<p>Harris also hints she might not be done with politics just yet. She’s open to running again — though 2024 clearly left a bitter taste in the mouths of many Democrats. Garry South, a Democratic strategist, told The Hill the book shows she’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5581973-carville-criticizes-harris-book/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“blaming everyone but herself for her loss.”</a>  </p>\n<p>In “107 Days,” Harris writes, “Of all the people in the White House, I was in the worst position to make the case that he should drop out. … He would see it as naked ambition, perhaps as poisonous disloyalty, even if my only message was: Don’t let the other guy win.”  </p>\n<p>And that right there — that tension between loyalty and leadership — is what defines so much of today’s Democratic struggle. Harris isn’t wrong for feeling frustrated. But if 2024 taught us anything, it’s that frustration doesn’t win elections: connection does.  </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>While I believe Kamala ran a solid campaign with the short time she had, I can still critique that she leaned on star power more than she spoke to the average American. Democrats can’t afford to keep fighting ghosts of campaigns past. And they certainly can’t afford to continue bringing Biden up at every turn. The future depends on authenticity, not applause.  </p>\n<p>At the end of the day, blaming Biden won’t fix the Democratic message. As I always tell my Republican friends, finger-pointing might win arguments, but it doesn’t win votes. </p>\n<p><em>Lindsey Granger is a NewsNation contributor and co-host of The Hill’s commentary show “Rising.” This column is an edited transcription of her on-air commentary.</em> </p>\n\n</div>",

Where there is less agreement is the debate over saturated fat. </p>\n<p>Leading health authorities like the American Heart Association argue that it is a<a href=\"https://www.heart.org/-/media/files/healthy-living/company-collaboration/inap/fats-white-paper-ucm_475005.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> major driver of heart disease</a>. Others, including a growing number of wellness influencers, claim it has been<a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9794145/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> unfairly maligned</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But amid the fierce debates over whether butter is better than seed oil, one critical issue has been largely ignored: the large number of harmful chemical contaminants hiding in animal fat.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>This conversation is especially urgent with imminent release of the 2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and statements by Kennedy, calling for<a href=\"https://katiecouric.com/health/body-and-soul/are-seed-oils-bad-for-you/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> more fat from animal sources like beef tallow</a> and <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/rfk-jr-expand-role-dairy-dietary-guidelines-science/story?id=123831525\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">full-fat whole milk products</a>, which was echoed in the recently released<a href=\"https://time.com/7316536/is-whole-milk-healthy-maha/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> MAHA Commission report</a>. Although there is broad agreement on the need to cut down on ultra-processed foods made with seed oils, Kennedy and other MAHA advocates pushing full fat animal products are failing to acknowledge the toxic load that comes with industrial meat and dairy products, which make up<a href=\"https://insideanimalag.org/percentage-of-farmed-animals-on-factory-farms/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> at least 95 percent</a> of the animal foods people eat. </p>\n<p>The MAHA Commission’s Report identified cumulative chemical exposure as a key driver of the rise in childhood chronic disease, but fat’s capacity to store environmental toxins means that eating more fat increases one’s exposure to those very same chemicals. Dioxins, heavy metals like mercury and cadmium, and pesticide residues build up in the fatty tissues of animals, especially those raised in industrial settings. These risks have been well-documented by the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/dioxin/learn-about-dioxin\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>, and National Institutes of Health.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Dioxins are among the most toxic substances known to science. According to <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/dioxin\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the EPA</a>, more than 90 percent of typical human exposure is through the intake of animal fats. Dioxins are produced as byproducts of waste incineration and industrial manufacturing, and they concentrate in animal fat through contaminated feed and environmental exposure. Long-term exposure to even low levels of dioxins is linked to <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/dioxin/learn-about-dioxin\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cancer, immune dysfunction</a> and <a href=\"https://iris.epa.gov/ChemicalLanding/&amp;substance_nmbr=1024\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reproductive</a> and development harm. That means, a family’s Sunday roast, or the burger a teenager grabs after practice, is the primary route by which these poisons enter the body.</p>\n<p>Heavy metals like cadmium and mercury also concentrate up the food chain, particularly in organ meats, dairy and seafood. A tuna sandwich tucked into a child’s lunchbox or a glass of milk poured at breakfast may seem wholesome, but these can deliver trace metals the body struggles to eliminate. Add to that insecticides like malathion, which is used widely on genetically engineered corn for animal feed.</p>\n<p>Those chemicals don’t just stay in the soil — they accumulate in animal tissue, fat and milk, eventually <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38128207/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ending up on our plates</a> and in our bodies and those of our children. A comprehensive<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38128207/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 2024 study</a> found that meat and dairy contribute significantly to human pesticide exposure, with livestock and poultry accounting for 39 percent of overall exposure and whole milk and dairy products accounting for 22 percent of all exposures.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the most dangerous pesticides, such as DDT and other persistent organic pollutants, don’t simply vanish when they’re banned. They are lipophilic, meaning they dissolve and store in fat, <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxguides/toxguide-35.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">especially animal fats</a>. Even decades after DDT was banned, it is still found in measurable levels in<a href=\"https://toxinfreeusa.org/pesticides-in-butter-getting-worse-not-better/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> butter</a>, meat and<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mcn.13759\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> breast milk</a>.</p>\n<p>For example, in 2023, out of 531 butter samples,<a href=\"https://www.afdo.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/800-1615-Food-Chemistry-101-Jason-Kong.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> DDE (a DDT metabolite) was detected in 188 samples (35 percent)</a> and in 2021, bifenthrin (a neurotoxic insecticide) was found in 37 percent of butter samples tested. Essentially, foods that should be simple staples, such as a pat of butter on your toast, can still carry the chemical legacy of dangerous farming practices from generations ago.</p>\n<p>Worse still, these chemicals don’t act alone. Meat and dairy often contain traces of multiple pesticides, antibiotics, and veterinary drugs like ractopamine — creating a toxic cocktail whose combined effects scientists are only beginning to understand. The FDA has approved over<a href=\"https://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/files/animal_drug_10_26_77838.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 450 drugs</a> for use in industrial livestock systems. Some, like ractopamine, are banned in China, the EU and many countries around the world. This isn’t about a single bad actor, it’s about layering risks on top of each other — and hoping for the best. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>If we are serious about health, we need to stop exposing animals — and, by extension, people, especially babies and children — to a cocktail of persistent industrial pollutants and animal drugs. That means advancing policies that support farmer transitions away from chemical-intensive factory farming to diversified, regenerative systems as well as increased production of organic and plant-based foods, including animal feed, while reducing toxic chemical use across agriculture. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>Given all the pollutants that accumulate in the fatty tissue of animals, we also need dietary guidelines that educate consumers about these risks and urge Americans to eat more whole plant-based proteins, fewer factory-farmed animal foods and more organic, pasture-raised meat and dairy products produced without harmful pesticides, antibiotics and growth-promoting drugs.</p>\n<p>This is especially important since these guidelines influence the foods offered to younger school children, who are most vulnerable to the cumulative impacts of these toxic chemicals, as President Trump’s MAHA Commission report has acknowledged. The truth is, whether you believe that saturated fat is or is not a desirable nutrient, everyone should be concerned about the contaminants that accumulate in the fatty tissues of animals — and in all of us. </p>\n\n<p><em>Kari Hamerschlag is deputy director of food and agriculture at Friends of the Earth and Liam Gray is founder and executive director of Wilberforce Institute, a nonprofit profit organization focused on free market and pro-liberty solutions to end animal suffering</em>.</p>\n</div>",

The National Symphony Orchestra’s “An Evening of Beethoven” had more than 2,000 seats available on the day-of all three shows, the outlet reported.</p>\n<p>“Depressed ticket sales not only cause a shortfall in revenue; they also bode unfavorably for future fundraising revenue,” Michael Kaiser, a former president of the Kennedy Center, wrote in an email to the Post, after reviewing outlet’s findings. </p>\n<p>“The vast majority of donors are ticket buyers who are anxious to enhance their relationships with the organization by making contributions in addition to paying for their tickets,” he said. “We had 40,000 generous individual donors by the time I left the Center in 2014.

He did not receive any pushback from Carlson.”</p>\n\n<p>Carlson on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efBB0D4tf1Y\">podcast</a> said that he wanted to understand Fuentes’s views, saying that while he also questioned the U.S. relationship with Israel, to say “well actually it’s the Jews” goes “against my Christian faith.”</p>\n<p>After the interview, a post on X started circulating that said the Heritage Foundation had <a href=\"https://x.com/jasonahart/status/1983655537784058064?s=46&amp;t=s27cFPVMxDTz4BmWHLglMQ\">scrubbed</a> a reference to Carlson from a donation page. </p>\n<p>Roberts, in a post accompanying his video, said he wanted to put to rest speculation that Heritage was distancing itself from Carlson.
