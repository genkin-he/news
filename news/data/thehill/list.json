Tim Kaine (D-Va.), <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?si=Jqm6Hr3u6i_3uOPk&amp;v=o_lRpFmmVsM&amp;feature=youtu.be\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said that he’s a “strong supporter”</a> of Hawley’s bill because it’s aligned with Democrats’ PRO Act — a wish-list of union leaders’ priorities.</p>\n\n<p>Cassidy <a href=\"https://www.help.senate.gov/hearings/labor-law-reform-part-2-new-solutions-for-finding-a-pro-worker-way-forward\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">explained this policy</a> in real-world terms, saying that it would “take workers out of the process by removing the need to ratify a contract.” He put a finer point on it by saying that if the government mandated arbitration, workers “cannot reject” the resulting agreement, even though it would be binding on them. “What would happen,” he asked, “if workers lost that ability to ratify a contract?”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The union official didn’t mince words: “that would be removing the democracy from the workplace.” Then he doubled down: Such democracy “is the whole point of the union,” he said, because it gives workers “a say.” In a few short words, that union official, a Democratic witness, rejected one of the Democrats’ and labor’s biggest policy priorities.</p>\n<p>I was testifying in the same hearing, and I struggled to contain my surprise. True, Cassidy had not mentioned the Faster Labor Contracts Act by name. Nor did he call out the PRO Act. But he didn’t have to. By focusing on the actual policy instead of the bill name, he highlighted how unjust both Hawley’s proposal and that of the Democrats really is. Each hurts workers in the name of helping them. When you strip away the window dressing, even a shop steward won’t accept it. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>And this was a shop steward from Hawley’s home state of Missouri, brought in by Democrats to support their agenda, including Hawley’s bill. If he can’t support that anti-democratic reform, who can?</p>\n<p>The timing couldn’t have been more awkward. Just a few weeks earlier, the Senate had held another hearing that <a href=\"https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/40740aa3-053a-9b1c-c218-ae057606d3e8/OBrien%20Testimony.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">prominently featured a union president</a> endorsing Hawley’s bill. Yet awkward or not, the shop steward is right on the money. There’s nothing fair or democratic about taking away workers’ right to vote on contracts that dictate their jobs. There is nothing fair or democratic in letting government impose its will regardless of workers’ wishes.</p>\n<p>And a union shop steward isn’t the only one who knows it — Americans do, too. <a href=\"https://www.uschamber.com/employment-law/what-american-voters-really-think-about-unions\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">New polling</a> from the Chamber of Commerce shows that 90 percent of voters oppose government-mandated union contracts that workers don’t approve. It makes sense: It’s hard to support the gutting of workplace democracy.</p>\n\n<p>That’s not to say that workers don’t need stronger protection of their rights. They most certainly do. But a real reform wouldn’t put government in control at the back end of a union election. The better path is to put workers in control at the front end.</p>\n<p>Workers really need the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4154/text\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Employee Rights Act</a>, which protects them in numerous ways. To start, it guarantees that unionization elections use the secret ballot, preventing the public “card check” voting system that encourages intimidation and harassment. It also lets workers decide what contact information union organizers receive, protecting their privacy and that of their families. </p>\n<p>These are just a few of the pro-worker reforms in the Employee Rights Act, which Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) introduced in the Senate in mid-October. This bill will ensure that workers’ voices are truly heard.</p>\n<p>The Faster Labor Contracts Act and the PRO Act would do the opposite, stifling workers’ voices at the hands of the federal government. This isn’t the pro-worker reform it’s chalked up to be. But don’t take it from me. Take it from the union official who admitted the truth — this union demand is anti-worker and undemocratic.</p>\n<p><em>F.

He’s stayed busy by traveling to Asia, calling for prosecutions of his political enemies and leading a demolition of the East Wing to make room for his ballroom, among other actions. Meanwhile, lawmakers are frozen in negotiations, with no clear off-ramp to end the impasse.

Trump late Thursday called for Senate Republicans to employ the “nuclear option” by getting rid of the filibuster. That would allow them to reopen the government with just 51 votes, instead of the required 60-vote threshold needed to advance most legislation in the upper chamber.</p>\n<p><strong>What Trump posted</strong>: “It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD,’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option — Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!” the president wrote on Truth Social. 🔎 <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115466450476422202\"><strong>Trump’s full post</strong></a></p>\n<p>Trump for weeks has blamed Democrats for not voting to reopen the government by blocking the GOP’s stopgap bill. In his post last night, he argued that because Republicans are now in power, they should also nix the filibuster for all the benefits for his administration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How easy is it for Republicans to get rid of the filibuster?</strong>: Republicans hold a 53-seat majority<ins>,</ins> but it’s unclear if enough Republicans would support nixing it.</p>\n<p>Ending the filibuster would be a big deal — it would open the floodgates for the Senate, and many members of both parties are wary of taking that route. Though some lawmakers have expressed openness to making a change to reopen the government.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump may have some hurdles in his party: </strong>Senate GOP Leader <strong>John Thune </strong>(S.D.) has repeatedly said he doesn’t want to remove the filibuster, and Speaker <strong>Mike Johnson</strong> (R-La.) in a press conference this morning also warned of the downsides of nixing the filibuster. Johnson noted he hasn’t discussed this with Trump.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Meanwhile, Republicans are questioning the extended break:</strong></h2>\n<p>Speaker Johnson’s shutdown strategy hasn’t changed: keep the House out of session until the shutdown mess is sorted out. His reasoning? House Republicans did their job by passing a funding extension, so now it’s on Senate Democrats to pass it.</p>\n<p>Well, Johnson’s strategy has kept the House out of session for more than a month during a key stretch, and that is making House Republicans increasingly anxious.</p>\n<p>The House’s last vote was on Sept. 19, making this six-week-and-counting recess the longest since a six-week recess during the 2024 election.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How we know frustrations are building</strong>: Rep. <strong>Marjorie Taylor Greene</strong> (R-Ga.), who has been critical of Republicans’ shutdown strategy since it began, confronted Johnson earlier this week. And Rep. <strong>Dan Crenshaw</strong> (R-Texas) questioned Johnson’s strategy, a source confirmed to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5582283-republicans-house-shutdown-recess-johnson/\">The Hill</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Brace yourselves for when they do return</strong>: “One House Republican familiar with leadership conversations said that members should brace for a jam-packed schedule when the chamber returns — likening it to ‘two-a-day’ football practices. ‘It’s not going to be business as usual.

There are already 14 Republican co-sponsors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why are some Republicans not on board with Hawley’s plan?</strong>: They blame the shutdown on Democrats. “They think Democrats, in blocking the House GOP funding bill, are the ones to blame for any lapse in SNAP.”  They want to keep pressure on Democrats to end the shutdown.</p>\n<p><strong>Read Bolton’s reporting: </strong><a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5582366-snap-benefits-lapse-senate/\"><strong>‘Republicans battling behind scenes over funding SNAP during shutdown’</strong></a><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>HOW CAN YOU HELP?</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Donating money to your local food bank is the best way to help SNAP recipients who need help putting food on their tables.

Once that stage is reached, however, the change is extremely difficult to reverse. And aspiring authoritarians use other excesses, like a cowed legislature and judiciary, to lock in their power.”</p>\n<p><strong>Does the Times think we’ve already reached an autocracy?</strong>: No. “Our country is still not close to being a true autocracy, in the mold of Russia or China,” the editorial board argues. “But once countries begin taking steps away from democracy, the march often continues. We offer these 12 markers as a warning of how much Americans have already lost and how much more we still could lose.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the editorial: </strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/31/opinion/trump-autocracy-democracy-report.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare\"><strong>‘Are we losing our democracy?’</strong></a><strong></strong></p>\n<p>The Atlantic published reporting today with a similar premise: “It’s getting ever harder to avoid connecting the authoritarian dots.”</p>\n<p><strong>Excerpt</strong>: “Trump is in the process of building his own paramilitary force. He is invoking wartime powers to deport people without due process, even suggesting that American citizens may be sent to foreign prisons. He has deployed National Guard troops to cities over the objections of local officials. In a speech to American troops in Japan, he warned: ‘If we need more than the National Guard, we’ll send more than the National Guard.’ Trump has signaled that he is open to invoking the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law that allows the president to deploy the military in the United States. And he has claimed, without legal justification, that he has the right to order the military to summarily kill people suspected of smuggling drugs on boats off the coast of South America.”</p>\n<p><strong>Read: ‘</strong><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/10/trump-authoritarianism/684773/\"><strong>Trump’s Plan Is Now Out in the Open’</strong></a><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>QUICK HITS</strong>:</p>\n<p>— ABC and ESPN <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5582925-youtubetv-disney-networks-dispute/\">have been taken off YouTube<ins> </ins>TV</a> over a carrier dispute with Disney.</p>\n<p>— Ticket sales at the Kennedy Center <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/10/31/kennedy-center-sales/\">have plummeted</a> since President Trump took it over, according to The Washington Post.</p>\n<p>— NASA tested a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/transportation/5583017-nasa-supersonic-jet-travel-time/\">low-volume supersonic jet</a> that could cut air travel time.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE READS:<br/></strong><strong><br/></strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/us/politics/supreme-court-kagan-jackson-liberal-justices.html\"><strong>The New York Times</strong></a>: The Debate Dividing the Supreme Court’s Liberal Justices</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/colleges-face-a-financial-reckoning-the-university-of-chicago-is-exhibit-a-8918b2b0?mod=hp_lead_pos7\"><strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong></a>: Colleges Face a Financial Reckoning.

I regularly queried students about whether they felt pressured to answer in-class or examination questions to placate the political or social leanings of their professors. On average, 85 percent answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p>The litmus test is whether the educator’s public statements are likely to inhibit the free exchange of ideas in the classroom. An affirmative answer to this question is presumptively disqualifying because it undermines the educational mission.</p>\n<p>The issue is not whether professors are free to express their views; they are. The issue is whether there can still be a reasonable expectation of a classroom experience in which students can express their own, possibly contrary views, with impunity. </p>\n\n<p>This is a slippery slope and gray areas abound.

A professor who poses thoughtful questions and is prepared to weigh in objectively on either side of the issue can encourage enlightening debate even on the most controversial of issues. </p>\n<p>The problem arises when educators impose their own opinions and use them suppress critical discourse.</p>\n<p>I presented the Summers case to my MBA students with some modification. I asked them to assume there is credible empirical evidence that men have a lower mathematical aptitude than women. I then asked them why economists and university administrators would be interested in the answer. </p>\n\n<p>One student noted that if it is known these differences exist, it would be more efficient to have more women in departments with a strong quantitative component and more men in departments that are less quantitatively oriented. The discussion then turned to the importance of role models and whether efficiency should be dispositive.</p>\n<p>I used the Socratic Method to examine other politically charged issues, including affirmative action and <a href=\"https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2022/03/80774/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">diversity</a>. I believe it proved effective because my role was limited to that of a referee posing specific questions — particularly intervening when I thought the discussion was moving too far to the left or the right.</p>\n<p>Scholarship is not the province of the timid, because pushing forth the frontiers of knowledge is a contest of ideas. What is underappreciated is that the educator’s role in this process is much more <a href=\"https://www.k-state.edu/economics/research/research/WeismanAnEssayOnTheArtAndScienceOfTeaching_TAE_Published.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">conductor</a> than composer.
