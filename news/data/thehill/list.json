            "title": "Democrats say Trump hasn't learned lessons of history, has no strategic endgame with Iran strikes",
            "description": "<p>Democrats reacting to U.S. strikes early Saturday morning on Iran criticized President Trump, saying he has failed to learn from multiple failed U.S. interventions in the Middle East and accusing the president of sidestepping Congress in launching the attacks. </p>\n<p>Sen. <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/mark-warner/\">Mark Warner </a>(D-Va.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, questioned the need for the attack in his statement, and warned the U.S. could be repeating “mistakes of the past” in a nod to the Iraq War launched by former President George W. Bush.</p>\n<p>“The American people have seen this playbook before – claims of urgency, misrepresented intelligence, and military action that pulls the United States into regime change and prolonged, costly nation-building,” Warner wrote. </p>\n<p>“We owe it to our service members, and to every American family, to ensure that we are not repeating the mistakes of the past. The president owes the country clear answers: What is the objective? What is the strategy to prevent escalation? And how does this make Americans safer?”</p>\n<p>Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee also said the president had failed to learn “the lessons of history.”</p>\n<p>“Everything I have heard from the Administration before and after these strikes on Iran confirms this is a war of choice with no strategic endgame,” Himes said in a statement.</p>\n<p>“Military action in this region almost never ends well for the United States, and conflict with Iran can easily spiral and escalate in ways we cannot anticipate. It does not appear that Donald Trump has learned the lessons of history.”</p>\n<p>Trump, in <a href=\"https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/full-text-trump-announces-major-combat-operations-in-iran/\">a video</a> <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116147082884192486\">posted to Truth Social</a> overnight, said the U.S. was “going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground” and also called for regime change in Iran.</p>\n<p>But Democratic critics called those goals unrealistic.</p>\n<p>“The goals laid out by President Trump — ending Iran’s destabilizing nuclear weapons program, dismantling its missile arsenal, crushing its proxy network, and regime change — are not the objectives of a limited strike,” said Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. </p>\n<p>“They are the objectives of a prolonged war. Military force can degrade Iran’s capabilities, but without a defined end state and real diplomacy, these objectives invite escalation.” </p>\n<p>Several Democrats also faulted Trump for failing to account for his own actions that set the stage for the growth of Iran’s nuclear program as well as inconsistencies in his statements about the both risks of its nuclear capabilities and U.S. success in thwarting them.</p>\n<p>Sen Tim Kaine (D-Va.), one of the sponsors of a war powers resolution, noted it was Trump who in 2018 withdrew the U.S. from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) initially signed in 2015, a deal that was effectively blocking Iran’s pathway to building a bomb.</p>\n<p>“Has President Trump learned nothing from decades of U.S. meddling in Iran and forever wars in the Middle East? Is he too mentally incapacitated to realize that we had a diplomatic agreement with Iran that was keeping its nuclear program in check, until he ripped it up during his first term?” <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5760434-kaine-trump-us-iran-strikes-nuclear/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5760434-kaine-trump-us-iran-strikes-nuclear/\">Kaine said</a>.</p>\n<p> Trump last June launched strikes on Iran, with the president at the time asserting the U.S. had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>That claim generated much pushback, with skeptics arguing Iran wasn’t on the brink of developing a weapon, while additional intelligence showed the strikes landed in other Iranian facilities set their nuclear development back only by a few months.</p>\n<p>Others argued Trump simply didn’t have the military background to understand the commitment he was making of U.S. troops.</p>\n<p>“I went to war three times for this country and learned that when elites in Washington bang the war drums, working class folks pay the price. The tough talk of a five-time draft dodger falls flat for Americans tired of military adventurism. Americans want us out of the regime change business,” said Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), a former Army Ranger who did tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>“Trump is plunging us into another war in the Middle East. He’s learned nothing from decades of failed conflicts. It’s a war of choice with no clear end game, no authorization from Congress, and little support from Americans.”</p>\n<p>Several Democrats raised constitutional issues with the strikes, stressing that the president must come to lawmakers to authorize war.</p>\n<p>“Congress must be fully briefed, and the administration must come forward with a clear legal justification, a defined end state, and a plan that avoids dragging the United States into yet another costly and unnecessary war,” Warner wrote.</p>\n<p>“Iran’s leadership has long supported terrorism across the region, undermined regional stability, continued to advance its nuclear ambitions, and brutally repressed its own people,” Warner said. “But acknowledging those realities does not relieve any president of the responsibility to act within the law, with a clear strategy, and with Congress.</p>\n<p>Sen. <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/ed-markey/\">Ed Markey </a>(D-Mass.) called the U.S. attack “illegal and unconstitutional” because it was not approved by Congress.</p>\n<p>“Trump’s illegal actions raise the threat of escalation into a wider regional war with grave risks for U.S. troops and civilians in the region,” he wrote in a statement that also called for an immediate vote on a war powers resolution that has been introduced by Kaine and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/adam-schiff/\">Adam Schiff </a>(D-Calif.).</p>\n<p>“A diplomatic solution remains the best way to permanently and verifiably prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon,” Markey stated. “This is a crisis of Trump’s creation. Americans do not want another endless war in the Middle East.”</p>\n<p>Sen. <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/ruben-gallego/\">Ruben Gallego </a>(D-Ariz.), a former Marine who served in Iraq, said in a statement posted on X also warned of the possibility the U.S. could be drawn into a bigger war.</p>\n<p>“The Iranian people deserve freedom and dignity. But we cannot send our men and women to die at the whim of the President,” he wrote. “The regime’s actions shouldn’t become an excuse for a wider war that punishes civilians and puts our troops at risk.”</p>\n<p>Trump has been <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5760326-republican-reaction-us-iran-strikes/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5760326-republican-reaction-us-iran-strikes/\">seeing support</a> for his actions from a number of Republican lawmakers, however, and at least one Democrat.</p>\n<p>Sen. <u><a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/john-fetterman/\">John Fetterman </a></u>(D-Pa.) in a statement offered support for the action.</p>\n<p>“Operation Epic Fury.

            "description": "<p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Saturday that the country’s president and supreme leader were alive “as far as I know” after overnight U.S.-Israeli strikes included targets near government compounds.</p>\n<p>“As far as I know, yes they are alive and the head of judiciary as well, the speaker of parliament as well. All high-ranking officials are alive,” Araghchi <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/video/full-interview-iranian-foreign-minister-reacts-to-u-s-and-israeli-strikes-in-iran-258481733776\">told NBC New</a>s said when asked specifically of President Masoud Pezeshkian and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>\n<p>When asked if he believed he was one of the targets, Araghchi responded: “Well I don’t know. They have targeted everybody,” citing an attack on a girls elementary school in southern Iran that he says killed 57, upping a previous death toll of 40, according to Iranian state media.</p>\n<p>Araghchi characterized the situation on the ground thus far as “under control.”</p>\n<p>“I think Americans and Israelis failed to… hit their targets,” he said, adding that Iran began its retaliation around two hours after the initial strikes on nearby American bases in neighboring Gulf states.</p>\n<p>“Almost all officials are safe and sound and alive. We may have lost one or two commanders but that is not a big problem,” Araghchi said.</p>\n<p>Iran has launched a number of missile strikes in neighboring countries that host U.S. bases including in Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar and United Arab Emirates, some of which were intercepted.</p>\n<p>Explosions were also heard in and around Jerusalem with Israeli defense forces also reporting missile interceptions in Haifa in northern Israel.</p>\n<p>Araghchi said he had been in contact with Persian Gulf states about retaliatory attacks, expressing his intent to not attack them and instead target American bases “in the act of self-defense.”</p>\n<p>“We cannot just sit and watch,” he said.</p>\n<p>He also criticized the Trump administration for launching the attack as negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program were underway, citing a recent meeting in Geneva with Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner that he said went well. </p>\n<p>“Everybody was happy,” Araghchi said. “A deal was at our reach.”</p>",

I said no pictures, and that picture was released.”</p>\n<p>“I said no pictures, and that picture was released. Again, it’s an unfortunate situation, but I don’t think that in any way, shape or form delegitimizes the deposition,” he added.</p>",

            "title": "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's brave fight against narcoterrorism",
            "description": "<p>When Mexican forces killed Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes — known as “El Mencho,” the longtime head of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel — the retaliation by one of the most violent criminal organizations in the Western Hemisphere was immediate and brutal.</p>\n<p>Gunfire erupted in crowded streets. Highways were blocked with burning vehicles. Armed convoys menaced neighborhoods. Entire cities shut down as cartel gunmen sought to reassert their reach. In the first 24 hours alone, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/el-mencho-killed-25-mexican-national-guard-troops-killed-jalisco-cartel/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dozens of Mexican National Guard members</a> were killed in coordinated counterattacks — a stark reminder that this cartel operates not as a street gang, but as a heavily armed insurgent enterprise.</p>\n<p>Mexico’s operation against Jalisco New Generation is part of a truly courageous and successful campaign by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum since taking office: direct action against cartel leadership combined with expanded cooperation with the U.S.</p>\n<p>To be clear, this was not a unilateral strike carried out in isolation. Targeting cartel leadership was undertaken in close partnership with U.S. authorities, relying on shared intelligence, coordinated targeting, and operational synchronization. The campaign underscores a maturing bilateral security relationship to counter a common threat.</p>\n<p>Her administration has also <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-us-trump-cartel-members-garcia-harfuch-e6af78fd8a5c851a81f7174324d55e51\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">accelerated extraditions</a> of senior cartel figures to U.S. courts — a consequential step that disrupts command structures and removes high-level operators from Mexican territory. These extraditions are politically sensitive, diplomatically complex, and life-threatening to Sheinbaum personally. She has proceeded anyway.</p>\n<p>Last month, after Mexican authorities helped arrest a major trafficker on the U.S. most wanted list, FBI Director Kash Patel traveled to Mexico, underscoring an increasingly operational partnership. Senior-level dialogue, intelligence fusion, and coordinated enforcement actions now define the relationship more than public friction does.</p>\n<p>For President Donald Trump, dismantling fentanyl networks and cartel supply chains has been central to his national security agenda. For Mexico, cartel dominance has eroded public safety and seriously undermined state authority. Our joint strategic interests align.</p>\n<p>Groups like Jalisco New Generation operate with paramilitary capability. They field armored vehicles, deploy military-grade weapons, buy off and threaten officials, and use spectacular violence to intimidate governments and populations alike. Authorizing operations against senior leadership invites brutal retaliation, carrying risk well beyond the battlefield. Cartels have assassinated local officials, infiltrated institutions, and issued threats that reach into every facet of national politics.</p>\n<p>The deadly response following El Mencho’s killing demonstrates both the scale of the threat and the seriousness of Mexico’s current approach. Sheinbaum is escalating pressure and delivering tangible blows against organizations that have long relied on fear as a governing tool.</p>\n<p>That makes Washington’s posture critical.</p>\n<p>Public threats of unilateral U.S. military action inside Mexico would complicate the very strategy currently underway. Sheinbaum is taking significant political and personal risk by targeting cartel leadership, increasing extraditions, and deepening cooperation with U.S. authorities. Her credibility at home matters. Strengthening it advances shared objectives. Undermining it weakens a partner engaged in a high-stakes confrontation with transnational criminal networks.</p>\n<p>Cooperation is already functioning at a serious level. Escalatory rhetoric could disrupt intelligence sharing and embolden criminal organizations eager to portray bilateral tension as opportunity.</p>\n<p>Fentanyl continues to devastate American communities. But we must recognize that drug users in the United States demand Mexican drugs, supply the money to pay for them and the chemicals to make them. Likewise, the vast majority of weapons in the hands of the cartels comes from the United States. It is reasonable therefore for Mexicans to believe we are part of the problem, and have every reason to expect us to do our part to help them end the scourge threatening their own country.</p>\n<p>Enforcement alone will not solve either the supply or demand challenge; long-term progress requires institutional reform, fighting addiction, anti-corruption measures, and economic resilience. But enforcement remains essential. Removing leadership, disrupting logistics, and severing financial pipelines are prerequisites for broader reform.</p>\n<p>Sheinbaum’s current course reflects that understanding. Targeting high-level figures, facilitating extraditions, and coordinating closely with U.S. counterparts represent sustained strategic decisions, not isolated gestures.</p>\n<p>The U.S. benefits when Mexico acts decisively against narcoterrorism. Mexico benefits when the partnership is steady and credible. Cartels benefit when political friction disrupts coordinated pressure.</p>\n<p>This is a moment for alignment.</p>\n<p>Sheinbaum is pressing against some of the most powerful criminal organizations in the hemisphere. Doing so exposes her government — and her personally — to retaliation. It also reinforces the principle that the Mexican state, not armed syndicates, governs Mexican territory.</p>\n<p>Washington should reinforce that effort. Support, intelligence cooperation, and disciplined messaging will advance shared security goals more effectively than threats of unilateral action.</p>\n<p>Narcoterrorism is a transnational problem that demands sustained cooperation. To that end, Claudia Sheinbaum has proven herself a fearless and capable partner. With the cartels on the run, Mexico needs an ally not an adversary.</p>\n<p><em>Richard Swett served as the U.S. representative for <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/New_Hampshire%27s_2nd_Congressional_District\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">New Hampshire’s 2nd District</a> from 1991 to 1995.

Hundreds of employees from Google and OpenAI signed an <a href=\"https://notdivided.org/\">open letter</a>, titled “We Will Not Be Divided,” accusing the Pentagon of pushing similar demands for their companies’ AI models. </p>\n<p>“The Pentagon is <a href=\"https://removepaywalls.com/https://www.axios.com/2026/02/23/ai-defense-department-deal-musk-xai-grok\">negotiating</a> with Google and OpenAI to try to get them to agree to what Anthropic has refused,” the employees wrote. </p>\n<p>“They’re trying to divide each company with fear that the other will give in,” they continued. “That strategy only works if none of us know where the others stand. This letter serves to create shared understanding and solidarity in the face of this pressure from the Department of War.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a data-id=\"https://apnews.com/article/openai-amazon-nvidia-softbank-altman-microsoft-a0a915c32b85337d799fe2f9525a932a\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/openai-amazon-nvidia-softbank-altman-microsoft-a0a915c32b85337d799fe2f9525a932a\">announced a deal</a> with the Pentagon on Friday.

            "title": "The Clintons and the politics of scandal",
            "description": "<p>The deposition of former President Bill Clinton this week was both unprecedented and strikingly reminiscent. It was the first time a former president had been deposed by the House, let alone under subpoena. Yet it is hardly the first deposition for Clinton. Twenty-eight years ago, I testified in Clinton’s impeachment hearing after he had lied under oath about his relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.</p>\n<p>Given his earlier previous perjury over an affair with a young woman, few would rely on Clinton’s denials of relations with multiple young women shown in pictures associated with Epstein. But given the paucity of direct evidence, there is ample room for plausible deniability. And plausible deniability is the realm wherein the Clintons have long dwelt — between the outright conclusive and the merely scandalous.</p>\n<p>The embarrassing photos of Clinton in a hot tub or receiving massages from young women come as a shock to no one. For anyone familiar with his past, Clinton was in his element. The level of Clinton’s interaction with Epstein is also extensive. Clinton flew on Epstein’s notorious private plane, dubbed the “Lolita Express, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79l38vl3lwo\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">at least 26 times</a> and had Epstein visit the White House <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/02/26/hillary-clinton-neighbors-sound-off-epstein-testimony/88887638007/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">at least 16 times.</a> Although Clinton has denied visiting Epstein’s island, various witnesses <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/05/26/clinton-spent-time-on-epsteins-orgy-island-netflix-doc/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">have claimed they saw him there</a>.</p>\n<p>Epstein emails also discuss his contributions to the Clinton Global Initiative and his work to assist the Clintons.</p>\n<p>That presents a greater challenge than debating <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/bctest092198_4.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">what the meaning of “is is.”</a></p>\n<p>The greatest danger was not that Clinton would be charged with sexual crimes connected to these underage girls. Prosecutors clearly did not find sufficient evidence for such charges. However, Clinton has previously shown the danger of being “too clever by half.” He and Hillary have spent their lives evading accountability, including his alleged perjury in the prior deposition. That record can create a dangerous sense of impunity and misplaced self-confidence.</p>\n<p>In 1998, I appeared at the Clinton impeachment and, despite voting for Clinton as a lifelong Democrat, I testified that his conduct in office had satisfied the standard of a “high crime and misdemeanor.”</p>\n<p>Clinton ultimately relied on Democratic senators to avoid conviction and was never formally charged with perjury, despite his public admissions of guilt.</p>\n<p>In the latest deposition, Clinton denied knowing anything about Epstein’s conduct with underage girls. Clinton built on his prior Lewinsky testimony by pluralizing his most famous declaration, denying that he had sex with those women. He said he had no memory of the identity of the young woman pictured with him in the hot tub. “I saw nothing,” he declared. “I did nothing wrong.”</p>\n<p>For critics, it was the <a href=\"https://www.bing.com/videos/riverview/relatedvideo?q=%22I+see+nothing!+I+hear+nothing!+I+know+nothing!+schultz&amp;mid=CDF2C9733176CF1E7AD5CDF2C9733176CF1E7AD5&amp;FORM=VIRE\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sgt. Schultz defense</a> that the Clintons have used in a long litany of scandals.</p>\n<p>There is no evidence that Clinton had relations with “those women.” Although Epstein’s associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, attended Chelsea Clinton’s wedding after the allegations were publicly known, there is no way to prove any knowledge by Clinton of his friend’s unlawful proclivities. Maxwell was also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/25/epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-bill-clinton-conference\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">given an award</a> by the Clinton Global Initiative in 2013 — five years after the public disclosure of the first Epstein allegations.</p>\n<p>Investigators will now go through the long deposition to see if Clinton tripped any wires in his denials. In the meantime, Democrats are denouncing the deposition while pledging to replicate it by hauling in President Trump at some future date, once they are back in power. It is unlikely to happen while he is in office, but the Clinton deposition created a precedent for subpoenaing former presidents.</p>\n<p>There is no evidence that Trump committed any crime in relation to Epstein. He will be able to point to the fact that he expelled Epstein from his club at Mar-a-Lago, as well as his correspondence with local police encouraging their investigation of Epstein.  </p>\n<p>It does not matter that prosecutors, including under the Biden administration, found no evidence to charge Trump. Democrats have already dispensed with any need for a factual basis for conspiracy theories.</p>\n<p>Recently, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) gave a <a href=\"https://jonathanturley.org/2026/02/15/ro-khanna-and-the-impunity-of-wealthy-powerful-men/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">chest-pounding speech</a> about revealing the names of six powerful men who had been protected by the Trump Justice Department from disclosure. Four of them turned out to have nothing to do with Epstein and weren’t especially powerful either. All Khanna accomplished was to multiply by 400 percent <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/11/21/us-news/dr-jeffrey-epstein-the-long-island-neurosurgeon-jasmine-crockett-confused-for-notorious-pedophile-floats-epic-revenge-he-could-exact-on-the-congresswoman/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the earlier fiasco</a> by Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas), who spuriously connected politicians with a different man — a neurosurgeon named Jeffrey Epstein.</p>\n<p>This week, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) used a hearing to accuse Trump of abusing an underage girl who was later allegedly murdered to keep her silent. His source? A driver who said he overheard Trump talking about abusing a minor and later learned of her murder. There is no evidence of the death, and the source has reportedly published hundreds of anti-Trump and bizarre postings. </p>\n<p>Lieu posted two pages from the FBI report containing the allegation but <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2026/02/13/us-news/lieu-makes-wild-claim-about-trump-based-on-unhinged-source/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">withheld a third page</a> that showed the same man making further allegations of a drunken Hillary Clinton and an effort to frame someone in the Oklahoma City bombing. There is a good reason raw investigative and grand jury materials are usually kept secret.</p>\n<p>The only thing more indecent than Epstein himself is the effort to use the scandal for political advantage. The scandal has ensnared as many leading Democrats as Republicans, if not more. But Epstein is the perfect political weapon with salacious allegations to inject directly into the media bloodstream against your opponents. </p>\n<p>Epstein himself once boasted, “I invest in people — be it politics or science. It’s what I do.” It now appears that Epstein himself is the investment that many in politics believe will bring unlimited political gains. </p>\n<p><em>Jonathan Turley is a law professor and the author of the New York Times bestselling “<a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/r.nypostlink.com/?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;btn_url=https*3A*2F*2Fwww.amazon.com*2FRage-Republic-Unfinished-American-Revolution*2Fdp*2F1668205025*3Ftag*3Dnypost-20*26asc_refurl*3Dhttps*3A*2F*2Fnypost.com*2F2026*2F01*2F07*2Fopinion*2Fthe-peril-of-mamdani-and-weavers-communist-college-kids-nyc-field-trip*2F*26asc_source*3Dweb__;JSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUl!!F0Stn7g!BjWySLJ4OwlcQZhb6wPOFS2EOKhL7o-sM6nnqIESQ0JVK8oWxyxym3SeoJz3PoYEXyZsHnFu6qmX2BMJ8juro55URA$\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rage and the Republic</a>: The Unfinished Story of the American Revolution.”</em></p>",

            "description": "<p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) pledged that House Democrats will force a vote on limiting President Trump’s war powers in Iran as he criticized the president for striking the country without explicit congressional authorization.</p>\n<p>“The framers of the United States Constitution gave Congress the sole power to declare war as the branch of government closest to the American people,” Jeffries said in a statement Saturday in response to the strikes.</p>\n<p>“Iran is a bad actor and must be aggressively confronted for its human rights violations, nuclear ambitions, support of terrorism and the threat it poses to our allies like Israel and Jordan in the region. However, absent exigent circumstances, the Trump administration must seek authorization for the preemptive use of military force that constitutes an act of war,” Jeffries said.</p>\n<p>He mentioned a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5745037-khanna-massie-war-powers-iran/\">war powers resolution</a> spearheaded by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) that would make Trump remove U.S. forces from hostilities in Iran without congressional authorization. </p>\n<p>“House Democrats remain committed to compelling a vote on this resolution upon our return,” Jeffries said. </p>\n<p>War powers resolutions are privileged parliamentary procedures in the House and Senate, allowing members to bypass House Republican leaders to force floor votes on war powers measures.</p>\n<p>But as of earlier this week, the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5756657-democrats-trump-iran-war-powers/\">resolution was expected to fail</a> in the House given overwhelming opposition from Republicans and a few Democrats. Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.), both of whom are supporters of Israel, had announced their opposition to the resolution. Party leaders, though, wanted to get all lawmakers on the record for the vote.</p>\n<p>Massie, in a <a href=\"https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/2027739993033134279?s=20\">post on X</a> Saturday morning, also renewed his commitment to forcing the vote.</p>\n<p>“I am opposed to this War. This is not ‘America First,’” Massie said. “When Congress reconvenes, I will work with @RepRoKhanna to force a Congressional vote on war with Iran. The Constitution requires a vote, and your Representative needs to be on record as opposing or supporting this war.”</p>\n<p>Jeffries worried about negative long-term consequences from Trump’s strikes.</p>\n<p>“If Iran’s nuclear program was ‘completely and totally obliterated’ by the military strikes in June 2025, as Donald Trump boldly proclaimed, there should be no need to strike them now,” Jeffries said in a statement. </p>\n<p>“Equally troublesome, the advancement of security and stability in the Middle East requires more than military might, as we painfully discovered in several failed wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Trump administration must explain itself to the American people and Congress immediately, provide an ironclad justification for this act of war, clearly define the national security objective and articulate a plan to avoid another costly, prolonged military quagmire in the Middle East.”</p>",
