It marked Vladimir Putin’s first official visit to the United States since 2015.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Trump said he had agreed to meet Putin in Alaska to <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-putin-ukraine-alaska-meeting/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">find out</a> “whether or not a deal can be made” with the Russian leader. In an effort to bring Putin to the negotiating table in Alaska, Trump announced a <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-50-day-deadline-russia-expires-2123116\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">50-day</a> deadline for new sanctions on Russia — a deadline that was soon shortened to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-sets-new-deadline-10-or-12-days-russia-act-ukraine-2025-07-28/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">10 days</a>. </p>\n<p>The gambit appeared to backfire. Not only does the war in Ukraine grind on,<strong> </strong>but the Kremlin has also withdrawn from negotiations, refused further talks and escalated tensions: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c2enwk1l9e1t\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">19 Russian drones</a> were detected over Poland, several more <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80g7g5rmlno\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">intercepted</a> over Romania and three fighter jets entered Estonian airspace for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czrp6p5mj3zo\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">12 minutes</a>. For the first time in eight decades, Estonia called an emergency <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/09/1165907\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">meeting</a> of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the situation.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>In Alaska, Putin rejected Trump’s demand for an immediate <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/17/g-s1-83183/putin-trump-ceasefire\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ceasefire</a> in Ukraine, shifting instead to discussions of the U.S.-Russia nuclear arms control <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-still-waiting-us-response-nuclear-arms-control-proposal-says-russias-un-2025-10-01/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">treaty</a>, which is set to expire in February.</p>\n<p>“I thought that was going to be an easy one because of my relationship with President Putin.

For decades, Russia has leveraged its energy resources as a political weapon. </p>\n\n<p>After meeting with Trump in Alaska, Putin said the war will not end until the “<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0q964851po\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">root causes</a>” are addressed, echoing his long-held grievances over NATO expansion and Ukraine’s Western alignment. </p>\n<p>Those root causes — denial of Ukraine’s sovereignty and a demand for a Russian sphere of influence — have defined his justification for war since 2014, yet none can be addressed without weakening Ukraine or NATO.</p>\n<p>After three and a half years of war, Russia remains one of the world’s most heavily sanctioned countries. Yet its economy has proved unexpectedly resilient, sustained by energy revenues, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wheat-chinese-cars-russia-turns-barter-skirt-sanctions-2025-09-15/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">barter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/08/russias-use-of-crypto-schemes.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cryptocurrency</a> trading, high interest rates and a series of domestic policy measures that have blunted the impact of Western penalties.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>If the world could draw one lesson from Ukraine, it is that reducing dependence on Russian energy is essential, both now and in the years ahead. Yet allies must do far more to help bring an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>First of all, allies must follow through on their commitments to Ukraine’s air defense, including Trump’s widely reported promise of <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/15/will-patriots-promised-by-trump-boost-ukraines-defence-against-russia\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">17 Patriot missile systems</a>, a pledge that has seen little public follow-up.</p>\n<p>The U.S. and the European Union must <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/eu-readies-ban-russian-gas-imports-by-end-2027-2025-06-17/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ban</a> Russian energy and impose sanctions on its importers. Russian exports to third countries must be prohibitively costly. </p>\n\n<p>Targeting most of the 600 vessels in Russia’s so-called shadow fleet is necessary. As of mid-2025, the EU has <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/an-update-on-the-efficacy-of-sanctions-against-russia/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sanctioned</a> 444 vessels, the United Kingdom 423, while the U.S. remains at 216, having failed to sanction a single new tanker under the current administration.</p>\n<p>Western corporations should face pressure to withdraw from Russian ventures. Many global enterprises <a href=\"https://som.yale.edu/story/2022/over-1000-companies-have-curtailed-operations-russia-some-remain\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">continue to trade</a> with Russia despite sanctions, exploiting loopholes enabled by weak enforcement and oversight. For years, Moscow has used these partnerships to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/exxon-mobile-russia-sanctions-rex-tillerson-232770\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">lobby</a> against sanctions.</p>\n<p>Sanctions lists against Russian oligarchs must be synchronized. Many remain active in jurisdictions where they are not targeted. Roman Abramovich, <a href=\"https://www.opensanctions.org/entities/Q171428/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sanctioned</a> by Britain and the EU since 2022, still faces no U.S. sanctions.</p>\n\n<p>Russian agents of influence must also be prosecuted. Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/six-defendants-indicted-alleged-conspiracy-bribe-government-officials-india-mine-titanium\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">indicted</a> by the U.S. in 2014 for bribery and racketeering and long linked to the Kremlin, remains in Austria, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/austria-dymitro-firtash-court-extradition-chicago-4cd7c4ef23b8ef04a85953ca47b91906\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">avoiding</a> extradition.</p>\n<p>Western allies should back Ukraine’s EU and NATO aspirations, recognizing its advances in drone <a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/55897\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">warfare</a> and defense innovation.

As he attempted this unpredictable move, three people in a minivan were killed crashing into his truck.  </p>\n<p>If he had read and obeyed the “Official Use Only” sign, this tragic accident would not have occurred. Apparently, the problem was that he couldn’t read English. When officers with the <a href=\"https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration</a> gave him an <a href=\"https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/newsroom/updated-internal-agency-enforcement-policy-english-language-proficiency\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">English Language Proficiency test</a> after the accident, he was only able to give a correct response to <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/illegal-immigrant-trucker-accused-killing-three-people-failed-english-road-sign-tests-dot\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">two of 12</a> verbal questions, and he could only identify one out of four highway traffic signs.  </p>\n\n<p>This driver should not have been driving a commercial vehicle at all. <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-49/subtitle-B/chapter-III/subchapter-B/part-391/subpart-B/section-391.11\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Federal regulations</a> governing qualifications for driving a commercial vehicle provide that drivers must be able to “read and speak the English language sufficiently to converse with the general public, to understand highway traffic signs and signals in the English language, to respond to official inquiries, and to make entries on reports and record.”  </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>This is particularly important for semi-truck drivers. A fully loaded semi can <a href=\"https://driverresourcecenter.com/why-are-semi-trucks-called-semi-trucks/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">weigh</a> as much as 80,000 pounds; most of them are between 70 and 80 feet long. Collisions between such large vehicles and cars are likely to be deadly. More than 4,000 people died in large truck crashes in 2023, and <a href=\"https://www.iihs.org/research-areas/fatality-statistics/detail/large-trucks\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">65 percent</a> of them were in cars and other passenger vehicles. </p>\n<p>As Rep. Pat Harrigan (R-N.C.) <a href=\"https://harrigan.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-pat-harrigan-introduces-safe-drivers-act\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">has said</a>, “If you can’t read ‘Bridge Out Ahead’ or communicate with a state trooper at a crash scene, you have no business driving an 80,000-pound truck on American highways.” Harrigan has introduced a <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr5800#:~:text=To%20require%20all%20applicants%20for%20a%20commercial%20driver%27s,in%20the%20first%20stage%20of%20the%20legislative%20process.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SAFE Drivers Act</a> last month, which would require all applicants for commercial driver’s licenses to show English proficiency. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Even so, the English proficiency regulations have to be enforced to be effective, and some administrations have not enforced them.  </p>\n<p>The Obama administration issued a <a href=\"https://www.gallaghersharp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SafetyNotice_English-Proficiency.pdf?x23768#:~:text=PURPOSE:,BACKGROUND:\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">memorandum</a> in June 2016, that removed the requirement to put non-English proficient drivers out of service. Moreover, it also provided that “If the driver cannot read, write, or speak English but can communicate sufficiently with the inspector / investigator, he / she should not be cited for a violation.”</p>\n<p>President Trump wants stricter enforcement of the English proficiency requirements for commercial truck drivers. In April 2025, he issued an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/enforcing-commonsense-rules-of-the-road-for-americas-truck-drivers/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">executive order</a> titled “Rules of the Road for America’s Truck Drivers,” in which he declared that commercial truck drivers must comply with federal law on English proficiency. It is the policy of his administration to support truck drivers and safeguard our highways by enforcing these commonsense requirements. </p>\n\n<p>But enforcement of commercial vehicle regulations won’t eliminate the risks posed by non-commercial drivers who cannot read or understand English. Apparently, the states aren’t concerned about non-commercial drivers who can’t read English. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYF18NrrBfA\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Only three</a> of the 50 states require all driver’s license applicants to take the written part of the exam in English: South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming. </p>\n<p>Every driver — commercial or not — should be able to read English traffic signs, detour notices and highway warnings, and be able to respond to law enforcement or first-responder instructions. Though accidents with an 80,000-pound truck are likely to be more serious than accidents with a <a href=\"https://www.autopadre.com/vehicle-weight/honda-accord\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">3,000-pound</a> Honda sedan, people die in collisions with Honda sedans and other passenger vehicles, too. </p>\n<p>A national road environment requires a common language, and English is America’s <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/designating-english-as-the-official-language-of-the-united-states/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">national language</a>. Using a single language simplifies signage, emergency instructions and law-enforcement communication. After a collision, drivers must know English well enough to exchange information, report locations to 911 operators, and understand instructions given by first-responders. They also should be able to understand instructions given in English when a disaster occurs.  </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>It isn’t necessary to establish a categorical “English-only” requirement<strong> </strong>that might raise<strong> </strong>discrimination issues under <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/civil-rights/civil-rights-library/civil-rights-act-1964#6\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Title VI of the Civil Rights Act</a>.

But this time, it could be the blood of our sons and daughters giving their last full measure of devotion in a conflict far from home.</p>\n\n<p>It is a reality and a risk to help end this latest chapter of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has caused so much suffering on both sides. There may be no alternative to putting our military in harm’s way today, but there could be and must be one in the future, and we need to embrace and pursue it as soon as possible.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>So, what if we could protect both civilians and our military by sending something else in their place — humanoid drones?</p>\n<p>We know how that sounds, but let us explain. These humanoids would be powered by interoperable, agentic artificial intelligence. Maybe it’s the stuff of science fiction, but it’s no longer the purview of just screenwriters.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>We now have the technology to deploy such robots in war zones to protect populations, establish communications and stabilize what’s happening on the ground. These systems could serve as guardians defending humanitarian corridors and deterring violence without firing a shot.</p>\n<p>We are entering a new era in which artificial intelligence becomes a civic institution rather than merely a commercial or military tool. The question is whether we lead the world in building ethical, interoperable systems that protect people, or leave the future to regimes with nefarious intentions.</p>\n<p>Let’s be clear: Our adversaries are already using this technology — not to save lives but to take them. Russia <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/10/1166189\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">uses drone swarms</a> to attack Ukraine’s infrastructure. China <a href=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/china/2025/02/20/china-ai-neuro-quantum-surveillance-security-threat/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">integrates AI into its naval and surveillance systems</a> and shares it with governments, using it for population control.  </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, we and our allies hesitate. Our doctrines remain anchored to an era when deterrence meant soldiers and sanctions. </p>\n<p>The new challenge isn’t our ability to get our military to the next hot spot. It’s machine coordination. The balance of power around the world is about to be determined by our approach to AI governance.</p>\n<p>From Ukraine to Gaza, the international community faces the same challenge: civilians stranded between opposing forces, and humanitarian agencies unable to provide aid. Yet, technology already exists to change that. Autonomous systems could patrol ceasefire zones, protect evacuation routes, deliver aid and detect incoming threats, creating buffer zones where humans can safely operate.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>This isn’t fantasy. It’s a moral and strategic imperative. Western democracies must find ways to deter aggression without risking American lives.  </p>\n<p>The foundation for this future is what we call Omni Cities — democratic, interoperable infrastructures where civic AI integrates across transportation, energy, health and defense systems. It’s not about surveillance, but about saving lives and protecting the peacemaker. It doesn’t control; it coordinates. It is is the civic answer to authoritarian implementations of AI.   </p>\n<p>The U.S. needs to lead this effort and set standards for interoperability, data ethics, and autonomous deterrence. Under United Nations oversight, AI-enabled drones and humanoid guardians could be deployed to regions such as Gaza to secure humanitarian corridors and enforce ceasefires. </p>\n\n<p>They would act not as instruments of war, but as intermediaries for peace — enforcing accountability through presence, not violence.</p>\n<p>Such a framework would extend beyond conflict zones. Domestic applications could include rapid disaster response to floods, wildfires or hurricanes, where AI could coordinate public infrastructure and autonomous assets to save lives. </p>\n<p>If the nuclear age was about avoiding mutual assured destruction, the civic AI era must be about preserving life. </p>\n\n<p>Public perception is understandably based on what we’ve seen in movies like “The Terminator.” Skeptics warn machines lack human morality and autonomy risks AI becoming more powerful than our ability to control it. Those concerns are legitimate, but inaction carries its own risk. </p>\n<p>Failing to define the ethics of AI deployment leaves it to authoritarian regimes that already use this technology to repress. The challenge isn’t whether to use AI but ensuring that it serves us. </p>\n<p>The new “Space Race” isn’t a contest between capitalism and communism, but rather between authoritarian AI and civic AI. The nations leading in building interoperable, ethical systems will shape the moral frontier of technology.</p>\n\n<p>So far, President Trump has rejected calls to cooperate in that venture with international partners. But the time has come for the U.S. and its allies to build Omni Cities and deploy these guardians of peace, not to replace humans, but to protect them. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>The civic AI Era is emerging.
