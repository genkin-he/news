So would be a pretty fun landscape to ride your BMX bike across,” Seeger told NewsNation.</p>\n<p>She added that the area explored by the rover was initially believed to be dry, but researchers now believe the web features “formed because the rock was buried over time and fractured because of all that pressure covering it, and then groundwater flowed through those cracks, and that groundwater was rich in different minerals that could crystallize in those cracks and the surrounding rock.”</p>\n<p>Seeger believes it is unclear exactly what this may lead to, but “following the water” will help their research.</p>\n<p>“We all need water. All sorts of microbes need water,” she continued. “So our investigation on Mars has been about looking for signs that there was water and signs that it was a neutral pH, a good temperature, where microbes could have lived.”</p>\n<p>Seeger added, “So, now that we see this evidence for later-stage groundwater where we could have maybe had microbes living in the subsurface, if they were there, we can keep looking for fossil evidence.”</p>",

            "title": "Iran's proxy network: Diminished, dangerous — and still an administration blind spot",
            "description": "<p>As U.S. carrier groups mass in the Gulf and Tehran signals defiance, Washington faces a strategic trap of its own making. Iran’s proxy network is weaker than at any point in the past decade — yet more volatile, more fragmented, and more likely to turn a “limited strike” into a regional firestorm. </p>\n<p>For years, Iran’s “Axis of Resistance” served as the backbone of its regional strategy. Through the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’s Quds Force, Tehran built a constellation of militias capable of bleeding adversaries and shaping conflicts from Beirut to Sanaa. Funding pipelines, drone and missile transfers, and ideological indoctrination allowed Iran to punch far above its weight. </p>\n<p>That architecture has been shaken by a cascade of shocks: the October 2023 Hamas attack and Israel’s Gaza war; crippling blows to Hezbollah; the 2024 collapse of Bashar al-Assad in Syria; and the U.S.–Israeli “12-Day War” of 2025. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/assad-regimes-collapse-devastating-defeat-iran-rcna183369\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Syria’s fall snapped the land bridge to Lebanon and Gaza</a>. The old hub-and-spoke system didn’t bend — it broke. </p>\n<p>What remains is a loose, improvised confederation. Tehran’s grip is slipping even as its proxies grow harder to neutralize. The Axis is weaker — but wilder. Less obedient. More erratic. And more dangerous in its unpredictability. </p>\n<p>Hezbollah was once Iran’s crown jewel: disciplined, heavily armed, and central to Tehran’s deterrence strategy. The 12-Day War changed that. Israeli strikes <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-says-troops-raided-destroyed-several-hezbollah-sites-in-south-lebanon/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gutted senior commanders</a>, destroyed stockpiles, and exposed vulnerabilities in air defense and communications networks. </p>\n<p>Under a fragile ceasefire, Hezbollah remains capable of firing into northern Israel, but its leadership is cautious, its arsenal depleted, and its political standing strained. Iran is funding a slow rebuild, but the group is no longer the reliable spearhead it once was.</p>\n<p>If Hezbollah is weakened, the Houthis are ascendant. Ansar Allah controls large swaths of Yemen, has survived U.S., British, and Israeli strikes and continues to disrupt Red Sea shipping. Their long range attacks on Israel during the 12-Day War showcased both capability and intent.</p>\n<p>They combine Iranian technology with their own ideological zeal and operational autonomy. They are Tehran’s least controllable partner — and the most likely to escalate in ways that drag the U.S. Navy into direct confrontation. </p>\n<p>Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad emerged from the Gaza war with shattered leadership and minimal offensive capacity. They remain symbolically important to Tehran but operationally diminished.</p>\n<p>Iraqi Shia militias, in contrast, retain significant influence. Groups like Kataib Hezbollah are embedded in Iraq’s political and security institutions, giving Iran leverage over Baghdad while maintaining the ability to strike U.S. forces. Their rhetoric about “martyrdom operations” spikes during crises — but Iraq’s internal politics may restrain them more than Tehran can. </p>\n<p>Assad’s fall in December 2024 was the single most consequential blow to Iran’s regional strategy. The loss of Damascus severed the logistical backbone of the “Axis of Resistance.” Iran’s Syrian militias are now scattered, leaderless and strategically irrelevant. Tehran has shifted to maritime routes through Yemen, covert transfers through Iraq, and dispersed global networks. </p>\n<p>A degraded Axis can still overwhelm Israel through simultaneity. Hezbollah rockets, Houthi drones, and Iraqi militia incursions — even poorly coordinated — could force Israel into a multi‑front crisis that strains its economy, air defenses and public morale. </p>\n<p>The threat is no longer a disciplined Iranian campaign. It is a chaotic storm of actors with uneven capabilities and unpredictable timing. </p>\n<p>Roughly 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria remain exposed to rocket and drone attacks. Tens of thousands more in Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain sit within range of Houthi missiles and Iraqi militia operations. During the 12-Day War, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/pentagon-acknowledges-irans-attack-on-qatar-air-base-hit-dome-used-for-u-s-communications\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. bases were repeatedly targeted</a> — a preview of what a new confrontation could unleash. </p>\n<p>Any strike on Iran risks immediate retaliation across multiple theaters. </p>\n<p>Tehran’s influence has eroded. Its proxies are bruised and fragmented, but they are also more decentralized, more ideological, and less responsive to Iranian control. </p>\n<p>A weaker Axis is not a safer one. It is a wilder one. </p>\n<p>What Washington must do now: First, plan for the proxies — do not treat them as an afterthought. Any U.S. strike must assume immediate retaliation from Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon. That requires simultaneous suppression of Houthi launch sites, Iraqi militia command centers and Hezbollah rocket infrastructure. Sequential strikes invite months of attrition. </p>\n<p>Second, the U.S. should replace maximalist demands with a narrow, enforceable deal. Zero enrichment, zero missiles, zero proxies is not a negotiating position — it is a stalemate generator. A realistic framework for an agreement should include a 20 percent enrichment cap, restored International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring, missile range limits, and incentives for verifiable proxy deescalation.</p>\n<p>Sanctions relief should also be tied to measurable reductions in militia activity, not to abstract promises. </p>\n<p>Iran’s Axis is battered but alive. Its proxies are diminished but dangerous. And its ability to turn a targeted strike into a regional conflagration remains intact. </p>\n<p>If Washington misreads weakness as irrelevance, it risks stumbling into the multi‑front conflict Tehran has spent decades preparing for. </p>\n<p><em>Charbel A.

If the drink machine is low on Diet Coke, Patty will tell the store’s manager. If a customer uses a QR code to report a messy bathroom, the manager will be alerted.</p>\n<p>Employees can ask Patty how to make various menu items or tell the AI bot to remove items from digital menus if they’ve run out of ingredients.</p>\n<p>Burger King said it’s also exploring using the technology as a way to improve <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/business/5482611-salesforce-4k-cuts-artificial-intelligence/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/business/5482611-salesforce-4k-cuts-artificial-intelligence/\">customer service</a>. The system can track when employees say key words like “welcome,” “please” and “thank you” and share that with managers.</p>\n<p>When asked about that capability Thursday by The Associated Press, Burger King said the intent is to use Patty as a coaching tool, not a tracker of individual employees.</p>\n<p>“It’s not about scoring individuals or enforcing scripts. It’s about reinforcing great hospitality and giving managers helpful, real-time insights so they can recognize their teams more effectively,” the company said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Burger King added that the key words are “one of many signals to help managers understand service patterns.”</p>\n<p>“We believe hospitality is fundamentally human. The role of this technology is to support our teams so they can stay present with guests,” it said.</p>\n<p>Patty is part of a larger app-based BK Assistant platform that will be available to all U.S. restaurants later this year.</p>\n<p>Burger King is one of several fast food chains experimenting with artificial intelligence. Yum Brands said last spring it was partnering with Nvidia to develop AI technologies for its brands, which include KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut.</p>\n<p>McDonald’s ended a partnership with IBM in 2024 that was testing automated orders at its drive-thrus.

            "description": "<p>President Trump is serious about fraud. As he should be — nothing more quickly undermines faith in our government, or enthusiasm for our safety net, than evidence that taxpayers are being ripped off.  </p>\n<p>And, boy, are they being ripped off. </p>\n<p>During the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-transcript-state-of-union-2026-c13e2a07df999b464b733f4a6e84dbd4\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">State of the Union address</a> on Tuesday, the president said, “I am officially announcing the war on fraud, to be led by our great Vice President [JD] Vance. He’ll get it done.” </p>\n<p>He also said, “And [if] we’re able to find enough of that fraud, we will actually have a balanced budget overnight. It’ll go very quickly. That’s the kind of money you’re talking about.” </p>\n<p>That is optimistic, for sure. Our deficit this year is estimated at <a href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/deficit-tracker/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">nearly $2 trillion</a> — two thousand billions of dollars. Welfare fraud is almost certainly less than half that amount. But Trump is still right that the amount of government payments being hijacked by crooks is stunning. </p>\n<p>In 2024, when Joe Biden was still president, <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-105833\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Government Accountability Office reported</a> that “the federal government could lose between $233 billion and $521 billion annually to fraud.” In other words, up to half a trillion dollars was being stolen each year! That estimate was based on a survey of spending done in the years between 2018 and 2022, in the wake of the massive COVID relief programs authorized by Congress. </p>\n<p>Note that this horrendous sum does not include <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-105833\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“improper payments”</a>; that’s a whole different (and also enormous) category, according to the Government Accountability Office.  </p>\n<p>GAO reported that “No area of the federal government is immune to fraud” and suggested that “a government-wide approach is required to address it.” That suggestion went unheeded. </p>\n<p>Theft undermining our welfare programs is not new — it has just gotten worse. </p>\n<p>During the COVID years, Congress approved <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/11/us/how-covid-stimulus-money-was-spent.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">more than $5 trillion</a> in payments to keep the economy afloat, and pushed money out the door as rapidly as possible to maintain employment and spending. The flood of barely supervised outlays in programs like the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program and the Unemployment Insurance programs was practically an invitation to steal.   </p>\n<p>Confidence in the government has been trending downward for decades, under both Republicans and Democrats. It is currently near an all-time low. While there are doubtless many reasons that <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/12/04/public-trust-in-government-1958-2025/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">voters no longer trust their leaders</a>, surely revelations of massive welfare fraud do not help.</p>\n<p>Politically, attacking the pilferage of dollars meant to help sick children or provide housing for single low-income moms is a no-brainer. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/what-is-minnesota-social-welfare-scandal-that-has-drawn-trumps-ire-2026-01-14/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">As we saw in Minneapolis</a>, voters are incensed to find that their well-meant money is being stolen, and they blame the government officials who oversee the programs and allow the thievery to go on. After the discovery that billions of dollars had been stolen from state coffers, Tim Walz <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/minnesota-gov-tim-walz-wont-run-for-a-third-term\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">decided he could not run for a third term</a> as Minnesota’s governor. He was right; the blowback from voters was swift and merciless. </p>\n<p>Since <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-and-local-finance-initiative/state-and-local-backgrounders/public-welfare-expenditures#:~:text=As%20such%2C%20while%20state%20and,%2C%20and%20Wyoming%20($1%2C577)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blue states like California, Illinois and New York</a> tend to embrace expansive welfare programs, hoping to win votes with taxpayer largesse, Democrats will be under scrutiny for allowing money to go missing. Republicans will highlight the mismanagement, adding to critiques that Democrats are poor administrators and especially feckless about fiscal management. </p>\n<p>But unlike the federal deficit, the theft of welfare hits close to home.  </p>\n<p>Alhough Trump officially tapped his VP Tuesday night to direct the anti-fraud effort, it isn’t his first move on that front. Earlier this month, he <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/trumps-fraud-enforcement-assistant-ag-nom-will-get-public-hearing-in-senate-judiciary/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">set up a new division</a> in the Department of Justice to tackle the theft of government payments. And at the end of last year, he <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-demands-california-hand-recipient-lists-10b-paused-fraud-concerns\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">demanded</a> states supply extensive information about recipients and payments.</p>\n<p>Vance will spearhead the anti-fraud campaign, and he has already thrown down the gauntlet. The vice president, along with Medicare and Medicaid Services chief Mehmet Oz, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/jd-vance/vance-trump-war-fraud-suspending-medicaid-payments-minnesota-rcna260655\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">just announced a pause on federal Medicaid reimbursements</a> to Minnesota, where billions meant for day care centers and autism treatments were stolen. </p>\n<p>Team Trump is withholding some $259 million in Medicaid reimbursements while an investigation, based on a recent audit, goes forward. Vance is demanding that Minnesota address its fraud problem before receiving more funds from Uncle Sam.</p>\n<p>That seems reasonable. Why should taxpayers across the country hand over their hard-earned cash to crooks? </p>\n<p>This isn’t a hypothetical. As NBC <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/jd-vance/vance-trump-war-fraud-suspending-medicaid-payments-minnesota-rcna260655\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a>, “The Justice Department has charged 98 people there, 85 of whom are Somali, with $1 billion in fraud.” As the scandal has widened, some put the <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/welfare/commentary/somali-welfare-fraud-minnesota-has-cost-american-taxpayers-billions\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">total lost as high as $9 billion</a>. (Trump misspoke when he mentioned a figure of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PQ7l905aVM\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$19 billion</a> in his address on Tuesday.)</p>\n<p>Walz responded to the holdup of Medicaid payments by trying to turn the spotlight back on ICE activities in his state, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/jd-vance/vance-trump-war-fraud-suspending-medicaid-payments-minnesota-rcna260655\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">saying</a>, ”This has nothing to do with fraud. The agents Trump allegedly sent to investigate fraud are shooting protesters and arresting children.” </p>\n<p>Nice try, Tim. Unrest over the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/a-look-at-shootings-by-federal-immigration-officers\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tragic killing of two civilians in your state by ICE</a> may have conveniently diverted the spotlight from your welfare fraud scandal, but it is not going away. </p>\n<p>Vance will no doubt pursue fraud allegations in California and New York, among other states, where Republicans will hope to hold onto a few essential House seats in the wake of damaging redistricting by Democrats. Govs. Gavin Newsom (D) and Kathy Hochul (D) have already pushed back, both touting <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/politics/2026/01/california-welfare-fraud-improvement/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">prior</a> <a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/money-your-pockets-governor-hochul-highlights-proposals-bring-down-costs-auto-insurance-rates\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">efforts</a> to clean up stealing in their states.</p>\n<p>Given the enormity of both states’ welfare operations, and their reportedly lax standards regulating who can access those payments, my guess is Newsom and Hochul will be on the hot seat in coming months. That will be good for Republicans — and for taxpayers. </p>\n<p><em>Liz Peek is a former partner of major bracket Wall Street firm Wertheim and Company.</em></p>",

How the parties move forward next week will significantly shape the question of whether the Republican Senate majority really is in jeopardy or not.</p>\n<p>And nobody knows what’s going to happen — on the Democratic side, at least.</p>\n<p>The Republicans have been replaying the siege of the Alamo for the past year, as incumbent Sen. <strong>John Cornyn</strong> has tried to outlast the siege by state Attorney General <strong>Ken Paxton</strong>. The arrival of a third high-visibility candidate, Houston-area Rep. <strong>Wesley Hunt</strong>, meant that a May 26 runoff between the top two was always going to be the likeliest outcome.</p>\n<p><strong>President Trump</strong> has stayed out of the race so far but is scheduled to campaign in Texas at the end of next week. Will he clarify his preference among the top two finishers or let them continue to fight it out and spend bales of cash? If the runoff features <a href=\"https://www.joemygod.com/2026/02/cornyn-attack-ad-calls-paxton-crooked-wife-cheater-accuses-him-of-being-secretly-pro-lgbtq-video/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ads like the ones we’ve seen in the first round</a>, front-runner Paxton could emerge into the general election more damaged than any Texas statewide Republican candidate in memory. </p>\n<p>It’s not unlike the story playing out along the Rio Grande as Democrats hope Republican Rep. <strong>Tony Gonzales </strong>survives his primary amid <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5753328-gonzales-pressure-affair-allegations-johnson/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a jaw-dropping scandal</a> involving the suicide by self-immolation of a staffer who claimed to have been having an affair with the congressman. While losing a House race would be an embarrassment for Texas Republicans after their audacious mid-decade redistricting, very few people in politics expect Republicans to remain in the House majority after the midterms.</p>\n<p>The Senate, though, still favors Republicans, but only slightly, and only if Republicans avoid candidates with heavy baggage, like Paxton, whose history of scandal is matched by his penchant for polarizing politics.</p>\n<p>Of course, it’s hard to say much with great confidence. Not only is there essentially no reliable, fresh polling in Texas this cycle — when <a href=\"https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/blog/competition-remains-fierce-in-both-u-s-senate-primaries-in-texas-according-to-latest-ut-texas-politics-project-poll-2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a YouGov survey</a> conducted over a two-week period online is the best you’ve got in the last week of the campaign, you ain’t got much — it would be hard to know how to even set the parameters for a poll given the huge turnout so far.</p>\n<p>Today is the last day of early voting, but by Thursday, some 270,000 more Republicans had already voted early than in 2022. That’s not so surprising, given that there wasn’t a hot Senate race on the ballot that year and Gov. <strong>Greg Abbott </strong>was easily weathering a slew of primary challengers to his right. Could Paxton win outright Tuesday? Yep. Could Hunt sneak into the top two? Sure. With turnout this high, it’s hard to say.</p>\n<p>But on the Democratic side? Wowzers.</p>\n<p>As of Thursday, <a href=\"https://votehub.com/early-vote-tracker-tx-primary-26?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;state=tx-sen-26-dem\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">868,118 ballots had already been cast</a> in Democratic primaries, almost triple the number from four years ago. To have Democratic turnout running nearly 140,000 votes ahead of Republicans in a state where the GOP holds every statewide office and huge majorities in both houses of the Legislature is really something.</p>\n<p>Part of that surge is due to the fact that Democrats everywhere are fired up to vote, winning special elections from coast to coast. But part of it is also that Texas Democrats have stumbled into a hornets’ nest of a primary between Rep. <strong>Jasmine Crockett</strong>, the trash-talking progressive from Dallas, and state Rep. <strong>James Talarico</strong>, the moderate-sounding liberal from the Austin area. </p>\n<p>The aforementioned junky poll has Crockett trouncing Talarico by a dozen points, but he has <a href=\"https://x.com/jt_ennis/status/2026761177171468380\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">his own internal poll</a> that puts him 4 points <em>ahead</em>. Both polls were taken before the imbroglio over Talarico’s scheduled appearance on <strong>Stephen Colbert</strong>’s TV show, and neither inspires much confidence in their predictive power. Even good, nonpartisan pollsters would struggle with a turnout surge like this.</p>\n<p>Republicans are hoping for Crockett in the same way Democrats are rooting for Paxton, as evidenced by Abbott’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/25/us/greg-abbott-jasmine-crockett-texas-primary-ads.html?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">mischievous interference in the Democratic race</a>, dumping a bunch of money to elevate the polarizing congresswoman for her similarities to progressive icons like Sen. <strong>Bernie Sanders </strong>(I-Vt.) and New York City Mayor <strong>Zohran Mamdani</strong>. Abbott is a shoo-in for his own race, so why not try to boost the weaker candidate for Senate?</p>\n<p>Crockett v. Cornyn would be basically no race at all. Crockett v. Paxton is a race Republicans still believe they can solidly win. Talarico v. Cornyn is probably also a solid Republican rating. But Talarico v. Paxton? That one has some real <strong>Roy Moore </strong>energy and rightly has Republicans frightened to think about what it would take to get their damaged nominee over the finish line. </p>\n<p>Even if Talarico ends up being just another <strong>Beto O’Rourke</strong>, Paxton isn’t nearly as good of a nominee as even Sen. <strong>Ted Cruz</strong> was in their 2018 match-up. And right now, the political climate looks even worse for Republicans than it did at this point in the first Trump midterm. </p>\n<p>High turnout and high stakes — that’s a Texas-sized start to the 2026 midterms.</p>\n<p>[<strong>Programming alert:</strong> Watch “<a href=\"https://x.com/thehillsunday/status/1979289066324791751?s=46&amp;t=Zd3W0ly33_L7lQTR75bKPA\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Hill Sunday with Chris Stirewalt</a>” — Midterm season is finally here, as primary voters in Texas, North Carolina and Arkansas head to the polls on Tuesday.

In the low-turnout, off-cycle elections that have happened since then, Democrats have overperformed dramatically, suggesting that their advantage with the most educated, plugged-in voters remains strong. In other words, the politics of voter ID have not caught up to its new partisan implications. Making voting more difficult would most likely hurt Republicans’ chances, yet they’re pushing hard to make that happen; meanwhile, Democrats, who insist that Trump and a MAGA Congress are existential threats to American democracy, refuse on principle to help Republicans sabotage themselves.”</p>\n<p><strong>Trump allies seek emergency declaration on elections: </strong><a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fpolitics%2F2026%2F02%2F26%2Ftrump-elections-executive-order-activists%2F%3Futm_source%3Dalert%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dwp_news_alert_revere%26location%3Dalert&amp;data=05%7C02%7Ciswanson%40thehill.com%7C563b0d016f5348f6e30508de757ba9e5%7C9e5488e2e83844f6886cc7608242767e%7C1%7C0%7C639077371501985037%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=BrHXWeBtZ4UczGk9PI6lElsX9Tx%2BYyc0KqsLJTuHJxM%3D&amp;reserved=0\">Washington Post</a>: “Pro-Trump activists who say they are in coordination with the White House are circulating a 17-page draft executive order that claims China interfered in the 2020 election as a basis to declare a national emergency that would unlock extraordinary presidential power over voting. … <strong>Peter Ticktin</strong>, a Florida lawyer … is advocating for the draft executive order. Ticktin attended the New York Military Academy with Trump and was part of his legal team that filed an unsuccessful 2022 lawsuit accusing Democrats of conspiring to damage him with allegations that his 2016 campaign colluded with Russia. ‘But here we have a situation where the president is aware that there are foreign interests that are interfering in our election processes,’ Ticktin went on. ‘That causes a national emergency where the president has to be able to deal with it.’ The emergency would empower the president to ban mail ballots and voting machines as the vectors of foreign interference, Ticktin argued.”</p>\n<p><strong>Panic setting in for California Democrats:</strong> <a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2026%2F02%2F26%2Fus%2Fcalifornia-governor-democratic-political-machine.html&amp;data=05%7C02%7Ciswanson%40thehill.com%7C563b0d016f5348f6e30508de757ba9e5%7C9e5488e2e83844f6886cc7608242767e%7C1%7C0%7C639077371502004455%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=HPghGiw%2B5cVIiSYbVGpuv1asM3FGdU1dayV%2F9WMG%2Fnw%3D&amp;reserved=0\">New York Times</a>: “[The] dominance of the San Francisco machine in California is coming to an end. … But the end of the dynastic dominance has also left California Democrats without a clear favorite to lead the state, the nation’s most populous. … At least nine Democrats are running, with no one seizing a substantial lead.

But on Wednesday, she told CNN that DHS may suspend the program again to prioritize standard security lanes.  </p>\n<p>Rosen suggested Noem is playing politics by threatening to pause PreCheck again, “despite no demonstrated need to do so.”</p>\n<p>“Given these concerns, I urge DHS to immediately reopen Global Entry and ensure that PreCheck remains available to travelers,” the senator wrote. “I also request a detailed explanation of the decision-making process that led to the suspension of TSA PreCheck and Global Entry, including the legal authority relied upon, the operational or budgetary assessments conducted, the officials who authorized the action, and the rationale for restoring PreCheck while leaving Global Entry closed.”</p>\n<p>She asked Noem to respond by March 2 and to provide the department’s plan and timeline for fully restoring Global Entry services.</p>\n<p>Rosen also copied the DHS inspector general on the letter.</p>\n<p>She told The Hill that she’s concerned about the broader economic effects of hampering air travel.</p>\n<p>“You’re going to shut down trillions of dollars. You shut down our economy by shutting down our airspace. You’re going to get your revenge alright because you’re going to cause the economy to collapse,” Rosen warned. “Good luck with that one.”</p>\n<p>“We don’t have enough people traveling, we don’t have enough shifts at the hotels, restaurants, bars. What about the people who sell toilet paper, paper towels and soap in the bathrooms there?” she continued. “You cascade all the way down. People make less, they spend less in their neighborhoods.”</p>",
