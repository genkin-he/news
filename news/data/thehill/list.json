The Office of Special Education Programs isn’t just a bureaucratic office; it’s the backbone of special education oversight in the United States. It guides states and school districts, supports families, and allocates <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/blog/trump-administration-threatens-support-for-children-with-disabilities\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$15 billion in funding for special education services nationwide.</a></p>\n\n<p>Compared to the attention given to potential cuts to Medicaid or food assistance, this move has flown under the radar. Yet the consequences could be devastating. Education is not a luxury; it is a lifeline. For millions of children with disabilities, it’s their best chance at independence and future success. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Since 1975, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act has guaranteed that children with disabilities cannot be excluded from public education. Today, <a href=\"https://sites.ed.gov/idea/2023-individuals-with-disabilities-education-act-annual-report-to-congress/#Ages-5-21\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">approximately 10 percent of students</a> — roughly 6.6 million children aged 6 to 21 — receive special education and related services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. <a href=\"https://sites.ed.gov/idea/2023-individuals-with-disabilities-education-act-annual-report-to-congress/#Part-C\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nearly half a million infants and toddlers</a> receive early education services to help reduce lifelong learning challenges. </p>\n<p>But the federal government has never lived up to its commitment to fully fund these services. The original law promised to cover 40 percent of special education costs; today, the federal share is <a href=\"https://www.nea.org/resource-library/individual-disabilities-education-act-idea-funding-gaps-school-district\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">only about 10 to 15 percent</a>. States and school districts make up the difference, leaving many children without the support they’re entitled to. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Eliminating the Office of Special Education Programs’ oversight and coordination would exacerbate an already dire situation. Without federal leadership, responsibility for compliance and funding would fall to a patchwork of state systems, some capable, others not. Families would have little recourse but to pursue costly private litigation to secure services, a route inaccessible to most. </p>\n<p>Before the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act became law, many <a href=\"https://sites.ed.gov/idea/regs/b/a/300.8\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">children with disabilities</a> were shut out of public schools or left to fail in classrooms unequipped to meet their needs. As a lawyer representing children with disabilities, I saw firsthand how proper support can change a child’s life.</p>\n<p>I represented dyslexic students who were failing and developing anxiety until they received the right interventions, after which they flourished, graduated and attended college. I worked with parents of children with severe disabilities who, through specialized education and therapy, gained the ability to walk, feed themselves, or communicate. These are not isolated stories; they are the everyday results of federal investment in special education.</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n\n<p>If the Office of Special Education Programs is dismantled, who will ensure those outcomes remain possible? Without coordination and accountability, we risk creating a generation of children left behind; children who could have become self-sufficient, taxpaying adults, but instead fall into cycles of dependency or involvement with the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p>Cutting special education oversight sends a cruel message: that the futures of children with disabilities matter less. America can — and must — do better. Fully funding and protecting the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act isn’t charity; it’s an investment in human potential. Every child deserves the chance to learn, to thrive and to contribute; we just need to give them a chance.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.adelphi.edu/faculty/profiles/profile.php?PID=0009\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Palley</a> MSW, J.D., Ph.D., is a professor of social work and director of the social work Ph.D. program at </em><a href=\"https://www.adelphi.edu/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Adelphi University</em></a><em> in Garden City, N.Y.</em></p>\n</div>",

And aspiring authoritarians use other excesses, like a cowed legislature and judiciary, to lock in their power.”</p>\n<p>The Times laid out a dozen different ways Trump has changed the operations of the U.S. government, arguing he is moving America away from democracy and toward a more centralized system of power among its leaders.

She then hinted it might be her: “<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n7k2veywo\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">I am not done</a>,” she said.</p>\n<p>To which America collectively sighed, “Please, for the love of God, don’t do this to us again!”</p>\n\n<p>I say this as someone who rode the Harris rollercoaster. I was skeptical at first, then briefly impressed when she didn’t implode in the summer of 2024. Ultimately, we received a brutal reminder of why President Trump is still the equivalent of a political wrecking ball. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>But this isn’t just about Harris. I’m just going to say the thing I probably shouldn’t say: If Democrats really believe Trump and MAGA represent an existential threat to liberal democracy, they should try something different next time. Like, nominating a man. </p>\n<p>Before you start sketching out your think piece, I am not saying this from a place of misogyny. I supported Sarah Palin back in 2008 (a confession that ages as well as milk) and pulled the lever for Nikki Haley in the 2024 primary.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>My point is simpler and sadder: There’s a growing sense that the Democratic Party has, to borrow James Carville’s phrase, “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4552950-carville-too-many-preachy-females-are-dominating-the-culture-of-the-democratic-party/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">too many preachy females</a>.” In a political era obsessed with toughness and masculinity, that perception is electoral kryptonite.</p>\n<p>For example, one participant in a Third Way focus group conducted in 2024 <a href=\"https://www.thirdway.org/memo/young-men-in-2025-not-sold-on-trump-alienated-by-democrats\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>, “I think being a masculine leader is, like, outlawed in the Democratic Party right now.”</p>\n<p>This might sound ridiculous, but the feelings — and the findings — both seem to align. Trump is 0-for-1 against male Democrats. Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris, while both capable, couldn’t close the deal. And yes, I acknowledge the counterarguments. That is a small sample size, and correlation isn’t causation. Yes, Hillary won the popular vote and Trump would have trounced Joe Biden in 2024 if he had stayed on the ticket. And yes, Harris got handed a tough assignment at a late date. </p>\n\n<p>But still, it is a pattern that feels like fate.</p>\n<p>The thing is, Trump’s obsession with dominance and cruelty, coupled with the backlash to the #MeToo movement, has changed attitudes. For example, a <a href=\"https://prri.substack.com/p/our-increasingly-gendered-politics\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2024 PRRI survey</a> found that 73 percent of Republicans now agree that society has become “too soft and feminine” — a belief that doubtless affects people’s voting decisions. It is telling that this number is up 13 points since 2016.</p>\n<p>And it’s not just white Republican men who are less inclined to vote for woman. Sarah Longwell from The Bulwark held focus group panels last fall that <a href=\"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/is-america-ready-to-elect-a-female-president-kamala-harris-glass-ceiling\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">revealed a bleak consensus</a>, even among Democratic women.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>A Georgia voter put it bluntly: “Women … don’t want to see another woman in office.”</p>\n<p>Another woman, a black Clinton-Biden voter, added, “I feel like Kamala wouldn’t win … because just in the black community, there’s still a struggle with men [wanting] to see women as leaders.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps it’s no coincidence that our culture has recently turned the word “Karen” into a national punchline — a shorthand way to call a woman bossy, humorless, and entitled. Carville, ever the Cajun oracle, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4552950-carville-too-many-preachy-females-are-dominating-the-culture-of-the-democratic-party/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">summed up the perception bluntly</a>: Too many Democrats sound like someone’s scolding aunt. “Don’t drink beer, don’t watch football, don’t eat hamburgers, this is not good for you. … You’ve got to eat your peas.”</p>\n\n<p>Fair or not, that image has infected how voters perceive Democratic women.</p>\n<p>Case in point, a recent episode of the Commentary podcast, focusing on Tuesday’s elections, was titled, “<a href=\"https://www.commentary.org/john-podhoretz/democrat-karens-and-islamist-zohrans/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Democrat Karens and Islamic Zohrans</a>.”</p>\n<p>The reference to “Karens” was in regards to the two Democratic women running for governor right now, New Jersey’s Mikie Sherrill and Virginia’s Abigail Spanberger. Both women are accomplished, grounded, and capable — yet, both are running campaigns so cautious that they might as well be wrapped in bubble wrap.</p>\n\n<p>Both will probably still win (although Sherrill’s race is too close, especially when you consider that New Jersey is a Democratic state and 2025 should be a Democratic year), but no one will remember how.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, up in Maine, there’s an incipient 2026 Democratic Senate primary where a scandal-plagued upstart named <a href=\"https://www.commentary.org/john-podhoretz/democrat-karens-and-islamist-zohrans/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Graham Platner is somehow trouncing Gov. Janet Mills</a> by double digits in a recent poll. </p>\n<p>That’s not normal politics. That’s a symptom — or a sign. </p>\n\n<p>And sure, part of the story might be that Platner is an outsider running against an aging establishment politician. But let’s not pretend his identity (oysterman, tattooed veteran, Joe Six-Pack) isn’t at least part of his appeal. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>The point is this: Until the fever breaks, Democrats might want to give more consideration to what they’re saying (please, no more <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5465386-democrats-avoid-political-correctness/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">words like “birthing person” or “cisgender</a>”) and to who is speaking.</p>\n<p>This is especially true when it comes to renominating a particular 2028 presidential candidate.
