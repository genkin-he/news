            "description": "<p>Scouting America has agreed to change several of its policies to maintain financial backing from the Pentagon, including that membership in the organization will be based solely on “biological sex at birth and not gender identity,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Friday morning. </p>\n<p>Hegseth, who has threatened to cut ties with Scouting America over its policies of inclusion, said in a video posted on X that the group has agreed to comply with President Trump’s executive order titled “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity.” </p>\n<p>He said the group will review and replace “politicized, divisive and discriminatory language,” end its Citizenship in Society merit badge, introduce a Military Service merit badge and waive registration fees for children of active duty, guard and reserve families, the Pentagon chief said in a 6-minute video. </p>\n<p>“Scouting will also make clear that biological boys and girls will not be allowed to occupy or share intimate spaces together, toilets, showers, tents, anywhere like that,” Hegseth said. </p>\n<p>Scouting America, which is based in Texas, allowed gay youth in 2013 and said that it would begin accepting transgender students in 2017. Girls of all ages were allowed to join the organization starting in 2019. Co-ed explorer and venturing programs have operated for decades. </p>\n<p>Hegseth’s announcement comes as the Pentagon said earlier this month it <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5720505-scouting-america-pentagon-agreement-near/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">was close to an agreement</a> with Scounting America, previously called Boy Scouts, after reviewing its partnership over the past several months, saying the group has made choices in the last decade that “run counter to the values of this administration and this Department of War, including an embrace of DEl and other social justice, gender-fluid ideological stances.”</p>\n<p>Scouting America said in a statement to The Hill that it would implement the changes, including “reinforcing our commitment to Scouting’s foundational ideas: leadership, character, duty to God, duty to country and service.” </p>\n<p>“Throughout this engagement, Scouting America held firm on the core commitments that define us. We maintained our name as ‘Scouting America’ and preserved our service to the more than 200,000 girls who participate in our programs,” the group said in a lengthy statement. </p>\n<p>“Girls have been an integral part of Scouting since the 1960s and have served as leaders and program developers for decades. That commitment is unwavering.”  </p>\n<p>The connection between Scouting American and the U.S. military is deep, as the U.S. military has sponsored Scout troops and supported their activities on military bases for decades. The military has long backed the organization’s National Boy Scout Jamboree. </p>\n<p>Hegseth said the department’s support for Scouting America will be contingent upon making and maintaining the proposed changes in the next six months. After six months, the Pentagon will review its progress and reassess its support.</p>\n<p>“If we’re unsatisfied with scouting America’s progress toward and commitment to the agreed upon reforms, we will find them in violation of the president’s executive order and cease our support,” Hegseth said. “We hope that doesn’t happen, but it could.” </p>\n<p>The Pentagon chief said he thinks the organization should go back to being the Boy Scouts. </p>\n<p>“A group that develops boys into men. Maybe someday,” he said.</p>",

            "description": "<p>It’s hard to watch a baby die.  </p>\n<p>Thirty-five years ago, I was visiting the intensive care unit of Bronx Municipal Hospital. A baby was covered with a red rash, had diarrhea too severe for a diaper to contain, seizures from inflammation of the brain, and was on a ventilator. He was dying of measles.</p>\n<p>Where had he caught the virus? From another child who, like himself, was unvaccinated.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/05/13/722944146/how-public-health-outreach-ended-a-1990s-measles-outbreak-and-whats-different-no\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">In a massive reduction of federal support</a>, public clinics had either closed or severely downsized. There were <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1580601/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">urban bonfires of measles</a> among unvaccinated children in Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles. As a newly hired CDC epidemiologist, I was charged with figuring out how to extinguish the New York bonfire. </p>\n<p>Measles is <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the most infectious human pathogen</a>. Imagine a totally asymptomatic infected person enters a room; within minutes, the virus has <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa060775\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">infected nine out of 10 susceptibles</a>. Two hours after the infected person has left the room, aerosolized virus <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.26.25324620v1.full\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">will infect still more</a>. Absent vaccination, every child will ultimately be infected, whether they live in Bangladesh or Beverly Hills.  </p>\n<p>Once infected, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">10 percent will develop a complication</a>, of which the most lethal are pneumonia and encephalitis. Hospitalization can only provide supportive care, since no effective anti-viral treatment exists. One in a thousand will die. Years after full recovery, one in 10,000 will develop a progressive inflammation of the brain that is always fatal.  </p>\n<p>But we have a defense. One dose of measles vaccine <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">prevents</a> 93 percent of infections — two doses 97 percent. In use since 1968, it has been the subject of thousands of studies, making it one of the world’s most exhaustively scrutinized pharmaceutical agents. At about <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/php/price-list/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$25 a dose,</a> the MMR vaccine (which also protects against mumps and rubella) is among the cheapest of all vaccines. Since measles is the most infectious human pathogen, more than 90 percent of children must be vaccinated to stop epidemic spread. </p>\n<p>We did stop epidemic spread. <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/389290\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Urban bonfires</a> were extinguished through <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/188029\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ad-hoc vaccination</a> programs. More importantly, the entire country was protected through <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK216118/#:~:text=(1)%20Vaccine%20Purchase.,financing%20for%20state-supplied%20vaccines\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">infrastructure improvements</a> — free vaccines for children at or near poverty level, greater financial support for public- and private-sector immunization, enhanced implementation of school vaccination requirements. By the year 2000, ongoing measles transmission in the United States had been <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jid/issue/189/Supplement_1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">eliminated</a>. According to one <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">estimate,</a> 13 million hospitalizations and 85,000 deaths were prevented across three decades with a societal saving of billions of dollars. </p>\n<p>Then attacks on vaccines began, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  </p>\n<p>Kennedy has compared childhood vaccination to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/11/15/rfk-jr-views-conspiracies-false-claims/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“the Holocaust”</a>; vaccination programs at the CDC, he said, are the equivalent of “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/01/politics/rfk-jr-fact-check-confirmation-heading\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nazi death camps</a>.” Federal employees were said to be promoting the “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/11/15/rfk-jr-views-conspiracies-false-claims/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">mass poisoning</a>” of the American public. Vaccine scientists “<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-vaccines-cdc-fascism-abuse-catholic-church-autism-conferences-rcna181605\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">should be in jail</a> and the key should be thrown away.” </p>\n<p>Confirmed last year as Donald Trump’s secretary of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has made good on his rhetoric.  </p>\n<p>He <a href=\"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/adult-non-flu-vaccines/kennedy-removes-all-acip-members-eyes-replacements\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fired</a> all the members of CDC’s independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

In six states, not a single county had protective vaccination rates. </p>\n<p>Then in 2025, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">measles exploded,</a> with more than 2,200 cases across 45 states — the most since the 1990s. More than 70 percent were children, 93 percent were unvaccinated, and 11 percent were hospitalized. Two school-aged children and one adult died. The outbreak began in a <a href=\"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/state-county-mmr-vaccination-data-mask-wide-disparities-school-uptake-researchers-say\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Texas county</a> with an 18 percent under-vaccination rate, then spread in similar outbreaks in Arizona, Utah, Florida, Ohio and elsewhere. Records were shattered in South Carolina, with <a href=\"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/south-carolina-s-measles-outbreak-slows-total-reaches-979\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">more than 900 cases</a> — <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/measles-cases-south-carolina-rise-by-99-310-state-health-department-says-2026-01-09/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">99 in a 72-hour span</a>.  </p>\n<p>Unlike the 1990s resurgence, where most infected preschool children had limited access to care, lack of vaccination among current measles cases <a href=\"https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-01611\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">had been a parental choice</a>. But with the wholesale attack on the vaccine infrastructure, lack of childhood vaccination may soon become families’ only choice.</p>\n<p>Dr. Ralph Abraham, newly appointed CDC second-in-command by Kennedy, was asked about surging measles cases, hospitalizations and deaths, along with the looming possibility of other vaccine-preventable epidemics.

            "description": "<p>The three leading candidates in the competitive Texas Senate Republican primary have all been invited to join President Trump’s Friday stop in Corpus Christi, just days ahead of the Lone Star State’s Tuesday primaries. </p>\n<p>Though Trump is visiting the state in an official capacity, observers are eager to see if the president will address the closely watched Senate race, in which he has yet to endorse. </p>\n<p>Incumbent Sen. Jon Cornyn (R), state Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) and Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-Texas) were invited to the Friday event, a White House official confirmed to The Hill, as they battle for the GOP nod. </p>\n<p>Paxton boasts a lead over Cornyn — roughly 39 percent to 34 percent — according to Decision Desk HQ’s latest <a href=\"https://polls.decisiondeskhq.com/averages/primary-ballot-test/2026-tx-us-senate-gop/texas/republicans-lv-rv-adults-independents\">polling aggregate</a>.

            "description": "<p>Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this week on “Rebuilding American Critical Minerals Supply Chains,” Michael Cadenazzi, Assistant Secretary of War for Industrial Base Policy, <a href=\"https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/critical_minerals_testimony.pdf\">pointed out that</a> the U.S. is more than 90 percent “import-reliant for around 25 critical minerals, and over 50 percent reliant on foreign sources for more than 50” others.</p>\n<p>He added that “a significant and, in some cases, dominant share of the global processing capacity for these and other minerals is consolidated within China’s borders.” </p>\n<p>In fact, the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology — of which I am a member — <a href=\"https://www.biotech.senate.gov/press-releases/biotechnology-for-critical-minerals/\">has reported</a> that the U.S. “is almost entirely reliant on China for over half of its annual consumption for 31 of 35 critical minerals.” These critical minerals and rare earths are key components of everything from cell phones and medical devices to semiconductors and nuclear reactors.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as the commission also has noted, China has not hesitated to exploit America’s dependence on its minerals and rare earths. In late 2024 China cut off U.S. access to gallium and germanium, jeopardizing U.S. semiconductor production, and in April 2025, China tightened exports of six rare earth metals, effectively restricting U.S. access.</p>\n<p>There is no way to assure that Beijing would not employ this tactic again in future; it could elect to further restrict rare earths and mineral exports to the U.S. in order to pressure Washington to accede to its objectives.</p>\n<p>For that reason, both Congress on a bipartisan basis and the Department of War have recognized the urgent need to formulate and implement an all-out effort to ensure that, in coordination with its closest allies, America can become materials- and rare-earths-independent.</p>\n<p>To do so, it must exploit the promise that biotechnology offers. This is why the fiscal 2026 National Defense Authorization Act includes no less than <a href=\"https://www.biotech.senate.gov/press-releases/biotechnology-breaks-through-in-fy-2026-national-defense-authorization-act/\">seventeen provisions</a> “designed to increase the focus on emerging biotechnology access in the defense and intelligence communities.” What we need are a new War Department Biotechnology Management Office and a new strategy for exploiting the benefits of emerging biotechnology.</p>\n<p>All of these efforts will reinforce the government’s role in supporting private sector development and manufacture of new biotechnology advancements to <a href=\"https://www.biotech.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NSCEB-%E2%80%93-Full-Report-%E2%80%93-Sep-30-.25.pdf\">support the warfighter</a>. We are talking about synthetic blood, for example for treating the wounded without the need to refrigerate and transport multiple blood types; bio-cement for rapid runway construction; and heat-resistant materials for weapons systems such as hypersonic missiles.</p>\n<p>The National Defense Authorization Act stresses the need for coordination with NATO allies, many of whom are actively pursuing such biotech advancements. At the same time, NATO’s Defense Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic <a href=\"https://www.diana.nato.int/resources/site1/general/challenges/docs/cha-26-04-human-resilience-and-biotechnologies.pdf\">has launched</a> a major program to support human resilience and biotechnologies.</p>\n<p>The National Defense Authorization Act also calls for the establishment of new biotech leads across the intelligence community and requires expanded intelligence gathering regarding China’s efforts to take the lead in all aspects of biotechnology.</p>\n<p>The War Department is moving quickly to respond to its Congressional mandate. The offices of the Under Secretary for Research and Development and the Under Secretary for Acquisition and Sustainment are collaborating to develop a comprehensive plan to stop the gradual erosion of America’s lead in biotech. </p>\n<p>In his testimony, Cadenazzi outlined a variety of steps that the Department is taking to achieve this objective. One effort that he highlighted is <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/environmental-microbes-as-a-bioengineering-resource\">DARPA’s EMBER program</a>, which aims “to develop a biotechnology-based separation and purification strategy for Rare Earth Elements from underutilized domestic sources such as phosphate mine waste.”</p>\n<p>The War Department is also focused on biomanufacturing, to ensure that new biotech products can be produced at scale, thereby obviating the need for companies to produce their products offshore, which is currently most often the case.  Finally, the War Department is planning a series of what it terms “technology sprints” that under the leadership of Office of the Under Secretary for Research and Engineering, seeks to field biotechnology products within as little as 24 months.</p>\n<p>Maximizing the benefits that biotechnology brings is not solely a Pentagon effort. Biotechnology involves a whole-of-government national security enterprise that ranges from agriculture, to energy, to health, to education. China President Xi Jinping has assigned top priority to his country’s attaining world leadership in biotechnology, and Beijing has been working toward that objective for the past two decades. </p>\n<p>For that reason, Congressional support and the War Department’s initiatives — and indeed those of other agencies — could not be coming a moment too soon. </p>\n<p><em>Dov S. Zakheim is a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and vice chairman of the board for the Foreign Policy Research Institute.

So, I can’t do anything about it.”</p>\n<p>“I would never say that,” he added. “That’s not who I am. … I don’t like that video because that’s just never come out of my mouth.”</p>\n<p>The White House did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>\n<p>President Trump called the men’s hockey team to congratulate and invite them to the White House after <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5750306-trump-posts-about-olympics-on-closing-day-of-games/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5750306-trump-posts-about-olympics-on-closing-day-of-games/\">their victory</a>. During the call, some believed they could hear Tkachuk in the background yelling “Close the northern border,” but he denied those claims on Thursday. </p>\n<p>“I’ve been seeing stuff that people think it’s me. But if you watch the video, it’s not my voice or something that I never say,” Tkachuk said. “I don’t know how that took a storm on its own when I give everything I have here. It’s crazy when things go on social media, how fast they go. I would never say anything like that.”</p>\n<p>Trump made a joke on the phone with the men’s team about having to invite the women’s hockey team, who also won gold at the Olympics, to the White House as well or else he would be “impeached.” </p>\n<p>“We’re going to have to bring the women’s team, you do know that,” Trump said on speaker phone with the men’s team.

            "description": "<p>Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) is demanding reimbursements for his state’s consumers and businesses after the Supreme Court <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5687657-scotus-rejects-trump-emergency-tariffs/\">shot down</a> a majority of the Trump administration’s tariffs last week. </p>\n<p>In a joint <a href=\"https://governor.maryland.gov/news/press/Documents/2.27.26%20Maryland%20Tariff%20Reimbursement%20Request%20Signed%20Final.pdf\">letter</a> to President Trump on Friday, Moore and other state officials said “the financial toll on our state has been significant” due to these tariffs. </p>\n<p>“Maryland is committed to building an economy that works for everyone — one that is competitive, resilient, and fair,” they wrote. “That work depends on a partnership between state and federal governments grounded in respect for the rule of law and a shared commitment to fiscal responsibility. </p>\n<p>“If the federal government collected funds under an unconstitutional policy, it has a legal and moral obligation to return those funds to the people from whom they were taken,” the letter continued.</p>\n<p>Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman and State Treasurer Dereck Davis co-signed the letter. </p>\n<p>The state officials cited <a href=\"https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/7cc03e65-d40a-465f-9e88-09dd53d3502f/jec-fact-sheet-on-cost-of-tariffs-for-families-update.pdf\">findings</a> from the U.S. Joint Economic Committee, which pinned the average American household’s tariff costs at $1,744. Based on this calculation, they estimated that these policies cost Maryland consumers and businesses around $4 billion. </p>\n<p>“I have long said that while tariffs are a tool of international trade, the Trump-Vance Administration has waged war on our families and raised taxes on us all,” Moore said in a Friday press release. </p>\n<p>“This isn’t just about bad policy; this is about the Supreme Court making it clear that these unilateral actions are illegal,” the governor continued. “This $4 billion represents real money taken away from Maryland families—now the Trump Administration needs to do what’s right and pay Marylanders back.” </p>\n<p>The Supreme Court last week ruled it was unlawful for the administration to impose tariffs using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). But it did not lay out guidance in its decision for how lower courts should navigate refund requests. In anticipation of this ruling, several large companies like Costco and Revlon <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5687657-scotus-rejects-trump-emergency-tariffs/\">filed lawsuits</a> seeking financial returns on these tariffs. </p>\n<p>The Kiel Institute for the World Economy found in a January <a href=\"https://www.kielinstitut.de/publications/news/americas-own-goal-americans-pay-almost-entirely-for-trumps-tariffs/\">report</a> that American consumers and importers have borne 96 percent of these costs. </p>\n<p>These findings run counter to the Trump administration’s promises that foreign countries would shoulder the majority of these tariff costs. A recent Washington Post/ABC News/Ipsos poll <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2026/02/22/trump-disapproval-post-poll/\">found</a> that 64 percent of respondents said they did not approve of Trump’s tariffs.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has continued to push these economic policies even after the Supreme Court’s ruling, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5748682-trump-imposes-global-tariff/\">enacting</a> 10 percent global tariffs under a Trade Act provision. Trump later<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5749113-donald-trump-15-percent-global-tariffs-supreme-court/\"> indicated</a> these tariffs would be raised to 15 percent, but it’s not clear if that will happen.</p>",

On Christmas Eve, thieves made off with an entire truckload of <a href=\"https://thehill.com/business/5663922-400k-lobster-theft-costco/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Costco lobsters valued at $400,000</a> from a cold storage facility in Taunton, Massachusetts. This theft was not some smash-and-grab with hooded figures and crowbars. Instead, it was a highly organized scam. The perpetrators impersonated a legitimate trucking company using spoofed emails and fake credentials, picked up the seafood, disabled GPS trackers and vanished into the night.</p>\n<p>That haul of premium seafood likely didn’t make it to anyone’s dinner table. Perishable goods like lobster must be handled and refrigerated to strict standards. Once stolen and unmonitored, they become unsafe for consumption and are often destroyed, while the criminals sell what they can on the black market or walk away with an insurance payout. </p>\n<p>The economic ripple effects hit every link in the supply chain, from carriers like me to small and large retailers and, ultimately, everyday consumers. And it costs the trucking industry <a href=\"https://truckingresearch.org/2025/10/new-atri-research-confirms-the-high-costs-of-cargo-theft-to-industry/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">more than $18 million</a> each day.  </p>\n<p>Cargo theft is no longer just about broken locks or stolen keys. Organized criminal networks impersonate legitimate brokers and carriers, spoof email domains and steal real Department of Transportation numbers to look authentic. Everything appears routine until the freight vanishes. Even as the industry works to defend itself, most victims, including my own company, are small businesses with limited resources facing well-financed, organized criminal networks.</p>\n<p>Once stolen, cargo often disappears into complex resale channels. Some is shipped overseas, some is broken down and sold locally, and much of it simply goes to waste, especially in the case of perishable food.</p>\n<p>The impact on legitimate shippers and carriers is devastating. Insurance premiums skyrocket, reputations are tarnished and many small businesses are pushed to the brink. And because there is no coordinated law enforcement response to investigating cargo theft, these crimes often go unreported, under-investigated or unsolved.</p>\n<p>That’s why Congress must act now to pass the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/2853/text\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Combating Organized Retail Crime Act</a>. This bipartisan bill would establish a centralized operational hub to empower federal, state and local law enforcement to coordinate investigations, share threat intelligence with industry partners and pursue organized crime rings that treat our supply chain like a playground.</p>\n<p>The act would also strengthen legal tools so that theft rings cannot hide behind jurisdictional loopholes, mandate better data tracking and reporting and help reduce the economic and security risks that come with unchecked cargo theft.</p>\n<p>I’ve seen firsthand what happens when freight criminals operate with impunity, and I’ve watched as the system leaves hard-working truckers, carriers and supply chain businesses with few tools to protect themselves or avenues for justice. We cannot allow criminals to treat legitimate commerce as a free resource.  </p>\n<p>Passing the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act isn’t just about protecting freight. It’s about protecting the integrity of America’s supply chain. </p>\n<p><em>Adam Blanchard is principal and CEO of San Antonio-based Tanager Logistics and Double Diamond Transport.
