For the <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/sanae-takaichi-makes-history-as-japans-first-woman-prime-minister\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">first time</a> in its modern history, the country has chosen a woman to lead it. Sanae Takaichi, a 64-year-old conservative, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japans-takaichi-become-prime-minister-after-winning-lower-house-vote-2025-10-21/?\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">has won</a> 237 out of 465 votes in the Lower House and 125 of 248 in the Upper House to become Japan’s first female prime minister. </p>\n<p>Her historic rise is not the result of a feminist breakthrough or generational change. It is the culmination of factional politics and a desire for continuity in an uncertain world.</p>\n\n<p>Takaichi’s path to power was shaped by the internal recalibration of the Liberal Democratic Party following a breakup with its longtime coalition partner, Komeito. The party struck a new alliance with the Japan Innovation Party, creating a tenuous parliamentary majority. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Despite leading a minority administration, balancing competing factions has cemented Takaichi’s image as a pragmatic yet determined leader — a quality that earned her the nickname <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/04/sanae-takaichi-the-new-leader-of-japans-liberal-democratic-party-who-cites-thatcher-as-an-influence?\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Japan’s Iron Lady</a>.</p>\n<p>Behind the symbolism, few expect radical transformation. Takaichi’s <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/japan-s-conservative-iron-lady-plans-to-stimulate-growth-tech-competition-via-massive-public-spending/3722272?\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">economic philosophy</a> mirrors her mentor Shinzo Abe’s “Abenomics.” It involves expansionary fiscal policy, ultra-loose monetary conditions and a belief that government stimulus remains key to Japan’s growth.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>She has already signaled plans for large-scale spending on infrastructure, defense and technology. The Nikkei 225 <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japans-nikkei-extends-record-bonds-stable-takaichi-pm-election-2025-10-21/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rallied</a> after her election, reflecting investor optimism for continued liquidity and state-led stimulus.</p>\n<p>Still, this optimism may prove fragile. Japan’s public debt exceeds <a href=\"https://www.mri.co.jp/en/knowledge/mreview/2023013.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">260 percent of GDP</a>. Another wave of spending could worsen inflationary pressure and further weaken the yen. A soft currency benefits exporters, but it also raises import costs and erodes purchasing power for ordinary households.</p>\n<p>Can Takaichi’s administration sustain economic momentum without stoking financial instability? Her record suggests she will tolerate a weaker yen as the price of national competitiveness, reinforcing the continuity of Abe’s economic model.</p>\n\n<p>However, change is likely in Japan’s <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/japan-s-conservative-iron-lady-plans-to-stimulate-growth-tech-competition-via-massive-public-spending/3722272?\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">geopolitical posture</a>. Takaichi’s nationalism is open and unapologetic. Often compared to Italy’s Giorgia Meloni for her ideological conviction and political discipline, she brings a more assertive tone to Japanese leadership that emphasizes sovereignty, pride and strength.</p>\n<p>Her worldview rests on the conviction that Japan must reclaim a central role in shaping Asia’s strategic future. This means defense spending will rise, continuing the trajectory begun under Abe and Kishida. Japan is already on track to double its defense budget by 2027. Under Takaichi, that goal may accelerate.</p>\n<p>She is expected to push for enhanced missile deterrence, expanded U.S. cooperation and deeper engagement with Australia, the Philippines and South Korea. For Takaichi, security and economic policy are intertwined. Strong defense, resilient supply chains and technological independence define Japan’s survival in a volatile Indo-Pacific.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Her hard line toward China will likely define her early foreign policy. Takaichi has long been critical of Beijing’s assertiveness in the <a href=\"https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20251030_03/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">East China Sea</a> and its stance on Taiwan. </p>\n<p>Her election prompted swift reactions from both capitals. Taipei’s President Lai Ching-te called her a “<a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/10/05/japan/politics/taiwans-lai-congratulates-takaichi/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">steadfast friend</a>,” while China’s foreign ministry warned Japan to “<a href=\"https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xw/fyrbt/202510/t20251023_11739485.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">honor its political commitments</a>” regarding Taiwan. This dynamic hints at a heightened Tokyo-Beijing rivalry in the years ahead, one where Japan asserts itself more openly against Chinese influence.</p>\n<p>Still, Takaichi is not seeking confrontation for its own sake. Her initial gestures toward Seoul, <a href=\"https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10605483\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">calling South Korea</a> an “important neighbor and a key partner,” signal a pragmatic recognition that Japan’s strength depends on its alliances. </p>\n\n<p>The improving Tokyo-Seoul relationship, combined with close ties to Washington, could form a new triangle of cooperation in Northeast Asia. This would bolster Japan’s leverage economically and strategically, positioning it as a pivotal player in regional security and technology supply chains.</p>\n<p>Domestically, Takaichi faces the paradox of being a historic figure leading a party resistant to change. Her cabinet includes only two women. That has fueled debate over whether her rise will advance women’s empowerment or simply reinforce the status quo. </p>\n<p>But her political instincts are clear; symbolism must serve stability. In that sense, she represents evolution without disruption, a conservative reformer steering Japan toward strength through discipline rather than social revolution.</p>\n\n<p>Looking ahead, Takaichi’s Japan will likely be defined by fiscal assertiveness, strategic nationalism and technological revival. Her administration will pour resources into semiconductor production, renewable energy and defense manufacturing under the banner of “economic security.” </p>\n<p>This will deepen Japan’s integration with Western economies while reducing its exposure to Chinese markets. Over time, Tokyo may emerge as a manufacturing hub and a geopolitical anchor, a democratic power balancing Washington and Beijing in Asia’s shifting order.</p>\n<p>The true test for Japan’s Iron Lady will be whether she can convert symbolic history into sustainable progress. Managing a weak yen, an aging population and fragile coalitions will demand pragmatism and resolve. Yet her brand of determined leadership may give Japan the clarity it has long lacked.</p>\n\n<p>Takaichi’s rise is not a revolution. It is the continuation of Japan’s long search for identity, between pacifism and assertiveness, tradition and renewal. But for the first time in history, that search will be guided by a woman whose strength could reshape how Tokyo defines power in Asia.</p>\n<p><em>Ronny P.

As per the Legal Services Corporation’s 2022 report “<a href=\"https://justicegap.lsc.gov/resource/executive-summary/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Justice Gap</a>,” many make these uncertain journeys alone, unable to afford representation. “Most low-income Americans do not get any or enough legal help for their civil legal problems — and the cost of legal help stands out as an important barrier,” the report says.</p>\n<p>Although the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/bill-of-rights-transcript#:~:text=without%20just%20compensation.-,Amendment%20VI,of%20Counsel%20for%20his%20defence.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sixth Amendment</a> guarantees the right to legal representation in criminal prosecutions, there is no such guarantee in obtaining adequate representation for civil matters. Approximately <a href=\"https://justicegap.lsc.gov/resource/section-2-todays-low-income-america/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">50 million Americans</a> have household incomes below 125 percent of the poverty threshold. The Justice Gap study found that low-income Americans do not get adequate legal assistance in <a href=\"https://justicegap.lsc.gov/resource/executive-summary/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">92 percent of civil cases</a>, which often involve securing and protecting basic needs.</p>\n\n<p>What can we do to improve civil representation for low-income Americans? Responsible use of artificial intelligence may be the answer. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>A January 2025 article in the <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/llr/vol57/iss4/2/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review</a> said AI can potentially enhance access to legal aid services. The article referenced <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3210&amp;context=llr\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a study</a> revealing that 21 percent of participating legal aid professionals are already using AI tools to complete routine tasks, freeing them to focus on more complex matters. Because many civil cases involve completing standardized forms, drafting routine letters, or explaining legal documents in plain language, low-income Americans should be able to access such basic services at little to no cost through an AI bot.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the study identified risks such as inaccurate results and <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3210&amp;context=llr\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hallucinations</a> — “the confident generation by AI tools of inaccurate results, such as nonexistent case citations, inaccurate legal information, and incorrect information about court procedures or deadlines.” However, it is difficult to estimate the gravity of potential problems associated with such hallucinations.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The Loyola article cited a separate <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jla/article/16/1/64/7699227?login=false\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2024 research study</a> whose authors found that “LLMs hallucinate between 58 percent (ChatGPT 4) and 88 percent (Llama 2) of the time.” For this reason alone, AI should not be relied upon to make significant legal decisions or recommendations resulting in fines or jail time.</p>\n<p>Regulation is needed at every jurisdictional level, or AI could easily do more harm than good. However, AI can still deliver tremendous benefits to low-income Americans by lowering the cost of basic legal support. Tasks like translating lease agreements into plain English or guiding tenants through standard court forms are well within AI’s current capabilities. For many Americans, these seemingly small actions could mean the difference between stability and crisis. </p>\n<p>Will AI replace junior attorneys altogether?

But it faces stiff headwinds from senators in his own party who have been adamantly opposed to getting rid of the tactic.</p>\n\n<p>A spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) said <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5583744-gop-leader-thune-defends-filibuster-trump/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Thune’s position</a> “on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged.”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) posted on the social platform X that he was a “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5582936-senate-filibuster-john-curtis-trump/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">firm no</a>” on eliminating the filibuster.</p>\n<p>“The filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate. Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t,” Curtis posted.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), while not in the Senate, mostly responded to Trump’s post by pointing out how eliminating the filibuster could boomerang back around to hurt Republicans in the future.</p>\n<p>Johnson argued if Democrats had a majority without the filibuster in place, they would make the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico states, alter the Supreme Court, ban firearms, and “do all sorts of things that would be very harmful for the country.” </p>\n<p>“The filibuster has traditionally been viewed as a very important safeguard. If the shoe was on the other foot, I don’t think our team would like it,” Johnson said. </p>\n\n<p>Trump late Thursday threw a curveball into efforts to end the shutdown with his plea for Senate Republicans to get rid of the filibuster and unilaterally vote to reopen the government. The president made the case that failing to nuke the filibuster, which requires most legislation in the Senate to garner 60 votes, could ultimately harm Republicans politically.</p>\n<p>“If the Democrats ever came back into power, which would be made easier for them if the Republicans are not using the Great Strength and Policies made available to us by ending the Filibuster, the Democrats will exercise their rights, and it will be done in the first day they take office, regardless of whether or not we do it,” Trump posted on Truth Social.</p>\n<p>This week was not the first time Trump has called for an end to the filibuster. He <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/26/donald-trump-kill-the-filibuster-677151\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">did so multiple</a> times in <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/335594-trump-calls-for-end-to-filibuster/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">his first term</a>, using a similar argument that Democrats would try the same thing if they took the majority.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Then-President Biden, then-Vice President Harris and some Democratic senators pushed to alter the filibuster to pass voting rights and abortion legislation, though it <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/politics/senate-voting-legislation-filibuster\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ultimately failed</a> to garner enough support within the party.</p>\n<p>Trump has largely avoided directly weighing in on efforts on Capitol Hill to end the shutdown, and White House allies have argued there is <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5577750-white-house-lacks-urgency-shutdown/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">little incentive</a> for the president to get involved since he has carried out his agenda unabated. Trump’s latest post came on the heels of a trip to Asia, where he worked to broker trade agreements with China, Japan, South Korea and other countries.</p>\n<p>But some close to the president suggested the timing of his filibuster post was a reflection of mounting frustration over Democrats’ continued refusal to back a GOP-led continuing resolution to fund the government at current levels. Any funding measure in the Senate requires at least seven Democrats to join with all 53 Republicans to overcome the filibuster and pass. </p>\n\n<p>“What you’re seeing is an expression of the president’s anger at the situation,” Johnson said. “He is as angry as I am, as the American people are about this madness. And he just desperately wants the government to be reopened so that all these resources can flow to the people who need it so much.”</p>\n<p>Some Senate Republicans have in recent days <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5566292-senate-republicans-filibuster-reform/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">increasingly discussed</a> changing the filibuster’s rules if Democrats do not end the shutdown. But doing so would require a majority of Republicans to back the change, and it’s unlikely the party has the needed support even with Trump’s urging.</p>\n<p>Instead, Thune and other top Republicans have been searching for other ways to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5580101-democrats-republicans-negotiate-aca-subsidies/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">break the stalemate</a> and end the shutdown as it threatens various government programs and causes issues at major airports.</p>\n\n<p>Thune told reporters Wednesday that moderate Democrats are looking for an “off-ramp” to end the shutdown, adding that he’s willing to talk to them about the concessions he has already offered, such as a vote on Democrats’ proposal to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies beyond December.</p>\n<p>Trump on Friday was not asked about the filibuster as he traveled to Florida for the weekend. But he reiterated that he would only meet with Democrats to discuss policy matters after the government was reopened.</p>\n<p>“I’m always willing to meet. All they have to do is open up the country,” Trump told reporters. “Let them open up the country, and we’ll meet. We’ll meet very quickly, but they have to open up the country. It’s their fault. Everything is their fault.”<br/></p>\n</div>",

Mikie Sherrill, the Democrat vying for governor in New Jersey. He will also stump for Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Virginia, hoping to give a last-minute push to both candidates. </p>\n<p>If Sherrill and Spanberger win, it will give a much-needed shot in the arm to Democrats who are still reeling from last year’s devastating election, when Republicans won not only the White House but also the House and Senate. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>While they remain out of power on Capitol Hill, Democrats have also leaned on governors across the nation in the last year — including California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker — to flex their muscle at the state level. </p>\n<p>And Obama, keenly aware of the importance of Democratic governors, is still a trusted messenger in the party. </p>\n<p>“Governors’ races are always under-appreciated on our side but this cycle, it could mean the literal difference in democracy or not,” said Democratic strategist Eddie Vale. </p>\n\n<p>A Gallup poll out earlier this year showed that Obama is the most popular among all five living presidents, receiving the highest approval rating at 59 percent. </p>\n<p>And Vale said Obama “may have a few more gray hairs each cycle” but “still has heat on his fastball coming out of the bullpen.” </p>\n<p>“He is still a great campaigner, can give a barnburner of a speech, and helps turn out key constituencies as part of ‘get out the vote,’” he added. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Since leaving office nearly 10 years ago, Obama has taken a relatively low-key approach when it comes to politics. But he has made it a point to reemerge on the political stage in the weeks before the election to help Democrats win their campaigns. </p>\n<p>This year, in addition to helping Democrats’ campaigns, he has also urged California voters to support Proposition 50, a ballot measure in the state which could reshape the congressional map there and give Democrats up to five seats in the House. </p>\n<p>“California, the whole nation is counting on you,” Obama said in an ad appearing in the state. “Democracy is on the ballot.”</p>\n\n<p>He has also been increasingly outspoken on President Trump and his administration’s policies, and the efforts to weaken democracy. </p>\n<p>“I think there is no doubt that a lot of the norms, civic habits, expectations, institutional guardrails that we had, that we took for granted for our democracy, have been weakened deliberately,” Obama told Marc Maron, on the final episode of the comedian’s podcast. </p>\n<p>The former president’s allies say he, more than anyone, understands the stakes in next week’s elections, and that’s why he has been increasingly vocal in recent weeks. </p>\n\n<p>He is growing worried, allies say, about Trump’s directives and is no longer convinced that the nation can survive another three years of the current administration’s policies. </p>\n<p>“He sees what’s happening and he is distraught, to put it lightly,” one ally to the former president said. </p>\n<p>Still, while Democrats say no one can get out the vote more than Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, they are realistic about their limitations. </p>\n\n<p>“The more we move away from the Obama presidency, the less muscle he has to push,” said one Democratic strategist. “It’s just the reality. We saw that with President Clinton and we’re seeing it now with Obama.” </p>\n<p>The strategist pointed to the 2024 election cycle and how his endorsements of some candidates — including former Vice President Harris — didn’t matter in the end. </p>\n<p>“And that’s with all the buzz around his speech at the convention, and all the rallies in the final days,” the strategist said. “In the end, no one cares about the surrogates. They care about the candidates themselves.”</p>\n\n<p>Rocha agreed with that sentiment. </p>\n<p>“In the multimedia world we’re living in, there is just less and less that endorsements and last minute rallies can do for a campaign overall,” he said. </p>\n</div>",

These orders are meant to be sent to the defense committees within 15 days of being issued, according to the first letter.</p>\n\n<p>“Unfortunately, the Department has not complied with this requirement,” the letter stated.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wicker_reed_joint_letter_southcom_operations.pdf\">second letter</a> sent on Oct. 6 requests a<strong> </strong>written opinion from the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Office of Legal Counsel over the legal basis — domestic or international — for conducting these strikes and related operations.</p>\n<p>The senators also requested a complete list “of all designated terrorist organizations and drug trafficking organizations with whom the President has determined the United States is in a non-international armed conflict and against whom lethal military force may be used.”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“To date, these documents have not been submitted,” according to a Friday <a href=\"https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/sasc-leaders-request-defense-department-orders-and-information-on-counternarcotics-operations\">statement</a> from Reed’s office.</p>\n<p>Tensions <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5584228-us-strikes-venezuela-maduro/\">continue to escalate</a> between the United States and Venezuela as the Trump administration conducts strikes against alleged narco-trafficking boats. The deployment of warships, surveillance planes and fighter aircraft, along with <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5557409-trump-venezuela-covert-operations/\">covert CIA operations in Venezuela</a> seemingly authorized by President Trump, has resulted in speculation around potential military operations aimed at the South American country.</p>\n<p>Trump and his <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5574094-trump-military-action-latin-america/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">close allies</a> have raised the prospects of the U.S. conducting land strikes in Venezuela. The administration has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/trump-covert-cia-action-venezuela.html\">reportedly accused</a> Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro of controlling the transnational criminal gang Tren de Aragua, designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization.</p>\n\n<p>While The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/u-s-eyes-striking-venezuelan-military-targets-used-for-drug-trafficking-cafcfe47?st=tchg4R\">reported</a> that the administration <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5584228-us-strikes-venezuela-maduro/\">identified military facilities in Venezuela</a> used to smuggle narcotics as potential targets for attack, Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday called the reporting on the U.S. deciding to conduct an attack “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5584001-rubio-trump-deny-impending-venezuela-strikes/\">a fake story</a>.”</p>\n<p>Earlier in the day, Trump <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5583516-trump-denies-strikes-venezuela/\">said</a> it’s “not true” that the U.S. was planning to strike Venezuela.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/international/articles/53298-the-us-navy-deployment-near-venezuela-has-become-even-less-popular\">YouGov</a> poll on Friday showed that <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5583482-trump-venezuela-strikes-poll/\">42 percent of Americans oppose military intervention in Venezuela</a>, while 27 percent support it. A majority of those polled oppose a land invasion, the boat strikes and the deployment of U.S. Navy vessels in the waters surrounding the country.</p>\n\n</div>",

But it is no accident. Instead, this design was the product of carefully considered compromises among our Constitution’s Framers.”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Kollar-Kotelly also ruled that the U.S. Election Assistance Commission is permanently barred from incorporating proof of citizenship in federal voter registration. </p>\n<p>“The court’s ruling confirms what we have long argued: the President may not rewrite election law to impose a burdensome show-your-papers rule that would shut out countless Americans from the ballot box,” reads a joint <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/court-strikes-down-key-part-of-trumps-unlawful-voting-executive-order-permanently-blocking-show-your-papers-requirement\">statement</a> from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) about the ruling.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“This executive order was an attempted overreach of power, bypassing the Constitution’s clear allocation of authority to Congress and the states to set election rules,” the statement continued. “Our democracy is strongest when every eligible voter can register and vote free from expensive and unnecessary requirements.”</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5224211-trump-executive-order-citizenship-proof-lawsuit/\">lawsuit</a> against the Trump administration was brought forth by the League of Women Voters Education Fund, League of Women Voters of the United States, League of Women Voters of Arizona, Hispanic Federation, NAACP, OCA-Asian Pacific American Advocates, and Asian and Pacific Islander Vote.</p>\n<p>White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/us/politics/trump-proof-citizenship-voter-registration.html\">told</a> The New York Times that the administration will appeal the ruling. </p>\n\n<p>“President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to ensure only American citizens are casting ballots in American elections,” she said.</p>\n<p>Trump signed the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preserving-and-protecting-the-integrity-of-american-elections/\">executive order in March</a>. Though the order says state governments oversee American elections, “the United States has not adequately enforced Federal election requirements that, for example, prohibit States from counting ballots received after Election Day or prohibit non-citizens from registering to vote.”</p>\n<p>Applicants registering to vote would have to provide proof of citizenship, such as a passport, Real ID or another state- or federal-issued identification that proves citizenship.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Critics said the order would result in large swaths of voters being disenfranchised.</p>\n<p>“There are multiple problems with it,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) told The Hill in April. “The president [of] United States does not control voting laws. The states control voting laws in America, and Congress can regulate, but Congress has not passed anything the president’s talking about.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen voter suppression up close as someone who has run in Georgia numerous times,” Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) also said in April. “Officials in Georgia looked at the anatomy of my win the first time around and they came after it with surgical precision. I had to beat them in court in order to win my race. And so we’re seeing the president play out of the same playbook writ large.” </p>\n</div>",
