Not all: The Gaza ceasefire is a good thing and I hope it holds. But in general, I have a grudging respect for his ability to underperform even my low expectations for his behavior.  </p>\n<p>Seriously, I don’t know how he does it. He is behaving outrageously and ignoring the laws, but you have to admire the creativity. Two weeks ago, did anyone have “<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-white-house-ballroom-57512e0d91432f75529946fddfbfe2c5\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tear down</a> part of the White House” or “punish Canada <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/25/world/canada/trump-tariffs-reagan-ad.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">for quoting Ronald Reagan</a>” on their bingo card? </p>\n\n<p>Trump’s <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115436697060819133\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">decision to impose</a> additional tariffs on Canada for running a television ad is exceptional on multiple levels. In short, Canada ran an ad on American TV stations featuring a 1987 speech in which President Reagan explained why tariffs, in general, are a bad policy that hurts American workers. Trump was so furious about this “fraudulent” ad that he imposed an additional 10 percent tariff on Canadian goods as a punishment and demanded it be taken down “IMMEDIATELY.” </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>You can imagine what happened. Trump may be able to ignore the Constitution, but he can’t ignore the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Streisand-effect\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Streisand Effect</a>. Had Trump done nothing, the ad would hardly have been noticed. Now it’s one of the biggest stories in the country, and millions of people are actively discussing Reagan’s thoughts on free trade. </p>\n<p>Trump’s plans for punishing Canada are <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-adds-10-tariff-canada-004143702.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">probably illegal</a>.  Although non-U.S. citizens acting outside the U.S. are <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2019/19-177\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">not protected</a> by the Constitution, Canada acted <a href=\"https://www.syracuse.com/us-news/2025/10/ontario-runs-anti-tariff-ads-on-us-tv-stations-with-a-surprising-voice.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">inside the U.S.</a> There is also a First Amendment “<a href=\"https://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/censorship\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">right to hear</a>.” So punishing a foreign government for communicating directly and openly with the American people on a topic of immense public interest may well violate the Constitution. It certainly violates the spirit of the Constitution. If someone inside the U.S. had run that ad, they would have unquestionably enjoyed all the protections that the First Amendment has to offer. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>That’s particularly true because the ad was neither incorrect <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fact-checking-claims-that-a-canadian-ad-was-misleading-about-reagans-tariff-warning\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">nor misleading</a>. It uses accurate quotes from a Reagan presidential address and correctly represents Reagan’s views on tariffs in general. Here’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hN_CVvzExpM\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the ad</a>. Here’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5t5QK03KXPc\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Reagan’s speech</a>. Judge for yourself.</p>\n<p>And let’s not forget that even under Trump’s reading of the law, he only has authority to impose tariffs when there is an “<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1701\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unusual and extraordinary threat</a>.” Canada running an ad quoting Reagan is not a threat, extraordinary or otherwise. </p>\n<p>But there is an even more fundamental question here. Trump claims that tariffs are part of his “America First” policy and are designed to make the U.S. economy stronger. Yet he is using them here to punish Canada because he’s personally offended by its efforts to speak directly to the American people. </p>\n\n<p>Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/oct-26-sec-scott-bessent-and-sen-ruben-gallego-plus-marcus-samuelsson-250654277998\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said as much</a>, claiming, “This is a kind of propaganda against U.S. citizens. It’s psy-ops. … What was the purpose of that other than to sway public opinion?” Heaven forbid someone should use a reasoned argument against the Trump administration in public. It is both tragic and hilarious that the Trump White House now considers an effort to foster a discussion as a “psy-op.”</p>\n<p>Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115436697060819133\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">also claims</a> that this ad might influence the Supreme Court as it <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/major-questions-dog-trump-tariff-war-as-scotus-wades-in/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">considers a challenge</a> to his authority to impose tariffs at all. I have serious concerns about the conservative majority’s objectivity, but even I have to admit that the idea the court will be swayed by a TV ad is ludicrous.</p>\n<p>This new tariff on Canada is part of a pattern. Trump also imposed a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/brazil-lula-trump-popularity-16a7cdc30ffd1812c43d9c84d0572520\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">50 percent punitive tariff</a> on Brazil — in the process increasing the <a href=\"https://www.nationalbeefwire.com/beef-imports\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cost of hamburger</a> in American supermarkets — because he was mad that former president Jair Bolsonaro was being prosecuted for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xrqxk9p4xo\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">attempting to overthrow the Brazilian government after losing an election</a>. There is no economic justification for this tariff, and Trump never pretended there was.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Indeed, there is no economic justification for any of this. Neither the Brazilian tariff nor the Canadian tariff will protect a single American job. They will, however, cost American businesses and consumers billions of dollars as things like lumber, fertilizer, coffee and beef become more expensive. Trump is using American trade policy simply for his own amusement.  </p>\n<p>There is some encouraging news, however. On Wednesday, the Senate <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5580167-senate-vote-trump-canada-tariffs/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">voted to rebuke Trump</a> by expressly removing his authority to impose such tariffs. But if you are expecting congressional Republicans to finally stand up to Trump, don’t get your hopes up. This effort garnered a total of four Republican votes, meaning 49 Republican senators still show no signs of an ethical pulse. </p>\n<p>Whether imposing tariffs or tearing down parts of the White House, Trump has made the entire federal government his own personal vanity project. Once you divorce American policy from American interests and make it about Trump’s whims, there’s no telling what you are going to get.   </p>\n\n<p>It is going to be a long three years. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fliberaldemocracy.substack.com%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7CCKulat%40thehill.com%7Cf3bf282d6bd045d7301508de17edbd05%7C9e5488e2e83844f6886cc7608242767e%7C1%7C0%7C638974507892777561%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C60000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=9x05yQjhyJ3hyaudGwLpF7FWaTHe93fS%2F4khQEEfTyY%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Chris Truax</em></a><em> is an appellate attorney who served as Southern California chair for John McCain’s primary campaign in 2008.</em>  </p>\n</div>",

But rather than look to reform bank oversight or fire bad regulators, some lawmakers would throw money at the problem and impose additional regulations.</p>\n<p>Adding more regulations will not fix the problem when regulators are not enforcing existing ones. Banks can already use the Fed’s <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/financial-stability/bank-term-funding-program.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bank Term Funding Program</a> and the discount window to access emergency liquidity. They do not need additional support.</p>\n\n<p>In the 1980s, savings and loans institutions collapsed for many of the same reasons Silicon Valley Bank did. Rising interest rates reduced the value of asset holdings to the point where they were unable to meet deposit liabilities. </p>\n<p>Congress passed a bailout that left taxpayers on the hook for <a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/savings-and-loan-crisis\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$124 billion</a> in insolvent assets. Increasing deposit coverage will only undermine the solvency of the Deposit Insurance Fund and shift the cost onto taxpayers in the event of a meltdown.</p>\n<p>The U.S. already has the highest deposit insurance coverage of any country, and <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/less-one-percent-accounts-are-above-fdic-limit\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">99 percent of accounts are already fully covered</a> by the current limit of $250,000.

The <a href=\"https://www.protectingtaxpayers.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/The-Cost-of-Deposit-Insurance-Increases.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">estimated costs</a> are huge: The FDIC would need to raise more than $10 billion from banks immediately and would take more than $1 billion in premiums out of the banking system annually. For reference, banks paid <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/financial-reports/2024-annual-report-section2-financial-highlights.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">around $12 billion</a> to the Deposit Insurance Fund in 2024.</p>\n<p>These costs will be passed on to consumers in the form of decreased lending. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/cfr/working-papers/2022/cfr-wp2022-10.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the FDIC’s own research</a> shows that expanded deposit insurance raises borrowing costs and reduces lending. </p>\n<p>The new proposal will also sow confusion among depositors who believe they are automatically covered under the new $10 million limit. Bifurcating the deposit insurance coverage will only create complications.</p>\n\n<p>The government should not pick winners and losers by rewarding poorly managed banks. Expanding coverage creates a moral hazard by preventing customers from evaluating a bank’s true financial health. </p>\n<p>Rather than expect competing banks to responsibly steward their customers’ money, this proposal would incentivize customers to shift their deposits to smaller banks with a higher deposit insurance limit, creating the very imbalance it seeks to solve. Banks approaching insolvency will also be less likely to react, opting instead to continue making risky decisions to cope with deteriorating finances, as Silicon Valley Bank did in its final days.</p>\n<p>Even with heavy-handed attempts like <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/4173/text\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dodd-Frank</a> to insulate the banking sector, bank failures continue to occur.

Putting up a new condominium or office tower in the city can <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/nyregion/housing-crunch-zoning-new-york.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">take more than a decade</a>; in real estate development, time is money, and the costs of those delays, brought on by onerous approval and permitting requirements, cause the price of any project to skyrocket.  </p>\n<p>One would think that democratic socialist Mamdani would exult at the chance to lower building costs and expand the housing stock, thus alleviating the high price of rents. After all, although many laws have been suspended in New York City, the law of supply and demand still rules. </p>\n\n<p>A survey of New York rents and housing from 2023 found that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/nyregion/apartment-vacancy-rate-housing-crisis.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fewer than 2 percent of the city’s apartments were available to rent</a> — the lowest rate since 1968. Worse, the number was even lower for cheaper units. A more normal vacancy rate would be 5 to 6 percent; in 2021, the rate was 4.5 percent.</p>\n<p>The lack of available housing is pushing out lower- and middle-income earners. Median city incomes are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/nyregion/housing-crunch-affordable-housing.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$70,000 per year</a>; the majority cannot afford to pay <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/rental-manager/market-trends/new-york-ny/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$3,600 per month</a>, which is today’s average cost — more than twice the national average.  </p>\n<p>To Mamdani’s credit, he latched onto the “affordability” issue in New York City and has campaigned on it successfully. The cost of living in New York City is indeed high — at least <a href=\"https://www.rentcafe.com/cost-of-living-calculator/us/ny/new-york-city/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">70 percent higher than the national average</a> — and young people, in particular, have lined up to vote for the 34-year-old in hopes that he can change that.  </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>But reducing the cost of living, and in particular the cost of housing, may require taking on New York’s City Council, which is mainly made up of <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/watch-scathing-report-exposes-what-new-yorkers-think-sanctuary-policies-mamdani-victory-looms\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">extreme leftists</a> and opposes nearly anything that might be construed as business-friendly.   </p>\n<p>The ballot proposals under consideration were written by a Charter Revision Commission set up by Mayor Eric Adams late last year. The commission, which includes 13 members, tackles changes to the city charter, the organizing document for New York’s government. It held public forums throughout the year, aiming to change provisions of the charter that could <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/nyregion/nyc-charter-revision-commission-housing-crisis.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">expedite building</a>; the result is the slate of proposals appearing on the back of New Yorkers’ ballots. </p>\n<p>Proposal 2, titled <a href=\"https://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/what-the-charter-revision-commissions-ballot-proposals-may-mean-for-new-york-citys-housing-production\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“Fast track Affordable Housing,”</a> would grant zoning relief and expedited approval for housing projects financed by the city, which tend to be lower-cost. The city council would be excluded from the approvals process involving mixed-income housing developments in the 12 community districts where the fewest new housing units have been added over the preceding five years.</p>\n\n<p>Proposal 3 would allow an expedited review process for another group of projects, and again   get the city council out of the review process in most cases. </p>\n<p>Proposal 4 would create a new “Affordable Housing Appeals Board,” which would consist of the mayor, the Speaker of the city council, and the president of the relevant borough. Under this provision, a decision by the city council on land use could be overturned by the mayor and the borough president.</p>\n<p>These three ballot initiatives in effect strip power from the city council and enhance the ability of city hall to push through projects. Today, it can take <a href=\"https://www.amny.com/news/city-hall-city-council-ballot-proposals/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">up to nine months</a> to navigate the arcane approval process for new development; the commission wants to change that.  </p>\n\n<p>The net effect would be to release the city council’s grip on real estate development in New York City — a grip that <a href=\"https://nysfocus.com/2025/06/05/rafael-salamanca-bronx-developer-donations\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fattens campaign coffers</a> and is vehemently protected by council members.  </p>\n<p>Mamdani does not dare to cross the powerful city council, which is packed with progressives who support his candidacy. But for someone pitching affordability, his indifference to the success of these ballot proposals is appalling.  </p>\n<p>But then nearly everything about Mamdani’s candidacy, from his <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/22/critics-say-zohran-mamdani-is-antisemitic-he-says-hes-simply-holding-israel-accountable-00416388\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">apparent antisemitism</a> to his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3814417/zohran-mamdani-law-enforcement-nyc-election/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">antagonism toward law enforcement</a>, is appalling.

Just after 10:00 a.m. Monday, the Idaho Statesman published an article titled, “<a href=\"https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/community/canyon-county/article312569587.html\">Child separation, zip ties and rubber bullets: Inside the Idaho racetrack raid</a>.” KBOI, the local CBS affiliate in Boise, quickly <a href=\"https://idahonews.com/newsletter-daily/report-children-among-hundreds-of-people-reportedly-detained-in-wilder-raid\">amplified</a> the story.</p>\n\n<p>By Monday afternoon, local NBC affiliate KTVB had published an article titled, “<a href=\"https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/local/fbi-aclu-of-idaho-press-conferences-wilder-arrests-horse-betting-investigation/277-2b1c845b-f92d-4c14-ab58-969e83f3cc77\">Idaho lawyers, families face more questions than answers after large detainment in Wilder</a>.” The story noted that the ACLU was coordinating with a pro–illegal-immigration organization called PODER of Idaho on a press conference outside the Canyon County Courthouse that afternoon.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>At that <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/aclu-holds-press-conference-following-massive-raid-in-wilder/vi-AA1OQKhi\">press conference</a>, protesters held signs that said things like, “Save America: Dump Trump!” PODER, <a href=\"https://www.poderofidaho.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">whose website</a> uses the word “Latinx,” states that “<a href=\"https://x.com/PoderofID/status/1427338427603701767\">no person is illegal</a>” and has previously lobbied the Idaho Legislature <a href=\"https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/local/idaho-poder-launches-campaign-supporting-legislation-to-allow-a-restricted-drivers-license-for-undocumented-idahoans/277-b020aadf-8941-4ca6-b008-6b73f7632c27\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to allow illegal aliens to receive driver’s licenses</a>. </p>\n<p>By Tuesday, the narrative was firmly set. KIVI, the local ABC affiliate, <a href=\"https://www.kivitv.com/canyon-county/father-speaks-out-after-son-arrested-in-fbi-raid-at-wilder-racetrack\">aired an interview</a> with a father whose son had been arrested by the FBI. The Idaho Press published an article with the headline “<a href=\"https://www.idahopress.com/news/local/families-were-separated-children-were-left-terrified-advocates-speak-at-protest-of-ice-raid/article_89bc6980-edc4-48c2-9e44-5460219471c6.html\">Families were separated. Children were left terrified: Advocates speak at protest of ICE raid</a>.” Even local media from the other end of the state joined in, with KIFI Idaho Falls publishing, “<a href=\"https://localnews8.com/news/2025/10/20/increased-ice-raids-raises-concerns-in-eastern-idaho-following-federal-raid-in-wilder/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Increased ICE raids raise concerns in Eastern Idaho following federal raid in Wilder</a>.”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Governor Brad Little <a href=\"https://gov.idaho.gov/pressrelease/gov-little-comments-on-arrests-in-wilder/\">has defended the raid</a>, explaining that illegal gambling operations “often accompany drug trafficking, animal abuse, illegal weapons trafficking, and large sums of money that end up in the hands of cartel bosses.” The release noted that officers will sometimes “detain others present while processing the scene to ensure the safety of both civilians and officers and to preserve evidence” and added that no children had been taken into custody.</p>\n<p>That same day, the Statesman’s weighed in with <a href=\"https://www.idahostatesman.com/opinion/editorials/article312577546.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an editorial</a> calling the law enforcement action “heartless” and “authoritarianism in action.” </p>\n<p>This sort of cookie-cutter, one-sided left-wing coverage would not surprise anyone in a big blue city like Los Angeles, New York, or Chicago. But this is Idaho, one of the reddest states in the nation. President Trump, who campaigned on mass deportations and strict immigration enforcement, won our state with 67 percent of the vote. He won Canyon County, where the raid occurred, with 72 percent of the vote.</p>\n\n<p>It is fair for Idahoans to ask why our local mainstream media headlines sound like ACLU press releases or Democratic talking points. Despite their local focus, most television and print outlets in Idaho are owned by national conglomerates or hedge funds and staffed from a talent pool that is steeped in left-leaning ideology. Yet for many Idahoans, these outlets remain the only trusted sources for local news — largely because there is so little competition.</p>\n<p>Conservatives have complained of media bias for decades, and this story helps illustrate why. Local journalists rallied around a single narrative — that ICE is immoral, that enforcement of our laws is illegitimate, and that we should just turn a blind eye to alleged criminality rather than hurt people’s feelings by arresting them. It’s as if they all got the same memo, and they all regurgitated its contents.</p>\n<p>How stories are framed can dramatically shape perceptions. Under President Barack Obama, the media described “temporary detention centers,” which under Trump became “kids in cages.” The same policy, reported in different ways, produced very different reactions.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Even Idahoans who voted for Trump and support deportations in principle might second-guess themselves after reading such headlines. And that is the entire point. It goes without saying that none of these outlets published anything remotely sympathetic about the families of the two local women who were arrested and charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol. </p>\n<p>The U.S. is an incredibly diverse country. Americans from New York City, Miami, rural Kansas, and Wilder, Idaho may lead very different lives and hold vastly different opinions. Yet news narratives today are consolidated and packaged from a single perspective, then disseminated through local outlets nationwide. Idahoans who subscribe to the Statesman for local news and high-school sports scores are given controversial stories framed exactly the same way The New York Times frames stories for its readers.</p>\n<p>When reporting so dramatically diverges from the deeply held values of a community, it erodes trust not only in the press but in society itself. All Americans — whether in red states or blue, cities, suburbs, or rural areas — deserve journalism that reports facts before framing them, separates news from opinion, and reflects the perspectives of the whole community, not just a small but very politically active minority.</p>\n\n<p><em>Brian Almon is chairman of Idaho’s District 14 Republican Party, a trustee of the Eagle Public Library Board, and editor of the <a href=\"https://gemstatechronicle.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gem State Chronicle</a>.</em> </p>\n</div>",

He assured her of his complete support but suggested waiting a day or two to make his endorsement public. Harris <a href=\"https://www.borderreport.com/news/harris-pleaded-with-biden-for-speedy-endorsement/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pushed back</a>. “Joe, I’m honored, but we live in a twenty-four-hour news cycle, and if you wait that long, the airwaves will be full of nothing but questions,” she told him. </p>\n<p>Harris was right. </p>\n\n<p>Setting aside whether Biden should have endorsed Harris at all, the timing really did matter once he had chosen to do so. And three factors made it especially urgent in her case: time pressure, the lack of public succession planning, and the presence of ambitious rivals ready to pounce. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Long gone are the days when news arrived with the morning paper. We live in a 24-hour news cycle, amplified by social media, where every hour of silence becomes its own story, every delay spawns a thousand hot takes, and every vacuum gets filled.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/01/21/camelots-end-kennedy-vs-carter-democratic-convention-1980-224030/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1980 Democratic Convention</a> offers an example. Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) had challenged sitting President Jimmy Carter in the primaries and lost. At the convention, Kennedy’s speech was eloquent and powerful, but it was hardly an endorsement of Carter. Kennedy focused more on his own legacy and platform, and when it came time for the traditional unity moment with Carter, Kennedy avoided the crucial “hands-raised” photo op with the candidate. The toxic atmosphere poisoned Carter’s general election campaign against Ronald Reagan — and it took Democrats 12 years to recover.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Yes, Kennedy was a defeated rival, not a sitting partner. But the communications lesson still stands: A weak or delayed endorsement creates space for dissent to gain momentum. </p>\n<p>Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) understood this in 2020. When <a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fcampaign%2F484684-clyburn-endorses-biden-ahead-of-south-carolina-primary%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7CCKulat%40TheHill.com%7Cd09b00e391ac4d303ef308de0abd0817%7C9e5488e2e83844f6886cc7608242767e%7C1%7C0%7C638960006109913997%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C60000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=X5Obt9Coac31RkRStabnyIE0WHh1D7hRo9GtQiikfkg%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">he endorsed</a> Biden just three days before the pivotal South Carolina primary, with <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/26/808856350/clyburn-endorses-biden-ahead-of-south-carolina-primary\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Biden’s campaign on life support,</a> the timing was surgical. Clyburn didn’t wait until after the primary, when it wouldn’t matter. He moved when his endorsement would have maximum impact, cutting off an emerging narrative of Biden’s inevitable collapse. Biden <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/01/810813892/4-takeaways-from-joe-bidens-big-win-in-south-carolina\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">won South Carolina decisively</a>, then went on to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/485912-five-takeaways-from-bidens-super-tuesday/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sweep Super Tuesday</a>.  </p>\n<p>The business world tells a similar story. When Steve Jobs <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2011/08/24Steve-Jobs-Resigns-as-CEO-of-Apple/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">resigned as Apple CEO</a> in 2011, the company announced Tim Cook as his successor the same day, with Jobs’s strong recommendation in the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2011/08/24Letter-from-Steve-Jobs/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">resignation letter</a> itself. The clarity was needed; Jobs died just six weeks later. Critically, Cook had also been publicly positioned as the successor long before the announcement, <a href=\"https://quartr.com/insights/business-philosophy/tim-cook-s-impact-on-apple-and-his-special-bond-with-steve-jobs\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">serving as acting CEO</a> during Jobs’s medical leaves. This gave the market and the company time to see him in the role. When the formal transition came, it was definitive, but not shocking.</p>\n\n<p>Although corporate transitions are different, the same communications principle applies: Clarity prevents confusion.</p>\n<p>Harris faced a perfect storm. With just 107 days until the election, there was no time for a prolonged contest or even a hint of ambiguity. Yet despite being vice president, she hadn’t been clearly positioned as Biden’s heir apparent. </p>\n<p>This lack of clarity gave rise to speculation. Governors like Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom were already being floated as alternatives. Every hour of silence gave that chatter more room to grow. </p>\n<p>In that environment, delay was dangerous, and it ultimately cost Harris the election. </p>\n<p><em>Candice Bryant is a strategic communications leader with 20 years of experience at the CIA and Google.</em> </p>\n</div>",
