            "title": "Whistleblower: Kash Patel tied up FBI resources during Kirk investigation?",
            "description": "<p>Let’s start with what matters most: when a political activist is murdered on a college campus, the American people expect the FBI to move immediately. No delays. No distractions. Just action.  </p>\n<p>Now, there are serious allegations that in the aftermath of the assassination of Charlie Kirk at a Utah university, the FBI’s elite shooting reconstruction team was delayed in getting to the scene — not because they weren’t ready, but because of a pilot shortage tied to FBI Director Kash Patel’s use of bureau aircraft.  </p>\n<p>According to Sen. Dick Durbin, a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5753195-whistleblower-allege-fbi-jet-misuse/amp/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">whistleblower told his office</a> that FBI pilots who had flown Patel hit federally mandated flight-hour limits, triggering required FAA rest periods. That meant the team tasked with analyzing and reconstructing the shooting scene couldn’t deploy for at least a day. Reuters has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-chief-patels-travel-decision-making-hampered-investigations-senate-democrat-2026-02-24/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> it could not independently verify those claims. The FBI has strongly denied the allegations, with spokesperson Ben Williamson calling them “ridiculous” and saying Director Patel was on official travel at the time.  </p>\n<p>Here’s why this matters.  </p>\n<p>The FBI director is required, for security reasons, to travel on government aircraft, even for personal trips, and must reimburse the government at the cost of a commercial flight. That’s not new. What is new is the scrutiny over how frequently those planes are being used and whether those decisions are affecting operations.  </p>\n<p>Durbin alleges this isn’t an isolated concern. He also points to the response to the Brown University shooting, <a href=\"https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/report-patels-sfl-flight-delayed-fbi-response-to-brown-university-shooting-40527333/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claiming</a> Patel’s decision to put the Hostage Rescue Team on standby, instead of activating closer regional SWAT teams, effectively tied up bureau aircraft and forced other responders to drive overnight. The FBI disputes that characterization, noting the incident was initially state-led and saying resources were not delayed because of director travel.  </p>\n<p>So at this point, we have competing narratives. On one side: a senior senator citing whistleblower claims of operational strain and delayed deployments. On the other: the bureau flatly rejecting the accusations and defending Patel’s travel as official and appropriate.  </p>\n<p>But let’s zoom out for a second.  </p>\n<p>The head of the FBI sets the tone. And <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5753195-whistleblower-allege-fbi-jet-misuse/amp/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to Durbin</a>, Patel once told field offices, “If you have golf, hockey, fishing, or hunting and beautiful sights, you’re going to see a lot of me.” Maybe that was a joke. Maybe it wasn’t. But leadership optics matter, especially when you’re overseeing time-sensitive, life-and-death investigations.  </p>\n<p>This isn’t about beer in a locker room or optics at the Olympics. It’s about whether taxpayer-funded resources are being managed in a way that prioritizes mission first, every single time.  </p>\n<p>If even the perception exists that travel decisions could delay justice in a murder case, that’s not partisan. That’s a governance issue.  </p>\n<p>The Government Accountability Office and the Justice Department’s inspector general are now being asked to look into it. That’s appropriate.   </p>\n<p>At the end of the day, this is simple: leadership is about judgment. And when you run the nation’s top law enforcement agency, judgment isn’t a side issue — it’s the job.  </p>\n<p><em>Lindsey Granger is a NewsNation contributor and co-host of The Hill’s commentary show “Rising.” This column is an edited transcription of her on-air commentary.  </em> </p>",

Reported proposals for a deal are said to include Iran being permitted uranium enrichment to about 1.5 percent, far below the 60 percent enriched uranium it currently possesses. Another proposal is allowing Iran to enrich uranium for medical purposes. </p>\n<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Wednesday that the talks taking place in Geneva are primarily focused on Iran’s nuclear program, despite the U.S. warning that Iran’s ballistic missile capabilities pose a threat to the U.S. and its allies.</p>\n<p>Trump has also brought up Iran’s human rights violations, its killing of an <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-deaths-in-irans-crackdown-on-protests-reach-at-least-7000-activists-say/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-deaths-in-irans-crackdown-on-protests-reach-at-least-7000-activists-say/\">estimated thousands </a>of protesters during mass demonstrations between December and January; Iran’s support for terrorist proxies — such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza — and Iran’s responsibility in the death of American service members. </p>\n<p>Lawmakers are looking to hold a vote on a <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5753315-trump-iran-military-force-resolution-fails/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5753315-trump-iran-military-force-resolution-fails/\">war powers resolution</a> to block the president from taking military action against Iran without approval from Congress. </p>\n<p>While there is bipartisan agreement that the <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5756532-trump-iran-strikes-regime-change/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5756532-trump-iran-strikes-regime-change/\">Iranian regime</a> is a threat to the U.S. and its allies, some lawmakers warn the president is not making the case for urgent action. </p>\n<p>“A war with Iran today is both unnecessary and dangerous,” Sen.

            "description": "<p>While most of America has been celebrating the awesome victory of our Olympic hockey team over Canada for the first time in 40 years, not everybody is so pleased with them. Sound crazy, right? But a New York Times columnist for their Athletic subsection, Jerry Brewer, wrote a column saying that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/7068426/2026/02/24/usa-mens-olympics-hockey-gold-donald-trump/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the team “won gold — and then lost the room.”</a>  </p>\n<p>What? What room, the feminist studies department at some sports-hating, fun-killing liberal arts college? Because I think most people are pretty happy about the win, even if you don’t like or care about hockey. I fully admit this is the most interested I’ve been in hockey since I was a kid in Detroit in the ’ 90s, watching our Red Wings win the Stanley Cup. </p>\n<p>So what gives?  </p>\n<p>Well, The New York Times, and some other liberals, are mad that some members of our hockey team had the audacity to meet with President Trump. Shake his hand, even. Accept medals from him, and praise. How shocking! How horrifying! Don’t they know they are helping to normalize fascism!?! </p>\n<p>Seriously, that’s it. That’s the problem. </p>\n<p>Brewer writes: “These are men who thrilled a nation and rocked the world, and as adults, they need to be more savvy. Trump, perhaps more than most modern presidents, understands the optics of standing next to winners. It normalizes him. It softens his cruel instincts and crude jokes, recasting them as locker-room banter. It washes his reputation and reduces the impact of polls that indicate a significant majority of Americans disapprove of his second term.  </p>\n<p>These champions have agency. In the afterglow of triumph, they have more agency than they ever will. They should be wary of giving it away so casually.” </p>\n<p>OK, but here’s the problem with that: supporters of Trump are the majority of the country. He won the election and the popular vote. Trump is normal now. Sorry about that. </p>\n<p>I would agree that it doesn’t help us at all for professional athletes to lean way into politics, or start talking about their views on issues. In fact, the hockey team avoided doing just that. But coming to the State of the Union, taking a photo with Trump — come on. That is normal. It’s normal no matter who the president is. Remember Barack Obama <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Barack_Obama_with_artistic_gymnastic_McKayla_Maroney_2.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">taking a photo</a> with Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney?  </p>\n<p>I don’t remember people being upset about that. I wasn’t. I thought it was a cool photo! </p>\n<p>The New York Times needs to get over itself. Chill out. There’s nothing wrong with the president being excited about the performance of our Olympians, and our athletes receiving some much deserved admiration. </p>\n<p>Ironically, the one athlete the liberal media did seem eager to celebrate was Eileen Gu, a traitor <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/19/sport/eileen-gu-china-us-controversy-winter-olympics-intl-hnk\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">who chose to compete on China’s Olympic team.</a> You’d think that if we’re so worried about normalizing totalitarianism, we’d be more upset about an athlete choosing to associate herself with one of the world’s most brutal and authoritarian regimes: Communist China. </p>\n<p>But liberal Vox <a href=\"https://x.com/AGHamilton29/status/2026487801684889941\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hailed Gu as a “winner”</a> of the narrative surrounding the Olympics. And they said the US Men’s hockey team were losers because they met with Trump. Losers.  </p>\n<p>Ridiculous. And mainstream media wonders why so many Americans hate them? </p>\n<p><em>Robby Soave is co-host of The Hill’s commentary show “Rising” and a senior editor for Reason Magazine.

James Talarico in the Texas Democratic primary for the Senate.</p>\n<p>“Listen up, y’all, early primary voting is happening right now in Texas, and we need Jasmine Crockett to win. She is running for U.S. Senate,” Cardi B <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/iamcardib/\">said in a story posted to her Instagram</a> account. </p>\n<p>“And if you want somebody that’s gonna fight for your rights, if you want somebody to fight for your community, if you want somebody that’s gonna go up there and represent you and represent your issues, please vote for my sister, Jasmine Crockett,” she added. </p>\n<p>Crockett touted the rapper’s endorsement on X. </p>\n<p>“Okurrr,” Crockett <a href=\"https://x.com/JasmineForUS/status/2027052834189943032\">wrote on X</a>. “Y’all heard my good sis!!! She’s on a SOLD OUT tour and still took a minute to tap in. We’ve got 2 days of Early Voting left. Let’s gooooo!!! <a href=\"https://x.com/hashtag/JasmineForUS?src=hashtag_click\">#JasmineForUS</a><a href=\"https://x.com/hashtag/TexasTough?src=hashtag_click\">#TexasTough</a>” </p>\n<p>Crockett is running against Talarico next Tuesday in the highly contested Democratic primary for Senate.

As such, she has an obligation to execute her oath of office and abide by U.S. laws,” she added.</p>\n<p>The closed-door meeting, which Ramirez described to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/dhs-shutdown-noem-meets-democrat-called-impeachment-rcna260683\">NBC News</a> as “heated and tense,” came as Democrats have <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5753121-dhs-funding-hakeem-jeffries-ice-reforms/\">repeatedly insisted</a> that they will not support a DHS funding measure unless it includes <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5722486-democrats-dhs-reform-funding/\">new restrictions</a> on federal law enforcement officers participating in the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration crackdown.</p>\n<p>Ramirez said she asked Noem to commit to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5751577-white-house-dhs-shutdown-tsa-precheck-global-entry/\">policy changes</a> in several areas, including prohibiting officers from entering sensitive locations, a standardized use of force policy, an end to “warrantless” arrests and searches and better standards of care for migrants in ICE detention facilities.</p>\n<p>“If there was any hope that she would recognize just how dysfunctional, how unlawful her agency has operated — it was very clear to me that she has no interest in really acknowledging all of the ways that her leadership continues to fail,” Ramirez told NBC News.</p>\n<p>The Illinois Democrat, who serves on the Homeland Security Committee, asked for the meeting in December after claiming she had not been given access to the requested information about DHS’s actions and tactics or the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois.</p>\n<p>She also said requests for a meeting with leaders in the Chicago field office had gone unanswered, according to a letter from her office.  </p>\n<p>“It’s been months since I requested the meeting, and DHS has only escalated its campaign of lawlessness and abuses of power.

            "description": "<p>The United Kingdom’s far-right political activist Tommy Robinson completed a tour at the State Department on Wednesday after meeting with one of Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s senior advisers.  </p>\n<p>A State Department spokesperson told The Hill that the anti-immigration advocate was there in an “unofficial capacity” for a tour.</p>\n<p>Robinson toured the department’s diplomatic reception room among other spaces at the invitation of senior adviser Joe Rittenhouse.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://x.com/Overlord26/status/2026708849848205801?s=20\">post</a> on the social platform X after the visit, Rittenhouse said he was honored to host Robinson, whom he described as a “free speech warrior.”</p>\n<p>“The World and the West is a better place when we fight for freedom of speech and no one has been on the front lines more than Tommy. Good to see you my friend!” he added in the post. </p>\n<p>Robinson, born Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon, said he visited to make “<a href=\"https://x.com/TRobinsonNewEra/status/2026705173884911868\">alliances &amp; friendships</a>” amid a <a href=\"https://x.com/newsguyusa/status/2024644101749043490\">report</a> that he also met with Kari Lake who heads the U.S. Agency for Global Media. </p>\n<p>However, several British lawmakers and others criticized Robinson’s visit, noting his past history of arrests and documentaries encouraging Islamophobia. </p>\n<p>Emily Thornberry, British Foreign Affairs Committee Chair, said, “Yaxley-Lennon is being touted around Washington as a ‘free speech warrior.’ We need to engage this administration on the difference between that and incitement to violence and racial hatred. There should be no place in any democracy for the latter,” in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/far-right-activist-tommy-robinsons-us-welcome-sparks-british-backlash/\">Politico</a>.</p>\n<p>Others echoed her sentiments noting Robinson’s staunch support from former White House adviser Elon Musk, who covered that activist’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/13/tommy-robinson-says-elon-musk-is-paying-his-legal-costs-as-trial-begins\">legal fees</a> during a court battle related to libel and the UK’s anti-terrorism laws. </p>\n<p>“The Trump administration hosting Tommy Robinson must be a wake-up call. The government needs to include the US in their inquiry into foreign interference in UK politics,” British Member of Parliament Calum Miller wrote in a <a href=\"https://x.com/calummillerld/status/2026968573793440082\">post</a> on X.</p>\n<p>“We cannot stand by while the likes of Trump and Musk meddle in our democracy,” he added.</p>\n<p>Robinson’s visit comes amid a broader concern for Islamophobia in Washington after Rep. Randy Fine (R-Fla.) faces <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5742244-randy-fine-censure-calls-muslims-dogs-post/\">calls to be censured</a> for making a social media post comparing dogs and Muslim people. </p>\n<p>Over the past two decades, Robinson has served five prison sentences for assault, harassment, fraud and contempt of court. </p>\n<p>Robinson joined an English branch of Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West and later co-founded the English Defence League (EDL), a now deflated Islamophobic social movement. </p>\n<p>In 2011, a judge sentenced him to a 12-month community rehabilitation order for starting a 100-man brawl, during which he chanted, “EDL till I die.” </p>\n<p>The fight broke out at a soccer match and resulted in Robinson’s completion of 150 hours of unpaid work and a three-year ban from attending football matches, as reported by the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-suffolk-14278957\">BBC</a>.</p>\n<p>Last year, Robinson organized a “Unite The Kingdom” anti-immigration rally with more than 100,000 participants, according to <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/london-protests-tommy-robinson-march-musk-starmer-latest-updates-b2827227.html\">The Independent</a>. Authorities were injured during the demonstration, and more than a dozen arrests were made.</p>\n<p>Robinson fled the United Kingdom after police warned him that he’d been identified in an Islamic publication as someone “to commit violence” against.</p>\n<p><em>Max Rego contributed</em>.</p>",
