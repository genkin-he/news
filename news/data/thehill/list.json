But the Trump administration <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/455888-us-officially-withdraws-from-cold-war-era-arms-pact-with-russia/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">formally pulled the U.S.</a> from the agreement in August 2019 after it declared that the 9M729 was in breach of the treaty and could fly far beyond the treaty’s limit of 500 km, which Russia denied.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Critics at the time worried that the move, which produced no proper follow-on agreement, would spur an arms race. </p>\n<p>That concern appears to have come to fruition, with Trump earlier this week <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5580424-trump-directs-pentagon-to-start-testing-nuclear-weapons/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">directing the Pentagon</a> to immediately start testing nuclear weapons on an equal basis to Russia and China. That came after Moscow said it had successfully tested the Burevestnik cruise missile on Oct. 21 and a new atomic-powered and nuclear-capable underwater drone on Tuesday. </p>\n<p>Russia’s use of the 9M729 includes an Oct. 5 flight of more than 1,200 km before it hit Ukraine, a source told Reuters.</p>\n\n<p>“Russia’s use of the INF-banned 9M729 against Ukraine in the past months demonstrates (President Vladimir) Putin’s disrespect to the United States and President Trump’s diplomatic efforts to end Russia’s war against Ukraine,” Sybiha said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Ukraine for months has pressed the Trump administration to help boost Ukraine’s long-range firepower via U.S.-made Tomahawk missiles, arguing it would help bring Russia to the table for peace talks. </p>\n<p>But Moscow, which began its war in Ukraine in February 2022, has warned Washington that providing the missiles would be a dangerous escalation. Trump has said the transfer would be dangerous, difficult and impractical, due to the training needed to use the weapons. </p>\n</div>",

But even they balk when confronted with what it would mean for workers.</p>\n<p>This truth was made clear last week in a high-profile Senate hearing. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) asked a shop steward from the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers about the union demand for government-imposed arbitration when employers and unions can’t quickly agree on a first contract. This policy is the basis of Sen. Josh Hawley’s (R-Mo.) <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/844/text\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Faster Labor Contracts Act</a>. In the same hearing, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?si=Jqm6Hr3u6i_3uOPk&amp;v=o_lRpFmmVsM&amp;feature=youtu.be\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said that he’s a “strong supporter”</a> of Hawley’s bill because it’s aligned with Democrats’ PRO Act — a wish-list of union leaders’ priorities.</p>\n\n<p>Cassidy <a href=\"https://www.help.senate.gov/hearings/labor-law-reform-part-2-new-solutions-for-finding-a-pro-worker-way-forward\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">explained this policy</a> in real-world terms, saying that it would “take workers out of the process by removing the need to ratify a contract.” He put a finer point on it by saying that if the government mandated arbitration, workers “cannot reject” the resulting agreement, even though it would be binding on them. “What would happen,” he asked, “if workers lost that ability to ratify a contract?”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The union official didn’t mince words: “that would be removing the democracy from the workplace.” Then he doubled down: Such democracy “is the whole point of the union,” he said, because it gives workers “a say.” In a few short words, that union official, a Democratic witness, rejected one of the Democrats’ and labor’s biggest policy priorities.</p>\n<p>I was testifying in the same hearing, and I struggled to contain my surprise. True, Cassidy had not mentioned the Faster Labor Contracts Act by name. Nor did he call out the PRO Act. But he didn’t have to. By focusing on the actual policy instead of the bill name, he highlighted how unjust both Hawley’s proposal and that of the Democrats really is. Each hurts workers in the name of helping them. When you strip away the window dressing, even a shop steward won’t accept it. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>And this was a shop steward from Hawley’s home state of Missouri, brought in by Democrats to support their agenda, including Hawley’s bill. If he can’t support that anti-democratic reform, who can?</p>\n<p>The timing couldn’t have been more awkward. Just a few weeks earlier, the Senate had held another hearing that <a href=\"https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/40740aa3-053a-9b1c-c218-ae057606d3e8/OBrien%20Testimony.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">prominently featured a union president</a> endorsing Hawley’s bill. Yet awkward or not, the shop steward is right on the money. There’s nothing fair or democratic about taking away workers’ right to vote on contracts that dictate their jobs. There is nothing fair or democratic in letting government impose its will regardless of workers’ wishes.</p>\n<p>And a union shop steward isn’t the only one who knows it — Americans do, too. <a href=\"https://www.uschamber.com/employment-law/what-american-voters-really-think-about-unions\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">New polling</a> from the Chamber of Commerce shows that 90 percent of voters oppose government-mandated union contracts that workers don’t approve. It makes sense: It’s hard to support the gutting of workplace democracy.</p>\n\n<p>That’s not to say that workers don’t need stronger protection of their rights. They most certainly do. But a real reform wouldn’t put government in control at the back end of a union election. The better path is to put workers in control at the front end.</p>\n<p>Workers really need the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4154/text\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Employee Rights Act</a>, which protects them in numerous ways. To start, it guarantees that unionization elections use the secret ballot, preventing the public “card check” voting system that encourages intimidation and harassment. It also lets workers decide what contact information union organizers receive, protecting their privacy and that of their families. </p>\n<p>These are just a few of the pro-worker reforms in the Employee Rights Act, which Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) introduced in the Senate in mid-October. This bill will ensure that workers’ voices are truly heard.</p>\n<p>The Faster Labor Contracts Act and the PRO Act would do the opposite, stifling workers’ voices at the hands of the federal government. This isn’t the pro-worker reform it’s chalked up to be. But don’t take it from me. Take it from the union official who admitted the truth — this union demand is anti-worker and undemocratic.</p>\n<p><em>F.

He’s stayed busy by traveling to Asia, calling for prosecutions of his political enemies and leading a demolition of the East Wing to make room for his ballroom, among other actions. Meanwhile, lawmakers are frozen in negotiations, with no clear off-ramp to end the impasse. Washington has been wondering — when will the president get involved?</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>That might be now. Trump late Thursday called for Senate Republicans to employ the “nuclear option” by getting rid of the filibuster. That would allow them to reopen the government with just 51 votes, instead of the required 60-vote threshold needed to advance most legislation in the upper chamber.</p>\n<p><strong>What Trump posted</strong>: “It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD,’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option — Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!” the president wrote on Truth Social. 🔎 <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115466450476422202\"><strong>Trump’s full post</strong></a></p>\n<p>Trump for weeks has blamed Democrats for not voting to reopen the government by blocking the GOP’s stopgap bill. In his post last night, he argued that because Republicans are now in power, they should also nix the filibuster for all the benefits for his administration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How easy is it for Republicans to get rid of the filibuster?</strong>: Republicans hold a 53-seat majority<ins>,</ins> but it’s unclear if enough Republicans would support nixing it.</p>\n<p>Ending the filibuster would be a big deal — it would open the floodgates for the Senate, and many members of both parties are wary of taking that route. Though some lawmakers have expressed openness to making a change to reopen the government.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump may have some hurdles in his party: </strong>Senate GOP Leader <strong>John Thune </strong>(S.D.) has repeatedly said he doesn’t want to remove the filibuster, and Speaker <strong>Mike Johnson</strong> (R-La.) in a press conference this morning also warned of the downsides of nixing the filibuster. Johnson noted he hasn’t discussed this with Trump.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Meanwhile, Republicans are questioning the extended break:</strong></h2>\n<p>Speaker Johnson’s shutdown strategy hasn’t changed: keep the House out of session until the shutdown mess is sorted out. His reasoning? House Republicans did their job by passing a funding extension, so now it’s on Senate Democrats to pass it.</p>\n<p>Well, Johnson’s strategy has kept the House out of session for more than a month during a key stretch, and that is making House Republicans increasingly anxious.</p>\n<p>The House’s last vote was on Sept. 19, making this six-week-and-counting recess the longest since a six-week recess during the 2024 election.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How we know frustrations are building</strong>: Rep. <strong>Marjorie Taylor Greene</strong> (R-Ga.), who has been critical of Republicans’ shutdown strategy since it began, confronted Johnson earlier this week. And Rep. <strong>Dan Crenshaw</strong> (R-Texas) questioned Johnson’s strategy, a source confirmed to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5582283-republicans-house-shutdown-recess-johnson/\">The Hill</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Brace yourselves for when they do return</strong>: “One House Republican familiar with leadership conversations said that members should brace for a jam-packed schedule when the chamber returns — likening it to ‘two-a-day’ football practices. ‘It’s not going to be business as usual. It’s going to be long nights, long days,’ the GOP member said.”</p>\n<p>One early order of business will be swearing in Rep.-elect <strong>Adelita Grijalva</strong> (D-Ariz.). Democrats have repeatedly slammed Johnson for not swearing her in, though he says Democrats must first vote to reopen the government.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read Emily Brooks’s reporting: </strong><a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5582283-republicans-house-shutdown-recess-johnson/\"><strong>‘House Republicans grow anxious about Speaker Johnson’s extended shutdown recess’</strong></a><strong></strong></p>\n<p>💬 <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5581955-live-updates-trump-government-shutdown/\"><strong>Follow today’s live blog</strong></a></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Will food stamps end at midnight?:</strong></h2>\n<p>The Senate left town<ins>,</ins> and the House is out. That means that without any last-minute intervention, food stamp benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will end on Saturday.</p>\n\n<p><strong>There’s one last chance to save them</strong>: A federal judge is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/us/politics/federal-judge-food-stamps.html?smid=url-share\">expected to decide today</a> whether the Trump administration must continue to fund the food stamp program.</p>\n<p>The Hill’s <strong>Alexander Bolton</strong> reports that the lapse in food assistance is forming cracks among Senate Republicans. Republicans have been unified so far, but Saturday’s freeze on the food stamp benefits for nearly 42 million Americans, including millions in Republican-led states, has driven a wedge in the GOP.</p>\n<p>Sen. <strong>Josh Hawley</strong> (R-Mo.) is trying to keep SNAP funded by introducing a bill to keep the benefits intact. There are already 14 Republican co-sponsors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why are some Republicans not on board with Hawley’s plan?</strong>: They blame the shutdown on Democrats. “They think Democrats, in blocking the House GOP funding bill, are the ones to blame for any lapse in SNAP.”  They want to keep pressure on Democrats to end the shutdown.</p>\n<p><strong>Read Bolton’s reporting: </strong><a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5582366-snap-benefits-lapse-senate/\"><strong>‘Republicans battling behind scenes over funding SNAP during shutdown’</strong></a><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>HOW CAN YOU HELP?</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Donating money to your local food bank is the best way to help SNAP recipients who need help putting food on their tables.

Once that stage is reached, however, the change is extremely difficult to reverse. And aspiring authoritarians use other excesses, like a cowed legislature and judiciary, to lock in their power.”</p>\n<p><strong>Does the Times think we’ve already reached an autocracy?</strong>: No. “Our country is still not close to being a true autocracy, in the mold of Russia or China,” the editorial board argues. “But once countries begin taking steps away from democracy, the march often continues. We offer these 12 markers as a warning of how much Americans have already lost and how much more we still could lose.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the editorial: </strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/31/opinion/trump-autocracy-democracy-report.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare\"><strong>‘Are we losing our democracy?’</strong></a><strong></strong></p>\n<p>The Atlantic published reporting today with a similar premise: “It’s getting ever harder to avoid connecting the authoritarian dots.”</p>\n<p><strong>Excerpt</strong>: “Trump is in the process of building his own paramilitary force. He is invoking wartime powers to deport people without due process, even suggesting that American citizens may be sent to foreign prisons. He has deployed National Guard troops to cities over the objections of local officials. In a speech to American troops in Japan, he warned: ‘If we need more than the National Guard, we’ll send more than the National Guard.’ Trump has signaled that he is open to invoking the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law that allows the president to deploy the military in the United States. And he has claimed, without legal justification, that he has the right to order the military to summarily kill people suspected of smuggling drugs on boats off the coast of South America.”</p>\n<p><strong>Read: ‘</strong><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/10/trump-authoritarianism/684773/\"><strong>Trump’s Plan Is Now Out in the Open’</strong></a><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>QUICK HITS</strong>:</p>\n<p>— ABC and ESPN <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5582925-youtubetv-disney-networks-dispute/\">have been taken off YouTube<ins> </ins>TV</a> over a carrier dispute with Disney.</p>\n<p>— Ticket sales at the Kennedy Center <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/10/31/kennedy-center-sales/\">have plummeted</a> since President Trump took it over, according to The Washington Post.</p>\n<p>— NASA tested a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/transportation/5583017-nasa-supersonic-jet-travel-time/\">low-volume supersonic jet</a> that could cut air travel time.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE READS:<br/></strong><strong><br/></strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/us/politics/supreme-court-kagan-jackson-liberal-justices.html\"><strong>The New York Times</strong></a>: The Debate Dividing the Supreme Court’s Liberal Justices</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/colleges-face-a-financial-reckoning-the-university-of-chicago-is-exhibit-a-8918b2b0?mod=hp_lead_pos7\"><strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong></a>: Colleges Face a Financial Reckoning.

These concerns, while not patently unreasonable, must be more than thinly veiled attempts to control students’ thinking and squash debate.

I regularly queried students about whether they felt pressured to answer in-class or examination questions to placate the political or social leanings of their professors. On average, 85 percent answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p>The litmus test is whether the educator’s public statements are likely to inhibit the free exchange of ideas in the classroom. An affirmative answer to this question is presumptively disqualifying because it undermines the educational mission.</p>\n<p>The issue is not whether professors are free to express their views; they are. The issue is whether there can still be a reasonable expectation of a classroom experience in which students can express their own, possibly contrary views, with impunity. </p>\n\n<p>This is a slippery slope and gray areas abound.

A professor who poses thoughtful questions and is prepared to weigh in objectively on either side of the issue can encourage enlightening debate even on the most controversial of issues. </p>\n<p>The problem arises when educators impose their own opinions and use them suppress critical discourse.</p>\n<p>I presented the Summers case to my MBA students with some modification. I asked them to assume there is credible empirical evidence that men have a lower mathematical aptitude than women. I then asked them why economists and university administrators would be interested in the answer. </p>\n\n<p>One student noted that if it is known these differences exist, it would be more efficient to have more women in departments with a strong quantitative component and more men in departments that are less quantitatively oriented. The discussion then turned to the importance of role models and whether efficiency should be dispositive.</p>\n<p>I used the Socratic Method to examine other politically charged issues, including affirmative action and <a href=\"https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2022/03/80774/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">diversity</a>.

What was supposed to be a pep talk from the former president <a href=\"https://x.com/VigilantFox/status/1983922315520844208\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">turned into something else entirely</a>.  <br/> <br/>“He went on to talk about a group of people in Pennsylvania who were saying bad things about me, because they heard I was saying bad things about him. And when I hung up the phone — it was just unbelievable, and yes I was angry. Just deeply disappointed”  </p>\n\n<p>Now imagine that — you’re about to go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump on live television, and your predecessor’s biggest concern becomes whether you like him. That’s not exactly the pre-game energy you want heading into a political heavyweight match.  </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Harris explained why that call hit wrong.  </p>\n<p>“There were only two people in the world that other than me that have debated this guy. Hillary Clinton and him. And you know what it’s like, going into a debate with the stakes being that high and Trump hadn’t agreed to another debate. The stakes were so high.”  </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>She described the moment as “so unnecessary.”  </p>\n<p>And she’s right — timing matters. Especially in politics, when every second is an opportunity to either gain ground or lose momentum. The last thing any candidate needs before a national debate is a lecture about gossip in Pennsylvania.  </p>\n<p>This story came up as Harris promoted her new book, “107 Days,” where she reflects on her short-lived 2024 campaign, her frustrations with Biden, and the lessons she’s still processing. She says she and Biden remain friends; he even called for her birthday. But she admits there were times when he angered her.  </p>\n\n<p>Harris also hints she might not be done with politics just yet. She’s open to running again — though 2024 clearly left a bitter taste in the mouths of many Democrats. Garry South, a Democratic strategist, told The Hill the book shows she’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5581973-carville-criticizes-harris-book/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“blaming everyone but herself for her loss.”</a>  </p>\n<p>In “107 Days,” Harris writes, “Of all the people in the White House, I was in the worst position to make the case that he should drop out. … He would see it as naked ambition, perhaps as poisonous disloyalty, even if my only message was: Don’t let the other guy win.”  </p>\n<p>And that right there — that tension between loyalty and leadership — is what defines so much of today’s Democratic struggle. Harris isn’t wrong for feeling frustrated. But if 2024 taught us anything, it’s that frustration doesn’t win elections: connection does.  </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>While I believe Kamala ran a solid campaign with the short time she had, I can still critique that she leaned on star power more than she spoke to the average American. Democrats can’t afford to keep fighting ghosts of campaigns past. And they certainly can’t afford to continue bringing Biden up at every turn. The future depends on authenticity, not applause.  </p>\n<p>At the end of the day, blaming Biden won’t fix the Democratic message. As I always tell my Republican friends, finger-pointing might win arguments, but it doesn’t win votes. </p>\n<p><em>Lindsey Granger is a NewsNation contributor and co-host of The Hill’s commentary show “Rising.” This column is an edited transcription of her on-air commentary.</em> </p>\n\n</div>",
