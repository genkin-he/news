            "description": "<p>The Pentagon is threatening to use the Defense Production Act (DPA) against Anthropic amid a dispute over the company’s restrictions on its AI tools, in a move that many experts say is an unusual use of the measure.</p>\n<p>The Defense Department (DOD) warned Anthropic on Tuesday that it could invoke the DPA, which gives the president broad authority to control domestic industries in the name of national defense, to use the AI firm’s tool on its own terms.</p>\n<p>The threat marks an <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5752960-pentagon-threatens-anthropic-contract/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5752960-pentagon-threatens-anthropic-contract/\">escalation in the feud</a> between the two parties. Negotiations appear to be at a standstill, with the Pentagon giving Anthropic until Friday to comply with its terms or face a cancellation of a $200 million contract and risk being labeled a “supply chain risk” or confronting the DPA.</p>\n<p>“It’s the wrong purpose of the tool,” Mark Dalton, senior policy director for technology and innovation at the R Street Institute, told The Hill. “The DPA exists for a capacity reason, like it’s an industrial capacity policy, and to use it as leverage is, I think, irresponsible.”</p>\n<p>Anthropic and the Pentagon have been <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5750785-claude-ai-pentagon-contract-risk/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5750785-claude-ai-pentagon-contract-risk/\">locked in tense negotiations</a> in recent weeks over the company’s AI usage policy, which bars its AI model Claude from being used to conduct mass surveillance or develop lethal autonomous weapons.</p>\n<p>These two issues have become the company’s red lines in the dispute. A source familiar with negotiations told The Hill on Monday that Anthropic’s resistance stemmed from concerns that AI systems are not reliable enough to make life-or-death decisions and the technology significantly changes what is possible with domestic surveillance.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Pentagon has pushed for the company to accept language that allows for “all lawful uses.”</p>\n<p>On Wednesday night, the DOD sent its last and final offer to Anthropic, asking the AI giant to allow the department to access Claude for “all lawful purposes,” a senior Pentagon official told The Hill on Thursday. CBS News reported earlier on the offer.</p>\n<p>The Hill has reached out to Anthropic for comment.</p>\n<p>Sean Parnell, chief Pentagon spokesperson, noted Thursday that the department has “no interest in using AI to conduct mass surveillance of Americans (which is illegal) nor do we want to use AI to develop autonomous weapons that operate without human involvement.”</p>\n<p>“Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” he wrote in a post on social platform X. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”</p>\n<p>Under Secretary of War for Research and Engineering Emil Michael, who was at a Tuesday meeting between Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, similarly said Thursday that mass surveillance would be a violation of the Fourth Amendment and the Pentagon would never do it.</p>\n<p>The dispute is notable given that Anthropic’s Claude has so far been the only AI model available to the department on its classified systems.</p>\n<p>However, the department recently reached a new agreement with Elon Musk’s xAI to use its AI model on the classified side, a Pentagon official told The Hill, while Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT are “close.”</p>\n<p>Negotiations came to a head Tuesday, when Amodei met with Hegseth at the Pentagon, and the department gave the company an ultimatum — agree to its terms by 5:01 p.m. EST on Friday or it will cancel their contract.</p>\n<p>The AI company was one of several firms, alongside Google, OpenAI and xAI, that scored a $200 million contract with the Defense Department last summer.</p>\n<p>The Pentagon also upped the ante by raising the prospect of invoking the DPA and “supply chain risk” label.</p>\n<p>While the department may only be employing these threats as negotiating tactics, the potential use of the DPA is drawing scrutiny from experts and Democratic lawmakers.</p>\n<p>“This is unprecedented,” said Charlie Bullock, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Law &amp; AI.</p>\n<p>He underscored that the Pentagon’s DPA threat could fall outside the parameters of the statute or raise constitutional concerns, including under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>“It’s mostly for traditional manufacturing in times of emergency,” Dalton added. “I get that everything feels emergent these days, but I don’t see what national emergency using DPA for a software company solves.”</p>\n<p>Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who is on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Andy Kim (D-N.J.) argued that Congress passed the DPA to aid the U.S. economy in times of needs, not to permit the Trump administration to “extort American companies that refuse to help the Pentagon to surveil Americans or build killer robots.”</p>\n<p>“If Secretary Hegseth weaponizes the DPA against American companies, he will shatter the bipartisan consensus in support of a strong DPA – weakening our hand in competition with China and our ability to ensure American competitiveness,” the pair said in a statement Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Previous administrations have invoked the DPA to boost production of goods during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Biden administration used the measure to up the production of baby formula, clean energy and vaccines, as well as to require AI companies to share safety information with the federal government.</p>\n<p>During his first term, President Trump used the law to address ventilator shortages. He has used the measure in his second term to increase the nation’s production of critical minerals.</p>\n<p>Title I of the DPA allows the president to require individuals or companies to prioritize or accept contracts as is necessary to promote the national defense, according to the Congressional Research Service. Several experts suggested this is likely the portion of the law that the Pentagon would turn to in this case.</p>\n<p>“I don’t believe he’s abusing the law in doing so,” said Greg Williams, director of the Center for Defense Information at the Project On Government Oversight (POGO).</p>\n<p>“However, I think it’s unfortunate the Pentagon is not as interested as Anthropic appears to be in ensuring the safe, lawful and ethical use of artificial intelligence,” he added.</p>\n<p>Neil Chilson, the head of AI policy at the Abundance Institute, who is a critic of the expanding uses of DPA Title I, said the measure’s use in this case is at least within the scope of defense and intent than in previous instances.</p>\n<p>“Because we are talking about DOD procuring services for defense purposes, right? So at least at the very high level, this is closer to the intent of the statute,” Chilson said in an interview with The Hill.</p>\n<p>Still, he said Pentagon’s threat of invoking the DPA is “perhaps more aggressive, even if it’s more within the sort of intent of the statute,” compared to the use of the law by previous administrations.</p>\n<p>Following Tuesday’s meeting, the Pentagon continued turning the screws on Anthropic, reaching out to defense contractors about its reliance on Claude, in what appears to be an initial step toward labeling the company a supply chain risk.</p>\n<p>Lockheed Martin spokesperson confirmed to The Hill that the Pentagon reached out to the defense contractor about its usage of Claude. The spokesperson declined to say when exactly the DOD reached out. Axios first reported on the outreach.</p>\n<p>Boeing Defense, Space and Security, a division of Boeing, does not have an active contract with Anthropic, a spokesperson confirmed to The Hill on Thursday.</p>\n<p>“What seems really sketchy here is this after the fact trying to change the terms of a contract without going through the regular contract negotiation process and what appears to be an abuse of labeling a contract a supply chain risk,” Williams of POGO said.</p>\n<p>“A supply chain risk is somebody who might not deliver on something they’ve agreed to do,” he added. “As far as I understand it, Anthropic is not suggesting they wouldn’t deliver on the terms of their existing contract.”</p>\n<p>James E. Baker, former chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, also argued there is a discrepancy between invoking the DPA and slapping the supply chain risk designation on a company.</p>\n<p>“As [former DOD official] Greg Allen has stated, there is an inherent contradiction between threatening to designate a company a supply chain risk, and using the DPA to compel provision of the company’s services,” Baker, who is now the director of the Syracuse University Institute for Security Policy and Law, told The Hill on Thursday.</p>\n<p>But Chilsonof the Abundance Institute argued the Pentagon could both invoke the DPA and slap the supply chain risk designation on Anthropic.</p>\n<p>“I think logically it would make sense to say, like, we need a tool that lets us make decisions,” he said. “It doesn’t make decisions for us and if you’re not going to provide that tool, then we’re worried about the tools that you are providing to our downstream vendors.”</p>\n<p>Jerry McGinn, director of the Center for the Industrial Base at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, argued that if a company does not want to do work in certain area and under certain conditions, they can pull out of the contract or the government can cancel it.</p>\n<p>“The government has the vehicles they need to stop the work if they want and find another provider,” McGinn said in an interview with The Hill.</p>",

            "description": "<p>A Texas grand jury on Wednesday rejected indictments regarding a fatal shooting involving federal immigration agents that left a U.S. citizen dead last year.</p>\n<p>The grand jury’s decision follows the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5754445-witness-ice-shooting-texas-dies/\">death of Joshua Orta</a>, who was with Ruben Ray Martinez when he was shot and killed by a Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agent while driving in South Padre Island in March 2025. </p>\n<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) claimed Martinez “intentionally ran over” the agent, which caused another agent to fire “defensive shots to protect himself, his fellow agents, and the general public.”</p>\n<p>Lawyers for Martinez’s family called on the Texas Department of Public Safety to disclose its findings after investigating the shooting to determine if Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which HSI operates under, is accurate about why Martinez was killed.</p>\n<p>“Since Ruben’s death a year ago, all we have wanted is justice for him and we have struggled with the silence surrounding his killing,” Martinez’s mother Rachel Reyes said in a <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2026/02/25/texas-ice-shooting-death-grand-jury-no-bill/\">statement </a>obtained by the Texas Tribune. </p>\n<p>“Now, the country is in crisis — and, terribly, heartbreakingly, other families are enduring what we have,” Reyes added. “It’s my hope that attention being raised now into Ruben’s death will help bring the justice we want for him and the answers we haven’t had.”</p>\n<p>The comments come as Democrats <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5748060-funding-department-homeland-security/\">refuse to fund and reopen DHS</a> unless there are substantial changes to immigration enforcement following the killing of two U.S. citizens in Minnesota earlier this year. </p>\n<p>Orta previously told Martinez’s family lawyers about the events of the crash in September and planned to work with investigators before his death. He defended his friend and said Martinez did not hit anyone, as the car was “just crawling as we were trying to turn around,” according to a draft affidavit obtained by The Associated Press. </p>\n<p>Orta said after they arrived at a crash site, they slowed down and started to turn their car after an officer ordered them to, seeing an open alcohol container in the back of their car. Other officers then surrounded their car and drew their guns.</p>\n<p>The officers fired into the driver’s side window without “warning, commands or opportunity to comply,” he added. An officer fired so close to the driver’s side window that bullet casings flew into the car after Martinez was shot. He apologized as he slumped back before officers removed Martinez’s body from the car and handcuffed him.</p>\n<p>A DHS spokesperson told The Hill on Wednesday that HSI special agents were helping local police with a “major accident.” The special agent they claim was struck by Martinez’s blue Ford was hospitalized with a knee injury.</p>\n<p><em>The Associated Press contributed. </em></p>",

Pretti’s shooting, however, resulted in Senate Democrats moving away from backing the bill. </p>",

Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, on Thursday called for President Trump to testify under oath before the committee as part of its investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>\n<p>He did so as the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5756577-clintons-questioned-epstein-links/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">panel conducted a deposition</a> with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Chappaqua, N.Y., and is set to depose former President Clinton on Friday.</p>\n<p>“This committee has now set a new precedent about talking to presidents and former presidents,” Garcia said in a press conference during a break in Clinton’s deposition. “We’re demanding immediately that we ask President Trump to testify in front of our committee and be deposed in front of Oversight Republicans and Democrats.”</p>\n<p>Garcia and other Democrats brought up a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5723968/epstein-files-trump-accusation-maxwell\">report from NPR</a> from this week that said the Department of Justice withheld and removed some Epstein files related to Trump.</p>\n<p>“We want to understand right now, where the missing FBI files are,” Garcia said. “These are files that accuse the president of the United States of serious, serious accusations around sexual abuse and the fact that they’re not in the files, and have been apparently either removed or discarded, is incredibly concerning.”</p>\n<p>The White House has denied any wrongdoing by Trump, and the Justice Department has said the allegations against Trump were found to have no credibility.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5756249-doj-investigates-withheld-fbi-interviews/\">Department of Justice said in a statement is reviewing the matter</a>.</p>\n<p>“Several individuals and news outlets have recently flagged files related to documents produced to Ghislaine Maxwell in discovery of her criminal case that they claim appear to be missing,” it said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/DOJRR47/status/2026769082159112295?s=20\">statement Wednesday</a>.</p>\n<p>“As with all documents that have been flagged by the public, the Department is currently reviewing files within that category of the production. Should any document be found to have been improperly tagged in the review process and is responsive to the Act, the Department will of course publish it, consistent with the law.”</p>\n<p>Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), the chair of the Oversight panel, said earlier Thursday that the panel is looking into the NPR report and looking to get an answer from the Department of Justice about what happened.</p>\n<p>Clinton said in her deposition opening statement that she did not recall ever meeting Epstein, and had no knowledge of crimes committed by him and Maxwell. Garcia said Clinton was “completely cooperating with the deposition and the committee” and “answering questions in full faith and in good faith.”</p>",

            "title": "Florida Republican on Cuba killing 4 on speedboat: 'We need the regime to go'",
            "description": "<p>Florida Republicans are repeating calls for regime change in Cuba in the wake of the Cuban coast guard killing four people and detaining others who were in a Florida-registered motorboat that Havana said crossed into Cuban territorial waters. </p>\n<p>The deadly confrontation adds another layer of volatility between Havana and Washington, amid President Trump’s fuel blockade around the island. Trump imposed the blockade at the end of January to weaken the Cuban communist regime. Last year, Trump designated Cuba as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. </p>\n<p>Rep. Carlos Gimenez (R-Fla.), who was born in Cuba, said Trump’s policies have brought the Cuban regime to the closest point of collapse in its 67 years. </p>\n<p>“The regime is in its weakest position. We have the right president and we have the right secretary of State and the right policies in place in order to make it happen,” Gimenez said on Fox News. </p>\n<p>“Actually I’ve been here for over 65 years. This is, you know, the closest we’ve been to seeing a free Cuba and for me it can’t happen soon enough.”</p>\n<p>Gimenez, who is also a member of the House Homeland Security and Armed Services committees, said he wants to know “exactly what happened” with the Cuban coast guard. </p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the Cuban coast guard said it confronted a Florida-registered speedboat and encountered armed individuals who opened fire, describing them as terrorists. Cuba said four people were killed and six others were detained. </p>\n<p>Gimenez demanded access to the individuals taken into custody. Gimenez described the individuals as Americans, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Wednesday that it’s not yet clear if they are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. </p>\n<p>Gimenez said Cuban officials view any Cuban diaspora as a Cuban national, regardless of other citizenship. He said the boat the Cuban coast guard confronted was a 24-foot open fisherman vessel with a 1,300 horsepower engine. </p>\n<p>“The original story was they were transporting human smuggling and now they’re terrorists. They are changing their story and we need to get to the bottom of it,” he said of Cuban officials. </p>\n<p>Gimenez raised the prospect that Cuba could use the six detained individuals as leverage in the standoff with the U.S.</p>\n<p>Other prominent Florida Republicans have called for regime change in Cuba. </p>\n<p>Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), who is running for governor, posted on the social platform X that the “Communist Cuban regime must go.”</p>\n<p>Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said Cuban leader Raúl Castro should be indicted in a U.S. court and put on trial “for all the Americans he killed.”</p>\n<p>Asked by The Hill if Trump should carry out an operation to capture Castro similar to the operation to seize Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro on a drug charges warrant, Scott deferred and predicted the Cuban people would eventually topple their government.</p>\n<p>“I think ultimately the Cuban people are going to just rise up, because of how bad it is,” he said.</p>\n<p>Trump has not laid out his demands for Cuba but said the fuel blockade could usher in regime collapse. </p>\n<p>Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is taking the lead on Trump’s policy toward Havana. The <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article314847434.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Miami Herald reported Thursday</a> that U.S. officials met on the sidelines of a conference in the Caribbean with Raúl Guillermo Rodriguez Castro, grandson and bodyguard to Raúl Castro, considered the de facto leader in Havana. </p>\n<p>Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month that the U.S. “would love to see the regime change, it doesn’t mean we’re going to make a change.” </p>\n<p>The secretary said that the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Coast Guard are carrying out an independent investigation into what happened with the Cuban coast guard.  </p>",

            "title": "Rove: Trump made 'key mistake' during State of the Union",
            "description": "<p>Republican strategist Karl Rove on Wednesday accused President Trump of making a “key mistake” during his State of the Union address by not pandering to his crowd of disenchanted voters who are seeking relief from financial hardship.</p>\n<p>“For them, the president’s speech almost certainly didn’t sound based in reality. Many Americans, especially swing voters, are pessimistic about the economy,” Rove wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/the-state-of-the-union-is-belligerent-b8d6e7a8\">Wall Street Journal op-ed</a>, highlighting job loss in the manufacturing sector preceding potentially more reductions due to artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>For weeks, Rove has urged Trump to cater to his base of voters plagued by rising costs.</p>\n<p>The strategist bucked the president’s claims that prices are decreasing and that tariffs would replace income tax, alleging that Trump “sounded as out of touch” as former President Biden when he preached “‘Bidenomics is working.’”</p>\n<p>In his Tuesday speech, Trump told listeners the economy was “roaring” and that America was “winning.” Rove said the vigor was motivating yet Trump’s efforts rarely show as material policy. </p>\n<p>“It too often sounded like a political convention speech rather than a presidential address. Even by the former’s standards, it was angry, pugnacious, and hence less effective,” Rove wrote.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Trump offered elements of a credible, effective case for Republicans in the midterm campaign. But if they’re to defend their majority successfully, congressional Republicans must offer more substance, be more forward-looking, display more empathy, and focus much more on the economy than what Americans heard Tuesday,” he added.</p>\n<p>Rove concluded the commentary with a clear call to the GOP: “They better get cracking. Time’s a-wasting.”</p>",

            "description": "<p>Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas) on Wednesday defended Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-Texas), who has recently <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5753069-jordan-declines-gonzales-resignation-call/\">faced pressure</a> over allegations that he had an affair with a staffer who later killed herself.</p>\n<p>“He’s not been indicted for anything. Does it look good? No, I don’t like the appearance of it. He’s got a problem here, don’t get me wrong. The optics are horrible. But I would, in no way, ever resign,” Nehls said Wednesday in a clip that aired on CNN.</p>\n<p>“If he does that, then you got to give the gavel to Hakeem Jeffries. Now, I’m sure the Democrats would love that,” he added later.</p>\n<p>If Gonzales resigns, it would further reduce the already-tight majority Republicans have in the House, at 218 seats to Democrats’ 214.</p>\n<p>Republicans are already dealing with challenging political problems in the form of concerns about affordability, backlash over the files linked to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, President Trump’s low polling numbers and recent Democratic election victories.</p>\n<p>Gonzales on Tuesday <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5753022-texas-rep-gonzales-scandal/\">said he would not step away</a> from Congress as he faced calls to step down.</p>\n<p>“I’m not gonna resign. I work every day for the people of Texas,” Gonzales said on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>“There will be an opportunity for all the details and facts to come out. What you’ve seen is not all the facts,” Gonzales added. “And there will be an ample time for all of that to come out.”</p>\n<p>Numerous Republicans <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5752521-thomas-massie-tony-gonzales-resign/\">have pushed</a> for Gonzales to resign or to stop his reelection campaign in the wake of new details that appear to support the affair allegations.
