            "description": "<p>Republican strategist Karl Rove on Wednesday accused President Trump of making a “key mistake” during his State of the Union address by not pandering to his crowd of disenchanted voters who are seeking relief from financial hardship.</p>\n<p>“For them, the president’s speech almost certainly didn’t sound based in reality. Many Americans, especially swing voters, are pessimistic about the economy,” Rove wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/the-state-of-the-union-is-belligerent-b8d6e7a8\">Wall Street Journal op-ed</a>, highlighting job loss in the manufacturing sector preceding potentially more reductions due to artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>For weeks, Rove has urged Trump to cater to his base of voters plagued by rising costs.</p>\n<p>The strategist bucked the president’s claims that prices are decreasing and that tariffs would replace income tax, alleging that Trump “sounded as out of touch” as former President Biden when he preached “‘Bidenomics is working.’”</p>\n<p>In his Tuesday speech, Trump told listeners the economy was “roaring” and that America was “winning.” Rove said the vigor was motivating yet Trump’s efforts rarely show as material policy. </p>\n<p>“It too often sounded like a political convention speech rather than a presidential address. Even by the former’s standards, it was angry, pugnacious, and hence less effective,” Rove wrote.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Trump offered elements of a credible, effective case for Republicans in the midterm campaign. But if they’re to defend their majority successfully, congressional Republicans must offer more substance, be more forward-looking, display more empathy, and focus much more on the economy than what Americans heard Tuesday,” he added.</p>\n<p>Rove concluded the commentary with a clear call to the GOP: “They better get cracking. Time’s a-wasting.”</p>",

Does it look good? No, I don’t like the appearance of it. He’s got a problem here, don’t get me wrong. The optics are horrible.

            "description": "<p>Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee tore into Republicans on the panel after Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) leaked a photo from inside former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s deposition on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Clinton is testifying as part of the panel’s probe into the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>\n<p>Ranking member Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) said Clinton, who said she <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5756577-clintons-questioned-epstein-links/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">did not recall</a> ever meeting Epstein, was “completely cooperating with the deposition and the committee” and “answering questions in full faith and in good faith.”</p>\n<p>“What is not acceptable is Oversight Republicans breaking their own committee rules that they established with the Secretary and her team,” Garcia said in statements to the press during a break in the deposition. “It was gracious of the Secretary and her team to continue the deposition.”</p>\n<p>“We are sitting through an incredibly unserious clown show of a deposition where members of Congress and the Republican Party are more concerned about getting their photo op of Secretary Clinton than actually getting to the truth and holding anyone accountable,” Rep. Yassamin Ansari (D-Ariz.) said.</p>\n<p>The panel’s deposition of Clinton was paused after conservative influencer Benny Johnson <a href=\"https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/2027067846417690630\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">posted a photo</a> of Clinton in the deposition on social media, which he said came from Boebert.</p>\n<p>A Clinton adviser told the press that the hearing was paused because of the photo, which he said was a violation of the rules read at the start of the deposition.</p>\n<p>Johnson <a href=\"https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/2027080800961720538\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">balked at the photo</a> leading to a pause in the deposition, noting that the Clintons had asked to testify in a public setting and that the full deposition would later be released to the public. House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) said there will be video of the deposition that both sides will have an opportunity to review.</p>\n<p>Asked about the photo when returning to the deposition after a break, Boebert made a reference to the FBI’s investigation into a private email server Clinton used while secretary of State, which dominated the final stretch of her 2016 presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>“I just returned to my hotel room and installed the BleachBit software … So, I guess in regards to taking photos, I do not recall,” Boebert quipped.</p>\n<p>Garcia said that “everybody was very taken aback by the committee rules being essentially not enforced and certainly just broken immediately.”</p>\n<p> He said that after the photo leaked, Clinton’s team continued to ask to let the press into the room because it is important to her that any release of her deposition not be edited.</p>\n<p>Any repercussions for the leak, he said, should come from the Republican majority and Comer.</p>\n<p>“What we’re seeing is political theater. What we’re seeing is folks that are looking for headlines and tweets as opposed to doing the business of going about getting justice for the victims,” said Rep. Wesley Bell (D-Mo.), a former prosecutor. He added: “We have not learned one new thing.”</p>",

            "description": "<p>Rep. Warren Davidson (Ohio) on Thursday became the second House Republican to pledge support for a resolution aimed at limiting President Trump’s ability to take unilateral military action in Iran.</p>\n<p>Davidson wrote in a post on the social platform X that he has requested a classified briefing on the “mission in Iran,” but he intended to back the <a href=\"https://massie.house.gov/uploadedfiles/iranwpr.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">war powers resolution</a> when it reaches the House floor next week, barring “new information.”</p>\n<p>“War requires Congressional authorization.

Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) last week.</p>\n<p>“We respect and defend Congress’s constitutional role in matters of war. Oversight and debate are absolutely vital. However, this resolution would restrict the flexibility needed to respond to real and evolving threats and risks, signaling weakness at a dangerous moment,” they added.</p>\n<p>Trump did not take the possibility of <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5756532-trump-iran-strikes-regime-change/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">military action</a> off the table in his <a href=\"https://thehill.com/video-clips/5752399-watch-live-donald-trump-state-of-the-union-address-2026/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">State of the Union address</a> on Tuesday, even as he pushed for a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754746-vance-us-seeks-iran-diplomacy/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">diplomatic outcome</a> in the ongoing, indirect talks between U.S. and Iranian officials.</p>\n<p>“We are in negotiations with them. They want to make a deal, but we haven’t heard those secret words: We will never have a nuclear weapon,” Trump said during his speech.</p>\n<p>Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi said Thursday that “significant progress” had been made and plans for another round of “technical level” discussions in Vienna next week were in the works.</p>\n<p>“We have finished the day after significant progress in the negotiation between the United States and Iran.

Bernie Sanders’s (I-Vt.) proposal for a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5652830-concerns-ai-data-centers/\">national moratorium on data centers</a>, deeming the idea as an intentional “surrender” to China amid their rapid development of artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>“A moratorium on data centers would — would be like, we might as well wave the surrender flag to China right now. I mean, it is, again — that’d be complete capitulation,” Burgum said during an appearance on Fox Business Network’s “<a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6389974377112\">Mornings with Maria</a>.” </p>\n<p>The Interior secretary added that “adversaries” are the only ones that want the United States to stop building data centers.</p>\n<p>“These data centers, again, they’re not a data center in the traditional sense, these are a place where you manufacture intelligence. We have to manufacture intelligence,” he added.</p>\n<p>In the war for global dominance in technology, China has remained a top sparring partner for the U.S.</p>\n<p>China is home to the world’s largest data center, the China Telecom-Inner Mongolia Information Park, which spans 10.7 million square feet.

            "description": "<p>The family of a sanctioned United Nations human rights investigator on Wednesday sued the Trump administration for sanctioning her over her criticism of Israel’s military actions in Gaza, arguing that the sanctions violate her First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p>U.N. Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese’s husband, Massimiliano Cali, filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of Washington. They argued that Albanese’s work surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, along with her work with the International Criminal Court (ICC), “is core First Amendment activity.”</p>\n<p>“At its heart, this case concerns whether Defendants can sanction a person — ruining their life and the lives of their loved ones, including their citizen daughter — because Defendants disagree with their recommendations or fear their persuasiveness,” according to the filing.</p>\n<p>Cali, who filed the lawsuit on behalf of himself, Albanese and their child, also argued that the sanctions have negatively impacted their ability to access their home in Washington, D.C. Cali said his wife also lost access to her bank account and the ability to travel to the U.S.</p>\n<p>“Sanctions, used appropriately, are a powerful tool to disrupt and undermine the activities of terrorists, criminals and authoritarian regimes,” he said in the complaint. “Sanctions are abused, however, when they seek to silence disfavored points of view and to violate the constitutional rights of people the government does not like.”</p>\n<p>The lawsuit also argues that the sanctions violated her Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights in seizing her property without due process and violating sanction laws. </p>\n<p>“I have experienced enormous hardship,” Albanese told <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/26/us/francesca-albanese-lawsuit-trump-sanctions-israel-gaza.html\">The New York Times</a> in an interview on Thursday, noting that her family worries about risking committing a felony by supporting her. “There is a criminalization of my motherhood and the family bonds I have.”</p>\n<p>The State Department accused Albanese of being an open supporter of “antisemitism, terrorism, and has engaged in lawfare against our nation and our interests, including against major American companies vital to the world economy.”</p>\n<p>“Our sanctions are legal and appropriate,” the department said in a statement to The Hill. “The United States will continue to condemn and oppose her biased and malicious activities, which have long made her unfit for her role. This lawsuit itself is baseless lawfare, and Albanese is a disgrace.” </p>\n<p>The Hill has reached out to the White House for comment. The Department of Justice declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Albanese has been the rapporteur for the Palestinian territories since 2022. She has long advocated for the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and has called for holding Israeli leaders accountable. She has accused Israel of being an apartheid state and said the country has committed genocide in Gaza.</p>\n<p>In July 2025, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued sanctions on Albanese pursuant to President Trump’s executive order sanctioning the ICC. Rubio accused Albanese of antisemitism and “open contempt for the United States, Israel, and the West.” Albanese has denied supporting terrorism and rejected that her criticism of Israel is antisemitic.</p>\n<p>“That bias has been apparent across the span of her career, including recommending that the ICC, without a legitimate basis, issue arrest warrants targeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant,” Rubio said in a <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/07/sanctioning-lawfare-that-targets-u-s-and-israeli-persons\">statement </a>at the time. </p>\n<p>Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, slammed the sanctions as setting a “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5395305-united-nations-us-sanctions-francesca-albanese/\">dangerous precedent</a>.” </p>\n<p>“Special Rapporteurs do not report to the Secretary-General, and he has no authority over them or their work,” Dujarric said at the time. “That being said, Member States are perfectly entitled to their views and to disagree with the reports by the Special Rapporteurs, but we encourage them to engage with the UN human rights architecture. The use of unilateral sanctions against special rapporteurs, or any other UN expert or official is unacceptable.”</p>\n<p><em>The Associated Press contributed.</em><a href=\"https://apnews.com/world-news/israel-hamas-war-tracking-the-gaza-ceasefire\"></a></p>",

Some, such as New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) ordered it the week of his death, while others, such as Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D), ordered flags to be lowered this week. </p>\n<p>In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster (R) directed the flags atop the Statehouse be lowered to half-staff from sunrise to sunset on Mar. 2, the day Jackson will lie in state there. </p>\n<p>Jackson, 84, died earlier this month after a lengthy battle with the neurodegenerative disorder progressive supranuclear palsy. He is survived by his wife, Jacqueline Lavinia Brown, and six children: Santita Jackson, former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.), Jonathan Luther Jackson, Yusef DuBois Jackson, Jacqueline Lavinia Jackson Jr. and Ashley Jackson. </p>\n<p>“A native son of South Carolina, and an icon of the civil rights movement, the Reverend Jesse Jackson was a prominent voice in our nation’s political and cultural dialogue,” McMaster <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HenryMcMaster/posts/a-native-son-of-south-carolina-and-an-icon-of-the-civil-rights-movement-the-reve/1438078651012448/\">wrote on Facebook</a> the day Jackson passed.</p>\n<p>Jackson, a mentee of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., was one of the preeminent leaders of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. He later ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 1984 and 1988, finishing in third and second place in those primaries, respectively. </p>\n<p>His death was met with mourning from across the political spectrum, with many paying tribute to his work throughout the decades. </p>\n<p>“Yesterday, we lost a giant who spent his life on the frontlines of the Civil Rights Movement. He broke down barriers, he inspired generations and he kept hope alive,” Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/reel/1681901792791992\">said on Feb. 18</a>. </p>\n<p>Jackson will lie in state at Rainbow PUSH headquarters Thursday and Friday, before services in South Carolina and Washington, D.C., next week, <a href=\"https://www.rainbowpush.org/reverend_jesse_louis_jackson_sr_celebration_of_life_services\">according to his coalition</a>. There will then be a celebration of life at the House of Hope in Chicago on Mar. 6, followed by homegoing services at Rainbow PUSH headquarters.</p>\n<p>“These homegoing services are welcome to all, Democrat, Republican, liberal and conservative, right-wing, left-wing because his life is broad enough to cover the full spectrum of what it means to be American,” Jesse Jackson Jr. said at a press conference last week. “We only ask people to come and be respectful in the context of the extraordinary life he lived.”</p>\n<p><em>Sarah Davis contributed reporting. </em></p>",

Spaceflight is an incredible privilege, and sometimes it reminds us just how human we are,” Fincke said. “Thank you all for your support.”</p>\n<p>Fincke did not share details about the nature of his medical event.</p>",
