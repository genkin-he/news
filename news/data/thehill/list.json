These commissioners were supposed to serve through 2028 and were the people expected to review President Trump’s new projects, including a <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/10/26/37-white-house-ballroom-donors-funding-300-million-build-tech-ceos-trump/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$300 million White House ballroom</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7e8lv176go\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">triumphal arch near Arlington National Cemetery</a>.  </p>\n<p>Now, they’re gone.  </p>\n\n<p>In an email reviewed by The Washington Post, the White House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/29/trump-fires-arts-board-arc-ballroom\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">made it plain</a>, saying: “On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as a member of the Commission of Fine Arts is terminated, effective immediately.”  </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>A White House official later confirmed the move, saying: “We are preparing to appoint a new slate of members to the commission that are more aligned with President Trump’s America First Policies.”  </p>\n<p>Translation?

It’s the body that weighs in on monuments, memorials and historic buildings, from the Lincoln Memorial to the National Mall. It’s been an independent voice since 1910, advising presidents but not serving them. Until now.  </p>\n<p>Trump’s team has already <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/27/nx-s1-5583793/the-white-houses-east-wing-has-been-demolished-heres-how-americans-feel-about-it\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">torn down the White House’s East Wing</a> to make room for the ballroom, before any formal review could take place. One fired commissioner, Bruce Becker, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/28/trump-arts-commission-firings-ballroom-arch/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> his group “would look forward to a full review of the plans for the new structure that will replace the East Wing” — well, now he’s been terminated.  </p>\n<p>If this feels familiar, it’s because it is. President Biden <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/28/trump-arts-commission-firings-ballroom-arch/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">also fired</a> Trump appointees from the same commission in 2021, and critics accused him of politicizing the arts. But here’s the difference: Biden wasn’t preparing to build a ballroom with his name all over it.  </p>\n\n<p>Trump’s firing spree also extends to another key body, the National Capital Planning Commission, where his allies now hold the majority. That board will likely decide whether the ballroom gets approved. In other words, Trump now controls the referees and the field.  </p>\n<p>This isn’t just about art or architecture. It’s about legacy — and who gets to define it. When you control how Washington looks, you shape how history remembers you. And that’s the real story here: The man who once promised to “drain the swamp” is now redesigning it — in marble, gold, and his own reflection. </p>\n<p><em>Lindsey Granger is a NewsNation contributor and co-host of The Hill’s commentary show “Rising.” This column is an edited transcription of her on-air commentary.</em> </p>\n</div>",

Millions of people will see major price hikes on their plans.</p>\n\n<p>The ACA’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5579055-window-shopping-2026-affordable-care-act-plans/\">window-shopping period</a> started Wednesday, revealing the extent to which expiring tax credits will drive up monthly premiums.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The health research nonprofit KFF said the average increase in premiums for ACA plans will be 26 percent next year.

Without the enhanced tax credit, that would jump to more than $130 per month in 2026. </p>\n<p>“The bottom line is that over 90 percent of marketplace enrollees are currently getting enhanced premium tax credits, which have reduced the amount of their income that they’re expected to contribute to premiums,” said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor and co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms (CHIR) at Georgetown University.  </p>\n\n<p>If Congress doesn’t extend the tax credits, that level of contribution “is going to be much, much higher, up and down the income scale,” Corlette said.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trump administration has done little outreach</h2>\n<p>By the end of October, almost all state-based exchanges will have sent notices to current enrollees informing them of higher premiums and reduced tax credits.</p>\n<p>But the Trump administration this year told insurers on the federal exchange that including premium information in their notices to consumers is voluntary.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, many enrollees won’t know about premium increases unless they log into their HealthCare.gov accounts; people who auto-enroll in plans may not find out until they receive their first bill. </p>\n<p>Less than a week away from open enrollment, the administration has also not yet opened the HealthCare.gov window-shopping period. For each of the past eight years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has launched Affordable Care Act (ACA) window-shopping on either Oct. 25 or 26. </p>\n<p>Senate Democrats on Monday called on the Trump administration to “stop hiding” premium increases and open window shopping immediately. </p>\n\n<p>“The over 24 million Americans relying on the ACA Marketplace for health coverage need clear information from CMS and their health insurance plans, and they need it now,” they wrote in a letter to CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz. </p>\n<p>The administration also slashed funding by 90 percent for federal navigators who help consumers enroll in plans. </p>\n<p>The Trump administration similarly cut ACA navigator funding every year during his first term and cut advertising to HealthCare.gov by 90 percent. When enrollments dropped, the administration said it was evidence the law was failing. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Impacts of subsidy loss will vary by states</h2>\n<p>Some states will fare worse than others. Window-shopping periods have already begun in more than a dozen states. The prices that customers are logging on to see are telling. </p>\n<p>KFF identified five congressional districts in Wyoming, West Virginia, Connecticut and Illinois where a 60-year-old couple making $85,000 would see the largest increases in their monthly premiums, ranging from 535 percent to nearly 700 percent. </p>\n<p>Gideon Lukens, director of research and data analysis on the health policy team for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, gave The Hill the example of a 60-year-old couple and said, “The average increase for that same example couple is typically over $20,000 annually.”</p>\n\n<p>Whether a state has opted to adopt Medicaid expansion, another provision of the ACA, will factor in to how the loss of subsidies will affect states. People in nonexpansion states who are ineligible for Medicaid coverage were particularly reliant on the ACA tax credits and won’t have the added safety net to fall back on.</p>\n<p>The majority of states and Washington, D.C., have already chosen to expand Medicaid, leaving only 10 states that haven’t adopted expansion: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming. </p>\n<p><em>This story was posted at 6 a.m. on Oct. 28 and updated at 1:30 p.m. on Oct. 30. </em></p>\n</div>",

I think that’s very telling.  </p>\n\n<p>GOP voters do not want feckless establishment leadership to succumb to Democrats’ efforts at emotional blackmailing over healthcare coverage, welfare payments and federal employee salaries. Because let’s keep in mind, Democrats are asking for everything. They want to maintain healthcare insurance subsidies that were intended to be a temporary COVID measure. But like most temporary government spending programs, Democrats now expect them to become permanent.  </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Democrats were willing to let the government shut down and say, look voters! Look what those mean Republicans are doing to you! They’re willing to withhold your paycheck, if you’re a government employee. They’re willing to take away your welfare! Blame them! </p>\n<p>Well, it’s not working. Republican and independent voters know that, at this point, the Democrats own the government shutdown. They could vote to end it anytime — Republicans are ready! But Democratic members of Congress are afraid to go along with this, because they fear the anger of their furthest left voters, who are demanding they stand up to the Republicans, even in performative and self-sabotaging ways. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Well, they’re only hurting themselves, because a majority of voters — not everyone clearly, but enough people — are with the GOP on this one. Even CNN’s Jake Tapper sounded <a href=\"https://x.com/america/status/1983379415758450783\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ever so slightly exasperated</a> with congressional Dems.  </p>\n<p>He’s right. I think plenty of Americans have decided that Democrats own this shutdown now. We’ll see how that affects the midterms next year. </p>\n<p><em>Robby Soave is co-host of The Hill’s commentary show “Rising” and a senior editor for Reason Magazine.

But also we’ve got to understand that we cannot just be focused on Donald Trump,” Harris said.</p>\n<p>“We need to not only be against something, but also we need to be understanding of how we got here, and that it’s a bigger apparatus, and not just the one guy,” she told Stewart.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>“But the second point that is equally important, which we’re not emphasizing, is what we stand for,” Harris said.</p>\n<p>Rather than just be “anti-Trump,” she said the focus should be on health care, affordable housing, child care and other issues.</p>\n<p>“People got to know what you stand for so that they’re clear about what they’re fighting for,” she said.</p>\n</div>",
