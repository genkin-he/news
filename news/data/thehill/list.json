            "description": "<p>President Trump declared that the “roaring economy is roaring like never before” during his State of the Union <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5753379-trump-state-union-second-term/\">address</a> on Tuesday. A majority of Americans disagree, according to a new survey.</p>\n<p>The Reuters/Ipsos <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/golden-age-americans-doubt-trumps-claim-booming-economy-midterms-near-2026-02-27/\">poll,</a> released Friday, found that 68 percent of Americans do not believe the U.S. economy is “booming.” Only 30 percent of respondents expressed confidence in the country’s current economic situation.  </p>\n<p>Additionally, an overwhelming 82 percent of poll respondents disagreed with the statement that “there is hardly any inflation in the U.S.” A mere 16 percent of people agreed with this sentiment, according to the survey.</p>\n<p>The results follow a trend in recent polling around <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5751721-trump-approval-ratings-state-of-union/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5751721-trump-approval-ratings-state-of-union/\">Trump’s economic policies</a>. </p>\n<p>A Washington Post/ABC News/Ipsos poll released on Sunday <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2026/02/22/trump-disapproval-post-poll/\">found</a> that 57 percent of respondents disapproved of how the president has handled the economy and 65 percent said they disapproved of his inflation management tactics.

The foundation said this could increase by several hundred dollars this year if these policies remain intact. </p>\n<p>The president has stuck by his tariffs amid pushback and following a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5687657-scotus-rejects-trump-emergency-tariffs/\">recent ruling</a> from the Supreme Court — which <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5747935-trump-tariffs-supreme-court-ruling/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5747935-trump-tariffs-supreme-court-ruling/\">struck down the bulk</a> of Trump‘s levies earlier this month, citing his “illegal” reliance on the 1970’s-era International Emergency Economic Powers Act.</p>\n<p>Trump responded to the court’s decision by <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5748682-trump-imposes-global-tariff/\">imposing</a> a 10 percent tariff on goods imported to the U.S. from countries across the globe under a Trade Act provision.

We were both raised by strong, loving families who taught us the value of hard work, service, and never forgetting where you came from,” Harrison said in a statement shared through Flanagan’s campaign on Friday.</p>\n<p>“We need more leaders like that in Washington,” he added. </p>\n<p>Flanagan, in her own statement, said she was “honored” to have the former DNC chair’s endorsement. </p>\n<p>“His life story is a powerful reminder of what’s possible when communities invest in one another and when leaders never forget where they came from,” she said. “He has always fought for working families and to provide  opportunities for everyone.” </p>\n<p>Harrison’s endorsement is notable given his previous job helming the national Democratic Party. Ken Martin, who previously ran the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) party, succeeded Harrison for the job as DNC chair last year. </p>\n<p>The primary has turned testy between Craig and Flanagan as they vie for the party’s nod to replace Smith. A number of Republicans are running for the GOP nomination, though the Senate Republicans’ campaign arm has made it clear it’s rallying around former NFL journalist Michele Tafoya. </p>\n<p>An Emerson College Polling survey <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5732315-minnesota-gop-faces-challenges/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">released earlier this month</a> showed Flanagan and Craig performing similarly against Tafoya, with the Democrats either polling ahead of Tafoya by either 6 or 7 points.  </p>\n<p>The nonpartisan election handicapper Cook Political Report <a data-id=\"https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/senate/minnesota-senate/gop-struggles-find-candidate-minnesota-senate-shifts-likely\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/senate/minnesota-senate/gop-struggles-find-candidate-minnesota-senate-shifts-likely\">rates</a> Smith’s seat as “likely Democrat.” </p>",

            "description": "<p>On Tuesday, Casey Means had a long-delayed Senate hearing on her nomination to become surgeon general. </p>\n<p>This may be President Trump’s weirdest nomination so far — keep in mind that this is the administration that wanted <a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-president-elect-donald-j-trump-announcing-the-nomination-congressman-matt-gaetz\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to make</a> Matt Gaetz the attorney general of the United States. </p>\n<p>Means, an <a href=\"https://www.caseymeans.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">influencer</a>, got this nomination because her social media accounts and best-selling book helped launch the MAHA movement. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. thinks that makes her the <a href=\"https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1920531616499208409\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">perfect pick</a> for surgeon general, America’s top doctor.</p>\n<p>Except she’s not a doctor — not a practicing one, anyway. She did graduate from Stanford medical school, but she <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/the-nuances-of-casey-means-medical-exit?srsltid=AfmBOooyW99p9-mPfi35INx9txTf_TqwdS5R6cRAK8grJbIdCmySM4BZ\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dropped out</a> of her residency before completing it. Her license is listed as “<a href=\"https://omb.oregon.gov/Clients/ORMB/Public/VerificationDetails.aspx?EntityID=1530903\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">inactive</a>” by the state of Oregon and, by her <a href=\"https://youtu.be/k8vol0gKKyQ?t=5368\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">own admission</a>, she is not able to write prescriptions or practice medicine.</p>\n<p>Right off the bat, this appears to disqualify her from the job. But nothing like this has ever come up before, since no president has ever considered nominating a social media influencer as surgeon general.</p>\n<p>Part of the job description of being surgeon general is being the <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/about/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">vice admiral</a> of the Commission Corps, “an elite group of multidisciplinary officers working throughout the federal government whose mission is to protect, promote, and advance the health of our nation.” But there are requirements for being an officer in the Corps, and <a href=\"https://dcp.psc.gov/ccmis/ccis/documents/CC251.01.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">one of them</a> is that “Each Corps officer must possess and maintain current, unrestricted licensure.”</p>\n<p>In other words, Casey Means is legally ineligible to join the organization that she would be leading.</p>\n<p>Means has also expressed positions consistent with being an anti-vaxxer. She has <a href=\"https://x.com/CaseyMeansMD/status/1820614949334589582\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">come out</a> particularly strong against the Hepatitis B vaccine, claiming that, “The disease is transmitted through needles and sex exclusively. There is no benefit to the baby or the wider population for a child to get this vaccine who is not at risk for sexual or IV transmission. There is only risk.” </p>\n<p>It turns out, that’s <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4246-hepatitis-b\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">not remotely true</a>. Hepatitis B can be spread that way, but it can also be spread through other bodily fluids, including saliva. In the United States, about 640,000 people have “chronic” Hepatitis B, which means they have Hepatitis B for their entire lives. Not only will a Hepatitis B vaccine keep you from catching it as a child, it will also protect you later in life if you do run across someone with chronic Hepatitis B — who often do not know they are infected.<br/> <br/>When pressed by Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), the committee chair, on whether she would recommend the measles vaccine to parents, Means <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/surgeon-general-nominee-faces-scrutiny-over-qualifications-and-views-on-vaccines\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said this:</a> “I’m not an individual’s doctor and every individual needs to talk to their doctor before putting a medication in their body.” Being unable to commit to the most basic public health advice when you’re the surgeon general is a real problem, since giving that kind of advice is your single biggest job. </p>\n<p>In Mean’s case, it’s also jaw-droppingly hypocritical. As a social media influencer, she has regularly made enthusiastic recommendations, telling her fans to take various supplements and claiming that they would, among other things, help cure infertility. Look at <a href=\"https://www.caseymeans.com/learn/3-things-fertility\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this pitch</a> for WeNatal, for example.</p>\n<p>But when it comes to vaccines, even measles and flu vaccines, she does nothing but hedge. It took Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) <a href=\"https://youtu.be/k8vol0gKKyQ?t=6910\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">three minutes</a> just to get her to admit that there is some clinical evidence that flu vaccines are effective.  </p>\n<p>But let’s get back to her inactive medical license. Means <a href=\"https://youtu.be/k8vol0gKKyQ?t=5368\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claims</a> it would be easy to reinstate if she wanted to, but that might not be as easy as she implies.</p>\n<p>In her best-selling book, “Good Energy,” Means talks about her <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2026/02/25/shopping/why-casey-means-book-good-energy-is-sparking-controversy/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">experimentation with psilocybin</a> — “magic mushrooms” — and even recommends that her readers try them. When asked whether, as surgeon general, she would encourage people to use illegal drugs, as she did in her book, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/k8vol0gKKyQ?t=4960\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">she responded</a>, “What I would say as a private citizen is, in many cases, different than what I would say as a public health official.” Some much for honesty, integrity and authenticity, I guess.</p>\n<p>Psilocybin is currently listed as a <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/812\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Schedule 1 narcotic;</a> using or possessing it is a violation of federal law. In Oregon, there is <a href=\"https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_677.190\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a list</a> of 27 things that are grounds for suspending or revoking a medical license. One of those things is “Violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act.” </p>\n<p>As a social media influencer, Casey Means is both interesting and hugely successful. But as a political appointee, she is a hot mess with no business becoming America’s chief public health spokesperson.</p>\n<p>Still don’t believe me? Here’s <a href=\"https://www.caseymeans.com/learn/3-things-fertility\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a quote</a> from her blog: “I believe that freeing my physical and energetic body from the societal, intergenerational, and personal shackles of wounds and expectation and living into my divine, eternally connected, and limitless potential creates a biological reality in my body that is more conducive to creating new life.” Put that on a package of cigarettes.</p>\n<p>Casey Means should not be confirmed as surgeon general. She is unsuited, unqualified and unlicensed. Even Laura Loomer <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5289482-laura-loomer-donald-trump-surgeon-general-nominee-attacks/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">thinks so</a>.

            "description": "<p>In the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling overturning President Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/20/trump-tariffs-supreme-court-ruling-industry-higher-rates.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reciprocal tariffs</a>, many scholars are weighing its significance. The most common interpretation is that the decision was about the <a href=\"https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2026/supreme-courts-welcome-ruling-trumps-tariffs\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">separation of powers</a>, in which Article 1 of the Constitution grants taxing and tariff powers to Congress.</p>\n<p>What should not be lost amid this, however, is how Trump’s trade policy has fallen short of achieving its goals. Thus, even though U.S. imports from China declined significantly last year, the overall <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-trade-deficit-tariffs-china-9eb6bd10ff635d63e46ee99d34ce1d05\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. trade deficit finished 2025 at a record high</a>. American manufacturers also cut an estimated <a href=\"https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/democrats/2026/2/new-data-during-trump-s-first-year-the-manufacturing-industry-lost-108-000-jobs\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">108,000 jobs</a> during Trump’s first year according to a Joint Economic Committee Minority report.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, public opinion polls show that Trump’s <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/699221/trump-approval-rating-drops-new-second-term-low.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">approval ratings have plummeted</a> in part due to concerns households have about many products becoming unaffordable. </p>\n<p>This has not stopped Trump from <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-doubles-down-after-us-supreme-court-strikes-down-global-tariffs/ar-AA1WKgR1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">doubling down</a>, however. He indicated that he would <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2026/02/23/trump-claims-he-doesnt-need-congress-for-tariffs-why-thats-true-yet-misleading/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">impose new tariffs</a> without going through Congress, although the statutes do not grant him as much flexibility as before. </p>\n<p>So, why is Trump doing this? </p>\n<p>Dartmouth Professor Douglas Irwin, an expert on U.S trade policy, contends that the tariffs Trump announced in his second term are “<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/trumps-tariffs-are-unique-in-history-douglas-irwin-trade-policy-protectionism-494d8cff\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unique</a>.” Irwin’s premise is that we are now entering a new era, where Trump is seeking retribution for America’s trading partners taking advantage of the U.S.   </p>\n<p>Trump’s views on trade date back to the 1980s when <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/making-sense/do-trade-restrictions-work-lessons-from-trade-with-japan-in-the-1980s\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Japan amassed large trade surpluses</a>. President Ronald Reagan applied diplomatic pressure to reduce the imbalances, including implementing tariffs and quotas on exports of cars, steel and semiconductors. However, the U.S. trade deficit persisted, and Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/4453481/trump-reagan-folded-japan-switzerland-tariffs/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">criticized Reagan</a> for not being tough enough on Japan. </p>\n<p>When Trump became president in 2017, China had supplanted Japan as having the largest trade surplus, and Trump was determined to take strong action against it. After implementing tariffs on products such as steel, aluminum and solar panels, he followed up with a series of <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/trump-furious-after-supreme-court-upends-his-global-tariffs-vows-new-10-levy/ar-AA1WLCV6\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tariff hikes on Chinese goods</a> that tallied $370 billion. </p>\n<p>Trump eventually reached a truce with China in mid-2019 whereby it would purchase $200 billion additional goods from the U.S. However, China did not adhere to it. Consequently, Trump said he would raise tariffs on China to <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/blog/trump-china-trade-war-proposal/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">60 percent</a> while also applying 10 percent tariffs to other trading partners of the U.S. during the 2024 election campaign. </p>\n<p>One reason for broadening the number of countries was that China skirted U.S. tariffs by establishing manufacturing hubs in Mexico and Vietnam and routed exports through Asian countries. Therefore, Trump wanted to build a shield, so that China could no longer circumvent U.S. tariffs. He also sought to boost tariffs sufficiently high that foreign producers would relocate production to the U.S. </p>\n<p>In his April 2 “<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-trump-announces-broad-tariffs-at-liberation-day-white-house-event\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Liberation Day</a>” remarks, Trump announced the biggest and most widespread tariff hikes since the 1930s. It culminated in a steep selloff of U.S. financial markets and the dollar after the U.S. and China engaged in a tit-for-tat escalation of tariffs. This forced Trump to postpone implementing the tariffs for 90 days and to reach another truce with China. </p>\n<p>Trump was ultimately able to reach agreements with Japan and the European Union in August that provided some clarity on what he was seeking. Japan’s reciprocal tariff rate was lowered to 15 percent from 25 percent, and the EU also agreed to a 15 percent rate, down from 30 percent. These agreements included pledges that Japan and the EU would make <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2025/08/trump-on-eu-and-japan-investments-in-the-u-s/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sizable investments in the U.S</a>. </p>\n<p>Amid this, many investors assumed the main areas of contention were now resolved, and the stock market went on to set record highs. However, this assessment proved premature when Trump began to threaten additional tariffs on countries that displeased him for various reasons, many of which had nothing to do with trade. </p>\n<p>The most egregious was his <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/breaking-trumps-argument-acquiring-greenland/story?id=129349786\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">threat to acquire Greenland</a> either through purchase or military ahead of the Davos Economic Summit in January. Previously, he announced that eight European countries would face <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-europe-greeland/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tariff increases of 10 percent</a> if they did not back him. When EU leaders took a firm stance to challenge Trump, he quickly rescinded the threat. </p>\n<p>There are several lessons to be gleaned from what has transpired in the past year.  First, Trump remains convinced that key trading partners of the U.S. — especially allies of the U.S. — are “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/18/economy/global-trade-relationships-trump-tariffs\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ripping off</a>” America. Second, he views trade as a zero-sum game, in which there are winners and losers based on whether a country runs a surplus or deficit. Third, he believes the way to win the game is with force and intimidation. </p>\n<p>In the process, Trump has ruptured the post-war order and the Western alliance that produced unparalleled peace and prosperity. In its place, there no longer is a rules-based system for trade, and individual countries must fend for themselves while the U.S. and China divvy up the spoils. Meanwhile, chaos and uncertainty reign. </p>\n<p><em>Nicholas Sargen, Ph.D., is an economic consultant and is affiliated with the Darden Business School.  The second edition of his book “<u>Global Shocks”</u> is forthcoming.</em> </p>",

So would be a pretty fun landscape to ride your BMX bike across,” Seeger told NewsNation.</p>\n<p>She added that the area explored by the rover was initially believed to be dry, but researchers now believe the web features “formed because the rock was buried over time and fractured because of all that pressure covering it, and then groundwater flowed through those cracks, and that groundwater was rich in different minerals that could crystallize in those cracks and the surrounding rock.”</p>\n<p>Seeger believes it is unclear exactly what this may lead to, but “following the water” will help their research.</p>\n<p>“We all need water. All sorts of microbes need water,” she continued. “So our investigation on Mars has been about looking for signs that there was water and signs that it was a neutral pH, a good temperature, where microbes could have lived.”</p>\n<p>Seeger added, “So, now that we see this evidence for later-stage groundwater where we could have maybe had microbes living in the subsurface, if they were there, we can keep looking for fossil evidence.”</p>",

            "title": "Iran's proxy network: Diminished, dangerous — and still an administration blind spot",
            "description": "<p>As U.S. carrier groups mass in the Gulf and Tehran signals defiance, Washington faces a strategic trap of its own making. Iran’s proxy network is weaker than at any point in the past decade — yet more volatile, more fragmented, and more likely to turn a “limited strike” into a regional firestorm. </p>\n<p>For years, Iran’s “Axis of Resistance” served as the backbone of its regional strategy. Through the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’s Quds Force, Tehran built a constellation of militias capable of bleeding adversaries and shaping conflicts from Beirut to Sanaa. Funding pipelines, drone and missile transfers, and ideological indoctrination allowed Iran to punch far above its weight. </p>\n<p>That architecture has been shaken by a cascade of shocks: the October 2023 Hamas attack and Israel’s Gaza war; crippling blows to Hezbollah; the 2024 collapse of Bashar al-Assad in Syria; and the U.S.–Israeli “12-Day War” of 2025. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/assad-regimes-collapse-devastating-defeat-iran-rcna183369\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Syria’s fall snapped the land bridge to Lebanon and Gaza</a>. The old hub-and-spoke system didn’t bend — it broke. </p>\n<p>What remains is a loose, improvised confederation. Tehran’s grip is slipping even as its proxies grow harder to neutralize. The Axis is weaker — but wilder. Less obedient. More erratic. And more dangerous in its unpredictability. </p>\n<p>Hezbollah was once Iran’s crown jewel: disciplined, heavily armed, and central to Tehran’s deterrence strategy. The 12-Day War changed that. Israeli strikes <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-says-troops-raided-destroyed-several-hezbollah-sites-in-south-lebanon/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gutted senior commanders</a>, destroyed stockpiles, and exposed vulnerabilities in air defense and communications networks. </p>\n<p>Under a fragile ceasefire, Hezbollah remains capable of firing into northern Israel, but its leadership is cautious, its arsenal depleted, and its political standing strained. Iran is funding a slow rebuild, but the group is no longer the reliable spearhead it once was.</p>\n<p>If Hezbollah is weakened, the Houthis are ascendant. Ansar Allah controls large swaths of Yemen, has survived U.S., British, and Israeli strikes and continues to disrupt Red Sea shipping. Their long range attacks on Israel during the 12-Day War showcased both capability and intent.</p>\n<p>They combine Iranian technology with their own ideological zeal and operational autonomy. They are Tehran’s least controllable partner — and the most likely to escalate in ways that drag the U.S. Navy into direct confrontation. </p>\n<p>Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad emerged from the Gaza war with shattered leadership and minimal offensive capacity. They remain symbolically important to Tehran but operationally diminished.</p>\n<p>Iraqi Shia militias, in contrast, retain significant influence. Groups like Kataib Hezbollah are embedded in Iraq’s political and security institutions, giving Iran leverage over Baghdad while maintaining the ability to strike U.S. forces. Their rhetoric about “martyrdom operations” spikes during crises — but Iraq’s internal politics may restrain them more than Tehran can. </p>\n<p>Assad’s fall in December 2024 was the single most consequential blow to Iran’s regional strategy. The loss of Damascus severed the logistical backbone of the “Axis of Resistance.” Iran’s Syrian militias are now scattered, leaderless and strategically irrelevant. Tehran has shifted to maritime routes through Yemen, covert transfers through Iraq, and dispersed global networks. </p>\n<p>A degraded Axis can still overwhelm Israel through simultaneity. Hezbollah rockets, Houthi drones, and Iraqi militia incursions — even poorly coordinated — could force Israel into a multi‑front crisis that strains its economy, air defenses and public morale. </p>\n<p>The threat is no longer a disciplined Iranian campaign. It is a chaotic storm of actors with uneven capabilities and unpredictable timing. </p>\n<p>Roughly 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria remain exposed to rocket and drone attacks. Tens of thousands more in Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain sit within range of Houthi missiles and Iraqi militia operations. During the 12-Day War, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/pentagon-acknowledges-irans-attack-on-qatar-air-base-hit-dome-used-for-u-s-communications\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. bases were repeatedly targeted</a> — a preview of what a new confrontation could unleash. </p>\n<p>Any strike on Iran risks immediate retaliation across multiple theaters. </p>\n<p>Tehran’s influence has eroded. Its proxies are bruised and fragmented, but they are also more decentralized, more ideological, and less responsive to Iranian control. </p>\n<p>A weaker Axis is not a safer one. It is a wilder one. </p>\n<p>What Washington must do now: First, plan for the proxies — do not treat them as an afterthought. Any U.S. strike must assume immediate retaliation from Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon. That requires simultaneous suppression of Houthi launch sites, Iraqi militia command centers and Hezbollah rocket infrastructure. Sequential strikes invite months of attrition. </p>\n<p>Second, the U.S. should replace maximalist demands with a narrow, enforceable deal. Zero enrichment, zero missiles, zero proxies is not a negotiating position — it is a stalemate generator. A realistic framework for an agreement should include a 20 percent enrichment cap, restored International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring, missile range limits, and incentives for verifiable proxy deescalation.</p>\n<p>Sanctions relief should also be tied to measurable reductions in militia activity, not to abstract promises. </p>\n<p>Iran’s Axis is battered but alive. Its proxies are diminished but dangerous. And its ability to turn a targeted strike into a regional conflagration remains intact. </p>\n<p>If Washington misreads weakness as irrelevance, it risks stumbling into the multi‑front conflict Tehran has spent decades preparing for. </p>\n<p><em>Charbel A.
