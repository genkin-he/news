Ted Cruz (R-Texas) for a “fundamentally ambiguous” line of questioning.</p>\n\n<p>“Fundamental to any false statement charge are both clear questions and false answers.

In an unusual move, Lindsey Halligan, who is now leading the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, is the only attorney to have signed the indictment.</p>\n<p>The sparse indictment doesn’t offer specifics about the exchange on which Comey’s charges are based. But it references questions about whether Comey authorized his deputy Andrew McCabe to leak to the media about an investigation into the 2016 Trump campaign, a line of inquiry only touched on by Cruz.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Cruz initially summarizes testimony Comey gave during a 2017 appearance before Congress, when Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) asked if he’d ever been the source for leaks on the Trump campaign probe. </p>\n<p>Cruz went on to summarize statements from Comey’s then-deputy, Andrew McCabe, statements the filing said “McCabe simply had not made.” Cruz then asked the FBI director who was telling the truth about the alleged leaks. </p>\n<p>Comey said only that he stood by his original testimony.</p>\n\n<p>“After speaking for more than a minute, Senator Ted Cruz asked Mr. Comey to recall statements he had made three years earlier and to simultaneously address statements that Senator Cruz incorrectly claimed were made by Andrew McCabe,” the filing states.</p>\n<p>“In doing so, Senator Cruz never indicated that he wanted Mr. Comey to address the statements or activities of any person except for Mr. McCabe.”</p>\n<p>The Grassley exchange is now beyond the statute of limitations, while Comey was charged just days before the clock would have run out on the 2020 testimony.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>However, confusing matters further, prosecutors have since said in court that Person 1 and 3 referenced in the indictment are not McCabe and Trump but rather a close friend of Comey’s, Daniel Richman, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p>While Cruz’s session included broad statements about authorizing FBI leaks about either investigation, his questions only referenced McCabe.</p>\n<p>“A reasonable person could have understood Senator Cruz’s questions to be entirely unrelated to Mr. Richman or anyone else at the FBI—and to have focused on Mr. McCabe alone,” Comey’s filing states.</p>\n\n<p>“On that reasonable understanding, the indictment contains no allegations that Mr. Comey’s answers were false: it never alleges that Mr. Comey made a false statement regarding Mr. McCabe.”</p>\n<p>Comey is facing another charge of obstructing a congressional proceeding, and his filing complains that his defense team still does not know the basis for the charge and whether it’s even related to the Cruz line of questioning, hindering their defense.</p>\n<p>“To the extent Count Two rests on the same false statements as Count One, that count should also be dismissed for the reasons set forth herein,” Comey’s team wrote in the filing.</p>\n\n<p>“But as it stands, Count Two’s lack of specificity renders it inherently and separately defective for failing to provide adequate notice to Mr. Comey of the charge against which he must defend.”</p>\n</div>",

They, you know, talked a little bit about the connection between cocaine and fentanyl, although I’m not convinced that what they said was accurate,” said Rep.

They’re going to see who’s responsible, and there’ll be a price to pay for that politically.”</p>\n<p>The government shutdown continues to stretch on as Republicans attempt to pass a “clean” continuing resolution (CR), a bill that would temporarily fund the government while both parties negotiate over a larger full-year funding bill. </p>\n\n<p>But the CR’s passage has hit a wall over its lack of funding for expiring Affordable Care Act (ACA) enhanced <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5555854-aca-health-insurance-tax-credit-fight-congress/\">premium tax credits</a>. Democrats <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5549619-democrats-demand-aca-subsidies/\">have refused</a> to pass it without the funding for ObamaCare subsidiaries, saying their expiration could potentially impact millions of Americans’ access to health care.</p>\n<p>Several programs are in danger of temporarily shutting down their services due to the lapse in government funding.

House Democrats have criticized the vote cancellations, as have <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5582283-republicans-house-shutdown-recess-johnson/\">several GOP representatives</a>. Rep.

Critics call it self-aggrandizing. When asked about the project, President Trump quipped that <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-admits-hes-building-arc-de-trump-for-me.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">it is for him</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Whatever is intended by the memorial and the symbolism of its location, it will be the American people who ultimately decide what this monument means.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/white-house-fires-all-commission-of-fine-arts-members-362ea9e1?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfz1JS3agyYiG8BQKhKdTSaN9UIbjepXhdpVoAmUDGGDyhF8er4CxYUBoZTYiY%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6903820e&amp;gaa_sig=EAPG3qA6CZzGUdf6HeCkstjhfhEs3Ps-2WFQOWDZUusDxfqPVaK9G5aZPqapMlyMbUVjPt97KjOabbfR-RDSaA%3D%3D\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claims</a> that “every time somebody rides over that beautiful bridge to the Lincoln Memorial, they literally say, something is supposed to be here,” the proposed site — Memorial Circle, at the Virginia end of the Arlington Memorial Bridge — is not a blank canvas. </p>\n<p>For a century, Lincoln’s temple to freedom and Lee’s former plantation — Arlington House, once home to the Confederate general Robert E. Lee — have faced each other across the river in a dialogue about emancipation, slavery and reunion. The bridge that joins them was meant to symbolically and literally join the North and South.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The National Park Service <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gwmp/learn/management/history.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">explains</a> that the bridge “also serves as the ceremonial entrance to Arlington National Cemetery, our nation’s most hallowed ground and the final resting place for more than 400,000 active-duty service members, veterans and their family members.” When unveiling the design to an audience of fundraisers, the president <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-ballroom-dinner-robert-e-lee-statue-b2846627.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">remarked</a> that he would have been fine with a statue to Lee in the same location.</p>\n<p>A massive triumphal arch in this location would intrude upon and dramatically reinterpret this symbolism of reunification. Americans might therefore question the intention behind it, and whether it carries a political or ideological signal through its choice of location. This is especially understandable because of recent efforts by the current administration to revisit Civil War memory by questioning <a href=\"https://www.military.com/history/trump-renaming-7-army-installations-here-are-stories-behind-names-being-scrubbed.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the renaming of military bases</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/us/politics/confederate-statue-trump.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">restoring certain Confederate monuments</a>.</p>\n<p>The current site is also a confusing selection because a more suitable one immediately comes to mind, along the same axis but east of the Capitol instead of west. The former RFK Stadium redevelopment comprises nearly 200 acres slated for mixed use with parks, housing, and a proposed stadium for the Washington Commanders. It would provide expansive space for a monumental arch and pedestrian-friendly park, along with unobstructed vistas toward the U.S. Capitol rotunda — a fitting gateway to the city, in the classical tradition of arches marking civic entrances.</p>\n\n<p>To many, the proposed arch is akin to the White House ballroom, It evinces a desire to monumentalize the self, to transform shared civic spaces into reflections of personal power and to do so without permission from the American people. A triumphal arch — especially one front-loaded by a president, unveiled at a donor gala and paired with the 90,000-square-foot White House ballroom — sounds less like national commemoration and more like personal aggrandizement.</p>\n<p>But previous national birthdays have been punctuated by great monuments and movements. At 100 years, <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/06/17/day-history-statue-liberty-came-america#:~:text=The%20Statue%20of%20Liberty%2C%20a%20gift%20from,the%20French%20to%20support%20the%20same%20ideals.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">France gifted us the Statue of Liberty</a>, a beacon linking freedom, immigration and democracy. At 200 years, the <a href=\"https://blog.nixonfoundation.org/2010/06/legacy-of-parks/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Legacy of Parks</a> program invested in hundreds of community spaces across the country, expanding public land and recreation for millions. Both commemorations reflected humility and inclusion. </p>\n<p>Democracies build monuments and memorials through consent, deliberation and the slow work of compromise. Since 1986, the <a href=\"https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title40/subtitle2/partD/chapter89&amp;edition=prelim\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Commemorative Works Act</a> has required that new national memorials undergo public hearings, congressional authorization and scrutiny by independent design commissions.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Dozens of steps in the process are not bureaucratic hurdles.

Those deliberate rhythms are proof that our monuments belong to the people.</p>\n<p>Regardless of where this monument might eventually stand on our national landscape, and regardless of whether it is imposed on the vista or endorsed by its people, the narrative arc for this moment in our national history, the moment it is intended to represent, is still being written. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n\n<p>Martin Luther King Jr. famously reminded us that the arc of the moral universe bends toward justice.
