He posted his message alongside a clip from the reality TV show “The Kardashians” that showed Kardashian discussing the moon landing.</p>\n\n<p>Duffy added that NASA’s <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/artemis/\">Artemis campaign</a> would <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/5535786-artemis-ii-moon-mission-2026/\">take Americans back</a> to the moon under President Trump’s administration.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“We won the last space race and we will win this one too,” he wrote, adding American flag and space ship emojis. </p>\n<p>The clip posted by Duffy comes from the Wednesday episode of the Kardashian family’s weekly TV show — a follow-up to their long-running series “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” which ended in 2021. In the clip, Kardashian repeats the conspiracy theory that the moon landing never happened while speaking with actress Sarah Paulson.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“I think it didn’t happen,” Kardashian told Paulson, referencing an apparent interview with astronaut Buzz Aldrin and “the other one” — likely referring to astronaut Neil Armstrong — where the first two men who walked on the moon said there “was no scary moment” during their trip to outer space. Kardashian pointed to the interview as evidence that the<strong>ir</strong> moon landing was fake.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to go on a massive deep dive,” Paulson promised her. </p>\n<p>Kardashian elaborated on why she believed the moon landing was “fake” later in the episode. </p>\n\n<p>“I’ve seen a few videos on Buzz Aldrin talking about how it didn’t happen,” she said. “He says it all the time now in interviews. Maybe we should find Buzz Aldrin.”</p>\n<p>Claims that Aldrin called the moon landing fake have been <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/fact-check/buzz-aldrin-interview-about-moon-landing-is-not-proof-that-it-was-faked-idUSL1N2US2G3/\">debunked</a> in the past.</p>\n<p>“There’s no gravity on the Moon,” she added. “Why is the <a href=\"https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/space-astronomy/moon-landing-conspiracy-theories-debunked\">flag blowing</a>?

Gavin Newsom (D) on Friday called President Trump’s move to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5580424-trump-directs-pentagon-to-start-testing-nuclear-weapons/\">restart nuclear weapons testing</a> “acts of a weak person” and embarrassing.</p>\n<p>Speaking with <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/newsom-trump-s-nuclear-weapons-testing-order-is-weakness-masquerading-in-strength-251039301664\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NBC News’s Kristin Welker,</a> Newsom said “it’s performative” on Trump’s part to restart the weapons testing, behavior that Newsom compared with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. He also pointed out that the Department of Energy (DOE) handles nuclear weapons testing, contradicting the president’s directive that the Pentagon should oversee it.</p>\n\n<p>“This is weakness masquerading in strength,” Newsom said. “This is classic Trump and Trumpism. This guy is historically weak, and these are acts of a weak person that is trying to appear strong.”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Private conversations between the two about nuclear weapons “calmed” Newsom, he said. But the governor added that Trump, by restarting testing and praising <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5580982-trump-xi-meeting-agreements/\">his recent trade negotiations</a> with China’s President Xi Jinping, was “trying to overcompensate to be a tough guy.”</p>\n<p>“Then again, trust but verify that he doesn’t begin to make some errant mistakes and we walk down a path of no return,” Newsom said. “It scares the hell out of me to start talking about these kind of things. But hopefully cooler heads will prevail, because again, he doesn’t even know what he said and what he was talking about on what the basis of his own administration has said he said and talking about.”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>On Friday, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5583290-nuclear-weapons-pentagon-testing-trump/\">that the Defense Department (DOD) would work with the DOE on the renewed testing.</a> Trump announced the decision on Wednesday. </p>\n<p>“The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” Trump wrote on his social platform Truth Social. “This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice! Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.”  </p>\n<p>Russia had recently claimed it had a successful new nuclear capable cruise missile, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5575554-burevestnik-missile-trump-condemns/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">known as the Burevestnik</a>, tested last week. Trump condemned it, and it drew <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5575554-burevestnik-missile-trump-condemns/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">international concern</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The United States <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5581750-us-russia-nuclear-competition-trump/\">stopped nuclear weapons testing in 1992</a> following the downfall of the Soviet Union, according to The Associated Press. Four years later, the U.S. signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.</p>\n<p>Newsom joined House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) in condemning Trump’s directive. Jeffries called the move <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5581938-jeffries-trump-nuclear-tests/\">“a massive breach of international treaties” and said Trump was “divorced from reality.”</a></p>\n<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) supported the decision,<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5581689-johnson-backs-trump-nuclear-testing/\"> referring to it as a “deterrent.”</a></p>\n<p>“The commander in chief wants us to be fully prepared,” Johnson told reporters Thursday morning. “We are the last great superpower on the earth. China intends to be a near peer-to-peer advisory to us. But in order to maintain peace around the world, you have to show strength, and that’s what the president believes in. That’s what he’s demonstrated over and over.”</p>\n</div>",

Under the account — which was deleted before his campaign’s launch — he <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5561274-platner-social-media-controversy/\">made</a> several yearsold comments that were dismissive of sexual assault.

Platner <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5566909-platner-plans-tattoo-removal/\">covered the tattoo</a> last week, saying he had no idea about the tattoo’s connotations before others had informed him about it.

Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic, announced that the COVID-19 vaccine would <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5319852-cdc-halts-routine-covid-shots-for-children/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">no longer</a> be recommended for healthy pregnant women. </p>\n<p>Kennedy has a history of comments linking autism and vaccines, despite strong evidence showing there is no association.   </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>The coronavirus has killed more than 1 million people in the past five years, and annual shots have served as a dose of protection. Yet fewer people have been getting them, and top administration officials have argued there’s no benefit and even potential harm to individuals.  </p>\n<p>Federal vaccine advisors now say all Americans regardless of risk factors should consult a medical provider about getting a coronavirus vaccine. </p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Kennedy and the Department of Health and Human Services <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5257511-rfk-jr-calls-autism-an-epidemic-it-dwarfs-covid/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">launched an effort</a> to determine “what has caused the autism epidemic.”  </p>\n\n<p>In September, President Trump held a press conference in the White House flanked by Kennedy and other federal health leaders and said that use of Tylenol during pregnancy is linked to a “very increased risk” of autism. They warned mothers not to take Tylenol and said the Food and Drug Administration would put a warning label on the drug. </p>\n<p>“Parental awareness of the potential for adverse child neurodevelopmental outcomes after COVID-19 in pregnancy is key. By understanding the risks, parents can appropriately advocate for their children to have proper evaluation and support,” Lydia Shook, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital and lead author of the study, said in a statement.  </p>\n</div>",
