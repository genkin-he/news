            "description": "<p>Illinois Gov. <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/jb-pritzker/\">JB Pritzker </a>(D) on Wednesday sought to distance himself from his cousin Tom Pritzker, whose communications with convicted sex offender <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/jeffrey-epstein/\">Jeffrey Epstein</a> were exposed in the Department of Justice’s release of files related to Epstein’s prosecution. </p>\n<p>“I’m not close to my cousin, but I can tell you that it’s very important that people be held to pay the price for whatever it is that they may have done,” Gov. Pritzker said during an interview on MS NOW’s “All In with Chris Hayes.”</p>\n<p>Tom Pritzker<a href=\"https://thehill.com/business/5740879-pritzker-epstein-controversy-resignation-hyatt/\"> resigned </a>from his role as executive chair of the Hyatt Hotels Corporation earlier this month after files showed his email communications with Epstein. Tom Pritzker kept in close contact with Epstein in the years after Epstein’s 2008 plea deal for procuring a minor for prostitution.</p>\n<p>“Good stewardship also means protecting Hyatt, particularly in the context of my association with Jeffrey Epstein and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/ghislaine-maxwell/\">Ghislaine Maxwell </a>which I deeply regret,” Pritzker wrote in a letter to the company’s board, according to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/16/us/politics/tom-pritzker-hyatt-epstein.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times</a>.</p>\n<p>“I exercised terrible judgment in maintaining contact with them, and there is no excuse for failing to distance myself sooner,” he added.</p>\n<p>Pritzker, 75, has served as chair of the family’s company since 2004 and announced that he would not seek reelection for the role in May. </p>\n<p>Gov. Pritzker said there are people in the files who “just sent a few emails or whatever and had nothing to do with any of the wrongdoing, but there’s a whole lot of people that have seemingly done something wrong.”</p>\n<p>He said he would like people who have done something wrong to be identified and wants to “see complete transparency.”</p>\n<p>Gov. Pritzker has referenced his wealth as a Hyatt Hotels heir in major political speeches. </p>\n<p>“Donald Trump thinks we should trust him on the economy because he claims to be very rich,” he said during a Democratic convention speech in August 2024. “Take it from an actual billionaire, Trump is rich in only one thing: stupidity.”</p>",

            "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/federal-program-will-bring-private-school-choice-to-at-least-4-new-states/2026/01\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Twenty-seven states</a> have opted into the new federal scholarship tax credit program, which helps families access tutoring, special education services, and expanded learning options in public schools and beyond. </p>\n<p>The program costs states nothing. The federal government pays the full cost. So this should be an easy call for everyone, including Democrats.</p>\n<p>Instead, in a <a href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/01.26.26-Federal-Privatization-of-K12-Education-Report_final.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">report released by the Senate HELP Committee,</a> Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has urged states to reject the federal dollars. In doing so, he is reversing an argument he once made with moral clarity and political force.</p>\n<p>For more than a decade after passage of the Affordable Care Act, Democrats rightly excoriated Republican governors who refused to embrace Medicaid expansion. The logic was straightforward. When the federal government offers states money to help working families, ideological objections are illegitimate. Take the money and help your constituents. Anything else would be putting politics over people.</p>\n<p>Few Democrats made that case more forcefully than Sanders himself. “This is a federal program, which costs zero dollars,” Sanders <a href=\"https://www.idahocountyfreepress.com/opinion/guest-commentary/support-from-planned-parenthood-pelosi-makes-prop-s-medicaid-expansion/article_2f77b4fb-b37f-540c-8198-b660cb7417b1.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">argued in 2013</a>, criticizing Republicans who rejected Medicaid expansion. He was right. Refusing federal dollars to help struggling families was indefensible.</p>\n<p>Yet that is precisely what Sanders now recommends on education.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/01.26.26-Federal-Privatization-of-K12-Education-Report_final.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">his report</a>, Sanders urges states to reject the federal scholarship tax credit and misrepresents it as a voucher program designed to undermine public schools. The same logic he once condemned, refusing federal support for working families because you oppose the underlying policy, is now his explicit recommendation.</p>\n<p>Democrats should not follow him down this path.</p>\n<p>The federal scholarship tax credit is not a voucher program. Scholarship-granting organizations can fund tutoring, curriculum, technology, transportation and special education services for students who remain enrolled in public schools.</p>\n<p>A student struggling in math can receive targeted tutoring. A child with a disability can access specialized services their district cannot provide. A rural student can enroll in virtual courses unavailable locally. These supports strengthen public education. They do not dismantle it.</p>\n<p>Sanders’s report barely acknowledges this reality. It makes a passing reference to public school students being eligible and then proceeds as if the program exclusively serves students who leave public schools. That omission is not a minor oversight. It fundamentally misrepresents how the program works.</p>\n<p>The report also argues that private school tuition remains out of reach for many working-class families. In some cases, that is true. But that is not an argument for rejecting the program. It is an argument for strengthening it.</p>\n<p>When Medicaid expansion proved insufficient, Democrats did not call for repeal. They fought to expand coverage further. The same logic applies here. If funding levels are too low, the answer is to improve the policy, not abandon it.</p>\n<p>Sanders also warns that education choice creates a two-tiered system. This misses a basic reality. We already have a two-tiered education system, and we have had one for decades. Affluent families exercise choice every day through housing decisions, private tuition and selective enrollment. The families trapped without meaningful alternatives are overwhelmingly working-class, disproportionately Black and Latino, and concentrated in the very communities Democrats claim to champion.</p>\n<p>The federal scholarship tax credit does not create inequality. It addresses one of the most entrenched and least discussed drivers of inequality in American education: the massive gap in out-of-school enrichment spending.</p>\n<p>Wealthy families routinely spend thousands of dollars a year on tutoring, test prep, academic enrichment, summer programs, technology and specialized services for their children. These investments compound over time, accelerating learning and widening achievement gaps. Working-class families understand this. They want to provide the same kinds of support for their kids. Most simply cannot afford to.</p>\n<p>The federal scholarship tax credit is designed to narrow that gap. By allowing funds to be used for tutoring, supplemental instruction, special education services and other learning support, including for students who remain in public schools, the program gives lower-income families access to the very tools affluent families already deploy as a matter of course. That is not privatization. It is equalization.</p>\n<p>Twenty-seven states have already opted in. Working families in those states will soon have access to tutoring, special education services, and learning options that did not exist before. Families in states that refuse to participate will have none of that.</p>\n<p>Once broadly trusted on education, Democrats <a href=\"https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/have-democrats-lost-their-education\">have lost ground</a>. Swing voters and communities of color are increasingly open to alternatives the party refuses to offer. </p>\n<p>Democratic governors face a defining question. Are we the party that puts families first, even when it challenges our preconceptions? Or are we the party that protects institutional orthodoxy, even when families pay the price?</p>\n<p>Voters are watching. And as with Medicaid expansion, they will remember who opted in and helped them, and who did not.</p>\n<p><em>Jorge Elorza is CEO of Democrats for Education Reform.

Fred Kacher, who became the director of the Joint Staff in December, was yanked from the post and will “return to service” with the Navy, a spokesperson told The Hill Thursday morning. </p>\n<p>“A distinguished and highly experienced surface warfare leader, Vice Adm. Fred Kacher will return to service with the United States Navy, after most recently serving as the Director of the Joint Staff,” a Joint Staff spokesperson told The Hill Thursday morning. </p>\n<p>It is unclear why Kacher was removed from the position. One source told Reuters, which first <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pentagon-removes-senior-official-joint-staff-post-sources-say-2026-02-26/\">reported</a> on the removal, that Kacher was not the right fit. </p>\n<p>Still, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine, praised the Vice admiral for his “dedicated service” to the Joint Force and “contributions” to the Joint Staff. </p>\n<p>“Since graduating from the United States Naval Academy, Vice Adm. Kacher has answered the call for every kind of selfless service imaginable,” Caine said in a statement to The Hill. “The Navy will be glad to have him back and we thank him and them for the loan of his leadership.”</p>\n<p>The director of the Joint Staff is a low-profile but influential role within the Pentagon. The senior official is part of key meetings and oversees the day-to-day operations of the Joint Staff. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.navy.mil/Leadership/Flag-Officer-Biographies/BioDisplay/Article/2236386/vice-admiral-fred-kacher/\">Kacher</a>, a career Surface Warfare Officer, is a three-star admiral who graduated with honors from the United States Naval Academy in 1990. He was most recently serving as a commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet.</p>\n<p>The move marks another shake-up within the Defense Deparment that has seen senior officals removed or forced into early retirement. CNN <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/25/politics/caine-iran-hegseth-trump\">reported this week</a> that Caine and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have at times disagreed over those moves. </p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Hegseth <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5741827-hegseth-ousts-top-army-advisor/\">ordered</a> Army Secretary Dan Driscoll to oust one of his top advisers, Col.

Democrats raised alarms after a United Arab Emirates-backed firm invested $2 billion in WLF’s stablecoin.</p>\n<p>Senate Democrats Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Chris Murphy (Conn.) raised alarms after Witkoff said he stepped away from the company prior to becoming Trump’s special envoy.</p>\n<p>Kushner and Witkoff were <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5755665-live-updates-trump-iran-hillary-clinton/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in Geneva on Thursday</a> to negotiate a deal with Iran to end its nuclear weapons program, talks that could determine whether Trump orders missile strikes against Iran in the near future. The special envoys met with Oman’s foreign minister, a broker in the talks.</p>\n<p>The meetings come only days after Witkoff and Kushner participated in talks to end the war in Ukraine and to set up Trump’s “Board of Peace” to maintain stability and order in Gaza.</p>",

In a separate statement, Adams said the call was a typical meeting between federal officials and secretaries of state. </p>\n<p>“FBI, DOJ, DHS and other national agencies reminded us of the resources they make available to help us election officials do our job,” he wrote. “They reaffirmed state officials’ primary role in the election process, and noted that they take domestic threats, including threats to election officials, just as seriously as they take cyber threats from foreign nations.”</p>\n<p>DHS’s assurance follows President Trump’s declaration that he would like to “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5719458-trump-suggests-republican-voting-takeover/\">nationalize</a>” federal elections <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5722063-donald-trump-state-elections-nationalization/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5722063-donald-trump-state-elections-nationalization/\">in over a dozen states</a>, sparking <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5721428-trump-nationalize-election-backlash/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5721428-trump-nationalize-election-backlash/\">fears</a> among Democratic leaders and <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5722041-rand-paul-trump-call-to-nationalize-elections/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5722041-rand-paul-trump-call-to-nationalize-elections/\">push back</a> from some <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5720386-thune-trump-federal-elections/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5720386-thune-trump-federal-elections/\">Republican lawmakers</a>.</p>\n<p>Democratic Sen.

Could those ICE roving vans be used to try to go and intimidate voters at the polling station?” Warner asked earlier this month in an episode of the “The Contrarian” podcast. </p>\n<p>He added at the time, “These are all things that, you know, sounded maybe way out or draconian a year ago or a year and a half ago, but they are at our front door right now.”</p>\n<p>The questions come as the Trump administration <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5709357-kristi-noem-criticism-minneapolis-shooting/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5709357-kristi-noem-criticism-minneapolis-shooting/\">faces heat</a> over tactics ICE uses when enforcing Trump’s sweeping deportation agenda.

            "description": "<p>The Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/27419547-25a952/\">asked the Supreme Court</a> Thursday to allow it to end temporary protections extended to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5513158-syrian-deportation-protections-end/\">more than 6,000 Syrians</a>. </p>\n<p>It marks <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5537995-supreme-court-ends-venezuelan-protections/\">the third time</a> the administration has urged the justices to rein in lower courts that have blocked the administration from restricting Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which provides individuals from countries with unsafe conditions protections against deportation and a pathway to apply for work authorization. </p>\n<p>“The Second Circuit’s ruling is indefensible,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote to the justices. “It flouts this Court’s two prior stays of materially similar orders in materially similar postures.” </p>\n<p>Beyond an immediate intervention allowing the termination to move forward, Sauer called on the justices to take up the case on their normal docket and settle the broader legal issues “so this cycle does not repeat a fourth, fifth, or sixth time.” </p>\n<p>Since taking office, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has looked to restrict TPS for various countries. Lawsuits have been filed over changes to TPS for Afghanistan, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Haiti, Honduras, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, South Sudan and Venezuela. </p>\n<p>The battle over Venezuela is what reached the Supreme Court on the two prior occasions. Each time, the court <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5307670-trump-administration-ends-tps/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">issued emergency orders</a> in <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5537995-supreme-court-ends-venezuelan-protections/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Noem’s favor</a>.  </p>\n<p>Noem <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5513158-syrian-deportation-protections-end/\">announced last fall</a> she would be terminating Syria’s TPS designation, pointing to the fall of the Assad regime and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5595883-trump-syrian-leader-visit/\">the administration’s embrace</a> of Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa.  </p>\n<p>The termination was set to take effect in November. </p>\n<p>After a group of Syrian TPS holders sued, U.S. District Judge Katherine Failla agreed to block the administration from ending TPS for Syria. The appointee of former President Obama ruled the termination likely illegal because it failed to adequately consult other agencies and rested on undue political influence. </p>\n<p>The administration turned to the Supreme Court after an appeals court declined to lift Failla’s ruling. It argues judges have no authority to second-guess Noem’s judgment and that she followed the law.</p>\n<p>The Hill has reached out for comment from the International Refugee Assistance Project, which represents the plaintiffs. </p>\n<p>The filing marks the second Trump administration’s 33rd emergency application at the Supreme Court, a staggering number. Trump’s critics contend it reflects how officials have repeatedly flouted the law, while the administration says it’s responding to lower courts overstepping to block Trump’s agenda.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Last Nov. 18, six members of Congress — all Democrats and all former military or intelligence veterans — posted a 90-second video in which they urged active military personnel to not obey illegal orders.</p>\n<p>The six members included Sens. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), and Reps. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), Chris Deluzio (D-Pa.), Maggie Goodlander (D-N.H.), and Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.).</p>\n<p>They knew exactly what they were doing. Although the video was not explicit about what illegal orders they had in mind, it is generally understood they were incensed by President Trump’s decisions to bomb alleged drug-running boats in the Caribbean and to deploy National Guard troops in American cities to help round-up illegal immigrants. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title10-section892&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Article 92</a> of the Uniform Code of Military Justice makes clear that service members must obey lawful orders or face potential serious punishment, including court martial. The article also makes clear that members of the armed forces may not only refuse to obey a manifestly illegal order, but have a duty to do so. The courts have held that for an order to be considered manifestly illegal, the unlawfulness must be clear and obvious, such as targeting civilians.</p>\n<p>The six video contributors were quite aware that their social media posting would likely anger Trump. Two days later, on Nov. 20, the president lashed out at the lawmakers, saying they should be arrested and tried for sedition: “TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP?????.” In a subsequent post the president left no doubt as to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-military-traitors-sedition-illegal-orders-c5fc3c5bd2fbc6b1204550e4203c24b2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">where he stood</a>: “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH.”</p>\n<p>Trump’s outrage was quickly absorbed by his loyal lieutenants at the departments of Justice and Defense. At Justice, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro convened a grand jury to indict the six members for their conduct. Due to grand jury secrecy, the specific charges were not made known, even to the accused members. In short order, though, the 20-person grand jury <a href=\"http://Jeanine%20Pirro,%20convened%20a%20grand%20jury%20to%20indict%20the%20six%20members%20for%20their%20conduct\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rejected Pirro’s request for an indictment</a>.</p>\n<p>Meantime, the Department of Defense was going full bore on investigating and punishing Kelly, but not the other five members. As Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth explained, Kelly was the only one of the six who had “formally” retired and therefore was subject to being recalled to duty and punished, even though his alleged offenses occurred after his retirement.</p>\n<p>On Jan. 5, Hegseth issued a “Secretarial Letter of Censure” to Kelly, based on a determination that he had exhibited conduct that is “prejudicial to good order and discipline in the Armed Forces…and [is] unbecoming an officer.”</p>\n<p>Although the Defense secretary downplayed the seriousness of the censure letter as “a necessary process step” to proceedings that could lead to Kelly’s demotion in rank and retirement pay, it is clear from the Code of Military Justice that censure is, in fact, already a finding of guilt and form of punishment.   </p>\n<p>In the censure letter Hegseth elaborated on numerous instances in which Kelly had been critical of administration policies, and accused “me and senior military officers of war crimes and to frame resistance to lawful orders….”</p>\n<p>Hegseth concluded his censure letter by informing Kelly of his “right to submit a written rebuttal. … However, you do not have a right to appeal this administrative action.” After receiving a recommendation from the secretary of the Navy, Hegseth said a determination would be made as to whether Kelly’s rank as captain would be reduced, and, with it, his commensurate retirement benefits.</p>\n<p>Kelly circumvented the meaningless rebuttal that would go nowhere other than into his personal file, and instead filed in the U.S. District Court for D.C. his motion that the censure be blocked. On Feb. 12, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/kelly-hegseth-pentagon-trump-censure.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blocked the Pentagon’s censure</a>, based primarily on grounds that Kelly’s free speech rights had been violated: “This court has all it needs to conclude that defendants have trampled on Senator Kelly’s First Amendment freedoms and threatened the constitutional liberties of millions of military retirees.”  </p>\n<p>Hegseth <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5753909-defense-secretary-appeals-senator-kelly/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">appealed the ruling on Tuesday</a>. Interestingly, Kelly did not emphasize in his own defense his immunity as a senator from being questioned in any other place for any “speech or debate” relating to his official duties in Congress. Moreover, Judge Leon did not highlight that constitutional shield members of Congress enjoy. </p>\n<p>While that additional argument may have some bearing on appeal, Leon and Kelly wanted to make clear that the more important issue is in protecting all Americans from government retribution for their public utterances.</p>\n<p><em>Don Wolfensberger is a 28-year congressional staff veteran culminating as chief of staff of the House Rules Committee in1995.
