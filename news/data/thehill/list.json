I regularly queried students about whether they felt pressured to answer in-class or examination questions to placate the political or social leanings of their professors. On average, 85 percent answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p>The litmus test is whether the educator’s public statements are likely to inhibit the free exchange of ideas in the classroom. An affirmative answer to this question is presumptively disqualifying because it undermines the educational mission.</p>\n<p>The issue is not whether professors are free to express their views; they are. The issue is whether there can still be a reasonable expectation of a classroom experience in which students can express their own, possibly contrary views, with impunity. </p>\n\n<p>This is a slippery slope and gray areas abound.

A professor who poses thoughtful questions and is prepared to weigh in objectively on either side of the issue can encourage enlightening debate even on the most controversial of issues. </p>\n<p>The problem arises when educators impose their own opinions and use them suppress critical discourse.</p>\n<p>I presented the Summers case to my MBA students with some modification. I asked them to assume there is credible empirical evidence that men have a lower mathematical aptitude than women. I then asked them why economists and university administrators would be interested in the answer. </p>\n\n<p>One student noted that if it is known these differences exist, it would be more efficient to have more women in departments with a strong quantitative component and more men in departments that are less quantitatively oriented. The discussion then turned to the importance of role models and whether efficiency should be dispositive.</p>\n<p>I used the Socratic Method to examine other politically charged issues, including affirmative action and <a href=\"https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2022/03/80774/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">diversity</a>. I believe it proved effective because my role was limited to that of a referee posing specific questions — particularly intervening when I thought the discussion was moving too far to the left or the right.</p>\n<p>Scholarship is not the province of the timid, because pushing forth the frontiers of knowledge is a contest of ideas. What is underappreciated is that the educator’s role in this process is much more <a href=\"https://www.k-state.edu/economics/research/research/WeismanAnEssayOnTheArtAndScienceOfTeaching_TAE_Published.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">conductor</a> than composer.

What was supposed to be a pep talk from the former president <a href=\"https://x.com/VigilantFox/status/1983922315520844208\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">turned into something else entirely</a>.  <br/> <br/>“He went on to talk about a group of people in Pennsylvania who were saying bad things about me, because they heard I was saying bad things about him. And when I hung up the phone — it was just unbelievable, and yes I was angry. Just deeply disappointed”  </p>\n\n<p>Now imagine that — you’re about to go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump on live television, and your predecessor’s biggest concern becomes whether you like him. That’s not exactly the pre-game energy you want heading into a political heavyweight match.  </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Harris explained why that call hit wrong.  </p>\n<p>“There were only two people in the world that other than me that have debated this guy.

The stakes were so high.”  </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>She described the moment as “so unnecessary.”  </p>\n<p>And she’s right — timing matters. Especially in politics, when every second is an opportunity to either gain ground or lose momentum. The last thing any candidate needs before a national debate is a lecture about gossip in Pennsylvania.  </p>\n<p>This story came up as Harris promoted her new book, “107 Days,” where she reflects on her short-lived 2024 campaign, her frustrations with Biden, and the lessons she’s still processing. She says she and Biden remain friends; he even called for her birthday. But she admits there were times when he angered her.  </p>\n\n<p>Harris also hints she might not be done with politics just yet. She’s open to running again — though 2024 clearly left a bitter taste in the mouths of many Democrats. Garry South, a Democratic strategist, told The Hill the book shows she’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5581973-carville-criticizes-harris-book/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“blaming everyone but herself for her loss.”</a>  </p>\n<p>In “107 Days,” Harris writes, “Of all the people in the White House, I was in the worst position to make the case that he should drop out. … He would see it as naked ambition, perhaps as poisonous disloyalty, even if my only message was: Don’t let the other guy win.”  </p>\n<p>And that right there — that tension between loyalty and leadership — is what defines so much of today’s Democratic struggle. Harris isn’t wrong for feeling frustrated. But if 2024 taught us anything, it’s that frustration doesn’t win elections: connection does.  </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>While I believe Kamala ran a solid campaign with the short time she had, I can still critique that she leaned on star power more than she spoke to the average American. Democrats can’t afford to keep fighting ghosts of campaigns past. And they certainly can’t afford to continue bringing Biden up at every turn. The future depends on authenticity, not applause.  </p>\n<p>At the end of the day, blaming Biden won’t fix the Democratic message. As I always tell my Republican friends, finger-pointing might win arguments, but it doesn’t win votes. </p>\n<p><em>Lindsey Granger is a NewsNation contributor and co-host of The Hill’s commentary show “Rising.” This column is an edited transcription of her on-air commentary.</em> </p>\n\n</div>",

Kennedy Jr. and the Make America Healthy Movement have effectively united the country around the urgent need to address our nation’s costly chronic disease epidemic. Where there is less agreement is the debate over saturated fat. </p>\n<p>Leading health authorities like the American Heart Association argue that it is a<a href=\"https://www.heart.org/-/media/files/healthy-living/company-collaboration/inap/fats-white-paper-ucm_475005.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> major driver of heart disease</a>.

Although there is broad agreement on the need to cut down on ultra-processed foods made with seed oils, Kennedy and other MAHA advocates pushing full fat animal products are failing to acknowledge the toxic load that comes with industrial meat and dairy products, which make up<a href=\"https://insideanimalag.org/percentage-of-farmed-animals-on-factory-farms/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> at least 95 percent</a> of the animal foods people eat. </p>\n<p>The MAHA Commission’s Report identified cumulative chemical exposure as a key driver of the rise in childhood chronic disease, but fat’s capacity to store environmental toxins means that eating more fat increases one’s exposure to those very same chemicals. Dioxins, heavy metals like mercury and cadmium, and pesticide residues build up in the fatty tissues of animals, especially those raised in industrial settings. These risks have been well-documented by the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/dioxin/learn-about-dioxin\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>, and National Institutes of Health.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Dioxins are among the most toxic substances known to science. According to <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/dioxin\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the EPA</a>, more than 90 percent of typical human exposure is through the intake of animal fats. Dioxins are produced as byproducts of waste incineration and industrial manufacturing, and they concentrate in animal fat through contaminated feed and environmental exposure. Long-term exposure to even low levels of dioxins is linked to <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/dioxin/learn-about-dioxin\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cancer, immune dysfunction</a> and <a href=\"https://iris.epa.gov/ChemicalLanding/&amp;substance_nmbr=1024\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reproductive</a> and development harm. That means, a family’s Sunday roast, or the burger a teenager grabs after practice, is the primary route by which these poisons enter the body.</p>\n<p>Heavy metals like cadmium and mercury also concentrate up the food chain, particularly in organ meats, dairy and seafood. A tuna sandwich tucked into a child’s lunchbox or a glass of milk poured at breakfast may seem wholesome, but these can deliver trace metals the body struggles to eliminate. Add to that insecticides like malathion, which is used widely on genetically engineered corn for animal feed.</p>\n<p>Those chemicals don’t just stay in the soil — they accumulate in animal tissue, fat and milk, eventually <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38128207/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ending up on our plates</a> and in our bodies and those of our children. A comprehensive<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38128207/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 2024 study</a> found that meat and dairy contribute significantly to human pesticide exposure, with livestock and poultry accounting for 39 percent of overall exposure and whole milk and dairy products accounting for 22 percent of all exposures.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the most dangerous pesticides, such as DDT and other persistent organic pollutants, don’t simply vanish when they’re banned. They are lipophilic, meaning they dissolve and store in fat, <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxguides/toxguide-35.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">especially animal fats</a>. Even decades after DDT was banned, it is still found in measurable levels in<a href=\"https://toxinfreeusa.org/pesticides-in-butter-getting-worse-not-better/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> butter</a>, meat and<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mcn.13759\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> breast milk</a>.</p>\n<p>For example, in 2023, out of 531 butter samples,<a href=\"https://www.afdo.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/800-1615-Food-Chemistry-101-Jason-Kong.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> DDE (a DDT metabolite) was detected in 188 samples (35 percent)</a> and in 2021, bifenthrin (a neurotoxic insecticide) was found in 37 percent of butter samples tested. Essentially, foods that should be simple staples, such as a pat of butter on your toast, can still carry the chemical legacy of dangerous farming practices from generations ago.</p>\n<p>Worse still, these chemicals don’t act alone. Meat and dairy often contain traces of multiple pesticides, antibiotics, and veterinary drugs like ractopamine — creating a toxic cocktail whose combined effects scientists are only beginning to understand. The FDA has approved over<a href=\"https://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/files/animal_drug_10_26_77838.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 450 drugs</a> for use in industrial livestock systems. Some, like ractopamine, are banned in China, the EU and many countries around the world. This isn’t about a single bad actor, it’s about layering risks on top of each other — and hoping for the best. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>If we are serious about health, we need to stop exposing animals — and, by extension, people, especially babies and children — to a cocktail of persistent industrial pollutants and animal drugs. That means advancing policies that support farmer transitions away from chemical-intensive factory farming to diversified, regenerative systems as well as increased production of organic and plant-based foods, including animal feed, while reducing toxic chemical use across agriculture. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>Given all the pollutants that accumulate in the fatty tissue of animals, we also need dietary guidelines that educate consumers about these risks and urge Americans to eat more whole plant-based proteins, fewer factory-farmed animal foods and more organic, pasture-raised meat and dairy products produced without harmful pesticides, antibiotics and growth-promoting drugs.</p>\n<p>This is especially important since these guidelines influence the foods offered to younger school children, who are most vulnerable to the cumulative impacts of these toxic chemicals, as President Trump’s MAHA Commission report has acknowledged.

He did not receive any pushback from Carlson.”</p>\n\n<p>Carlson on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efBB0D4tf1Y\">podcast</a> said that he wanted to understand Fuentes’s views, saying that while he also questioned the U.S. relationship with Israel, to say “well actually it’s the Jews” goes “against my Christian faith.”</p>\n<p>After the interview, a post on X started circulating that said the Heritage Foundation had <a href=\"https://x.com/jasonahart/status/1983655537784058064?s=46&amp;t=s27cFPVMxDTz4BmWHLglMQ\">scrubbed</a> a reference to Carlson from a donation page. </p>\n<p>Roberts, in a post accompanying his video, said he wanted to put to rest speculation that Heritage was distancing itself from Carlson. Roberts and Carlson are personal friends, and he has featured Carlson at Heritage events in the past.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>“The Heritage Foundation didn’t become the intellectual backbone of the conservative movement by canceling our own people or policing the consciences of Christians, and we won’t start doing that now,” Roberts said, adding that Heritage won’t “take direction from comments on X” or “take direction from members or donors.” </p>\n<p>“We will always defend our friends against the slander of bad actors who serve someone else’s agenda,” Roberts said.</p>\n<p>Roberts also weighed in on the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/newsletters/the-movement/5458571-gop-division-israel-support/\">bubbling debate on the right</a> over Israel.</p>\n\n<p>“Christians can critique the state of Israel without being antisemitic, and of course, antisemitism should be condemned,” Roberts said.</p>\n<p>“When it serves the interests of the United States to cooperate with Israel and other allies, we should do so with partnerships on security, intelligence, and technology,” Roberts said. “But when it doesn’t, conservatives should feel no obligation to reflexively support any foreign government, no matter how loud the pressure becomes from the globalist class or from their mouthpieces in Washington.”</p>\n</div>",

The plan directs agencies to mobilize federal financing tools and provide various subsidies for AI infrastructure, declaring that “Winning the AI race will usher in a new golden age of human flourishing.”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>President Trump has signed <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-accelerates-federal-permitting-of-data-center-infrastructure/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">executive orders</a> directing the Commerce Department to provide “financial support, such as loans, grants and tax incentives” for AI data centers requiring over 100 megawatts of power.</p>\n<p>The U.S. isn’t alone. Canada is allocating <a href=\"https://canadiandefencereview.com/canada-launches-canadian-sovereign-ai-compute-strategy/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$2 billion</a> for AI compute infrastructure, and the EU launched InvestAI to put <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/eu-launches-investai-initiative-mobilise-eu200-billion-investment-artificial-intelligence\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$263 billion</a> toward artificial intelligence investment.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>But the very excitement driving these proposals suggests that private markets are already working well. Subsidies make sense only when private markets systematically underfund something society needs, not when they’re already pouring in capital. </p>\n<p>Rigorous policy would identify specific costs or benefits that private investors can’t capture and target only those gaps. Instead, the AI Action Plan and executive orders take a scattershot approach, subsidizing everything from data centers to workforce training without demonstrating where private investment falls short.</p>\n<p>A deeper question is whether the government can identify underfunded yet socially beneficial projects. Private investors risk billions of their own dollars, backed by domain expertise and rigorous due diligence. Politicians, in contrast, spread taxpayer money across regions and politically important interest groups. Betting taxpayer dollars on selecting winners when the private sector is already all-in is a recipe for inefficiency, not for innovation.</p>\n\n<p>We have seen this before. The Obama-era push for solar manufacturing led to <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2011/10/obamas-solyndra-problem/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$535 million</a> in loan guarantees for Solyndra, which collapsed into <a href=\"http://bankruptcy.so/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bankruptcy.</a> Some defend this kind of failure as the price of taking risks on socially valuable industries, but that logic doesn’t apply to AI. </p>\n<p>Unlike solar at that time, AI today is awash in private capital. Subsidies here aren’t addressing what some argue is an underfunded social goal. They simply pile taxpayer money on top of investments that private markets are already making on their own.</p>\n<p>The government does, of course, have an important role to play in AI development. Concerns about the Chinese government dominating AI are real. But Chinese competition in AI is most relevant in military applications and cutting-edge research, not the commercial data centers that private investors are already racing to fund.</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>If subsidies are justified anywhere, it is in areas private markets are less likely to cover, like defense research, basic science and national security applications where private investors can’t capture the full benefits. Subsidizing profitable American companies to do what they’re already doing doesn’t meaningfully counter Chinese military AI development.</p>\n<p>AI may indeed reshape the economy, but that’s exactly why policymakers need discipline, not subsidy sprees. Taxpayer dollars should go where private investors won’t — defense, basic research and security — not into data centers already awash in capital. The AI boom doesn’t need government handouts — it needs government restraint.</p>\n<p><em>Scott Wallsten is president and a senior fellow at the Technology Policy Institute.</em></p>\n</div>",
