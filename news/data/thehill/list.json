It was not discussed actually,” Trump said when asked by reporters on Air Force One. </p>\n\n<p>However, the president noted that Russia’s war in Ukraine came up “very strongly” during the meeting. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“We’re both going to work together to see if we can get something done,” Trump said. “We agree that the sides are locked in, fighting, and sometimes you have to let them fight, I guess. Crazy. But he’s going to help us and we’re going to work together on Ukraine.”</p>\n<p>When asked about China’s history of purchasing Russian oil, Trump said, “we really didn’t discuss the oil” talking instead about trying to end the war. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“He’s been buying oil from Russia for a long time. It takes care of a big part of China,” Trump told reporters.</p>\n<p>Many view the war between Russia and Ukraine as parallel to Taiwan’s relationship with China, given tensions over territorial sovereignty between Beijing and Taipei. Xi sees Taiwan as Chinese sovereign territory and has vowed to reunify the two countries, by force if necessary. </p>\n<p>The U.S. has maintained unofficial ties with Taiwan. </p>\n\n<p>Trump did not give a definitive answer over whether Taiwan would be brought up during trade negotiations with China. </p>\n<p>“I don’t know that we’ll even speak about Taiwan.

But this time, it could be the blood of our sons and daughters giving their last full measure of devotion in a conflict far from home.</p>\n\n<p>It is a reality and a risk to help end this latest chapter of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has caused so much suffering on both sides. There may be no alternative to putting our military in harm’s way today, but there could be and must be one in the future, and we need to embrace and pursue it as soon as possible.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>So, what if we could protect both civilians and our military by sending something else in their place — humanoid drones?</p>\n<p>We know how that sounds, but let us explain. These humanoids would be powered by interoperable, agentic artificial intelligence. Maybe it’s the stuff of science fiction, but it’s no longer the purview of just screenwriters.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>We now have the technology to deploy such robots in war zones to protect populations, establish communications and stabilize what’s happening on the ground. These systems could serve as guardians defending humanitarian corridors and deterring violence without firing a shot.</p>\n<p>We are entering a new era in which artificial intelligence becomes a civic institution rather than merely a commercial or military tool. The question is whether we lead the world in building ethical, interoperable systems that protect people, or leave the future to regimes with nefarious intentions.</p>\n<p>Let’s be clear: Our adversaries are already using this technology — not to save lives but to take them. Russia <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/10/1166189\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">uses drone swarms</a> to attack Ukraine’s infrastructure. China <a href=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/china/2025/02/20/china-ai-neuro-quantum-surveillance-security-threat/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">integrates AI into its naval and surveillance systems</a> and shares it with governments, using it for population control.  </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, we and our allies hesitate. Our doctrines remain anchored to an era when deterrence meant soldiers and sanctions. </p>\n<p>The new challenge isn’t our ability to get our military to the next hot spot. It’s machine coordination. The balance of power around the world is about to be determined by our approach to AI governance.</p>\n<p>From Ukraine to Gaza, the international community faces the same challenge: civilians stranded between opposing forces, and humanitarian agencies unable to provide aid. Yet, technology already exists to change that. Autonomous systems could patrol ceasefire zones, protect evacuation routes, deliver aid and detect incoming threats, creating buffer zones where humans can safely operate.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>This isn’t fantasy. It’s a moral and strategic imperative. Western democracies must find ways to deter aggression without risking American lives.  </p>\n<p>The foundation for this future is what we call Omni Cities — democratic, interoperable infrastructures where civic AI integrates across transportation, energy, health and defense systems. It’s not about surveillance, but about saving lives and protecting the peacemaker. It doesn’t control; it coordinates. It is is the civic answer to authoritarian implementations of AI.   </p>\n<p>The U.S. needs to lead this effort and set standards for interoperability, data ethics, and autonomous deterrence. Under United Nations oversight, AI-enabled drones and humanoid guardians could be deployed to regions such as Gaza to secure humanitarian corridors and enforce ceasefires. </p>\n\n<p>They would act not as instruments of war, but as intermediaries for peace — enforcing accountability through presence, not violence.</p>\n<p>Such a framework would extend beyond conflict zones. Domestic applications could include rapid disaster response to floods, wildfires or hurricanes, where AI could coordinate public infrastructure and autonomous assets to save lives. </p>\n<p>If the nuclear age was about avoiding mutual assured destruction, the civic AI era must be about preserving life. </p>\n\n<p>Public perception is understandably based on what we’ve seen in movies like “The Terminator.” Skeptics warn machines lack human morality and autonomy risks AI becoming more powerful than our ability to control it. Those concerns are legitimate, but inaction carries its own risk. </p>\n<p>Failing to define the ethics of AI deployment leaves it to authoritarian regimes that already use this technology to repress. The challenge isn’t whether to use AI but ensuring that it serves us. </p>\n<p>The new “Space Race” isn’t a contest between capitalism and communism, but rather between authoritarian AI and civic AI. The nations leading in building interoperable, ethical systems will shape the moral frontier of technology.</p>\n\n<p>So far, President Trump has rejected calls to cooperate in that venture with international partners. But the time has come for the U.S. and its allies to build Omni Cities and deploy these guardians of peace, not to replace humans, but to protect them. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>The civic AI Era is emerging.

Although Affordable Care Act subsidies have been at the center of the debate, one of the most basic questions remains unanswered: Where is the money actually going? </p>\n<p>And we cannot answer that, because the U.S. still lacks real price transparency in health care.  </p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://waysandmeans.house.gov/2024/06/24/cbo-and-jct-confirm-the-debt-driving-cost-of-bidens-plan-to-permanently-expand-obamacare-subsidies-for-the-wealthy/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2024, the federal government spent roughly $125 billion on Affordable Care Act subsidies</a>. According to the Congressional Budget Office, federal spending on these subsidies will <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-07/60523-2024-07-premium-tax-credit.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">exceed $1 trillion over the next decade.</a> These numbers are far higher than initial cost estimates, and increases in premiums are at least part of the story. <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/state-indicator/marketplace-average-benchmark-premiums/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Benchmark plans’ premium rose between 70 and 90 percent in the last decade,</a> <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/43083\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">defying early budget expectations</a> that competition among health care exchanges would restrain increases. But neither the government nor businesses nor patients can benefit from competition if we don’t have markets. And we can’t have markets if we don’t have actual prices we can see in advance. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The Affordable Care Act was sold as a way to help families afford coverage, but it’s become a guaranteed revenue stream for insurers. <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-107194\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Most markets remain dominated by just a few insurers</a>. Subsidies were paid directly to insurance companies — not as flat fee vouchers but as a percentage of the annual premium. The Affordable Care Act expansion led to millions more covered lives — new customers for insurers — and these companies returned the favor by hiking their rates, knowing that taxpayers would make up the difference. </p>\n<p>What’s the reason for the increase in premiums since Obamacare began? We could cynically assume greed, but there are multiple plausible explanations, none of which we can quantify with great confidence. Some argue that because the subsidies rise with premiums, insurers face less pressure to keep prices down. Insurers point to rising hospital and pharmaceutical prices, consolidation among health systems, and the increasing number of high-cost enrollees. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>All of these may be true to a degree, but the real problem is we can’t say for sure. </p>\n<p>Federal law requires insurers and hospitals to disclose negotiated prices, under the <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/hospital-price-transparency\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hospital Price Transparency Rule (2021)</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/healthplan-price-transparency\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Transparency in Coverage Rule (2022)</a>. But unfortunately, compliance has been largely performative. Insurers post massive “machine-readable” files that are nearly impossible to download, let alone interpret. The information exists in theory, but in practice it is unusable for patients, employers and policymakers trying to answer the most basic question: What does care actually cost? </p>\n<p>The prospect of premiums going up by hundreds of dollars each month frightens families. But we need to balance compassion for those individual circumstances with the reality that we are spending billions of dollars each year to prop up a fundamentally broken system. The largest beneficiaries of taxpayer subsidies are not hospitals, doctors or even patients — they are insurers.</p>\n\n<p>If Congress extends the Affordable Care Act subsidies that families have come to depend on, it should demand something in return: real price-transparency. Reporting should be mandatory, not voluntary. Readable, easy-to-understand disclosures should be made public of what insurers pay for care and what patients are expected to pay. Ordinary people should be able to tell exactly how much of every subsidy dollar is going to patient premiums and patient care, and how much is funding administrative costs, executive bonuses and shareholder revenue. Taxpayers deserve to see where their money is going. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>Empathy for families facing rate hikes and a demand for fiscal responsibility are not mutually exclusive.

We hit play and content appears, powered by the invisible cloud. It feels environmentally virtuous choosing a digital download over a disc or a virtual meeting over a flight. But the environmental impact of this data is surprisingly large and tangible.</p>\n<p>That buffer bar connecting you to your favorite show or TikTok is tied to a vast, energy-hungry network few ever think about. Our digital consumption fuels a rapidly growing carbon footprint hiding in plain sight.</p>\n\n<p>The information and communication technology sector, which makes the internet run, now accounts for an <a href=\"https://greenly.earth/en-gb/leaf-media/data-stories/the-carbon-cost-of-streaming\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">estimated 3.7 percent</a> of global greenhouse gas emissions. To put that into perspective, the global network of data centers consumes energy <a href=\"https://usfblogs.usfca.edu/sustainability/2023/11/29/the-cost-of-streaming-data-centers-and-their-environmental-impact/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">comparable to the entire airline industry</a>. As high-resolution 4K and 8K streaming becomes the norm, global video traffic is exploding — and placing immense strain on energy grids. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Streaming is an invisible relay race of electricity consumption that happens in three main acts: </p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"1\">\n<li><strong>The server:</strong> Your movie lives on a server in a warehouse-sized data center that uses staggering amounts of electricity, to power and cool computers. Cooling systems can account for nearly half of a facility’s total energy use and draw <a href=\"https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/data-centers-and-water-consumption\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">billions of gallons of water annually</a> to maintain internal temperatures, anchoring the “cloud” to local power and water supplies. </li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>The network:</strong> Fiber-optic cables, routers and switching stations transmit gigabytes of data across the globe. This “always-on” network consumes power continuously, even when idle. The longer data travels and the more digital “hops” it makes, the greater the energy required. </li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>The device:</strong> The device itself is the most overlooked piece of the carbon puzzle, <a href=\"https://www.carbontrust.com/our-work-and-impact/guides-reports-and-tools/carbon-impact-of-video-streaming\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">responsible for the largest share of streaming-associated emissions</a>. Larger, higher-resolution screens demand more power. One hour of high-quality streaming can emit <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2021/how-to-reduce-environmental-impact-next-virtual-meeting-0304\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">55 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent;</a> streaming four hours daily for a month generates emissions on par with driving more than 100 miles. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>When a major tech company builds a billion-dollar facility, the steep new power demand often requires construction of new power plants and transmission lines — frequently fossil-fueled — <a href=\"https://www.calgary.ca/content/dam/www/general/documents/smartcities/addressing-digital-equity-digital-divide.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">raising rates for nearby residents and small businesses</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>This dynamic creates a <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-science/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2025.1593632/full\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cruel imbalance</a>: local communities, often lower-income or marginalized, bear the brunt of increased pollution from added power generation, while profits and convenience flow to wealthier consumers and powerful tech companies. It is inequitable for corporations to <a href=\"https://greencitizen.com/blog/digital-carbon-footprint/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reap digital profits while externalizing the environmental cost to the public</a> — especially to communities without affordable access to the very systems creating the pollution. </p>\n<p>How do we fix a problem that is invisible to users? The answer lies in redesigning incentives for corporations and consumers. </p>\n<p>First, regulators should require tech giants to disclose the energy and water use of their data centers, breaking it down by service (such as streaming, search and cloud storage). Companies should face stricter power usage effectiveness mandates, the standard measure of efficiency. Transparency provides data for accountability and targeted regulation. </p>\n\n<p>Second, we must provide an incentive by making renewable power profitable. Companies like Google and Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.landapp.com/post/data-centers-are-driving-renewable-energy-development\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">already lead in purchasing green energy</a>, setting an example for their supply chains. Policies should promote development of clean energy sources to meet <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/meta-data-center-louisiana-power-costs-4ce76b73c102727d71edbbb56abe1388\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rising data center demand</a> and prevent construction of new natural gas power plants.</p>\n<p>Third, we must encourage efficient content delivery. Streaming platforms should default to standard definition, with users having to opt in for high definition or 4K. This small design change could dramatically reduce network traffic and energy use without affecting most viewing experiences.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, consumers can do their part as well in ways that are <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/gdo/clean-energy-resources-meet-data-center-electricity-demand\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">easy and intuitive</a>. For example, when watching on a small screen or listening to background videos, they can switch to SD. This single action cuts data use and energy consumption across the network.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>If you plan to watch something multiple times, just download it once over Wi-Fi rather than streaming it repeatedly.

Now, the rupture with the U.S. was complete.</p>\n<p>The Axis of Evil had found its modern-day South American upstart first in Chávez and then in Maduro. Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2006-09/venezuela-russia-sign-weapons-deal\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sealed a deal</a> with Chávez in 2006 to sell combat planes and helicopters to Venezuela.</p>\n\n<p>By late 2009, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna32809912\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chávez had secured</a> a “$2.2 billion line of credit for Venezuela to purchase [Russian] weapons including armored vehicles and surface-to-air missiles.” For all of Putin’s recent complaints against NATO member-states arming Ukraine, the Kremlin — 17 years ago — was arming Venezuela to counter neighboring Colombia’s decision “to give U.S. troops greater access to its military bases.”</p>\n<p>During that same timeframe, Chávez <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/aug/25/venezuela.china\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">solidified economic ties</a> with China. Beginning in 2006, he signed multiple trade agreements with Beijing and referred to them as a “Great Wall” protecting Venezuela from “American hegemonism.” By then, Chávez was openly calling President George W. Bush “the devil” and was establishing Venezuela alongside Iran, Syria and North Korea as junior members of the Axis of Evil.</p>\n<p>Chinese purchases of Venezuelan oil proved decisive in letting Maduro skirt past U.S. oil sanctions aimed at ending his regime. Likewise, it gave oil-hungry Beijing another source of oil imports.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Fast-forward to March 2022. Putin’s armies had invaded Ukraine. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was putting his finishing touches on his <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/what-is-irans-axis-resistance-which-groups-are-involved-2024-01-29/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Axis of Resistance</a> — Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis in Yemen.

He was looking for wins. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/11/04/1134421149/russias-invasion-has-prompted-biden-to-offer-reconciliation-to-venezuelas-presid\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fearing spikes in global oil prices</a>, Biden abandoned Trump’s maximum pressure approach against Caracas and naively sought to peel off Maduro from the anti-Western axis.</p>\n<p>Predictably, Maduro took everything he could from Biden and then stiffed him. Despite U.S. energy sanctions relief, Maduro continued to ban Maria Corina Machado (winner of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize) as a presidential candidate. By July 2024 the Venezuelan dictator was even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jul/21/venezuela-guyana-latin-america-tensions-rise-maduro-essequibo-border-dispute-support-elections-oil-indigenous\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">threatening to militarily seize</a> Essequibo, a province of Guyana where U.S.-based Exxon has invested billions. </p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/blog/bidens-tragic-mistake-venezuela-calling-new-election-instead-respect-election-opposition-won\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Elliot Abrams noted</a>, President Biden last year nonetheless “gave oxygen to the Maduro regime.” Ironically, it took a fellow leftist government in Brazil to keep Caracas in check — it <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c624m4kgrg3o\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">vetoed Venezuela’s bid</a> to join BRICS after Maduro’s flagrant theft of the 2024 election from winner Edmundo González.</p>\n<p>That was then. This is now. Trump’s maximum pressure campaign against Maduro is back, and this time, he is casting a wider net. The Pentagon’s show of force is also squarely aimed at Moscow and Beijing — an assertion of a modern Monroe Doctrine.</p>\n<p>The White House’s messaging to the Axis of Evil is as simple as it is blunt: hands off of the Western Hemisphere. As <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/01/12/opinion/trumps-greenland-push-about-growing-china-threat/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">we noted last January</a>, Trump began sending that message to Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping when he refused to rule out military force in Greenland or the Panama Canal.</p>\n\n<p>So far, neither Putin nor Xi appear willing to accept the message. Significantly, over the weekend, a <a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/global/the-americas/2025/10/28/heavy-russian-cargo-plane-lands-in-caracas-amid-us-venezuela-tensions/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Russian cargo plane</a> linked in the past to the Wagner Group and other Russian paramilitary companies landed in Caracas. In the past, these planes have been used to ship “rockets, warheads, and helicopter parts globally.”</p>\n<p>Notably, the cargo plane took a circuitous route from Moscow to Caracas “via Armenia, Algeria, Morocco, Senegal and Mauritania to Latin America.” Although its contents remain unknown, Putin’s messaging to Trump is obvious. He is willing to bring his <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6341171078112\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">global war against the West</a> to the Americas.</p>\n<p>Beijing is also weighing in on Trump’s buildup in the Caribbean. Mao Ning, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/venezuela-china-us-maduro-xi-jinping-trump-intl-latam\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said last week</a> that “China opposes any move that violates the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and a country’s sovereignty and security. We oppose the use or threat of force in international relations and the interference of external forces in Venezuela’s internal affairs under any pretext.”</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n\n<p>No doubt Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines wish China would live up to Ning’s laughably hollow statement and stop encroaching on their waters while maneuvering against Taipei.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Team Trump can book a win here.

Their relationship has been rocky at times as they’ve been critical of one another, only to later cool tensions as leaders of the world’s two biggest superpowers.</p>\n\n<p>The conference in South Korea came at the end of Trump’s Asia tour, in which he also traveled to Malaysia and Japan.</p>\n<p>Here’s what to know from the meeting:</p>\n<p><strong>Trump hails ‘truly great’ Xi meeting</strong></p>\n\n<p>The president said in a <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115462098072054944\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post on Truth Social</a> following the meeting that the “enormous respect” the two countries have for each other will only be enhanced based on what happened during his meeting.</p>\n<p>He said Xi authorized China to purchase “massive amounts of Soybeans, Sorghum, and other Farm products” that will support U.S. farmers. China had been boycotting these products in protest of the tariffs Trump had placed on the country.</p>\n<p>Trump said Beijing agreed to a one-year pause on new restrictions it enacted earlier this month on the export of rare earth materials and critical minerals, which has been the source of significant tension between Trump and China.</p>\n\n<p>The pause is another win for Trump on this issue as he has prioritized it since China put the restrictions in place. He signed several deals earlier in the trip with Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand and Japan to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5573672-trump-signs-asian-trade-mineral-deals/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gain U.S. access</a> to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5575798-trump-signs-critical-minerals-deal-japan/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">these materials</a> in response to China’s earlier action.</p>\n<p>Trump said on Truth Social that Xi also agreed for China to help stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.</p>\n<p>The president said he would accordingly cut in half the 20 percent tariffs he had imposed to pressure China to take more action to address fentanyl trafficking. That will bring overall tariffs on Chinese goods down from 57 percent to about 47 percent.</p>\n\n<p>Trump said China would also start “the process of purchasing American Energy,” and a “large scale transaction” may happen on the purchase of oil and gas from Alaska. He said the countries’ energy teams would be meeting to try to reach a deal.</p>\n<p>The meeting with Xi concluded after <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5580450-trump-xi-south-korea/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">less than two hours</a>, with the two leaders having a cordial exchange before Xi got into a car and Trump made his way to Air Force One to return to the U.S.</p>\n<p>The leaders seem likely to meet again, as a Chinese readout of the meeting stated that Trump would travel to China next year and Trump invited Xi to visit the U.S.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shadow of Trump’s nuclear announcement</strong></p>\n<p>The meeting began shortly after Trump made news by directing the Pentagon to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5580424-trump-directs-pentagon-to-start-testing-nuclear-weapons/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">resume testing nuclear weapons</a> on an equal basis to Russia and China.</p>\n<p><em>“Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,”</em> he <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115460423936412555\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said on Truth Social</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The renewal of nuclear weapons testing would end a more than three-decade hiatus on tests that started in 1992, just one year after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.</p>\n<p>Trump ignored a question from a reporter about the move while meeting with Xi.</p>\n<p>A recent Russian test of a nuclear-capable cruise missile received international condemnation, including from Trump, who called it “inappropriate” as he’s trying to reach a deal to end the war between Russia and Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Trump touted the “complete update and renovation” of existing nuclear weapons that he conducted during his first term. He said he “hated” to do it but had no choice.</p>\n<p>China has built up its nuclear arsenal in recent years, reaching <a href=\"https://fas.org/publication/nuclear-notebook-china-2025/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">about 600 warheads</a> this year, but it conducted its last nuclear test in 1996. Russia’s test of a nuclear-capable missile didn’t include a detonation.</p>\n<p>But the announcement could signal a return to an arms race and heightened tensions around nuclear weapons that hasn’t been seen in years.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other issues left alone</strong></p>\n<p>Trump and Xi did not announce any major breakthroughs on other issues that received heightened attention heading into the meeting.</p>\n<p>That includes the finalization of the sale of TikTok, which Trump has prioritized and suggested was close. The status of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as Chinese territory but the U.S. considers to be ambiguous, was also viewed as a key topic potentially for the agenda.</p>\n\n<p>Trump also didn’t make any announcement regarding the issue of Americans being unjustly detained in China. As many as 200 U.S. citizens are thought to be unjustly held.</p>\n<p>Ahead of the meeting, Republicans hawkish on China urged Trump to press Xi on releasing Americans unjustly detained and ending religious persecution of civil society activists, The Hill’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5579605-republicans-urge-trump-xi-prisoners/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Laura Kelly reported</a>. </p>\n<p>Trump also left for Washington without meeting North Korean leader <strong>Kim Jong Un </strong>on the trip, as had been speculated. Trump expressed openness to meeting with Kim while in Asia, but nothing was ultimately scheduled. </p>\n\n<p>The president commented on the conflict between North and South Korea, telling the South Korean prime minister that ending the standoff is “common sense.” But he said his and Kim’s schedules didn’t line up. </p>\n<p>Despite the lack of developments on these issues, Trump declared the multi-country trip a success.</p>\n<p>He also took a shot at Senate Minority Leader <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong> (D-N.Y.) for <a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/news/press-releases/leader-schumer-floor-remarks-on-donald-trump-selling-out-the-american-people-through-failed-trade-negotiations-with-china-announcing-democrats-will-force-more-votes-to-end-trumps-disastrous-trade-war\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">calling</a> Trump’s Asia trip a “total dud.” The president called Schumer’s comments “almost treasonous” on Truth Social.</p>\n\n<p><em>“Worked really hard, 24/7, took in Trillions of Dollars, and Chuck Schumer said trip was ‘a total dud,’ even though he knows it was a spectacular success,” </em>Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115462006949579771\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a>.</p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-30/chinese-markets-under-pressure-as-xi-trump-meet-lacks-surprises?embedded-checkout=true\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a>: <em>“Chinese markets under pressure as Xi-Trump meeting lacks surprise.”</em></p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-view-europe-2025-10-30/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Reuters</a>: <em>Trump-Xi meeting cools tensions.</em></p>\n\n<p>Follow The Hill’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/?p=5579438/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">live coverage of the day here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>NEW THIS A.M.:</strong> Democratic Rep. <strong>Mikie Sherrill</strong> (N.J.) and Republican <strong>Jack Ciattarelli</strong> are <a href=\"https://thehill.com/?p=5579199\">essentially tied in the latest poll</a> of the New Jersey gubernatorial race released this morning. </p>\n<p>The survey from Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill showed Sherrill leading by 1 point, 49 percent support to 48 percent, with 2 percent of respondents undecided. The 3-point margin of error means statistically the candidates are even. </p>\n\n<p>Sherrill’s lead grows to 2 points when undecided respondents are asked which candidate they’re leaning toward, still within the margin of error. </p>\n<p>The margin is closer than Sherrill’s lead of roughly 5 points in the <a href=\"https://polls.decisiondeskhq.com/averages/general-ballot-test/2025-nj-governor/new-jersey/lv-rv-adults\">Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ) polling average</a>, but it points to the increasingly competitive nature of the race as it comes down to the wire. </p>\n<p>Ciattarelli is trying to pull off an upset in the Garden State, building off his narrow 3-point loss in the governor’s race to Gov. <strong>Phil Murphy</strong> (D) four years ago. Ciattarelli outperformed polls that year to make it a much closer race than anticipated. </p>\n\n<p>The polls for this year’s race are closer than at this point in 2021, but Ciattarelli will still need to outperform again to pull off a win. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in the Big Apple, Democratic nominee <strong>Zohran Mamdani </strong>holds a comfortable <a href=\"https://thehill.com/?p=5579248\">25-point lead</a> over <strong>Andrew Cuomo</strong>, who’s running as an independent, in New York City’s mayoral race. Mamdani draws 50 percent support to Cuomo’s 25 percent while Republican <strong>Curtis Sliwa</strong> gets 21 percent and 4 percent say they’re undecided.</p>\n<p>The poll, also from Emerson, PIX11 and The Hill, is an improvement for Mamdani from the survey last month, which had him leading by 15 points.

Spanberger leads by almost 8 points on average. </p>\n<p>At the same time, Virginia Attorney General <strong>Jason Miyares</strong> (R) leads Democratic candidate <strong>Jay Jones</strong> <a href=\"https://polls.decisiondeskhq.com/averages/general-ballot-test/2025-virginia-attorney-general/virginia/lv-rv-adults\">by 3 points</a> in the competitive race, which for the past month has been dominated by the texts that Jones sent in 2022 wishing for violence against a political opponent. </p>\n<p>In California, Democrats are feeling optimistic about a ballot measure being voted on next week on whether the state Legislature should be able to redraw its congressional map. The measure, proposed by Gov. <strong>Gavin Newsom</strong> (D) in response to Republican efforts to redraw congressional lines, could add up to five additional Democratic seats in the House in next year’s midterms. </p>\n<p>A new tracker for the proposal, known as Proposition 50, shows <a href=\"https://polls.decisiondeskhq.com/averages/general-ballot-test/2025-ca-proposition-50/california/lv-rv-adults\">almost a 20-point advantage</a> for those in favor of the measure compared with those opposed. </p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/nyregion/nyc-immigrant-mayors-mamdani.html\">The New York Times</a>: <em>Mamdani wouldn’t be New York City’s first immigrant mayor.</em> </p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/new-jersey-governor-race-fundraising-20251029.html\">Philadelphia Inquirer</a>: <em>“New Jersey gubernatorial hopefuls rely on a small slice of the state for cash.”</em> </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3 Things to Know Today</h2>\n<p>1. <strong>The Supreme Court requested additional information</strong> <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5579726-supreme-court-trump-national-guard-chicago-request/?tbref=hp\">before it decides</a> whether Trump can deploy the National Guard in Chicago.

Meanwhile, Democrats are showing some signs of willingness to support measures to reduce the hurt while the shutdown is ongoing. </p>\n<p>Democrats have said they’re <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5576960-federal-workers-pay-during-shutdown/\">open to a proposal</a> from Wisconsin Sen. <strong>Ron Johnson</strong> (R) to pay all federal workers, including those furloughed and deemed essential, during the shutdown. One caveat is that it wouldn’t restrict Trump’s ability to continue layoffs during the shutdown. </p>\n<p>Democrats have said they need time to review it. </p>\n<p>Schumer also said <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5579847-senate-snap-wic-funding/\">Democrats would support</a> a bill proposed by Sen. <strong>Josh Hawley</strong> (R-Mo.) to continue to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) amid the shutdown. Timing is particularly key for that bill as those receiving benefits through the program are due to receive them for November on Saturday, but funding hasn’t been provided for the program. </p>\n<p>Still, Democrats also introduced their <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5579092-democrats-republicans-snap-funding-bills/\">own competing bill</a> to fund SNAP, leading Thune to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5579827-thune-blasts-democrats-snap/\">rail against</a> his Democratic colleagues on the Senate floor. </p>\n<p><em>“This isn’t a political game,” </em>Thune said. <em>“These are real people’s lives that we’re talking about. And you all just figured out 29 days in that, ‘Oh, there might be some consequences. There are people who’ll run out of money?’”</em> </p>\n<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has said it won’t use reserve funds to continue providing benefits for the 40 million Americans who use SNAP, as the funds should only be used in cases of natural disasters and not government shutdowns. </p>\n<p>The bills under consideration show how Democrats are wobbling a bit in the face of increased pressure to end the shutdown after almost a month, The Hill’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5577883-senate-democrats-government-shutdown-pressure/\">Alexander Bolton reports</a>. They show how Democrats are looking to ease the pain of the funding lapse, which is set to affect even more Americans starting in November, without a clear end. </p>\n<p>The Hill’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5579889-government-shutdown-americans-pain/\">Sudiksha Kochi reports</a> on six ways the shutdown could get worse for Americans without government intervention. </p>\n<p>But a continuing resolution to end the funding lapse still seems elusive, as even these proposals under consideration are just measures to reduce the pain of the shutdown but not end it. </p>\n<p>Bolton reports how Republicans and Democrats are each looking for offramps to end the stalemate as soon as next week but are unsure of how to do it. But one thing that is certain is that fatigue with the shutdown is only growing by the day. </p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/us/politics/democrats-republicans-shutdown-impasse.html\">The New York Times</a>: <em>“What can break the shutdown impasse?”</em> </p>\n<p><strong>FED LOWERS INTEREST RATES</strong>: The Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://thehill.com/business/5579280-federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rates/\">lowered interest rates</a> for the second consecutive time Wednesday, despite a lack of data about the state of the jobs market amid the shutdown. </p>\n<p>The Fed lowered rates by a quarter point, down to a range of 3.75 to 4 percent, marking its second interest rate cut this year. The agency had maintained steady rates for most of the year, despite pressure from the president, as inflation continued to be higher than the Fed’s target. </p>\n<p>As inflation eased and the job market weakened, the Fed shifted last month to reduce interest rates for the first time in 2025. Officials suggested in projections at the time that they would cut rates at least one more time this year. </p>\n<p>But this time is a bit different from September with the Bureau of Labor Statistics mostly shuttered because of the shutdown. That means the Fed had no federal jobs report for October to work off of, causing it to have a less clear view of where the economy currently stands. </p>\n<p>But the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel responsible for monetary policy, relied on a patchwork of private sector data, a delayed consumer price index and the Fed’s regular surveys of businesses and nonprofits for insight. </p>\n<p>The decision to cut rates still didn’t come as a surprise for Wall Street traders and analysts, despite the lack of a jobs report. </p>\n<p><em>“Although some important federal government data have been delayed due to the shutdown, the public and private-sector data that have remained available suggests that the outlook for employment and inflation has not changed much since our meeting in September,”</em> Federal Reserve Chair <strong>Jerome Powell</strong> told reporters. </p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/fed-rate-decision-october-2025.html\">CNBC</a>: <em>Powell raises doubts about cutting rates at next meeting.</em> </p>\n<p><strong>FEDERAL PROSECUTORS SUSPENDED</strong>: Two federal prosecutors were <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5579424-doj-prosecutors-jan-6-mob-trump/\">suspended hours after</a> filing a sentencing memo describing Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack defendents as a “mob of rioters.”</p>\n<p>Multiple outlets reported that Assistant U.S. Attorneys <strong>Carlos Valdivia</strong> and <strong>Samuel White</strong> were told Wednesday that they were suspended and were locked out of their government devices. It came after they filed a memo recommending a 27-month sentence for <strong>Taylor Taranto</strong>, who with other Jan. 6 defendents received a pardon earlier this year from Trump.</p>\n<p>Taranto is set to be sentenced on Friday for unrelated crimes, including threatening the National Institute of Standards and Technology and driving through former <strong>President Obama</strong>’s neighborhood with a van containing firearms and munition. </p>\n<p>The prosecutors only discussed the Jan. 6 attack in a few lines of their 14-page sentencing memo, saying that a “mob of rioters” attacked the Capitol and Taranto was accused of participating in the “riot” by entering the Capitol. The memo also included the signature of Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney <strong>Jeanine Pirro</strong>. </p>\n<p><em>“While we don’t comment on personnel decisions, we want to make very clear that we take violence and threats of violence against law enforcement, current or former government officials extremely seriously,”</em> Pirro said in a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/29/jan-6-prosecutors-case-leave-00627086\">statement</a> reported by multiple media outlets. </p>\n<p>The suspensions appear to mark the latest example of the administration reframing the events of the Jan. 6 attack. The president and other allies have repeatedly downplayed the violence of the day, with Trump having called it a “day of love” during the 2024 campaign. </p>\n<p>The Justice Department has also conducted a purge of prosecutors who worked on Jan. 6 cases.</p>\n<p><strong>MELISSA DEATH TOLL RISES</strong>: The death toll from Hurricane Melissa is rising as the storm <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-melissa-cuba-jamaica-flooding-winds-275a4d2d41a0ff3f382053865eefe295\">continues to move</a> through the Caribbean. </p>\n<p>Dozens are dead in Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti amid widespread destruction. The storm hit Jamaica first as a rare Category 5 hurricane, causing life-threatening storm surge and dangerous flooding. </p>\n<p>At least 25 people have been killed and 18 are missing in Haiti, according to the country’s Civil Protection Agency. Twenty of those killed lived in a southern coastal town where flooding caused homes to collapse. </p>\n<p>At least eight people have been killed in Jamaica. </p>\n<p>The storm moved through Cuba and the Bahamas and is now on track to reach Bermuda before going back out into the Atlantic Ocean. It has weakened but is still expected to bring strong winds, rain and storm surge.</p>\n<p>Relief efforts have already started in Jamaica with the storm passed, but more than three-quarters of the island nation lost electricity.

Most recently, she <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5577071-greene-johnson-health-care-plans-shutdown/\">criticized</a> House Speaker <strong>Mike Johnson</strong> (R-La.) for not offering details of an alternative health care plan that he said Republicans are working on. She also slammed Johnson for his decision to keep the House out of session for weeks while the shutdown has dragged on. </p>\n<p><em>“Johnson said he’s got ideas and pages of policy ideas and committees of jurisdiction are working on it, but he refused to give one policy proposal to our GOP conference on our own conference call,”</em> Greene said on X.</p>\n<p><em>“Apparently I have to go into a SCIF to find out the Republican healthcare plan!!!”</em> she added, referring to a secure area used to review classified material.</p>\n<p>Earlier on, she broke with Republicans in calling Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza a “genocide.” </p>\n<p>Sen. <strong>Ted Cruz</strong> (R-Texas) brushed off Greene’s comments on Wednesday, telling CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5578793-ted-cruz-marjorie-taylor-greene/\">people shouldn’t listen</a> to Greene. He also suggested that Greene has shifted leftward politically. </p>\n<p>It came after Ohio Sen. <strong>Bernie Moreno</strong> (R) called on Greene to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5578461-aca-subsidies-gop-debate/\">stop her public criticism</a> of Johnson. He said she should “present an option” rather than simply “criticize what other people are doing.” </p>\n<p>And Johnson himself also voiced exasperation earlier this month after Greene accused him of “hypocrisy” for his handling of controversy surrounding Rep. <strong>Cory Mills</strong> (R-Fla.). </p>\n<p><em>“I try not to react to what Marjorie Taylor Greene says every day,” </em>Johnson <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5560535-mike-johnson-marjorie-taylor-greene/\">said</a>. </p>\n<p>Greene has <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5550346-marjori-taylor-greene-split-republicans/\">defended herself</a> against the criticism, insisting that she hasn’t changed, even as several of her colleagues say they’ve been thrown off by her positions. </p>\n<p>To be sure, Greene is still one of Trump’s most passionate supporters and still demonstrates herself as a true believer in his MAGA and America First agenda. But the split from other Republicans in Congress is still notable. </p>\n<p><em>“I am 100 percent the same person today as I was when I ran for Congress,” </em>Greene said. </p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/29/marjorie-taylor-greene-shutdown-attacks-00628195\">Politico</a>: <em>Republicans are growing tired of Greene’s shutdown attacks.</em> </p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/atlanta/news/rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-urges-gop-to-go-nuclear-slams-partys-lack-of-health-care-plan-amid-shutdown-fight/\">CBS News</a>: <em>Greene calls for Senate Republicans to go nuclear to end shutdown.</em> </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Elsewhere</h2>\n<p><strong>WILDERS’S SETBACK:</strong> Dutch far-right leader <strong>Geert Wilders</strong>’s party sustained notable losses in the Netherlands’s general election, though the race to lead a governing coalition in the Dutch Parliament seems up in the air.</p>\n<p>Wilders’s right-wing populist Party for Freedom and the centrist Democrats 66 (D66) party appear to have tied with each party winning 26 seats each in the Dutch House of Representatives. The party that wins the most seats generally has the first opportunity to form a governing coalition, but what happens from here is unclear as no Dutch election has previously ended with two parties tied for the lead.</p>\n<p>Wilders said his party should play a role in forming a coalition if it is the largest in Parliament.</p>\n<p><em>“As long as there’s no 100% clarity on this, no D66 scout can get started.
