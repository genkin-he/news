            "title": "The Clintons and the politics of scandal",
            "description": "<p>The deposition of former President Bill Clinton this week was both unprecedented and strikingly reminiscent. It was the first time a former president had been deposed by the House, let alone under subpoena. Yet it is hardly the first deposition for Clinton. Twenty-eight years ago, I testified in Clinton’s impeachment hearing after he had lied under oath about his relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.</p>\n<p>Given his earlier previous perjury over an affair with a young woman, few would rely on Clinton’s denials of relations with multiple young women shown in pictures associated with Epstein. But given the paucity of direct evidence, there is ample room for plausible deniability. And plausible deniability is the realm wherein the Clintons have long dwelt — between the outright conclusive and the merely scandalous.</p>\n<p>The embarrassing photos of Clinton in a hot tub or receiving massages from young women come as a shock to no one. For anyone familiar with his past, Clinton was in his element. The level of Clinton’s interaction with Epstein is also extensive. Clinton flew on Epstein’s notorious private plane, dubbed the “Lolita Express, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79l38vl3lwo\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">at least 26 times</a> and had Epstein visit the White House <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/02/26/hillary-clinton-neighbors-sound-off-epstein-testimony/88887638007/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">at least 16 times.</a> Although Clinton has denied visiting Epstein’s island, various witnesses <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/05/26/clinton-spent-time-on-epsteins-orgy-island-netflix-doc/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">have claimed they saw him there</a>.</p>\n<p>Epstein emails also discuss his contributions to the Clinton Global Initiative and his work to assist the Clintons.</p>\n<p>That presents a greater challenge than debating <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/bctest092198_4.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">what the meaning of “is is.”</a></p>\n<p>The greatest danger was not that Clinton would be charged with sexual crimes connected to these underage girls. Prosecutors clearly did not find sufficient evidence for such charges. However, Clinton has previously shown the danger of being “too clever by half.” He and Hillary have spent their lives evading accountability, including his alleged perjury in the prior deposition. That record can create a dangerous sense of impunity and misplaced self-confidence.</p>\n<p>In 1998, I appeared at the Clinton impeachment and, despite voting for Clinton as a lifelong Democrat, I testified that his conduct in office had satisfied the standard of a “high crime and misdemeanor.”</p>\n<p>Clinton ultimately relied on Democratic senators to avoid conviction and was never formally charged with perjury, despite his public admissions of guilt.</p>\n<p>In the latest deposition, Clinton denied knowing anything about Epstein’s conduct with underage girls. Clinton built on his prior Lewinsky testimony by pluralizing his most famous declaration, denying that he had sex with those women. He said he had no memory of the identity of the young woman pictured with him in the hot tub. “I saw nothing,” he declared. “I did nothing wrong.”</p>\n<p>For critics, it was the <a href=\"https://www.bing.com/videos/riverview/relatedvideo?q=%22I+see+nothing!+I+hear+nothing!+I+know+nothing!+schultz&amp;mid=CDF2C9733176CF1E7AD5CDF2C9733176CF1E7AD5&amp;FORM=VIRE\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sgt. Schultz defense</a> that the Clintons have used in a long litany of scandals.</p>\n<p>There is no evidence that Clinton had relations with “those women.” Although Epstein’s associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, attended Chelsea Clinton’s wedding after the allegations were publicly known, there is no way to prove any knowledge by Clinton of his friend’s unlawful proclivities. Maxwell was also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/25/epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-bill-clinton-conference\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">given an award</a> by the Clinton Global Initiative in 2013 — five years after the public disclosure of the first Epstein allegations.</p>\n<p>Investigators will now go through the long deposition to see if Clinton tripped any wires in his denials. In the meantime, Democrats are denouncing the deposition while pledging to replicate it by hauling in President Trump at some future date, once they are back in power. It is unlikely to happen while he is in office, but the Clinton deposition created a precedent for subpoenaing former presidents.</p>\n<p>There is no evidence that Trump committed any crime in relation to Epstein. He will be able to point to the fact that he expelled Epstein from his club at Mar-a-Lago, as well as his correspondence with local police encouraging their investigation of Epstein.  </p>\n<p>It does not matter that prosecutors, including under the Biden administration, found no evidence to charge Trump. Democrats have already dispensed with any need for a factual basis for conspiracy theories.</p>\n<p>Recently, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) gave a <a href=\"https://jonathanturley.org/2026/02/15/ro-khanna-and-the-impunity-of-wealthy-powerful-men/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">chest-pounding speech</a> about revealing the names of six powerful men who had been protected by the Trump Justice Department from disclosure. Four of them turned out to have nothing to do with Epstein and weren’t especially powerful either. All Khanna accomplished was to multiply by 400 percent <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/11/21/us-news/dr-jeffrey-epstein-the-long-island-neurosurgeon-jasmine-crockett-confused-for-notorious-pedophile-floats-epic-revenge-he-could-exact-on-the-congresswoman/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the earlier fiasco</a> by Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas), who spuriously connected politicians with a different man — a neurosurgeon named Jeffrey Epstein.</p>\n<p>This week, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) used a hearing to accuse Trump of abusing an underage girl who was later allegedly murdered to keep her silent. His source? A driver who said he overheard Trump talking about abusing a minor and later learned of her murder. There is no evidence of the death, and the source has reportedly published hundreds of anti-Trump and bizarre postings. </p>\n<p>Lieu posted two pages from the FBI report containing the allegation but <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2026/02/13/us-news/lieu-makes-wild-claim-about-trump-based-on-unhinged-source/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">withheld a third page</a> that showed the same man making further allegations of a drunken Hillary Clinton and an effort to frame someone in the Oklahoma City bombing. There is a good reason raw investigative and grand jury materials are usually kept secret.</p>\n<p>The only thing more indecent than Epstein himself is the effort to use the scandal for political advantage. The scandal has ensnared as many leading Democrats as Republicans, if not more. But Epstein is the perfect political weapon with salacious allegations to inject directly into the media bloodstream against your opponents. </p>\n<p>Epstein himself once boasted, “I invest in people — be it politics or science. It’s what I do.” It now appears that Epstein himself is the investment that many in politics believe will bring unlimited political gains. </p>\n<p><em>Jonathan Turley is a law professor and the author of the New York Times bestselling “<a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/r.nypostlink.com/?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;btn_url=https*3A*2F*2Fwww.amazon.com*2FRage-Republic-Unfinished-American-Revolution*2Fdp*2F1668205025*3Ftag*3Dnypost-20*26asc_refurl*3Dhttps*3A*2F*2Fnypost.com*2F2026*2F01*2F07*2Fopinion*2Fthe-peril-of-mamdani-and-weavers-communist-college-kids-nyc-field-trip*2F*26asc_source*3Dweb__;JSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUl!!F0Stn7g!BjWySLJ4OwlcQZhb6wPOFS2EOKhL7o-sM6nnqIESQ0JVK8oWxyxym3SeoJz3PoYEXyZsHnFu6qmX2BMJ8juro55URA$\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rage and the Republic</a>: The Unfinished Story of the American Revolution.”</em></p>",

            "title": "Jeffries: Democrats 'committed' to forcing Iran war powers vote in wake of US strikes",
            "description": "<p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) pledged that House Democrats will force a vote on limiting President Trump’s war powers in Iran as he criticized the president for striking the country without explicit congressional authorization.</p>\n<p>“The framers of the United States Constitution gave Congress the sole power to declare war as the branch of government closest to the American people,” Jeffries said in a statement Saturday in response to the strikes.</p>\n<p>“Iran is a bad actor and must be aggressively confronted for its human rights violations, nuclear ambitions, support of terrorism and the threat it poses to our allies like Israel and Jordan in the region. However, absent exigent circumstances, the Trump administration must seek authorization for the preemptive use of military force that constitutes an act of war,” Jeffries said.</p>\n<p>He mentioned a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5745037-khanna-massie-war-powers-iran/\">war powers resolution</a> spearheaded by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) that would make Trump remove U.S. forces from hostilities in Iran without congressional authorization. </p>\n<p>“House Democrats remain committed to compelling a vote on this resolution upon our return,” Jeffries said. </p>\n<p>War powers resolutions are privileged parliamentary procedures in the House and Senate, allowing members to bypass House Republican leaders to force floor votes on war powers measures.</p>\n<p>But as of earlier this week, the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5756657-democrats-trump-iran-war-powers/\">resolution was expected to fail</a> in the House given overwhelming opposition from Republicans and a few Democrats. Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.), both of whom are supporters of Israel, had announced their opposition to the resolution. Party leaders, though, wanted to get all lawmakers on the record for the vote.</p>\n<p>Massie, in a <a href=\"https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/2027739993033134279?s=20\">post on X</a> Saturday morning, also renewed his commitment to forcing the vote.</p>\n<p>“I am opposed to this War. This is not ‘America First,’” Massie said. “When Congress reconvenes, I will work with @RepRoKhanna to force a Congressional vote on war with Iran. The Constitution requires a vote, and your Representative needs to be on record as opposing or supporting this war.”</p>\n<p>Jeffries worried about negative long-term consequences from Trump’s strikes.</p>\n<p>“If Iran’s nuclear program was ‘completely and totally obliterated’ by the military strikes in June 2025, as Donald Trump boldly proclaimed, there should be no need to strike them now,” Jeffries said in a statement. </p>\n<p>“Equally troublesome, the advancement of security and stability in the Middle East requires more than military might, as we painfully discovered in several failed wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Trump administration must explain itself to the American people and Congress immediately, provide an ironclad justification for this act of war, clearly define the national security objective and articulate a plan to avoid another costly, prolonged military quagmire in the Middle East.”</p>",

We call for a resumption of negotiations and urge the Iranian leadership to seek a negotiated solution.

            "title": "How to solve the current and future physician shortage",
            "description": "<p>Over nearly 50 years, the medical school I founded has sent <a href=\"https://www.sgu.edu/about-sgu/history/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">more than 20,000 physicians</a> into the international health care system — more than any other single institution. </p>\n<p>Back then, I had an idea that the American medical establishment considered crazy, and reckless: To start an English-language medical school outside the U.S., using an American curriculum, close enough that graduates could train and practice in American hospitals. The logic was simple: If the U.S. was not producing enough doctors, others would have to help fill the gap.</p>\n<p>That idea became St. George’s University in Grenada. And for all these years, I have been right in the thick of the physician pipeline into the U.S. health care system.</p>\n<p>At the time of the university’s beginning, policymakers were warning of a “physician glut.” In fact, four years after St. George’s opened, the U.S. effectively stopped expanding medical education. <a href=\"https://macyfoundation.org/assets/reports/publications/new_and_developing_schools_part2.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">In 1980, there were 127 U.S. medical schools; by 1990 there were 125</a>. After rapid growth in the 1960s and 1970s, expansion had stalled following federal workforce projections — most notably a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK232541/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1981 report that warned of an impending physician surplus</a> and encouraged restraint.</p>\n<p>Those assumptions went largely unchallenged for nearly two decades, but they were wrong. Today’s physician shortage is serious, but the problem ahead is even more profound than most projections suggest, because many of the assumptions behind current forecasts no longer hold.</p>\n<p>First, one quarter of the U.S. physician workforce <a href=\"https://www.aamc.org/data-reports/data/2024-key-findings-and-definitions\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">consists of international medical graduates</a>. The vast majority of these doctors are foreign-born and foreign-trained, and many rely on hospital sponsorship to complete residency training. Any disruption to visa pathways — whether through rising costs such as the <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/h-1b-faq\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">new $100,000 H1-B visa application fee</a>, administrative barriers or political uncertainty — immediately constrains physician supply. A workforce that is structurally dependent on international physicians cannot be susceptible to the vagaries of politics.</p>\n<p>Second, access to medical education is itself tightening. New limits on professional student borrowing will make medical school financially unreachable for many qualified applicants. At a time when we need more doctors, we are quietly narrowing the pipeline.</p>\n<p>Third, the workforce is aging. <a href=\"https://www.aamc.org/news/press-releases/aamc-report-reinforces-mounting-physician-shortage\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">More than 40 percent</a> of active physicians will reach typical retirement age within the next decade. Each year the U.S. produces <a href=\"https://osteopathic.org/about/aoa-statistics/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">roughly 30,000 new Doctors of Medicine and Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine</a>, but that output barely offsets attrition, let alone population growth. New medical schools — most opening with classes of 60 students or fewer — will not close the gap. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the population is growing older, sicker and more medically complex. Americans are not only living longer, they are demanding care that preserves function and quality of life. If the country expands coverage further and brings tens of millions of uninsured Americans into regular care, demand will rise again.</p>\n<p>The conclusion is unavoidable: The current model of physician production cannot meet future needs, even under optimistic assumptions. So, what do we do?</p>\n<p>The answer is not simply to build more traditional medical schools. U.S. medical education is tightly linked to large, expensive research enterprises, which makes schools slow to open and costly to operate. Research universities have driven extraordinary innovation, but tying every medical school to a full-scale research infrastructure has also constrained capacity. </p>\n<p>St. George’s demonstrated something different: A teaching-focused medical school, anchored to strong clinical training and targeted research exposure, can produce outstanding physicians at scale. We now need to think bigger.</p>\n<p>One solution is to create a new system of teaching medical schools, with a dedicated accreditation pathway, formally partnered — or “twinned” — with established research institutions. These schools would focus primarily on education and clinical excellence, while maintaining structured access to research through their partner institutions. Some could be located domestically; others, as international medical schools have already proven, could operate outside the U.S. without compromising standards.</p>\n<p>At the same time, we must address maldistribution. Schools like St. George’s are already moving in this direction, offering substantial tuition support to students from rural and underserved communities in exchange for commitments to return home to practice. Training doctors who already understand the communities most in need is one of the most effective ways to close access gaps. </p>\n<p>When St. George’s opened in 1977, the idea was dismissed as unrealistic. History has proven otherwise. </p>\n<p>Today’s physician shortage will not be solved by incremental adjustments or by hoping current projections are wrong. It will take the same kind of bold thinking that challenged orthodoxy 50 years ago. If we want a healthy nation, we must be willing to rethink how and where we train the doctors who care for it. </p>\n<p><em>Charles R. Modica is the chancellor of St. George’s University and author of the forthcoming “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Docs-Bay-Americas-Unlikely-Medical/dp/B0FQWPGSPY\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Docs on the Bay: The Dream that Became America’s Most Unlikely Medical School</a>” (Post Hill Press, April 2026)</em>.</p>",

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), known to be a war hawk in the upper chamber of Congress, doubled down on the president’s call for regime change.</p>\n<p>“His speech will go down in history as the catalyst for the most historic change in the Middle East in a thousand years. I echo President Trump’s call to the Iranian military, IRGC and security forces to lay down their arms,” he <a data-id=\"https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/2027706424533422531\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/2027706424533422531\">wrote on social platform X</a>. “I echo his call to the Iranian people to take back their government.”</p>\n<p>“President Trump was right when he said he’s the first president in 47 years to stand with the people of Iran and give them the backing they need,” he added. “I am confident this operation will be successful and the liberation of the long suffering people of Iran is at hand.”</p>\n<p>Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, also commended the president for the decision in a <a href=\"https://x.com/SenTomCotton/status/2027718442686480726\">post</a> on X.</p>\n<p>“The butcher’s bill has finally come due for the ayatollahs,” Cotton wrote. “May God bless and protect our troops on this vital mission of vengeance, and justice, and safety.”</p>\n<p>He urged his followers to watch Trump’s roughly 8-minute speech.</p>\n<p>“Please watch this excellent statement by President Trump,” Cotton <a data-id=\"https://x.com/SenTomCotton/status/2027723337804222842\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/SenTomCotton/status/2027723337804222842\">wrote in a separate post</a>. “He put it simply: for 47 years of Iran’s war against America, ‘it’s been mass terror, and we’re not going to put up with it any longer.'”</p>\n<p>Sen. Rick Scott, who also sits on the committee, praised Trump for his “strong leadership” following the strikes, which were dubbed part of “Operation Epic Fury.”</p>\n<p>“Operation Epic Fury is peace through strength on full display, and a reminder to our friends and our enemies: The U.S. will ALWAYS put AMERICA FIRST,” Scott <a href=\"https://x.com/SenRickScott/status/2027722947553611880\">wrote online</a>. “We will always stand with our friend, Israel, and we will NEVER allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon.”</p>\n<p>These congratulatory remarks come as some lawmakers on <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5757526-davidson-massie-back-resolution-iran/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5757526-davidson-massie-back-resolution-iran/\">both sides</a> of the aisle have <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5760287-lawmakers-call-war-powers-vote/\">pressed for a vote</a> on a <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5753315-trump-iran-military-force-resolution-fails/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5753315-trump-iran-military-force-resolution-fails/\">war powers resolution</a> that would block the administration from continued use of military force against Tehran without congressional approval. That request was exacerbated Saturday following the attack.</p>\n<p>House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) called the strikes “a bold, decisive act of strength by President Trump” in a <a data-id=\"https://x.com/GOPMajorityWhip/status/2027722551812620703\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/GOPMajorityWhip/status/2027722551812620703\">post on X</a>.</p>\n<p>“The Ayatollah is responsible for killing hundreds of U.S. service members and slaughtering its own people,” Emmer continued. “We pray that because of this leadership, the U.S. and the world will be a safer place. May God bless and protect the men and women of our military conducting this mission and serving in the region.”</p>\n<p>Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) also expressed her support for the operations. </p>\n<p>“The Iranian regime has slaughtered thousands of its own people in recent days, men, women, and children, whose only crime was asking for freedom,” Mace <a href=\"https://x.com/RepNancyMace/status/2027706207620718882?s=20\">wrote</a> on X. </p>\n<p>“Tyrants and terrorists everywhere should take note: the world is watching,” she continued. “History is watching. We must not forget what is happening in Iran. We must not turn a blind eye. History does not forgive those who look away from massacre.”</p>\n<p>Rep. Rick Crawford (R-Ark.) urged people to “pray for the safety” of Americans and military service members in the region and expressed his support for the actions taken against the Iranian regime.</p>\n<p>“President Trump has given Iran plenty of opportunities to take the diplomatic route,” he wrote <a data-id=\"https://x.com/RepRickCrawford/status/2027722407763460286\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/RepRickCrawford/status/2027722407763460286\">in a post online</a>. “The United States of America has the most premier military in the world, and I am confident it will successfully carry out the very clearly stated goals of this operation.” </p>\n<p>“I would strongly advise the Iranian regime heed President Trump’s warning,” Crawford added later.</p>\n<p>Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) has so far been the only Democrat to signal support for the strikes.</p>\n<p>“President Trump has been willing to do what’s right and necessary to produce real peace in the region,” Fetterman <a href=\"https://x.com/SenFettermanPA/status/2027674658091204808\">wrote</a> in a post on X. “God bless the United States, our great military, and Israel.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Democrats reacting to the U.S. air strikes on Iran are calling on President Trump to provide further information to Congress while warning the White House it could be dragging the U.S. into a wider war in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, questioned the need for the attack in his statement, and warned the U.S. could be repeating “mistakes of the past” in a nod to the Iraq War launched by former President George W. Bush.</p>\n<p>“Iran’s leadership has long supported terrorism across the region, undermined regional stability, continued to advance its nuclear ambitions, and brutally repressed its own people,” Warner wrote. “But acknowledging those realities does not relieve any president of the responsibility to act within the law, with a clear strategy, and with Congress.</p>\n<p>“The American people have seen this playbook before – claims of urgency, misrepresented intelligence, and military action that pulls the United States into regime change and prolonged, costly nation-building” Warner wrote. “We owe it to our service members, and to every American family, to ensure that we are not repeating the mistakes of the past. The president owes the country clear answers: What is the objective? What is the strategy to prevent escalation? And how does this make Americans safer?”</p>\n<p>Warner said decisions of taking the U.S. to war should remain with Congress, and that Trump’s actions raise constitutional issues.</p>\n<p>“Congress must be fully briefed, and the administration must come forward with a clear legal justification, a defined end state, and a plan that avoids dragging the United States into yet another costly and unnecessary war,” he wrote.</p>\n<p>Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) called the U.S. attack “illegal and unconstitutional” because it was not approved by Congress.</p>\n<p>“Trump’s illegal actions raise the threat of escalation into a wider regional war with grave risks for U.S. troops and civilians in the region,” he wrote in a statement.</p>\n<p>Markey also accused Trump of “consistently exaggerated the imminence of Iran’s nuclear threat,” while noting the president had insisted Iran’s nuclear program had been “obliterated” by strikes last summer.</p>\n<p>He called for an immediate vote on a war powers resolution that has been introduced by Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).</p>\n<p>“A diplomatic solution remains the best way to permanently and verifiably prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon,” Market stated. “This is a crisis of Trump’s creation. Americans do not want another endless war in the Middle East.”</p>\n<p>Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) in a statement posted on X also warned of the possibility the U.S. could be drawn into a bigger war.</p>\n<p>“The Iranian people deserve freedom and dignity. But we cannot send our men and women to die at the whim of the President,” he wrote. “The regime’s actions shouldn’t become an excuse for a wider war that punishes civilians and puts our troops at risk.”</p>\n<p>Trump has been seeing support for his actions from a number of Republican lawmakers, however.</p>\n<p>And Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) in a statement offered support for the action.</p>\n<p>“Operation Epic Fury. President Trump has been willing to do what’s right and necessary to produce real peace in the region.

            "title": "Saving the SAVE Act — this one change can fix the American voting system",
            "description": "<p>For months, voter identification and proof of citizenship have been debated not only as policy proposals but as constitutional questions. Republicans argue that verifying voter eligibility is essential to election integrity. Democrats respond that such requirements risk disenfranchising voters. The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/22\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SAVE Act</a> represents the most direct federal effort to address that debate, by requiring documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to register for federal elections. </p>\n<p>I support the core premise behind the SAVE Act. American citizens should decide federal elections. Supporting that premise, however, does not eliminate the responsibility to evaluate the constitutional structure surrounding it. </p>\n<p>My hesitation in fully endorsing the SAVE Act stems from the 24th Amendment and the legal implications of how verification is implemented. The 24th Amendment <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/amendments/amendment-xxiv\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">prohibits poll taxes in federal elections</a>. If registering to vote requires documentary proof of citizenship, and obtaining that documentation requires payment — whether for a certified birth certificate, a passport or a REAL ID — the government risks attaching a financial condition to voting. </p>\n<p>Even relatively small administrative fees raise constitutional concerns when they function as mandatory prerequisites to ballot access. The relevant legal question is not whether documentation is reasonable, but whether any cost associated with it operates as a condition on a constitutionally protected right.</p>\n<p>Americans must present identification to open bank accounts, apply for SNAP benefits, enroll in Medicaid or Medicare, rent housing, secure employment, or board commercial flights. Identification functions as a baseline requirement across nearly every aspect of modern civic and economic life, a reality often overlooked by Democrats, who portray voter ID as uniquely burdensome. None of those activities, however, are protected by a constitutional amendment prohibiting financial barriers. Voting is. </p>\n<p>Because voting receives explicit protection, comparisons to identification requirements for other government services will not resolve the issue. The presence of identification standards elsewhere in federal law does not answer whether attaching a fee to voter registration implicates the 24th Amendment. </p>\n<p>But addressing the constitutional concern does not require abandoning the SAVE Act. If Congress mandates documentary proof of citizenship for registering to vote in federal elections, the federal and state governments should guarantee that eligible citizens can obtain qualifying documents at no cost. States could provide certified birth certificates for voting purposes at no charge. Federal agencies could waive passport documentation fees for limited verification use. REAL ID-compliant identification could be issued without administrative fees when used exclusively for voter registration. </p>\n<p>Once documentation is accessible without financial burden, the policy cannot plausibly be characterized as a poll tax. The constitutional objection would weaken substantially because the financial precondition would no longer exist. </p>\n<p>Public opinion further clarifies that no serious dispute regarding the SAVE Act can be grounded in broad voter opposition. Survey data over nearly two decades show bipartisan backing for voter identification requirements. In 2006, national polling indicated that approximately <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/06/21/80-of-americans-support-voter-id-rules-but-fewer-worried-about-fraud-poll-finds/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">80 percent of Americans</a> supported showing identification to vote. The lowest recorded level, in 2012, showed <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2026-02-10/voter-id-controversial\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">77 percent overall support,</a> including 61 percent of Democrats. </p>\n<p>As recently as last year, Pew Research <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2026-02-10/voter-id-controversial\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that 95 percent of Republicans and 71 percent of Democrats favored requiring government-issued identification for voting. Few election policies generate that level of cross-party agreement. </p>\n<p>For that reason, characterizing the SAVE Act as a revival of <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/freedom-riders-jim-crow-laws/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jim Crow laws</a> is historically and legally inaccurate. Jim Crow statutes were designed to exclude lawful voters through literacy tests, intimidation, arbitrary enforcement and selective application. A documentation requirement that verifies citizenship and is universally accessible without cost would not operate in that manner.</p>\n<p>Some Democrats defend expansive constitutional interpretations in other contexts through a living constitutional framework that allows rights to evolve with social practice, including the previously recognized federal right to abortion. Under that interpretive model, one could argue that voter identification reflects contemporary administrative norms rather than resembling historical poll taxes. But I do not approach constitutional interpretation through that lens.  </p>\n<p>An originalist framework requires examining the text and historical purpose of the 24th Amendment. That amendment was ratified to eliminate financial preconditions attached to voting in federal elections. Any modern requirement that effectively conditions registration on payment must be evaluated against that historical prohibition, regardless of contemporary administrative convenience. </p>\n<p>The debate, therefore, turns on implementation rather than ideology. If proof of citizenship is required, documentation must be provided at no cost to eligible voters. Once that safeguard is embedded in statutory design, the constitutional objection loses force. Opposition would then rest on policy preference rather than legal necessity. </p>\n<p>Federal elections demand both integrity and constitutional compliance. Citizenship verification aligns with the structure of representative government. Guaranteeing free access to required documentation aligns with the explicit command of the 24th Amendment. Careful legislative drafting can reconcile both principles without sacrificing either. </p>\n<p><em>Gregory Lyakhov is a nationally syndicated columnist and political commentator.</em></p>",
