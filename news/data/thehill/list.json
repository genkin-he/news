            "description": "<p>Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, on Thursday called for President Trump to testify under oath before the committee as part of its investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>\n<p>He did so as the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5756577-clintons-questioned-epstein-links/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">panel conducted a deposition</a> with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Chappaqua, N.Y., and is set to depose former President Clinton on Friday.</p>\n<p>“This committee has now set a new precedent about talking to presidents and former presidents,” Garcia said in a press conference during a break in Clinton’s deposition. “We’re demanding immediately that we ask President Trump to testify in front of our committee and be deposed in front of Oversight Republicans and Democrats.”</p>\n<p>Garcia and other Democrats brought up a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5723968/epstein-files-trump-accusation-maxwell\">report from NPR</a> from this week that said the Department of Justice withheld and removed some Epstein files related to Trump.</p>\n<p>“We want to understand right now, where the missing FBI files are,” Garcia said. “These are files that accuse the president of the United States of serious, serious accusations around sexual abuse and the fact that they’re not in the files, and have been apparently either removed or discarded, is incredibly concerning.”</p>\n<p>The White House has denied any wrongdoing by Trump, and the Justice Department has said the allegations against Trump were found to have no credibility.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5756249-doj-investigates-withheld-fbi-interviews/\">Department of Justice said in a statement is reviewing the matter</a>.</p>\n<p>“Several individuals and news outlets have recently flagged files related to documents produced to Ghislaine Maxwell in discovery of her criminal case that they claim appear to be missing,” it said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/DOJRR47/status/2026769082159112295?s=20\">statement Wednesday</a>.</p>\n<p>“As with all documents that have been flagged by the public, the Department is currently reviewing files within that category of the production. Should any document be found to have been improperly tagged in the review process and is responsive to the Act, the Department will of course publish it, consistent with the law.”</p>\n<p>Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), the chair of the Oversight panel, said earlier Thursday that the panel is looking into the NPR report and looking to get an answer from the Department of Justice about what happened.</p>\n<p>Clinton said in her deposition opening statement that she did not recall ever meeting Epstein, and had no knowledge of crimes committed by him and Maxwell. Garcia said Clinton was “completely cooperating with the deposition and the committee” and “answering questions in full faith and in good faith.”</p>",

            "description": "<p>Florida Republicans are repeating calls for regime change in Cuba in the wake of the Cuban coast guard killing four people and detaining others who were in a Florida-registered motorboat that Havana said crossed into Cuban territorial waters. </p>\n<p>The deadly confrontation adds another layer of volatility between Havana and Washington, amid President Trump’s fuel blockade around the island. Trump imposed the blockade at the end of January to weaken the Cuban communist regime. Last year, Trump designated Cuba as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. </p>\n<p>Rep. Carlos Gimenez (R-Fla.), who was born in Cuba, said Trump’s policies have brought the Cuban regime to the closest point of collapse in its 67 years. </p>\n<p>“The regime is in its weakest position. We have the right president and we have the right secretary of State and the right policies in place in order to make it happen,” Gimenez said on Fox News. </p>\n<p>“Actually I’ve been here for over 65 years. This is, you know, the closest we’ve been to seeing a free Cuba and for me it can’t happen soon enough.”</p>\n<p>Gimenez, who is also a member of the House Homeland Security and Armed Services committees, said he wants to know “exactly what happened” with the Cuban coast guard. </p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the Cuban coast guard said it confronted a Florida-registered speedboat and encountered armed individuals who opened fire, describing them as terrorists. Cuba said four people were killed and six others were detained. </p>\n<p>Gimenez demanded access to the individuals taken into custody. Gimenez described the individuals as Americans, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Wednesday that it’s not yet clear if they are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. </p>\n<p>Gimenez said Cuban officials view any Cuban diaspora as a Cuban national, regardless of other citizenship. He said the boat the Cuban coast guard confronted was a 24-foot open fisherman vessel with a 1,300 horsepower engine. </p>\n<p>“The original story was they were transporting human smuggling and now they’re terrorists. They are changing their story and we need to get to the bottom of it,” he said of Cuban officials. </p>\n<p>Gimenez raised the prospect that Cuba could use the six detained individuals as leverage in the standoff with the U.S.</p>\n<p>Other prominent Florida Republicans have called for regime change in Cuba. </p>\n<p>Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), who is running for governor, posted on the social platform X that the “Communist Cuban regime must go.”</p>\n<p>Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said Cuban leader Raúl Castro should be indicted in a U.S. court and put on trial “for all the Americans he killed.”</p>\n<p>Asked by The Hill if Trump should carry out an operation to capture Castro similar to the operation to seize Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro on a drug charges warrant, Scott deferred and predicted the Cuban people would eventually topple their government.</p>\n<p>“I think ultimately the Cuban people are going to just rise up, because of how bad it is,” he said.</p>\n<p>Trump has not laid out his demands for Cuba but said the fuel blockade could usher in regime collapse. </p>\n<p>Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is taking the lead on Trump’s policy toward Havana. The <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article314847434.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Miami Herald reported Thursday</a> that U.S. officials met on the sidelines of a conference in the Caribbean with Raúl Guillermo Rodriguez Castro, grandson and bodyguard to Raúl Castro, considered the de facto leader in Havana. </p>\n<p>Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month that the U.S. “would love to see the regime change, it doesn’t mean we’re going to make a change.” </p>\n<p>The secretary said that the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Coast Guard are carrying out an independent investigation into what happened with the Cuban coast guard.  </p>",

            "description": "<p>Republican strategist Karl Rove on Wednesday accused President Trump of making a “key mistake” during his State of the Union address by not pandering to his crowd of disenchanted voters who are seeking relief from financial hardship.</p>\n<p>“For them, the president’s speech almost certainly didn’t sound based in reality. Many Americans, especially swing voters, are pessimistic about the economy,” Rove wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/the-state-of-the-union-is-belligerent-b8d6e7a8\">Wall Street Journal op-ed</a>, highlighting job loss in the manufacturing sector preceding potentially more reductions due to artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>For weeks, Rove has urged Trump to cater to his base of voters plagued by rising costs.</p>\n<p>The strategist bucked the president’s claims that prices are decreasing and that tariffs would replace income tax, alleging that Trump “sounded as out of touch” as former President Biden when he preached “‘Bidenomics is working.’”</p>\n<p>In his Tuesday speech, Trump told listeners the economy was “roaring” and that America was “winning.” Rove said the vigor was motivating yet Trump’s efforts rarely show as material policy. </p>\n<p>“It too often sounded like a political convention speech rather than a presidential address. Even by the former’s standards, it was angry, pugnacious, and hence less effective,” Rove wrote.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Trump offered elements of a credible, effective case for Republicans in the midterm campaign. But if they’re to defend their majority successfully, congressional Republicans must offer more substance, be more forward-looking, display more empathy, and focus much more on the economy than what Americans heard Tuesday,” he added.</p>\n<p>Rove concluded the commentary with a clear call to the GOP: “They better get cracking. Time’s a-wasting.”</p>",

Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) leaked a photo from inside former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s deposition on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Clinton is testifying as part of the panel’s probe into the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>\n<p>Ranking member Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) said Clinton, who said she <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5756577-clintons-questioned-epstein-links/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">did not recall</a> ever meeting Epstein, was “completely cooperating with the deposition and the committee” and “answering questions in full faith and in good faith.”</p>\n<p>“What is not acceptable is Oversight Republicans breaking their own committee rules that they established with the Secretary and her team,” Garcia said in statements to the press during a break in the deposition. “It was gracious of the Secretary and her team to continue the deposition.”</p>\n<p>“We are sitting through an incredibly unserious clown show of a deposition where members of Congress and the Republican Party are more concerned about getting their photo op of Secretary Clinton than actually getting to the truth and holding anyone accountable,” Rep. Yassamin Ansari (D-Ariz.) said.</p>\n<p>The panel’s deposition of Clinton was paused after conservative influencer Benny Johnson <a href=\"https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/2027067846417690630\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">posted a photo</a> of Clinton in the deposition on social media, which he said came from Boebert.</p>\n<p>A Clinton adviser told the press that the hearing was paused because of the photo, which he said was a violation of the rules read at the start of the deposition.</p>\n<p>Johnson <a href=\"https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/2027080800961720538\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">balked at the photo</a> leading to a pause in the deposition, noting that the Clintons had asked to testify in a public setting and that the full deposition would later be released to the public.

What we’re seeing is folks that are looking for headlines and tweets as opposed to doing the business of going about getting justice for the victims,” said Rep.

The country has also managed to produce <a href=\"https://merics.org/en/comment/china-commercializing-energy-efficient-underwater-data-centers#:~:text=China%20has%20unveiled%20the%20world's%20first%20commercial,capable%20of%20holding%20up%20to%20500%20servers\">under-sea</a> data centers to boost cooling efficiency by 40 to 60 percent, with other major data center hubs in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Chengdu.</p>\n<p>Nevada is home to the data center with among the world’s largest capacity for power. <a href=\"https://www.switch.com/tahoe-reno/\">The Citadel</a> covers 7.2 million square feet and can deliver up to 650 megawatts of power.</p>\n<p>Despite the benefits of large language models, Sanders has railed against widespread initiatives to develop data centers across the country. </p>\n<p>In a Monday <a href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-yes-we-need-a-moratorium-on-data-center-construction/\">statement</a>, Sanders said data centers will have a “profound impact on land and water use, and will drive up electricity costs.” </p>\n<p>“Concerns about the very real environmental impact of data centers, however, are not the only reasons to support a moratorium,” the Vermont senator said. </p>\n<p>“Let’s be clear.

            "title": "Sanctioned UN human rights investigator's family sues Trump administration",
            "description": "<p>The family of a sanctioned United Nations human rights investigator on Wednesday sued the Trump administration for sanctioning her over her criticism of Israel’s military actions in Gaza, arguing that the sanctions violate her First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p>U.N. Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese’s husband, Massimiliano Cali, filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of Washington. They argued that Albanese’s work surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, along with her work with the International Criminal Court (ICC), “is core First Amendment activity.”</p>\n<p>“At its heart, this case concerns whether Defendants can sanction a person — ruining their life and the lives of their loved ones, including their citizen daughter — because Defendants disagree with their recommendations or fear their persuasiveness,” according to the filing.</p>\n<p>Cali, who filed the lawsuit on behalf of himself, Albanese and their child, also argued that the sanctions have negatively impacted their ability to access their home in Washington, D.C. Cali said his wife also lost access to her bank account and the ability to travel to the U.S.</p>\n<p>“Sanctions, used appropriately, are a powerful tool to disrupt and undermine the activities of terrorists, criminals and authoritarian regimes,” he said in the complaint. “Sanctions are abused, however, when they seek to silence disfavored points of view and to violate the constitutional rights of people the government does not like.”</p>\n<p>The lawsuit also argues that the sanctions violated her Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights in seizing her property without due process and violating sanction laws. </p>\n<p>“I have experienced enormous hardship,” Albanese told <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/26/us/francesca-albanese-lawsuit-trump-sanctions-israel-gaza.html\">The New York Times</a> in an interview on Thursday, noting that her family worries about risking committing a felony by supporting her. “There is a criminalization of my motherhood and the family bonds I have.”</p>\n<p>The State Department accused Albanese of being an open supporter of “antisemitism, terrorism, and has engaged in lawfare against our nation and our interests, including against major American companies vital to the world economy.”</p>\n<p>“Our sanctions are legal and appropriate,” the department said in a statement to The Hill. “The United States will continue to condemn and oppose her biased and malicious activities, which have long made her unfit for her role. This lawsuit itself is baseless lawfare, and Albanese is a disgrace.” </p>\n<p>The Hill has reached out to the White House for comment. The Department of Justice declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Albanese has been the rapporteur for the Palestinian territories since 2022. She has long advocated for the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and has called for holding Israeli leaders accountable. She has accused Israel of being an apartheid state and said the country has committed genocide in Gaza.</p>\n<p>In July 2025, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued sanctions on Albanese pursuant to President Trump’s executive order sanctioning the ICC. Rubio accused Albanese of antisemitism and “open contempt for the United States, Israel, and the West.” Albanese has denied supporting terrorism and rejected that her criticism of Israel is antisemitic.</p>\n<p>“That bias has been apparent across the span of her career, including recommending that the ICC, without a legitimate basis, issue arrest warrants targeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant,” Rubio said in a <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/07/sanctioning-lawfare-that-targets-u-s-and-israeli-persons\">statement </a>at the time. </p>\n<p>Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, slammed the sanctions as setting a “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5395305-united-nations-us-sanctions-francesca-albanese/\">dangerous precedent</a>.” </p>\n<p>“Special Rapporteurs do not report to the Secretary-General, and he has no authority over them or their work,” Dujarric said at the time. “That being said, Member States are perfectly entitled to their views and to disagree with the reports by the Special Rapporteurs, but we encourage them to engage with the UN human rights architecture. The use of unilateral sanctions against special rapporteurs, or any other UN expert or official is unacceptable.”</p>\n<p><em>The Associated Press contributed.</em><a href=\"https://apnews.com/world-news/israel-hamas-war-tracking-the-gaza-ceasefire\"></a></p>",
