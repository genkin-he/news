            "description": "<p>Netflix on Thursday said it would not match a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5757758-paramount-hostile-bid-warner-discovery/\">bid from Paramount</a> seeking to acquire Warner Brothers Discovery, the sprawling media empire that includes legacy brands in news and entertainment like CNN and HBO.</p>\n<p>News of the streamer bowing out of its deal with Warner Bros. Discovery came just minutes after the David Zaslav-led company said it considered the hostile bid mounted by Paramount to be a “superior” offer to the one it struck with the streamer <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5652023-netflix-warner-deal-paramount-bid/\">late last year</a>.</p>\n<p>Netflix’s deal would have given the streamer control of Warner Bros. Discovery’s premier movie and television studios at a price of more than $70 billion.</p>\n<p>“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” Netflix said in a statement. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.” </p>\n<p>Paramount’s bid, which seeks to purchase the entire Warner Bros. Discovery portfolio including its linear television assets like CNN and TNT Sports, comes with a purchase price of $31 per share in cash, as well as a $7 billion regulatory termination fee for the previous deal with Netflix.</p>\n<p>Paramount was sold last year to Skydance, the rapidly growing media conglomerate owned by Larry Ellison, an ally of President Trump and one of the richest people on earth. </p>\n<p>Since the sale, led by Larry’s son David Ellison, Paramount has worked to implement sweeping changes to the company’s news and entertainment divisions at CBS.</p>\n<p>The company has vowed to retool its news coverage and entertainment content offerings to appeal to a more politically diverse customer base, a sentiment many elected Democrats and media critics have warned signals as a rightward shift at the legacy media giant. </p>\n<p>“We are pleased WBD’s Board has unanimously affirmed the superior value of our offer, which delivers to WBD shareholders superior value, certainty and speed to closing,” David Ellison said in a statement on Thursday.</p>\n<p>A merger between Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery would require approval by President Trump’s Justice Department, which earlier this month ousted the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5735535-gail-slater-leaves-doj-antitrust/\">head of its antitrust division</a>.</p>\n<p>Trump has spoken positively about the Ellison’s efforts to retool CBS under Paramount, and said he wishes to see CNN operate under new ownership. </p>\n<p>As Paramount mounted its hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, the president and his allies railed against Netflix over what they argued is left-leaning bias at the streamer, while some Democrats on Capitol Hill raised anti-trust concerns about the proposed merger. </p>\n<p>“Netflix’s business is healthy, strong and growing organically, powered by our slate and best-in-class streaming service,” the company said. “This year, we’ll invest approximately $20 billion in quality films and series and will expand our entertainment offering. Consistent with our capital allocation policy, we’ll also resume our share repurchase program.”</p>",

            "description": "<p>Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) on Wednesday pressed Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Administrator Terry Cole for answers on an investigation into possible drug trafficking and suspicious financial transactions involving the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>\n<p>Wyden sent a letter to Cole requesting an unredacted version of a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00173953.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2015 memorandum</a> that references a probe entitled “Chain Reaction,” in which Epstein is named alongside 14 other alleged co-conspirators.</p>\n<p>“Since Epstein and his 14 co-conspirators were never charged by the DOJ for drug trafficking or financial crimes, I am concerned that the DEA and DOJ during the first Trump Administration moved to terminate this investigation in order to protect pedophiles,” Wyden wrote.</p>\n<p>“I am also concerned that the excessive redactions of this memorandum for operation ‘Chain Reaction’ go well beyond the intent of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which allows for redactions to protect the identity of victims, not members of a criminal sex trafficking organization. Since this memorandum is designated as ‘sensitive but unclassified’ there is no reason to withhold an unredacted version of this document from the U.S. Congress,” he added.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5612631-epstein-files-transparency-act/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Epstein Files Transparency Act</a> requires the Department of Justice (DOJ) to provide Congress with an explanation for all redactions and the release of any immunity deals, nonprosecution agreements, plea bargains and sealed settlements provided to Epstein or his associates.</p>\n<p>Multiple redactions submitted by the DOJ have been contested by Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), in some cases leading to the information being released. </p>\n<p>In addition to a redacted copy of the DEA memo, Wyden asked for clarity regarding whether Epstein and his associates were buying or selling narcotics and why none of the 14 co-conspirators were prosecuted when the DEA’s “Chain Reaction” operation concluded.</p>\n<p>The memo in question notes that the case was opened in 2010 in New York and suggested it remained active when the memo was drafted in 2015. The co-conspirators, it said, were being investigated for “illegitimate wire transfers which are tied to illicit drug and/or prostitution activities occurring in the U.S. Virgin Islands and New York City.”</p>\n<p>The names of other co-conspirators and many other details in the memo are blacked out in the released files.</p>\n<p>The DEA did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment.</p>",

            "description": "<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Wednesday revealed that childhood and teen obesity rates in the U.S. have reached record highs in recent years.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/hestat111.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">first report</a> details how the CDC’s researchers found that 40.3 percent of adults 20 and older were found to be obese, which included 9.7 percent who have severe obesity and another 31.7 percent who are classified as overweight. This report was conducted between August 2021 and August 2023.</p>\n<p>Between 1988 and 1994, when the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/hestat112.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">second report</a> was being surveyed, researchers found that almost 23 percent of adults 20 years and older were found to be obese. Of that number, 2.8 percent had severe obesity, and 33.1 percent were deemed overweight.</p>\n<p>The researchers relied on heights and weights established by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to monitor and track years-long trends. Surveying for both reports was paused starting in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and resumed in August 2021.</p>\n<p>Professor David Ludwig of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health called the rate levels “exceptionally concerning.” He noted in <a href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/rising-childhood-obesity-exceptionally-concerning-says-expert/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a report</a> published by the school that obesity rates were previously on a decline for children between 2 and 5 years old in the 2010s, something he said was a “glimmer of hope.” What reached down to 9.4 percent between 2013 and 2014 jumped to a 14.9 percent obesity rate.</p>\n<p>“We saw that dip [in 2014] and we all got excited thinking that we were beginning to turn the tide,” Ludwig said in the report. “In retrospect, that was more of a statistical aberration, more of mirage than a true glimmer of hope because the trend overall has continued upward.”</p>\n<p>The reports also show that adult obesity rates may be slowing as a result of public health policies and the introduction of GLP-1 agonists. </p>\n<p>“I do think the advent of the GLP-1s are absolutely playing a role,” Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children’s Hospital, told <a href=\"https://abcnews.com/Health/us-child-teen-obesity-rates-reach-record-high/story?id=130441952\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ABC News</a>. “At that point in 2023, they weren’t as widespread as they are today. So, we expect that these factors could play even more significant role in more recent times.”</p>\n<p>The new data comes months after Gallup found that the country’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5578724-glp-1-weight-loss/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">obesity rate declined</a> in the last three years as a result of Americans using GLP-1 agonists for weight loss. Pollsters, however, noted that this was likely a “vanity effect” accounting for Gallup’s slightly lower obesity rates on average when compared with randomized clinical measurements.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Anthropic said Thursday that “virtually no progress” had been made in the company’s talks with the Pentagon over the terms of use for its AI models ahead of a Friday afternoon deadline.</p>\n<p>The Defense Department (DOD) delivered its <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5757667-pentagon-threatens-anthropic-dpa/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5757667-pentagon-threatens-anthropic-dpa/\">last and final offer</a> to the company on Wednesday night, asking the AI firm to allow the department to access Claude for “all lawful purposes.”</p>\n<p>It is unclear changes the Pentagon has proposed as part of its latest offer to the company.</p>\n<p>“The contract language we received overnight from the Department of War made virtually no progress on preventing Claude’s use for mass surveillance of Americans or in fully autonomous weapons,” an Anthropic spokesperson told The Hill in a statement on Thursday.</p>\n<p>“New language framed as compromise was paired with legalese that would allow those safeguards to be disregarded at will,” they added. “Despite DOW’s recent public statements, these narrow safeguards have been the crux of our negotiations for months.”</p>\n<p>The Pentagon has threatened to cancel Anthropic’s contract if it does not agree to the department’s terms by Friday afternoon. The AI firm was one of several companies that received a $200 million contract with the DOD last summer.</p>\n<p>Anthropic’s usage policy bars its AI model from being used for mass surveillance or lethal autonomous weapons. These two issues have been the company’s red lines in its weeks-long negotiations with the Pentagon.</p>\n<p>Amid this dispute, the DOD has also threatened to label Anthropic as a “supply chain risk” and to invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) against the company. The DPA gives the president gives broad authority to control domestic industries in the name of national defense. </p>\n<p>The Pentagon has upped the pressure in recent days, reaching out to defense contractors about their reliance on Anthropic’s Claude in what appears to be an initial step toward labeling the company a supply chain risk. </p>\n<p>Amodei accused the DOD of “inherently contradictory threats” in negotiations with the the AI giant.</p>\n<p>“Regardless, these threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request,” Amodei said in a lenghty statement.</p>\n<p>“It is the Department’s prerogative to select contractors most aligned with their vision,” he added. “But given the substantial value that Anthropic’s technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider. Our strong preference is to continue to serve the Department and our warfighters—with our two requested safeguards in place.”</p>\n<p>The Pentagon said earlier on Thursday that it has “no interest in using AI to conduct mass surveillance of Americans (which is illegal) nor do we want to use AI to develop autonomous weapons that operate without human involvement.”</p>\n<p>“Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” Sean Parnell, chief Pentagon spokesperson , wrote in a post on the social platform X. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”</p>\n<p>The Pentagon’s latest proposal, which came less than 48 hours before the proposed deadline, included some of the Anthropic’s suggested language around narrow exceptions to the autonomous and surveillance provisions, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Hill on Thursday.  </p>\n<p>But substantively, the DOD offer reverts to permitting any lawful use while adding qualifiers where they see fit to the autonomy provision and all other applicable guidelines to the surveillance provision, the source briefed on the talks said.  </p>\n<p>The source argued that the additions are made to look like concessions, but ultimately give the other side the ability sideline restrictions whenever necessary.  </p>\n<p>They also accused the Pentagon of strategically leaking information to news outlets make it appear to be engaging in good-faith negotiations. </p>\n<p><em>Updated at 6:34 p.m. EST</em></p>",

            "description": "<p>Republican senators are putting pressure on Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Justice Department to release all files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that mention President Trump’s name, warning the issue won’t go away until there is full transparency.</p>\n<p>GOP senators are urging the Justice Department to fully comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act in the wake of media reports that the department hasn’t released records detailing claims a woman made in 2019 against both Epstein and Trump, that related to an incident from the 1980s.  </p>\n<p>Republicans are on the defensive as Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) is vowing that Democrats will use every tactic at their disposal to force the release of the missing records.</p>\n<p>Republican senators want the Justice Department to get ahead of the issue by releasing any records mentioning Trump that officials may have withheld due to their sensitive or unverified nature.</p>\n<p>“Release the documents. Redact the names of the victims. Don’t release photographs, naked or otherwise, of minors. Release the documents. This is not going to go away until there is full disclosure,” said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a member of the Judiciary Committee.</p>\n<p>Asked about the whether the administration should hold back unverified allegations a woman made against Trump in several interviews with the FBI, Kennedy replied: “I don’t know how else to say it: Release the documents.”</p>\n<p>While he said the Justice Department should use some “discretion” in “good faith,” he advised officials should strive for maximum transparency.</p>\n<p>“This is not going away until there’s full disclosure and the American people want to know, and they’re entitled to know, who if anyone, did Epstein traffic these women to … and why they weren’t prosecuted,” Kennedy said.</p>\n<p>Asked about reports that the Justice Department has withheld files mentioning Trump, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said that would seem to be in conflict with what Congress intended when it overwhelmingly passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know what the circumstances are and whether there’s legitimate reasons for redactions or withholding since he’s currently in office, but that would seem to be contrary with the intent of the law,” she said.</p>\n<p>Asked about missing files mentioning Trump’s name, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said the law passed by Congress last year was clear, the Justice Department should release all documents related to Epstein.</p>\n<p>“I think when we pass a law that says that all documents need to be put out, it seems to me all documents need to be put out,” Grassley said.</p>\n<p>The senior senator from Iowa said he hasn’t made a decision on whether he would hold a hearing on the Justice Department’s compliance with the law.</p>\n<p>Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), another member of the Judiciary panel, said it would be “concerning” if the Justice Department held back Epstein files that mention Trump.</p>\n<p>“If it’s in fact true, it’s concerning. Unless it fits the same filter as everyone else…,” he said. “I’ve heard the reporting but I haven’t nailed it down.”</p>\n<p>The New York Times and other media outlets reported this week that Epstein-related documents released by the Justice Department did not include FBI memos summarizing interviews with a woman who claimed that she was sexually assaulted by Trump and Epstein in the 1980s, when she was a minor.</p>\n<p>The White House has repeatedly said Trump did nothing wrong with regards to Epstein, and the Justice Department previously described the allegations as having no credibility.</p>\n<p>The missing memos were listed in an index that was publicly released by the Justice Department, which indicated that the FBI conducted four interviews related to the woman’s claims and wrote separate summaries about them.</p>\n<p>The interview notes connected to the investigation were not released, either.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department responded to The Times in a statement asserting that “the only materials that have been withheld were either privileged or duplicates” and later added that documents may have been withheld because of “an ongoing federal investigation.”</p>\n<p>On Wednesday night, Justice said it would be reviewing files to see if anything that should have been published was withheld.</p>\n<p>“Several individuals and news outlets have recently flagged files related to documents produced to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/ghislaine-maxwell/\">Ghislaine Maxwell </a>in discovery of her criminal case that they claim appear to be missing,” it said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/DOJRR47/status/2026769082159112295?s=20\">statement Wednesday</a>.</p>\n<p>“As with all documents that have been flagged by the public, the Department is currently reviewing files within that category of the production. Should any document be found to have been improperly tagged in the review process and is responsive to the Act, the Department will of course publish it, consistent with the law.”</p>\n<p>Independent journalist Roger Sollenberger first reported on the missing pages.</p>\n<p>Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said she hasn’t closely followed the Justice Department’s compliance with the law but added that she would want to “look into” the matter.</p>\n<p>“I thought that they had released all of the files. So it’s definitely something I’d want to look into because I think Congress as a body has really said we need clarity on this issue,” she said.</p>\n<p>Schumer joined several other Democratic senators at a press conference in the Capitol Thursday pledging to keep pushing the issue until the Justice Department issues all the Epstein files in its possession, including all documents that mention the president.  </p>\n<p>“The law requires the DOJ to release all the files, not just some of the files, not just the ones they pick and choose and want to do,” Schumer said Thursday. “Let me be blunt, there is a massive coverup going on in the Justice Department to protect Donald Trump and people associated with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>\n<p>Schumer said Democrats are working with the victims’ attorneys and legal experts to push for the release of additional documents.</p>\n<p>“We will not rest, it’s an all-out oversight effort. We’re going to pull on every thread, we’re going to chase every lead. We’ll talk to whistleblowers,” he announced.</p>\n<p>A group of Senate Democrats plan to travel to the Justice Department “in the coming days” to review the unredacted Epstein files.</p>\n<p>“Pam Bondi should listen carefully, the truth will come out,” Schumer said. “Democrats are going to hold Pam Bondi and everyone involved at the DOJ accountable for this cover up.”</p>\n<p>Democrats have asked the Justice Department and FBI to preserve all records related to decisions on redacting and withholding Epstein related documents.</p>\n<p>Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said in a statement Tuesday that Justice Department “appears to have illegally withheld FBI interviews” with the woman who made allegations against Trump.</p>\n<p>Garcia pledged to open up an investigation on the matter.</p>",

            "description": "<p>U.S. power plant pollution rose last year, according to a green group’s analysis of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data.</p>\n<p>Emissions of sulfur dioxide increased by 18 percent in 2025, according to an analysis by the <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/press-releases/coal-pollution-spiked-after-trump-administrations-free-pass-pollute\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Natural Resources Defense Council</a>, an environmental advocacy group, of the EPA data.</p>\n<p>The group found that plants’ nitrogen oxide emissions increased 7 percent and their carbon dioxide emissions increased by 4 percent.</p>\n<p>Both <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/so2-pollution/sulfur-dioxide-basics\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sulfur dioxide</a> and <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/no2-pollution/basic-information-about-no2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">nitrogen oxides</a> can harm peoples’ respiratory systems. </p>\n<p>The analysis found that at <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5239327-trump-exempts-coal-plants/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the dozens of coal plants</a> that President Trump exempted from strict Biden-era standards for <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5747717-trump-coal-plants-lead-mercury/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mercury and Air Toxics (MATS)</a>, sulfur dioxide emissions increased by 24 percent.</p>\n<p>“President Trump gave coal plants a free pass to pollute, and they took him up on the offer,” said Amanda Levin, director of policy analysis at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) in a written statement.  “With no cop on the beat to make sure the owners of these plants ran their pollution controls effectively, they ignored the health of their surrounding communities to save a few bucks on their costs. The rest of us will pay with our health.”</p>\n<p>The EPA, however, accused the group of cherry-picking data in a misleading way.</p>\n<p>“NRDC is peddling misleading, cherry-picked data in a desperate attempt to drum up donations,” an EPA spokesperson said via email. </p>\n<p>“MATS has little or nothing to do with sulfur dioxide emissions. And even if the now-repealed Biden EPA 2024 MATS rule had gone into effect, compliance with the 2024 MATS requirements was not required until 2027, so those requirements did not impact 2025 emissions,” the spokesperson added. </p>\n<p>The Trump administration has sought to bolster coal plants, including by loosening climate and environmental standards, providing funds and ordering plants to stay online. It has argued that this power is needed to support the electric grid, while environmental groups have raised concerns about pollution and climate change.</p>",
