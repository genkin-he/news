Roberts argued that conservatives should put loyalty to “Christ first, and America always” before reflexive support of Israel, no matter the tremendous pressure they might receive from the “globalist class.”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>That dog whistle conjured up antisemitic images of a parasitic, transnational Zionist lobby arrayed against Christian nationalism. And now Fuentes is taking a victory lap, flanked by MAGA’s leading pundit on one arm and MAGA’s leading think tank on the other, his toxic brand of antisemitism poised to waltz into the conservative mainstream.</p>\n<p>Heritage seems to have taken a sudden and dizzying turn; for more than a year the organization sought to elbow its way to the front lines of the fight against antisemitism, which it associated exclusively with the pro-Palestine left.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>In October 2024, Heritage <a href=\"https://religiondispatches.org/heritage-foundations-christian-nationalist-project-esther-wont-combat-antisemitism-but-it-will-weaponize-jews/\">released</a> Project Esther, an authoritarian playbook much like <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/project-2025\">Project 2025 </a>(from which it derived its namesake) calling on the Trump administration to “disrupt” and “degrade” pro-Palestine advocacy using the full force of the state. Once in office, Donald Trump moved quickly to fulfill many of its goals,<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj5nlxz44yo\"> locking up activists like Mahmoud Khalil,</a> <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/columbia-university-funding-trump-fa70143c715df8fd4ef337c0e1ccf872\">strong-arming universities like Columbia </a>and threatening advocacy organizations with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/doj-sues-over-pro-palestinian-protest-using-law-abortion-clinic-access-2025-09-29/\">lawsuits</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trumps-war-left-inside-plan-investigate-liberal-groups-2025-10-09/\">terrorism designations</a>, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/gop-effort-revoke-tax-exempt-status-some-nonprofits-sparks-concern-2071764\">revocation of nonprofit status</a> and more.</p>\n<p>When Project Esther launched, its backers dismissed any need to include the fight against right-wing antisemitism in its mandate, arguing that the left represented the only real threat to Jewish safety. Many flat-out denied the very premise that antisemitism exists within the conservative movement. “I refuse to acknowledge that [antisemitism] is part of the conservative movement and that [white supremacists] are my problem,” James Carafano, a leader of Heritage’s Task Force on Antisemitism, <a href=\"https://jewishinsider.com/2024/10/heritage-foundation-project-esther-combat-antisemitism/\">told Jewish Insider</a>, “because white supremacists are not my problem, because white supremacists are not part of being conservative.”</p>\n<p>Now, many of Project Esther’s Jewish supporters are singing a different tune. Rabbi Yaakov Menken, head of the far-right Coalition for Jewish Values, a Project Esther partner, <a href=\"https://x.com/ymenken/status/1983991089322192911?s=46\">lamented</a> on X that “Heritage has chosen to vocally stand with an antisemite … the consequences will be far-reaching indeed.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://politicalresearch.org/2024/04/24/101-christian-zionism\">Christian Zionists</a>, too, are sounding the alarm. “It’s disappointing to see, though unfortunately not surprising,” Luke Moon, head of the Christian Zionist group Philos Project and a co-chair of the Heritage Antisemitism Task Force, acknowledged in an email to supporters. Leaders like Moon are deeply concerned that their days of influence are numbered, as since the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_7_attacks\">October 7 attacks in 2023</a>, criticism of U.S. support for Israel has deepened across the MAGA movement.</p>\n<p>For decades, the Israeli, American Jewish and Christian Right forged what seemed like an ironclad alliance. In service of defending Israel and fighting antisemitism, they tirelessly championed the supposed shared “Judeo-Christian” values of “Western civilization” undergirding the U.S.-Israel “special relationship.”</p>\n<p>Project Esther is a latecomer in a crowded, bipartisan pro-Israel anti-antisemitism landscape, dotted by American Jewish groups like the Anti-Defamation League, Christian partners like Christians United for Israel, and gloves-off groups like StopAntisemitism, Canary Mission and Betar. These groups have relied on overzealous, weaponized <a href=\"https://politicalresearch.org/2024/09/05/new-antisemitism-and-neo-mccarthyism\">conflations</a> of legitimate criticism of Israel with antisemitism, shredding free speech rights and shielding unjust Israeli policies from accountability in the process.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>If conservatives truly wanted to fight this battle, they would turn first to their own camp. Antisemitism can show up on the left, to be sure, but it finds its most natural home in the ranks of the right, where it fits comfortably alongside anti-black racism, xenophobia, anti-LGBTQ+ phobia and all other types of bigotry.</p>\n<p>Data <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/resources/report/murder-and-extremism-united-states-2024\">shows</a> that radical right actors committed the majority of extremist-related murders in the last decade, while “the epicenter of antisemitic attitudes is young adults on the far right,” as a 2022 <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/10659129221111081\">study</a> put it. White nationalists like Fuentes <a href=\"https://politicalresearch.org/2019/10/22/taking-aim-multiracial-democracy\">imagine</a> a Jewish conspiracy at the heart of progressivism, U.S. support for Israel, and everything else they detest. These fever dreams have been dutifully repeated by ultranationalist movements for over a century, and are a core part of the authoritarian toolkit today.</p>\n<p>Jewish Rightists may be surprised, but the rest of us aren’t. Progressive analysts have long <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/741043/safety-through-solidarity-by-shane-burley/\">understood</a> that the strategy of allying with Christian nationalists would backfire. Meanwhile, the relentless push to equate Jewish identity with defense of the indefensible actions of the Israeli state ends up feeding the very flames of antisemitism it seeks to combat. Now, the cynical underbelly of the Right’s posturing, and the Jewish establishment’s short-sighted enabling of their authoritarian agenda, is clear to all.</p>\n\n<p>Israel’s right-wing defenders are flailing, on the backfoot and apoplectic. Long accustomed to looking only left for the next threat, their necks have painfully swiveled. Conservative Catholic columnist Rod Dreher recently <a href=\"https://roddreher.substack.com/p/nick-tucker-a-two-man-unite-the-right?publication_id=136360&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;r=edy16&amp;utm_medium=email\">reported</a> that all of his right-wing Jewish friends now view Tucker Carlson as the most dangerous antisemite in America.</p>\n<p>This isn’t a fluke; it’s here to stay. At a Turning Point USA event in Mississippi on Wednesday, Vice President JD Vance was <a href=\"https://x.com/infolibnews/status/1983699386770321749\">grilled</a> by college students <a href=\"https://x.com/MarioNawfal/status/1983701913297473933\">insisting</a> that Israel was “controlling” Trump and Judaism was “prosecuting” Christianity. These future leaders of the right aren’t going anywhere; they’ll be taking the reins soon, and there’s little room for the “Judeo” in their vision of the Christian West.</p>\n<p>In hindsight, the obsessive focus on uncovering and rooting out a supposed crisis of antisemitism on the left will prove to have been a drastic and myopic miscalculation. Jewish Rightists, in fact, were bedfellows with a far more substantive threat, putting not only Jews but democracy itself in greater danger in the process. With their dreams increasingly discredited, we must work to awaken from the nightmare they have helped create.</p>\n\n<p>Ben Lorber is a senior researcher at Political Research Associates, a research and strategy center that helps pro-democracy campaigners understand and counter authoritarian movements.

However, those expecting food assistance on Nov. 1 may still see delays.</p>\n<p>The legal rulings came after a month of back-and-forth since the shutdown began on Oct. 1. At first, the United States Department of Agriculture’s shutdown plan said the agency would use emergency funds to keep food aid going through the shutdown. Later, the Trump administration said that would not be the case. </p>\n\n<p>“Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 1,” said the USDA, which runs the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>On Friday, a federal judge in Rhode Island ruled a $5 billion contingency fund must be used to keep SNAP running. The tricky thing is that SNAP benefits cost about $8 billion monthly. </p>\n<p>Democratic state attorneys general and governors who challenged the SNAP pause argued a separate fund with $23 billion should also be used to keep food assistance going out to the 1 in 8 Americans who qualify for it. But the courts gave the Trump administration flexibility on whether to fund the program partially or in full for November. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Both judges gave the administration until Monday to provide an update on how they plan to move forward. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Will SNAP benefits be delayed in November?</h2>\n<p>Despite the courts’ rulings to fund SNAP (at least partially) through November, the immediate future was still unclear. </p>\n<p>First off, the judges’ decisions could be appealed, posing a potential delay.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. District Judge John McConnell ordered the USDA to distribute funds “timely or as soon as possible,” but it wasn’t clear how quickly EBT cards could be reloaded even if the money started flowing. That process can take one to two weeks, the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/snap-shutdown-lawsuits-deadline-4af8b0dec6cd31cddd023cc99c131b73\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Associated Press reports</a>. </p>\n<p>Households that qualify for SNAP typically see their benefits reload automatically on an Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card, but each state has its own way of doing things. Many states <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/monthly-issuance-schedule\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reload benefits on a rolling basis</a>, using recipients’ last names, case numbers or social security numbers to dole out benefits in batches.</p>\n<p>In Arizona, for example, people whose last names start with A or B expect benefits to become available on the first of the month. Last names starting with Y or Z don’t expect new benefits until the 13th. Other states, like Connecticut, have a schedule that pays everyone in the first three days of the month. (See the schedule for your state’s benefits issuance <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/monthly-issuance-schedule\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.)</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>In practice, that means many families are expecting EBT cards to be reloaded on Saturday, and even a 24-hour delay will force them to find other ways to get food. But others have weeks until they expect to get paid, and may have enough money left on their cards to tide them over. </p>\n<p>To make things even more complicated, it’s not even clear that states would stick to their normal schedules if or when funding becomes available. Doing so could risk running out of money before everyone gets their allotment. </p>\n<p>The situation is particularly chaotic if the federal government decides to only use the smaller $5 billion contingency fund to operate SNAP, which wouldn’t be enough to pay everyone out through the end of November. </p>\n\n<p>“Such a partial payment has never been made — and for good reason,” the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5583581-court-ruling-snap-emergency-funds/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Trump administration argued in court filings</a>. “It would require each state to recalculate the benefits owed based on the reduced funds available. USDA estimates that such a calculation, involving complicated system changes and processes dictated by statute and regulation, would take weeks, if it can be done at all.”</p>\n<p>As of Friday afternoon, the USDA’s website had not been updated with next steps following the two rulings. </p>\n</div>",

He posted his message alongside a clip from the reality TV show “The Kardashians” that showed Kardashian discussing the moon landing.</p>\n\n<p>Duffy added that NASA’s <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/artemis/\">Artemis campaign</a> would <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/5535786-artemis-ii-moon-mission-2026/\">take Americans back</a> to the moon under President Trump’s administration.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“We won the last space race and we will win this one too,” he wrote, adding American flag and space ship emojis. </p>\n<p>The clip posted by Duffy comes from the Wednesday episode of the Kardashian family’s weekly TV show — a follow-up to their long-running series “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” which ended in 2021. In the clip, Kardashian repeats the conspiracy theory that the moon landing never happened while speaking with actress Sarah Paulson.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“I think it didn’t happen,” Kardashian told Paulson, referencing an apparent interview with astronaut Buzz Aldrin and “the other one” — likely referring to astronaut Neil Armstrong — where the first two men who walked on the moon said there “was no scary moment” during their trip to outer space. Kardashian pointed to the interview as evidence that the<strong>ir</strong> moon landing was fake.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to go on a massive deep dive,” Paulson promised her. </p>\n<p>Kardashian elaborated on why she believed the moon landing was “fake” later in the episode. </p>\n\n<p>“I’ve seen a few videos on Buzz Aldrin talking about how it didn’t happen,” she said. “He says it all the time now in interviews. Maybe we should find Buzz Aldrin.”</p>\n<p>Claims that Aldrin called the moon landing fake have been <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/fact-check/buzz-aldrin-interview-about-moon-landing-is-not-proof-that-it-was-faked-idUSL1N2US2G3/\">debunked</a> in the past.</p>\n<p>“There’s no gravity on the Moon,” she added. “Why is the <a href=\"https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/space-astronomy/moon-landing-conspiracy-theories-debunked\">flag blowing</a>?

Gavin Newsom (D) on Friday called President Trump’s move to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5580424-trump-directs-pentagon-to-start-testing-nuclear-weapons/\">restart nuclear weapons testing</a> “acts of a weak person” and embarrassing.</p>\n<p>Speaking with <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/newsom-trump-s-nuclear-weapons-testing-order-is-weakness-masquerading-in-strength-251039301664\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NBC News’s Kristin Welker,</a> Newsom said “it’s performative” on Trump’s part to restart the weapons testing, behavior that Newsom compared with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. He also pointed out that the Department of Energy (DOE) handles nuclear weapons testing, contradicting the president’s directive that the Pentagon should oversee it.</p>\n\n<p>“This is weakness masquerading in strength,” Newsom said. “This is classic Trump and Trumpism. This guy is historically weak, and these are acts of a weak person that is trying to appear strong.”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Private conversations between the two about nuclear weapons “calmed” Newsom, he said. But the governor added that Trump, by restarting testing and praising <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5580982-trump-xi-meeting-agreements/\">his recent trade negotiations</a> with China’s President Xi Jinping, was “trying to overcompensate to be a tough guy.”</p>\n<p>“Then again, trust but verify that he doesn’t begin to make some errant mistakes and we walk down a path of no return,” Newsom said. “It scares the hell out of me to start talking about these kind of things. But hopefully cooler heads will prevail, because again, he doesn’t even know what he said and what he was talking about on what the basis of his own administration has said he said and talking about.”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>On Friday, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5583290-nuclear-weapons-pentagon-testing-trump/\">that the Defense Department (DOD) would work with the DOE on the renewed testing.</a> Trump announced the decision on Wednesday. </p>\n<p>“The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” Trump wrote on his social platform Truth Social. “This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice! Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.”  </p>\n<p>Russia had recently claimed it had a successful new nuclear capable cruise missile, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5575554-burevestnik-missile-trump-condemns/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">known as the Burevestnik</a>, tested last week. Trump condemned it, and it drew <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5575554-burevestnik-missile-trump-condemns/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">international concern</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The United States <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5581750-us-russia-nuclear-competition-trump/\">stopped nuclear weapons testing in 1992</a> following the downfall of the Soviet Union, according to The Associated Press. Four years later, the U.S. signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.</p>\n<p>Newsom joined House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) in condemning Trump’s directive. Jeffries called the move <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5581938-jeffries-trump-nuclear-tests/\">“a massive breach of international treaties” and said Trump was “divorced from reality.”</a></p>\n<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) supported the decision,<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5581689-johnson-backs-trump-nuclear-testing/\"> referring to it as a “deterrent.”</a></p>\n<p>“The commander in chief wants us to be fully prepared,” Johnson told reporters Thursday morning. “We are the last great superpower on the earth. China intends to be a near peer-to-peer advisory to us. But in order to maintain peace around the world, you have to show strength, and that’s what the president believes in. That’s what he’s demonstrated over and over.”</p>\n</div>",

Under the account — which was deleted before his campaign’s launch — he <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5561274-platner-social-media-controversy/\">made</a> several yearsold comments that were dismissive of sexual assault.

The expiration would impact millions of people in Republican-represented states. </p>\n<p>Though the judge’s ruling takes the pressure off for now, it does not require USDA to maintain the benefit once the emergency fund is depleted. </p>\n\n<p>The administration’s refusal to spend the fund came under two lawsuits, one filed by <a data-id=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.290958/gov.uscourts.mad.290958.1.0.pdf\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.290958/gov.uscourts.mad.290958.1.0.pdf\">25 Democratic-led states</a> and the other brought by a coalition of cities and private organizations. </p>\n<p>McConnell, an appointee of former President Obama who serves in Rhode Island, is overseeing the second lawsuit. </p>\n<p>He handed down his ruling from the bench moments after U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani, an Obama appointee who serves in Boston and oversees the states’ case, issued a <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.290958/gov.uscourts.mad.290958.26.0_5.pdf\">written order</a> suggesting she’ll issue a similar block. </p>\n<p>Talwani gave the government until Monday to explain how it will use the contingency funds. </p>\n<p><em>DEVELOPING</em></p>\n\n</div>",
