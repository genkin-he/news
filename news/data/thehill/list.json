            "description": "<p>Brady Tkachuk said Thursday that a <a data-id=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@whitehouse/video/7609740037386702093\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@whitehouse/video/7609740037386702093\">video posted</a> on the White House’s official TikTok page appearing to show the American hockey player speaking ill of Canadians after the <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/ap-its-on-us-and-canada-face-off-for-olympic-gold-in-mens-hockey-as-winter-games-come-to-a-close/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/ap-its-on-us-and-canada-face-off-for-olympic-gold-in-mens-hockey-as-winter-games-come-to-a-close/\">U.S. won gold</a> during the Winter Olympics was “clearly fake.”</p>\n<p>The video, which provides a disclaimer that it contains “AI-generated media,” used dubbed audio over a real video of Tkachuk, depicting him saying, “They booed our national anthem, so I had to come out and teach those maple syrup eating f—s a lesson.” </p>\n<p>“Canada, we own you little bro,” the dubbed audio continued.</p>\n<p>The Ottawa Senators captain helped the U.S. to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5750666-kash-patel-team-usa-backlash/\">win gold over Canada</a> for the first time since 1980 on Sunday in Milan, Italy.</p>\n<p>The TikTok video, which contains the caption “Silver does NOT shine just as bright,” had more than 11 million views as of Friday morning.</p>\n<p>“Well, it’s clearly fake,” Tkachuk said Thursday. “Because it’s not my voice, not my lips moving. … I’m not in control of any of those accounts, and I know that those words would never come out of my mouth. So, I can’t do anything about it.”</p>\n<p>“I would never say that,” he added. “That’s not who I am. … I don’t like that video because that’s just never come out of my mouth.”</p>\n<p>The White House did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>\n<p>President Trump called the men’s hockey team to congratulate and invite them to the White House after <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5750306-trump-posts-about-olympics-on-closing-day-of-games/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5750306-trump-posts-about-olympics-on-closing-day-of-games/\">their victory</a>. During the call, some believed they could hear Tkachuk in the background yelling “Close the northern border,” but he denied those claims on Thursday. </p>\n<p>“I’ve been seeing stuff that people think it’s me. But if you watch the video, it’s not my voice or something that I never say,” Tkachuk said. “I don’t know how that took a storm on its own when I give everything I have here. It’s crazy when things go on social media, how fast they go. I would never say anything like that.”</p>\n<p>Trump made a joke on the phone with the men’s team about having to invite the women’s hockey team, who also won gold at the Olympics, to the White House as well or else he would be “impeached.” </p>\n<p>“We’re going to have to bring the women’s team, you do know that,” Trump said on speaker phone with the men’s team. The joke drew some laughs from players which at least one said they later regretted.</p>\n<p>The comment <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5756125-us-womens-hockey-captain-hilary-knight-trump-state-of-the-union-joke/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5756125-us-womens-hockey-captain-hilary-knight-trump-state-of-the-union-joke/\">drew criticism</a> with Hilary Knight, the captain of the U.S. women’s hockey team, who called it “distasteful.” The women’s team <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5752109-us-womens-gold-medal-trump-state-of-union-invite/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5752109-us-womens-gold-medal-trump-state-of-union-invite/\">did not visit the White House</a> due to professional and academic commitments. </p>\n<p>Tkachuk said on Thursday he understood how the women’s players might have negatively viewed the moment on the phone. </p>\n<p>“I mean, I get it,” the captain said on Thursday. “We supported them, they supported us. You can’t control what other people say.”</p>\n<p>Some of the U.S. men’s hockey team also <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5752444-state-of-the-union-us-mens-olympic-hockey-team-milan/\">attended</a> Trump’s <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754101-trump-state-union-address-takeaways/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754101-trump-state-union-address-takeaways/\">State of the Union address</a> on Tuesday.

            "description": "<p>Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) is demanding reimbursements for his state’s consumers and businesses after the Supreme Court <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5687657-scotus-rejects-trump-emergency-tariffs/\">shot down</a> a majority of the Trump administration’s tariffs last week. </p>\n<p>In a joint <a href=\"https://governor.maryland.gov/news/press/Documents/2.27.26%20Maryland%20Tariff%20Reimbursement%20Request%20Signed%20Final.pdf\">letter</a> to President Trump on Friday, Moore and other state officials said “the financial toll on our state has been significant” due to these tariffs. </p>\n<p>“Maryland is committed to building an economy that works for everyone — one that is competitive, resilient, and fair,” they wrote. “That work depends on a partnership between state and federal governments grounded in respect for the rule of law and a shared commitment to fiscal responsibility. </p>\n<p>“If the federal government collected funds under an unconstitutional policy, it has a legal and moral obligation to return those funds to the people from whom they were taken,” the letter continued.</p>\n<p>Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman and State Treasurer Dereck Davis co-signed the letter. </p>\n<p>The state officials cited <a href=\"https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/7cc03e65-d40a-465f-9e88-09dd53d3502f/jec-fact-sheet-on-cost-of-tariffs-for-families-update.pdf\">findings</a> from the U.S. Joint Economic Committee, which pinned the average American household’s tariff costs at $1,744. Based on this calculation, they estimated that these policies cost Maryland consumers and businesses around $4 billion. </p>\n<p>“I have long said that while tariffs are a tool of international trade, the Trump-Vance Administration has waged war on our families and raised taxes on us all,” Moore said in a Friday press release. </p>\n<p>“This isn’t just about bad policy; this is about the Supreme Court making it clear that these unilateral actions are illegal,” the governor continued. “This $4 billion represents real money taken away from Maryland families—now the Trump Administration needs to do what’s right and pay Marylanders back.” </p>\n<p>The Supreme Court last week ruled it was unlawful for the administration to impose tariffs using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). But it did not lay out guidance in its decision for how lower courts should navigate refund requests. In anticipation of this ruling, several large companies like Costco and Revlon <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5687657-scotus-rejects-trump-emergency-tariffs/\">filed lawsuits</a> seeking financial returns on these tariffs. </p>\n<p>The Kiel Institute for the World Economy found in a January <a href=\"https://www.kielinstitut.de/publications/news/americas-own-goal-americans-pay-almost-entirely-for-trumps-tariffs/\">report</a> that American consumers and importers have borne 96 percent of these costs. </p>\n<p>These findings run counter to the Trump administration’s promises that foreign countries would shoulder the majority of these tariff costs. A recent Washington Post/ABC News/Ipsos poll <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2026/02/22/trump-disapproval-post-poll/\">found</a> that 64 percent of respondents said they did not approve of Trump’s tariffs.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has continued to push these economic policies even after the Supreme Court’s ruling, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5748682-trump-imposes-global-tariff/\">enacting</a> 10 percent global tariffs under a Trade Act provision. Trump later<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5749113-donald-trump-15-percent-global-tariffs-supreme-court/\"> indicated</a> these tariffs would be raised to 15 percent, but it’s not clear if that will happen.</p>",

            "title": "Cargo thieves tried to destroy my company — Congress must stop them",
            "description": "<p>I still remember the phone call like it was yesterday.                        </p>\n<p>It was early on a Tuesday morning when I first learned that someone — or more accurately, a group of someones — had stolen not just freight, but my company’s identity. </p>\n<p>For years I had poured every ounce of energy into growing Tanager Logistics and Double Diamond Transport from a one-truck startup into a thriving business. And suddenly, criminals had mimicked our email domains, copied our branding and convinced legitimate carriers to haul freight under our name, while their only aim was to steal. This was freight fraud disguised as legitimate business, and it is far more common than you think.</p>\n<p>In one instance, a trailer full of energy drinks worth well over $100,000 was diverted more than 1,000 miles from its intended route because fraudsters spoofed our communications. These thieves are brazen enough to <a href=\"https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/1E0980F7-A8CD-4B4D-BCBF-4EE3D68B8541\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">strike carriers like myself</a>, and also bold enough to target celebrities like <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-thieves-stole-24000-bottles-of-guy-fieris-tequila-highway-heist-60-minutes-transcript-2025-12-28/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Guy Fieri and Sammy Hagar</a>.</p>\n<p>And the examples outside my company are countless. On Christmas Eve, thieves made off with an entire truckload of <a href=\"https://thehill.com/business/5663922-400k-lobster-theft-costco/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Costco lobsters valued at $400,000</a> from a cold storage facility in Taunton, Massachusetts. This theft was not some smash-and-grab with hooded figures and crowbars. Instead, it was a highly organized scam. The perpetrators impersonated a legitimate trucking company using spoofed emails and fake credentials, picked up the seafood, disabled GPS trackers and vanished into the night.</p>\n<p>That haul of premium seafood likely didn’t make it to anyone’s dinner table. Perishable goods like lobster must be handled and refrigerated to strict standards. Once stolen and unmonitored, they become unsafe for consumption and are often destroyed, while the criminals sell what they can on the black market or walk away with an insurance payout. </p>\n<p>The economic ripple effects hit every link in the supply chain, from carriers like me to small and large retailers and, ultimately, everyday consumers. And it costs the trucking industry <a href=\"https://truckingresearch.org/2025/10/new-atri-research-confirms-the-high-costs-of-cargo-theft-to-industry/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">more than $18 million</a> each day.  </p>\n<p>Cargo theft is no longer just about broken locks or stolen keys. Organized criminal networks impersonate legitimate brokers and carriers, spoof email domains and steal real Department of Transportation numbers to look authentic. Everything appears routine until the freight vanishes. Even as the industry works to defend itself, most victims, including my own company, are small businesses with limited resources facing well-financed, organized criminal networks.</p>\n<p>Once stolen, cargo often disappears into complex resale channels. Some is shipped overseas, some is broken down and sold locally, and much of it simply goes to waste, especially in the case of perishable food.</p>\n<p>The impact on legitimate shippers and carriers is devastating. Insurance premiums skyrocket, reputations are tarnished and many small businesses are pushed to the brink. And because there is no coordinated law enforcement response to investigating cargo theft, these crimes often go unreported, under-investigated or unsolved.</p>\n<p>That’s why Congress must act now to pass the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/2853/text\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Combating Organized Retail Crime Act</a>. This bipartisan bill would establish a centralized operational hub to empower federal, state and local law enforcement to coordinate investigations, share threat intelligence with industry partners and pursue organized crime rings that treat our supply chain like a playground.</p>\n<p>The act would also strengthen legal tools so that theft rings cannot hide behind jurisdictional loopholes, mandate better data tracking and reporting and help reduce the economic and security risks that come with unchecked cargo theft.</p>\n<p>I’ve seen firsthand what happens when freight criminals operate with impunity, and I’ve watched as the system leaves hard-working truckers, carriers and supply chain businesses with few tools to protect themselves or avenues for justice. We cannot allow criminals to treat legitimate commerce as a free resource.  </p>\n<p>Passing the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act isn’t just about protecting freight. It’s about protecting the integrity of America’s supply chain. </p>\n<p><em>Adam Blanchard is principal and CEO of San Antonio-based Tanager Logistics and Double Diamond Transport.

            "description": "<p>On Tuesday, Casey Means had a long-delayed Senate hearing on her nomination to become surgeon general. </p>\n<p>This may be President Trump’s weirdest nomination so far — keep in mind that this is the administration that wanted <a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-president-elect-donald-j-trump-announcing-the-nomination-congressman-matt-gaetz\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to make</a> Matt Gaetz the attorney general of the United States. </p>\n<p>Means, an <a href=\"https://www.caseymeans.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">influencer</a>, got this nomination because her social media accounts and best-selling book helped launch the MAHA movement. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. thinks that makes her the <a href=\"https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1920531616499208409\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">perfect pick</a> for surgeon general, America’s top doctor.</p>\n<p>Except she’s not a doctor — not a practicing one, anyway. She did graduate from Stanford medical school, but she <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/the-nuances-of-casey-means-medical-exit?srsltid=AfmBOooyW99p9-mPfi35INx9txTf_TqwdS5R6cRAK8grJbIdCmySM4BZ\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dropped out</a> of her residency before completing it. Her license is listed as “<a href=\"https://omb.oregon.gov/Clients/ORMB/Public/VerificationDetails.aspx?EntityID=1530903\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">inactive</a>” by the state of Oregon and, by her <a href=\"https://youtu.be/k8vol0gKKyQ?t=5368\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">own admission</a>, she is not able to write prescriptions or practice medicine.</p>\n<p>Right off the bat, this appears to disqualify her from the job. But nothing like this has ever come up before, since no president has ever considered nominating a social media influencer as surgeon general.</p>\n<p>Part of the job description of being surgeon general is being the <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/about/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">vice admiral</a> of the Commission Corps, “an elite group of multidisciplinary officers working throughout the federal government whose mission is to protect, promote, and advance the health of our nation.” But there are requirements for being an officer in the Corps, and <a href=\"https://dcp.psc.gov/ccmis/ccis/documents/CC251.01.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">one of them</a> is that “Each Corps officer must possess and maintain current, unrestricted licensure.”</p>\n<p>In other words, Casey Means is legally ineligible to join the organization that she would be leading.</p>\n<p>Means has also expressed positions consistent with being an anti-vaxxer. She has <a href=\"https://x.com/CaseyMeansMD/status/1820614949334589582\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">come out</a> particularly strong against the Hepatitis B vaccine, claiming that, “The disease is transmitted through needles and sex exclusively. There is no benefit to the baby or the wider population for a child to get this vaccine who is not at risk for sexual or IV transmission. There is only risk.” </p>\n<p>It turns out, that’s <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4246-hepatitis-b\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">not remotely true</a>. Hepatitis B can be spread that way, but it can also be spread through other bodily fluids, including saliva. In the United States, about 640,000 people have “chronic” Hepatitis B, which means they have Hepatitis B for their entire lives. Not only will a Hepatitis B vaccine keep you from catching it as a child, it will also protect you later in life if you do run across someone with chronic Hepatitis B — who often do not know they are infected.<br/> <br/>When pressed by Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), the committee chair, on whether she would recommend the measles vaccine to parents, Means <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/surgeon-general-nominee-faces-scrutiny-over-qualifications-and-views-on-vaccines\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said this:</a> “I’m not an individual’s doctor and every individual needs to talk to their doctor before putting a medication in their body.” Being unable to commit to the most basic public health advice when you’re the surgeon general is a real problem, since giving that kind of advice is your single biggest job. </p>\n<p>In Mean’s case, it’s also jaw-droppingly hypocritical. As a social media influencer, she has regularly made enthusiastic recommendations, telling her fans to take various supplements and claiming that they would, among other things, help cure infertility. Look at <a href=\"https://www.caseymeans.com/learn/3-things-fertility\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this pitch</a> for WeNatal, for example.</p>\n<p>But when it comes to vaccines, even measles and flu vaccines, she does nothing but hedge. It took Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) <a href=\"https://youtu.be/k8vol0gKKyQ?t=6910\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">three minutes</a> just to get her to admit that there is some clinical evidence that flu vaccines are effective.  </p>\n<p>But let’s get back to her inactive medical license. Means <a href=\"https://youtu.be/k8vol0gKKyQ?t=5368\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claims</a> it would be easy to reinstate if she wanted to, but that might not be as easy as she implies.</p>\n<p>In her best-selling book, “Good Energy,” Means talks about her <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2026/02/25/shopping/why-casey-means-book-good-energy-is-sparking-controversy/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">experimentation with psilocybin</a> — “magic mushrooms” — and even recommends that her readers try them. When asked whether, as surgeon general, she would encourage people to use illegal drugs, as she did in her book, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/k8vol0gKKyQ?t=4960\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">she responded</a>, “What I would say as a private citizen is, in many cases, different than what I would say as a public health official.” Some much for honesty, integrity and authenticity, I guess.</p>\n<p>Psilocybin is currently listed as a <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/812\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Schedule 1 narcotic;</a> using or possessing it is a violation of federal law. In Oregon, there is <a href=\"https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_677.190\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a list</a> of 27 things that are grounds for suspending or revoking a medical license. One of those things is “Violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act.” </p>\n<p>As a social media influencer, Casey Means is both interesting and hugely successful. But as a political appointee, she is a hot mess with no business becoming America’s chief public health spokesperson.</p>\n<p>Still don’t believe me? Here’s <a href=\"https://www.caseymeans.com/learn/3-things-fertility\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a quote</a> from her blog: “I believe that freeing my physical and energetic body from the societal, intergenerational, and personal shackles of wounds and expectation and living into my divine, eternally connected, and limitless potential creates a biological reality in my body that is more conducive to creating new life.” Put that on a package of cigarettes.</p>\n<p>Casey Means should not be confirmed as surgeon general. She is unsuited, unqualified and unlicensed.

            "title": "How Trump's trade policy spiraled out of control",
            "description": "<p>In the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling overturning President Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/20/trump-tariffs-supreme-court-ruling-industry-higher-rates.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reciprocal tariffs</a>, many scholars are weighing its significance. The most common interpretation is that the decision was about the <a href=\"https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2026/supreme-courts-welcome-ruling-trumps-tariffs\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">separation of powers</a>, in which Article 1 of the Constitution grants taxing and tariff powers to Congress.</p>\n<p>What should not be lost amid this, however, is how Trump’s trade policy has fallen short of achieving its goals. Thus, even though U.S. imports from China declined significantly last year, the overall <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-trade-deficit-tariffs-china-9eb6bd10ff635d63e46ee99d34ce1d05\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. trade deficit finished 2025 at a record high</a>. American manufacturers also cut an estimated <a href=\"https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/democrats/2026/2/new-data-during-trump-s-first-year-the-manufacturing-industry-lost-108-000-jobs\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">108,000 jobs</a> during Trump’s first year according to a Joint Economic Committee Minority report.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, public opinion polls show that Trump’s <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/699221/trump-approval-rating-drops-new-second-term-low.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">approval ratings have plummeted</a> in part due to concerns households have about many products becoming unaffordable. </p>\n<p>This has not stopped Trump from <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-doubles-down-after-us-supreme-court-strikes-down-global-tariffs/ar-AA1WKgR1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">doubling down</a>, however. He indicated that he would <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2026/02/23/trump-claims-he-doesnt-need-congress-for-tariffs-why-thats-true-yet-misleading/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">impose new tariffs</a> without going through Congress, although the statutes do not grant him as much flexibility as before. </p>\n<p>So, why is Trump doing this? </p>\n<p>Dartmouth Professor Douglas Irwin, an expert on U.S trade policy, contends that the tariffs Trump announced in his second term are “<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/trumps-tariffs-are-unique-in-history-douglas-irwin-trade-policy-protectionism-494d8cff\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unique</a>.” Irwin’s premise is that we are now entering a new era, where Trump is seeking retribution for America’s trading partners taking advantage of the U.S.   </p>\n<p>Trump’s views on trade date back to the 1980s when <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/making-sense/do-trade-restrictions-work-lessons-from-trade-with-japan-in-the-1980s\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Japan amassed large trade surpluses</a>. President Ronald Reagan applied diplomatic pressure to reduce the imbalances, including implementing tariffs and quotas on exports of cars, steel and semiconductors. However, the U.S. trade deficit persisted, and Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/4453481/trump-reagan-folded-japan-switzerland-tariffs/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">criticized Reagan</a> for not being tough enough on Japan. </p>\n<p>When Trump became president in 2017, China had supplanted Japan as having the largest trade surplus, and Trump was determined to take strong action against it. After implementing tariffs on products such as steel, aluminum and solar panels, he followed up with a series of <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/trump-furious-after-supreme-court-upends-his-global-tariffs-vows-new-10-levy/ar-AA1WLCV6\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tariff hikes on Chinese goods</a> that tallied $370 billion. </p>\n<p>Trump eventually reached a truce with China in mid-2019 whereby it would purchase $200 billion additional goods from the U.S. However, China did not adhere to it. Consequently, Trump said he would raise tariffs on China to <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/blog/trump-china-trade-war-proposal/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">60 percent</a> while also applying 10 percent tariffs to other trading partners of the U.S. during the 2024 election campaign. </p>\n<p>One reason for broadening the number of countries was that China skirted U.S. tariffs by establishing manufacturing hubs in Mexico and Vietnam and routed exports through Asian countries. Therefore, Trump wanted to build a shield, so that China could no longer circumvent U.S. tariffs. He also sought to boost tariffs sufficiently high that foreign producers would relocate production to the U.S. </p>\n<p>In his April 2 “<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-trump-announces-broad-tariffs-at-liberation-day-white-house-event\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Liberation Day</a>” remarks, Trump announced the biggest and most widespread tariff hikes since the 1930s. It culminated in a steep selloff of U.S. financial markets and the dollar after the U.S. and China engaged in a tit-for-tat escalation of tariffs. This forced Trump to postpone implementing the tariffs for 90 days and to reach another truce with China. </p>\n<p>Trump was ultimately able to reach agreements with Japan and the European Union in August that provided some clarity on what he was seeking. Japan’s reciprocal tariff rate was lowered to 15 percent from 25 percent, and the EU also agreed to a 15 percent rate, down from 30 percent. These agreements included pledges that Japan and the EU would make <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2025/08/trump-on-eu-and-japan-investments-in-the-u-s/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sizable investments in the U.S</a>. </p>\n<p>Amid this, many investors assumed the main areas of contention were now resolved, and the stock market went on to set record highs. However, this assessment proved premature when Trump began to threaten additional tariffs on countries that displeased him for various reasons, many of which had nothing to do with trade. </p>\n<p>The most egregious was his <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/breaking-trumps-argument-acquiring-greenland/story?id=129349786\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">threat to acquire Greenland</a> either through purchase or military ahead of the Davos Economic Summit in January. Previously, he announced that eight European countries would face <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-europe-greeland/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tariff increases of 10 percent</a> if they did not back him. When EU leaders took a firm stance to challenge Trump, he quickly rescinded the threat. </p>\n<p>There are several lessons to be gleaned from what has transpired in the past year.  First, Trump remains convinced that key trading partners of the U.S. — especially allies of the U.S. — are “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/18/economy/global-trade-relationships-trump-tariffs\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ripping off</a>” America. Second, he views trade as a zero-sum game, in which there are winners and losers based on whether a country runs a surplus or deficit. Third, he believes the way to win the game is with force and intimidation. </p>\n<p>In the process, Trump has ruptured the post-war order and the Western alliance that produced unparalleled peace and prosperity. In its place, there no longer is a rules-based system for trade, and individual countries must fend for themselves while the U.S. and China divvy up the spoils. Meanwhile, chaos and uncertainty reign. </p>\n<p><em>Nicholas Sargen, Ph.D., is an economic consultant and is affiliated with the Darden Business School.  The second edition of his book “<u>Global Shocks”</u> is forthcoming.</em> </p>",

Ford, the <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5737201-uss-gerald-r-ford-middle-east-us-iran/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5737201-uss-gerald-r-ford-middle-east-us-iran/\">world’s largest aircraft carrier</a>, is <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/uss-gerald-ford-aircraft-carrier-set-to-arrive-at-israeli-coast-today\">expected</a> to arrive in Haifa, Israel, on Friday as the Trump administration continues to ramp up the <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5702855-donald-trump-warns-iran-armada/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5702855-donald-trump-warns-iran-armada/\">U.S. military’s presence</a> in the region to <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5709342-iran-us-strike-tension-middle-east/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5709342-iran-us-strike-tension-middle-east/\">prepare for possible strikes</a> on Iran. </p>\n<p>Despite three rounds of indirect talks between Washington and Tehran, officials have <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-us-and-iran-to-hold-a-third-round-of-nuclear-talks-as-more-american-forces-deploy-to-the-mideast/\">failed</a> to reach an agreement on a new nuclear deal. The most recent conversation took place in Geneva on Thursday with Oman as the top negotiator. </p>\n<p>In a statement <a href=\"https://x.com/araghchi/status/2027156363097391139?s=20\">posted</a> to social platform X, Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi said the latest talks were the “most intense so far.”</p>\n<p>“It concluded with the mutual understanding that we will continue to engage in a more detailed manner on matters that are essential to any deal — including sanctions termination and nuclear-related steps,” Araghchi said. </p>\n<p>The Iranian official said technical teams will meet in Vienna in the “coming days.”</p>\n<p>Oman’s foreign minister, Badr al Busaidi, has been moderating the conversation and is set to meet with Vice President Vance in Washington on Friday. </p>\n<p>Busaidi reiterated the Iranian minister’s message of progress after the Thursday talks, saying officials achieved “significant progress.”</p>\n<p>“We will resume soon after consultation in the respective capitals,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/badralbusaidi/status/2027089708392579576?s=20\">posted</a> on X. “Discussions on a technical level will take place next week in Vienna. I am grateful to all concerned for their efforts: the negotiators, the IAEA, and our hosts the Swiss government.</p>\n<p>President Trump <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5747127-trump-iran-nuclear-deal-outcome-timeline/\">warned</a> last week that Iran will face “unfortunate” consequences if a deal is not struck in “10-15 days, pretty much maximum.”</p>\n<p>In an interview with The Washington Post on Thursday, Vance defended Trump’s moves in in the Middle East and <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5758310-vance-defends-iran-strikes/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5758310-vance-defends-iran-strikes/\">suggested another strike</a> — following an attack on three of <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5362470-us-iran-bombing-takeaways/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5362470-us-iran-bombing-takeaways/\">Tehran’s nuclear facilities</a> last year — would not lead to a long-term conflict.</p>\n<p>Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has remained defiant, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5742196-iran-warning-us-warships-nuclear-talks/\">threatening</a> earlier this month to sink U.S. warships. </p>\n<p>“The Americans constantly say that they’ve sent a warship toward Iran,” <a href=\"https://x.com/khamenei_ir/status/2023707826011378060?s=20\">Khamenei posted</a> on X at the time. “Of course, a warship is a dangerous piece of military hardware.”</p>\n<p>“However, more dangerous than that warship is the weapon that can send that warship to the bottom of the sea,” he added.</p>",
