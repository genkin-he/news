For most conservative leaders, divorce reform is a personal and political bridge too far.</p>\n<p>Some are clearly guided by self-interest. Divorce is <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2636456/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">big business</a> for family courts and family lawyers.</p>\n\n<p>Two decades ago, my husband and the father of my children had an affair and left.

But he moved to New Jersey, which had adopted no-fault, and we were eventually divorced. New York enacted no-fault divorce one year later.</p>\n<p>I began writing about my experiences in liberal outlets. Chris Gersten, former Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, saw my articles and reached out. This could be an <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-most-pioneering-divor_b_863024\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">opportunity</a> for liberals and conservatives to join forces in educating the public about marriage and advocating for <a href=\"https://divorcereform.us/parental-divorce-reduction-act/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">modest</a> reforms to help troubled parents in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2005/11/06/just-whom-is-this-divorce-good-for/32da3ae3-b15e-491f-a897-96b62a23fe57/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">low-conflict marriages</a>?

Until New York enacted no-fault divorce, the <a href=\"https://catholiccourier.com/articles/ny-bishops-oppose-no-fault-divorce-bill/#:~:text=By%20Jennifer%20Burke/Catholic%20Courier,custody%20issues%20have%20been%20resolved.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">New York Catholic dioceses</a> stood strong against this heinous law. But today, Catholic marriage and annulment <a href=\"https://www.ewtnreligiouscatalogue.com/betrayed-without-a-kiss/p/BKFAM03158\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">statistics</a> track the secular culture. Over 426,000 U.S. Catholic weddings occurred in 1969; today, weddings total less than 100,000 per year. In 1968, hardly 350 annulments were granted nationwide; by 1989, the tally had risen to 70,000.

I’m a big believer that there are things out there that we can’t explain. And so if another person sees an alien, maybe I see an angel or a demon. So, I’m a big believer that there are like spiritual forces working on the physical world that a lot of us don’t see and a lot of us don’t understand and a lot of us don’t appreciate.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“Is it aliens or is it our guardian angel, or is it aliens or is it a not so guardian force that doesn’t care about us or in fact actively wishes us harm?” Vance continued. “I don’t know the answer to that question. What I try to do is I try to say my prayers, I try to be as good of a person as I can be and I try to do a good job. And, hopefully, that’s all I need to do.”</p>\n<p>Vance also said that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was also interested in the topic, saying it is something they both talked about since their days working together in Senate.</p>\n<p>“There’s certainly an interest there, there’s certainly an intrigue,” Vance said. “But I really haven’t yet had time to dig in. Things have been so busy. But this is the crazy person inside me. All of us put the tinfoil hat on from time to time.”</p>\n\n<p>Miranda brought up the topic in reference <a href=\"https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/jd-vance-ufo-video-2024-investigation-trump/\">to an interview Vance had on the “Ruthless Podcast” on Aug. 1,</a> where he said he was “obsessed with the whole UFO thing.”</p>\n<p>“What’s actually going on? What were those videos all about? What’s actually happening?” Vance said at the time. “I haven’t gotten to the bottom of it yet, but we’re only six months in.”</p>\n<p>In September, Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) accused the federal government of lying about its knowledge of unexplained aerial phenomenon (UAP), commonly called UFOs. He made the accusation during a Task Force for the Declassification of Federal Secrets hearing, where he defended veterans who testified on seeing UAPs while in the military.</p>\n<p>“The narrative has changed, right?” Moskowitz said. “It’s politically convenient for the government if you all weren’t military folks in suits. It would be much better if you pulled up in Winnebagos and were wearing hats. This is now the second or third committee where we have former military folks with impeccable records with information and knowledge.”</p>\n<p>During Vance’s interview on “Pod Force One,” Rubio’s name also came up when the vice president referred to him as <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5578600-rubio-vance-trump-succession/\">his “best friend” in the administration</a>, spurred by the question of a Vance-Rubio 2028 ticket to succeed President Trump. Vance called any discussion about a future presidential run “premature.”</p>\n\n</div>",

Cheese Obama” and might deserve to “get primaried.”</p>\n<p>The nationwide “No Kings” <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5561313-live-updates-no-kings-trump-protests/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rallies earlier</a> this month showed that “the country is angry,” Charlamagne said while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35oH_2eU2vc\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">guest hosting</a> Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show” on Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p>“People are screaming for change. Democrats, let’s see you harness that energy,” the “Breakfast Club” co-host said, before cueing up a clip of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) using a pointer stick and dry erase board to describe a GOP megabill as a “big, ugly betrayal.”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“No, no, no, no. We want you to match our energy,” Charlamagne, who was born Lenard McKelvey, said, before playing remarks from Jeffries calling the GOP the party of “lawlessness and disorder.”</p>\n<p> “Come on. People are angry. So why is Hakeem Jeffries talking like he’s Chuck E. Cheese Obama?” Charlamagne said.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“Democratic leaders never support candidates who might disrupt the capitalist system. But guess what? The current system isn’t working,” the 47-year-old media personality said.</p>\n<p>“Americans want it remodeled the way Trump is remodeling the East Wing,” he added.</p>\n<p>“Dems act like they’ll get a cookie for being the most rational people in the room. No one cares. You’re trying to win voters, not get a signed headshot from [New York Times columnist] Ezra Klein.”</p>\n\n<p>“Democrats don’t understand how ready people are to act,” he continued, citing the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5565017-disney-hulu-subscriptions-fall-jimmy-kimmel-suspension/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">public’s response</a> to Disney’s brief suspension of Jimmy Kimmel after the ABC late-night comedian’s comments regarding the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. </p>\n<p>“If you can turn this energy into collective action, you can get s— done,” Charlamagne said to applause.</p>\n<p>“If the Democrats can’t lead, we the people will take action in our own way — whether it’s protests, corporate boycotts, sit ins, even a national worker’s strike,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Right now, America’s got all this ass, and I’m sorry to say, the Dems don’t know how to hit it right,” the “Get Honest or Die Lying” author said, specifically calling out Schumer and Jeffries. </p>\n<p>“Maybe it’s time they get primaried and give someone else a chance to hit this ass,” he said.</p>\n</div>",
