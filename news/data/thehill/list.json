An EXIM spokesperson confirmed to The Hill that he has withdrawn his nomination.</p>\n\n<p>McFerran drew scrutiny from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, after <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/10/29/trump-nominee-export-bank-russia/\">The Washington Post obtained federal financial disclosures</a> showing he spent much of the past decade as a senior executive at a Swiss subsidiary of Evraz PLC, a steel-trading business co-owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Warren <a href=\"https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/minority/following-warren-questions-on-his-work-tied-to-uk-sanctioned-russian-company-evraz-mcferran-withdraws-nomination-to-be-vp-at-export-import-bank\">noted that McFerran continued to work</a> at the subsidiary even after the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on Evraz. The U.S. later sanctioned several of its subsidiaries.</p>\n<p>The Post also reported that McFerran has extensive ties to the Kremlin through his wife’s family, members of which reportedly hold senior positions at a Russian-backed investment fund. McFerran’s father-in-law is reportedly an aide to one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s advisers and was previously a senator in Russia’s upper chamber of parliament, according to the Post.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>In her letter to McFerran on Wednesday, before his withdrawal had been publicly reported, Warren said she’s “especially concerned about your past work that appears to be deeply connected to a Russian metals and mining giant called Evraz.”</p>\n<p>“Your decision to work for an Evraz subsidiary in the wake of Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and after its launching a full-scale war raises significant questions about your judgment and your commitment to U.S. national security,” Warren wrote.</p>\n<p>“It also raises questions about the origin of funds you used to make a nearly $1 million donation to the Trump 47 Committee—a PAC created to fund President Trump’s and other Republican campaigns, including the Republican National Committee—in 2024,” she continued.</p>\n\n<p>White House spokesperson Kush Desai confirmed McFerran withdrew his nomination on Oct. 27, according to a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/29/congress/trump-exim-pick-withdrew-nomination-following-scrutiny-over-russia-ties-00629431\">statement reported</a> by multiple outlets.</p>\n<p>Desai reportedly defended McFerran, writing, “his prior business interests have been fully researched, vetted, and cleared by the nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics – a fact that should deter the Fake News from continuing to perpetuate the debunked Russia, Russia, Russia hoax.”</p>\n<p>McFerran, who was tapped as EXIM’s acting chief banking officer in March, will continue to serve in that capacity “until a permanent replacement is named in the coming weeks,” Desai added in the reported statement.</p>\n<p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n</div>",

The <a href=\"https://www.convenience.org/Media/Daily/2025/September/25/1-Retailers-Start-to-See-Penny-Shortages_GR\">National Association of Convenience Stores</a> warned last month that supply shortages were starting to emerge amongst its members, with more expected to be impacted. </p>\n<p>So far, at least two gas and convenience store chains, Love’s and Kwik Trip, have said they will round change on cash transactions <a href=\"https://fox8.com/news/how-the-growing-penny-shortage-may-impact-you/#:~:text=Love%E2%80%99s%20and%20Kwik%20Trip\">in favor of the customer</a>.

There may be no alternative to putting our military in harm’s way today, but there could be and must be one in the future, and we need to embrace and pursue it as soon as possible.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>So, what if we could protect both civilians and our military by sending something else in their place — humanoid drones?</p>\n<p>We know how that sounds, but let us explain. These humanoids would be powered by interoperable, agentic artificial intelligence. Maybe it’s the stuff of science fiction, but it’s no longer the purview of just screenwriters.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>We now have the technology to deploy such robots in war zones to protect populations, establish communications and stabilize what’s happening on the ground. These systems could serve as guardians defending humanitarian corridors and deterring violence without firing a shot.</p>\n<p>We are entering a new era in which artificial intelligence becomes a civic institution rather than merely a commercial or military tool. The question is whether we lead the world in building ethical, interoperable systems that protect people, or leave the future to regimes with nefarious intentions.</p>\n<p>Let’s be clear: Our adversaries are already using this technology — not to save lives but to take them. Russia <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/10/1166189\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">uses drone swarms</a> to attack Ukraine’s infrastructure. China <a href=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/china/2025/02/20/china-ai-neuro-quantum-surveillance-security-threat/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">integrates AI into its naval and surveillance systems</a> and shares it with governments, using it for population control.  </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, we and our allies hesitate. Our doctrines remain anchored to an era when deterrence meant soldiers and sanctions. </p>\n<p>The new challenge isn’t our ability to get our military to the next hot spot. It’s machine coordination. The balance of power around the world is about to be determined by our approach to AI governance.</p>\n<p>From Ukraine to Gaza, the international community faces the same challenge: civilians stranded between opposing forces, and humanitarian agencies unable to provide aid. Yet, technology already exists to change that. Autonomous systems could patrol ceasefire zones, protect evacuation routes, deliver aid and detect incoming threats, creating buffer zones where humans can safely operate.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>This isn’t fantasy. It’s a moral and strategic imperative. Western democracies must find ways to deter aggression without risking American lives.  </p>\n<p>The foundation for this future is what we call Omni Cities — democratic, interoperable infrastructures where civic AI integrates across transportation, energy, health and defense systems. It’s not about surveillance, but about saving lives and protecting the peacemaker. It doesn’t control; it coordinates. It is is the civic answer to authoritarian implementations of AI.   </p>\n<p>The U.S. needs to lead this effort and set standards for interoperability, data ethics, and autonomous deterrence. Under United Nations oversight, AI-enabled drones and humanoid guardians could be deployed to regions such as Gaza to secure humanitarian corridors and enforce ceasefires. </p>\n\n<p>They would act not as instruments of war, but as intermediaries for peace — enforcing accountability through presence, not violence.</p>\n<p>Such a framework would extend beyond conflict zones. Domestic applications could include rapid disaster response to floods, wildfires or hurricanes, where AI could coordinate public infrastructure and autonomous assets to save lives. </p>\n<p>If the nuclear age was about avoiding mutual assured destruction, the civic AI era must be about preserving life. </p>\n\n<p>Public perception is understandably based on what we’ve seen in movies like “The Terminator.” Skeptics warn machines lack human morality and autonomy risks AI becoming more powerful than our ability to control it. Those concerns are legitimate, but inaction carries its own risk. </p>\n<p>Failing to define the ethics of AI deployment leaves it to authoritarian regimes that already use this technology to repress. The challenge isn’t whether to use AI but ensuring that it serves us. </p>\n<p>The new “Space Race” isn’t a contest between capitalism and communism, but rather between authoritarian AI and civic AI. The nations leading in building interoperable, ethical systems will shape the moral frontier of technology.</p>\n\n<p>So far, President Trump has rejected calls to cooperate in that venture with international partners. But the time has come for the U.S. and its allies to build Omni Cities and deploy these guardians of peace, not to replace humans, but to protect them. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>The civic AI Era is emerging.

Although Affordable Care Act subsidies have been at the center of the debate, one of the most basic questions remains unanswered: Where is the money actually going? </p>\n<p>And we cannot answer that, because the U.S. still lacks real price transparency in health care.  </p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://waysandmeans.house.gov/2024/06/24/cbo-and-jct-confirm-the-debt-driving-cost-of-bidens-plan-to-permanently-expand-obamacare-subsidies-for-the-wealthy/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2024, the federal government spent roughly $125 billion on Affordable Care Act subsidies</a>. According to the Congressional Budget Office, federal spending on these subsidies will <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-07/60523-2024-07-premium-tax-credit.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">exceed $1 trillion over the next decade.</a> These numbers are far higher than initial cost estimates, and increases in premiums are at least part of the story. <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/state-indicator/marketplace-average-benchmark-premiums/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Benchmark plans’ premium rose between 70 and 90 percent in the last decade,</a> <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/43083\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">defying early budget expectations</a> that competition among health care exchanges would restrain increases. But neither the government nor businesses nor patients can benefit from competition if we don’t have markets. And we can’t have markets if we don’t have actual prices we can see in advance. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The Affordable Care Act was sold as a way to help families afford coverage, but it’s become a guaranteed revenue stream for insurers. <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-107194\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Most markets remain dominated by just a few insurers</a>. Subsidies were paid directly to insurance companies — not as flat fee vouchers but as a percentage of the annual premium. The Affordable Care Act expansion led to millions more covered lives — new customers for insurers — and these companies returned the favor by hiking their rates, knowing that taxpayers would make up the difference. </p>\n<p>What’s the reason for the increase in premiums since Obamacare began? We could cynically assume greed, but there are multiple plausible explanations, none of which we can quantify with great confidence. Some argue that because the subsidies rise with premiums, insurers face less pressure to keep prices down. Insurers point to rising hospital and pharmaceutical prices, consolidation among health systems, and the increasing number of high-cost enrollees. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>All of these may be true to a degree, but the real problem is we can’t say for sure. </p>\n<p>Federal law requires insurers and hospitals to disclose negotiated prices, under the <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/hospital-price-transparency\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hospital Price Transparency Rule (2021)</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/healthplan-price-transparency\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Transparency in Coverage Rule (2022)</a>. But unfortunately, compliance has been largely performative. Insurers post massive “machine-readable” files that are nearly impossible to download, let alone interpret. The information exists in theory, but in practice it is unusable for patients, employers and policymakers trying to answer the most basic question: What does care actually cost? </p>\n<p>The prospect of premiums going up by hundreds of dollars each month frightens families. But we need to balance compassion for those individual circumstances with the reality that we are spending billions of dollars each year to prop up a fundamentally broken system. The largest beneficiaries of taxpayer subsidies are not hospitals, doctors or even patients — they are insurers.</p>\n\n<p>If Congress extends the Affordable Care Act subsidies that families have come to depend on, it should demand something in return: real price-transparency. Reporting should be mandatory, not voluntary. Readable, easy-to-understand disclosures should be made public of what insurers pay for care and what patients are expected to pay. Ordinary people should be able to tell exactly how much of every subsidy dollar is going to patient premiums and patient care, and how much is funding administrative costs, executive bonuses and shareholder revenue. Taxpayers deserve to see where their money is going. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>Empathy for families facing rate hikes and a demand for fiscal responsibility are not mutually exclusive.

Or it can seize the opportunity to make a basic correction that should have happened years ago.

Our digital consumption fuels a rapidly growing carbon footprint hiding in plain sight.</p>\n\n<p>The information and communication technology sector, which makes the internet run, now accounts for an <a href=\"https://greenly.earth/en-gb/leaf-media/data-stories/the-carbon-cost-of-streaming\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">estimated 3.7 percent</a> of global greenhouse gas emissions. To put that into perspective, the global network of data centers consumes energy <a href=\"https://usfblogs.usfca.edu/sustainability/2023/11/29/the-cost-of-streaming-data-centers-and-their-environmental-impact/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">comparable to the entire airline industry</a>. As high-resolution 4K and 8K streaming becomes the norm, global video traffic is exploding — and placing immense strain on energy grids. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Streaming is an invisible relay race of electricity consumption that happens in three main acts: </p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"1\">\n<li><strong>The server:</strong> Your movie lives on a server in a warehouse-sized data center that uses staggering amounts of electricity, to power and cool computers. Cooling systems can account for nearly half of a facility’s total energy use and draw <a href=\"https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/data-centers-and-water-consumption\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">billions of gallons of water annually</a> to maintain internal temperatures, anchoring the “cloud” to local power and water supplies. </li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>The network:</strong> Fiber-optic cables, routers and switching stations transmit gigabytes of data across the globe. This “always-on” network consumes power continuously, even when idle. The longer data travels and the more digital “hops” it makes, the greater the energy required. </li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>The device:</strong> The device itself is the most overlooked piece of the carbon puzzle, <a href=\"https://www.carbontrust.com/our-work-and-impact/guides-reports-and-tools/carbon-impact-of-video-streaming\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">responsible for the largest share of streaming-associated emissions</a>. Larger, higher-resolution screens demand more power. One hour of high-quality streaming can emit <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2021/how-to-reduce-environmental-impact-next-virtual-meeting-0304\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">55 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent;</a> streaming four hours daily for a month generates emissions on par with driving more than 100 miles. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>When a major tech company builds a billion-dollar facility, the steep new power demand often requires construction of new power plants and transmission lines — frequently fossil-fueled — <a href=\"https://www.calgary.ca/content/dam/www/general/documents/smartcities/addressing-digital-equity-digital-divide.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">raising rates for nearby residents and small businesses</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>This dynamic creates a <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-science/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2025.1593632/full\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cruel imbalance</a>: local communities, often lower-income or marginalized, bear the brunt of increased pollution from added power generation, while profits and convenience flow to wealthier consumers and powerful tech companies. It is inequitable for corporations to <a href=\"https://greencitizen.com/blog/digital-carbon-footprint/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reap digital profits while externalizing the environmental cost to the public</a> — especially to communities without affordable access to the very systems creating the pollution. </p>\n<p>How do we fix a problem that is invisible to users? The answer lies in redesigning incentives for corporations and consumers. </p>\n<p>First, regulators should require tech giants to disclose the energy and water use of their data centers, breaking it down by service (such as streaming, search and cloud storage). Companies should face stricter power usage effectiveness mandates, the standard measure of efficiency. Transparency provides data for accountability and targeted regulation. </p>\n\n<p>Second, we must provide an incentive by making renewable power profitable. Companies like Google and Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.landapp.com/post/data-centers-are-driving-renewable-energy-development\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">already lead in purchasing green energy</a>, setting an example for their supply chains. Policies should promote development of clean energy sources to meet <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/meta-data-center-louisiana-power-costs-4ce76b73c102727d71edbbb56abe1388\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rising data center demand</a> and prevent construction of new natural gas power plants.</p>\n<p>Third, we must encourage efficient content delivery. Streaming platforms should default to standard definition, with users having to opt in for high definition or 4K. This small design change could dramatically reduce network traffic and energy use without affecting most viewing experiences.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, consumers can do their part as well in ways that are <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/gdo/clean-energy-resources-meet-data-center-electricity-demand\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">easy and intuitive</a>. For example, when watching on a small screen or listening to background videos, they can switch to SD. This single action cuts data use and energy consumption across the network.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>If you plan to watch something multiple times, just download it once over Wi-Fi rather than streaming it repeatedly. Wi-Fi is generally more energy-efficient than mobile networks and avoids the constant energy draws of repeated streaming. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>Finally, extending your phone’s or television’s lifespan, as by refurbishment, reduces production-related carbon output and limits e-waste. It also saves consumers money.</p>\n<p>To fulfill the digital age’s promise of speed, we must shed the illusion of weightlessness. Climate action is not just about how we drive or heat our homes; our daily digital habits have tangible environmental impacts. By aligning personal behavior with smarter incentives and demanding transparency from the largest tech companies, our digital future can be truly sustainable. </p>\n\n<p><em>J. Freya H.
