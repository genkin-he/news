That impacts more than 1,000 people in the state, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/kansas-invalidates-drivers-licenses-birth-certificates-over-1000-transgender-2026-02-26/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to Reuters</a>. </p>\n<p>Under the law, Kansans cannot make changes to their gender on driver’s licenses and birth certificates going forward. Those who need new licenses must pay a fee of no more than $8, to be set by state Secretary of Revenue Mark Burghart. </p>\n<p>Transgender Kansans must also use restrooms, locker rooms, changing rooms and shower rooms in government buildings that correspond to their birth sex. </p>\n<p>Individuals who violate the law twice will face a civil penalty of $1,000, while those who commit a third or subsequent violation will be charged with a class B misdemeanor. Government entities in violation will be penalized $25,000 for first infractions and $125,000 for each subsequent infraction. </p>\n<p>The GOP-led Kansas Legislature passed the bill last month. While Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly (D) vetoed it, the Legislature overrode that veto earlier this month. </p>\n<p>When that occurred, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Kansas <a href=\"https://www.aclukansas.org/press-releases/advocacy-organizations-condemn-kansas-legislature-override-of-governor-veto-on-sb-244/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">denounced the legislation</a> as “intrusive” and an attack on transgender Kansans. </p>\n<p>“This bill is about forcing people into the wrong bathrooms and opening up all Kansans to scrutiny and gender policing by strangers,” said Logan DeMond, ACLU of Kansas policy director, in a release. “Bathroom bans are grounded in prejudice and misinformation, and they don’t actually make anyone safer.”</p>\n<p>Harper Seldin, a senior staff attorney with the LGBTQ and HIV Project at the ACLU, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/kansas-invalidates-drivers-licenses-birth-certificates-over-1000-transgender-2026-02-26/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told Reuters</a> that the organization plans on filing a legal challenge to the law by the end of Friday.</p>",

Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, on Thursday called for President Trump to testify under oath before the committee as part of its investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>\n<p>He did so as the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5756577-clintons-questioned-epstein-links/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">panel conducted a deposition</a> with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Chappaqua, N.Y., and is set to depose former President Clinton on Friday.</p>\n<p>“This committee has now set a new precedent about talking to presidents and former presidents,” Garcia said in a press conference during a break in Clinton’s deposition. “We’re demanding immediately that we ask President Trump to testify in front of our committee and be deposed in front of Oversight Republicans and Democrats.”</p>\n<p>Garcia and other Democrats brought up a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5723968/epstein-files-trump-accusation-maxwell\">report from NPR</a> from this week that said the Department of Justice withheld and removed some Epstein files related to Trump.</p>\n<p>“We want to understand right now, where the missing FBI files are,” Garcia said. “These are files that accuse the president of the United States of serious, serious accusations around sexual abuse and the fact that they’re not in the files, and have been apparently either removed or discarded, is incredibly concerning.”</p>\n<p>The White House has denied any wrongdoing by Trump, and the Justice Department has said the allegations against Trump were found to have no credibility.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5756249-doj-investigates-withheld-fbi-interviews/\">Department of Justice said in a statement is reviewing the matter</a>.</p>\n<p>“Several individuals and news outlets have recently flagged files related to documents produced to Ghislaine Maxwell in discovery of her criminal case that they claim appear to be missing,” it said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/DOJRR47/status/2026769082159112295?s=20\">statement Wednesday</a>.</p>\n<p>“As with all documents that have been flagged by the public, the Department is currently reviewing files within that category of the production. Should any document be found to have been improperly tagged in the review process and is responsive to the Act, the Department will of course publish it, consistent with the law.”</p>\n<p>Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), the chair of the Oversight panel, said earlier Thursday that the panel is looking into the NPR report and looking to get an answer from the Department of Justice about what happened.</p>\n<p>Clinton said in her deposition opening statement that she did not recall ever meeting Epstein, and had no knowledge of crimes committed by him and Maxwell.

            "description": "<p>Florida Republicans are repeating calls for regime change in Cuba in the wake of the Cuban coast guard killing four people and detaining others who were in a Florida-registered motorboat that Havana said crossed into Cuban territorial waters. </p>\n<p>The deadly confrontation adds another layer of volatility between Havana and Washington, amid President Trump’s fuel blockade around the island. Trump imposed the blockade at the end of January to weaken the Cuban communist regime. Last year, Trump designated Cuba as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. </p>\n<p>Rep. Carlos Gimenez (R-Fla.), who was born in Cuba, said Trump’s policies have brought the Cuban regime to the closest point of collapse in its 67 years. </p>\n<p>“The regime is in its weakest position. We have the right president and we have the right secretary of State and the right policies in place in order to make it happen,” Gimenez said on Fox News. </p>\n<p>“Actually I’ve been here for over 65 years. This is, you know, the closest we’ve been to seeing a free Cuba and for me it can’t happen soon enough.”</p>\n<p>Gimenez, who is also a member of the House Homeland Security and Armed Services committees, said he wants to know “exactly what happened” with the Cuban coast guard. </p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the Cuban coast guard said it confronted a Florida-registered speedboat and encountered armed individuals who opened fire, describing them as terrorists. Cuba said four people were killed and six others were detained. </p>\n<p>Gimenez demanded access to the individuals taken into custody. Gimenez described the individuals as Americans, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Wednesday that it’s not yet clear if they are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. </p>\n<p>Gimenez said Cuban officials view any Cuban diaspora as a Cuban national, regardless of other citizenship. He said the boat the Cuban coast guard confronted was a 24-foot open fisherman vessel with a 1,300 horsepower engine. </p>\n<p>“The original story was they were transporting human smuggling and now they’re terrorists. They are changing their story and we need to get to the bottom of it,” he said of Cuban officials. </p>\n<p>Gimenez raised the prospect that Cuba could use the six detained individuals as leverage in the standoff with the U.S.</p>\n<p>Other prominent Florida Republicans have called for regime change in Cuba. </p>\n<p>Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), who is running for governor, posted on the social platform X that the “Communist Cuban regime must go.”</p>\n<p>Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said Cuban leader Raúl Castro should be indicted in a U.S. court and put on trial “for all the Americans he killed.”</p>\n<p>Asked by The Hill if Trump should carry out an operation to capture Castro similar to the operation to seize Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro on a drug charges warrant, Scott deferred and predicted the Cuban people would eventually topple their government.</p>\n<p>“I think ultimately the Cuban people are going to just rise up, because of how bad it is,” he said.</p>\n<p>Trump has not laid out his demands for Cuba but said the fuel blockade could usher in regime collapse. </p>\n<p>Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is taking the lead on Trump’s policy toward Havana. The <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article314847434.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Miami Herald reported Thursday</a> that U.S. officials met on the sidelines of a conference in the Caribbean with Raúl Guillermo Rodriguez Castro, grandson and bodyguard to Raúl Castro, considered the de facto leader in Havana. </p>\n<p>Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month that the U.S. “would love to see the regime change, it doesn’t mean we’re going to make a change.” </p>\n<p>The secretary said that the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Coast Guard are carrying out an independent investigation into what happened with the Cuban coast guard.  </p>",

            "description": "<p>Republican strategist Karl Rove on Wednesday accused President Trump of making a “key mistake” during his State of the Union address by not pandering to his crowd of disenchanted voters who are seeking relief from financial hardship.</p>\n<p>“For them, the president’s speech almost certainly didn’t sound based in reality. Many Americans, especially swing voters, are pessimistic about the economy,” Rove wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/the-state-of-the-union-is-belligerent-b8d6e7a8\">Wall Street Journal op-ed</a>, highlighting job loss in the manufacturing sector preceding potentially more reductions due to artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>For weeks, Rove has urged Trump to cater to his base of voters plagued by rising costs.</p>\n<p>The strategist bucked the president’s claims that prices are decreasing and that tariffs would replace income tax, alleging that Trump “sounded as out of touch” as former President Biden when he preached “‘Bidenomics is working.’”</p>\n<p>In his Tuesday speech, Trump told listeners the economy was “roaring” and that America was “winning.” Rove said the vigor was motivating yet Trump’s efforts rarely show as material policy. </p>\n<p>“It too often sounded like a political convention speech rather than a presidential address. Even by the former’s standards, it was angry, pugnacious, and hence less effective,” Rove wrote.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Trump offered elements of a credible, effective case for Republicans in the midterm campaign. But if they’re to defend their majority successfully, congressional Republicans must offer more substance, be more forward-looking, display more empathy, and focus much more on the economy than what Americans heard Tuesday,” he added.</p>\n<p>Rove concluded the commentary with a clear call to the GOP: “They better get cracking. Time’s a-wasting.”</p>",

These are actions short of war, but no case has been made,” Davidson <a href=\"https://x.com/WarrenDavidson/status/2027036899945107794?s=20\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wrote on X</a>.</p>\n<p>House Democrats are expected to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5756657-democrats-trump-iran-war-powers/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">force a vote</a> next week designed to stop Trump from <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5747382-trump-limited-strike-iran/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">launching strikes</a> without first obtaining congressional approval as the administration <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5755158-us-iran-sanctions-oil-nuclear-program/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ramps up pressure</a> on Tehran over its nuclear program.</p>\n<p>The resolution’s prospects <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5753315-trump-iran-military-force-resolution-fails/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">remain uncertain</a>, with Davidson and co-sponsor Rep. Thomas Massie (Ky.) being the only House Republicans to publicly back it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, at least two Democrats — Reps. Josh Gottheimer (N.J.) and Jared Moskowitz (Fla.) — have indicated they will <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5748330-lawler-gottheimer-oppose-iran-strike/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">break with their party</a> and vote against it.</p>\n<p>Gottheimer, a staunch Israel ally, has defended his stance by arguing that Trump needs flexibility in addressing Iranian threats, noting the regime’s support of terrorist proxies and efforts to develop a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>“So long as ‘Death to America’ remains the rallying cry of the Iranian regime, Iran will remain a persistent and serious threat to our men and women in uniform, our allies, and global stability,” Gottheimer said in <a href=\"https://lawler.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5528\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a joint statement</a> with Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) last week.</p>\n<p>“We respect and defend Congress’s constitutional role in matters of war. Oversight and debate are absolutely vital. However, this resolution would restrict the flexibility needed to respond to real and evolving threats and risks, signaling weakness at a dangerous moment,” they added.</p>\n<p>Trump did not take the possibility of <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5756532-trump-iran-strikes-regime-change/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">military action</a> off the table in his <a href=\"https://thehill.com/video-clips/5752399-watch-live-donald-trump-state-of-the-union-address-2026/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">State of the Union address</a> on Tuesday, even as he pushed for a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5754746-vance-us-seeks-iran-diplomacy/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">diplomatic outcome</a> in the ongoing, indirect talks between U.S. and Iranian officials.</p>\n<p>“We are in negotiations with them. They want to make a deal, but we haven’t heard those secret words: We will never have a nuclear weapon,” Trump said during his speech.</p>\n<p>Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi said Thursday that “significant progress” had been made and plans for another round of “technical level” discussions in Vienna next week were in the works.</p>\n<p>“We have finished the day after significant progress in the negotiation between the United States and Iran. We will resume soon after consultation in the respective capitals,” al-Busaidi <a href=\"https://x.com/badralbusaidi/status/2027089708392579576\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wrote on X</a>.</p>\n<p>The war powers resolution would not be the first time Davidson aligned with Massie on a largely party-line vote. The two fiscal conservatives were the only House Republicans to initially <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5313198-house-passes-trump-big-beautiful-bill/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">vote against</a> the One Big Beautiful Bill Act last summer over concerns about deficit spending.</p>\n<p>Davidson <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5382760-warren-davidson-trump-big-beautiful-bill/\">ultimately voted for</a> the Senate’s version of the massive spending and policy bill, but Massie did not.</p>",
