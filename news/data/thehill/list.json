As per the Legal Services Corporation’s 2022 report “<a href=\"https://justicegap.lsc.gov/resource/executive-summary/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Justice Gap</a>,” many make these uncertain journeys alone, unable to afford representation. “Most low-income Americans do not get any or enough legal help for their civil legal problems — and the cost of legal help stands out as an important barrier,” the report says.</p>\n<p>Although the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/bill-of-rights-transcript#:~:text=without%20just%20compensation.-,Amendment%20VI,of%20Counsel%20for%20his%20defence.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sixth Amendment</a> guarantees the right to legal representation in criminal prosecutions, there is no such guarantee in obtaining adequate representation for civil matters. Approximately <a href=\"https://justicegap.lsc.gov/resource/section-2-todays-low-income-america/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">50 million Americans</a> have household incomes below 125 percent of the poverty threshold. The Justice Gap study found that low-income Americans do not get adequate legal assistance in <a href=\"https://justicegap.lsc.gov/resource/executive-summary/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">92 percent of civil cases</a>, which often involve securing and protecting basic needs.</p>\n\n<p>What can we do to improve civil representation for low-income Americans? Responsible use of artificial intelligence may be the answer. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>A January 2025 article in the <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/llr/vol57/iss4/2/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review</a> said AI can potentially enhance access to legal aid services. The article referenced <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3210&amp;context=llr\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a study</a> revealing that 21 percent of participating legal aid professionals are already using AI tools to complete routine tasks, freeing them to focus on more complex matters. Because many civil cases involve completing standardized forms, drafting routine letters, or explaining legal documents in plain language, low-income Americans should be able to access such basic services at little to no cost through an AI bot.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the study identified risks such as inaccurate results and <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3210&amp;context=llr\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hallucinations</a> — “the confident generation by AI tools of inaccurate results, such as nonexistent case citations, inaccurate legal information, and incorrect information about court procedures or deadlines.” However, it is difficult to estimate the gravity of potential problems associated with such hallucinations.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The Loyola article cited a separate <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jla/article/16/1/64/7699227?login=false\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2024 research study</a> whose authors found that “LLMs hallucinate between 58 percent (ChatGPT 4) and 88 percent (Llama 2) of the time.” For this reason alone, AI should not be relied upon to make significant legal decisions or recommendations resulting in fines or jail time.</p>\n<p>Regulation is needed at every jurisdictional level, or AI could easily do more harm than good. However, AI can still deliver tremendous benefits to low-income Americans by lowering the cost of basic legal support. Tasks like translating lease agreements into plain English or guiding tenants through standard court forms are well within AI’s current capabilities. For many Americans, these seemingly small actions could mean the difference between stability and crisis. </p>\n<p>Will AI replace junior attorneys altogether? According to <a href=\"https://assets.bbhub.io/bna/sites/18/2024/06/2024-Legal-Ops-and-Tech-Survey.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg Law’s Legal Ops and Tech Survey</a>, “With investment for legal technology as part of budgeting plans, respondents agree that there will be a reorganization of roles to accommodate the shift towards new tech.” This indicates that we are more likely to see a change in work roles rather than a complete restructuring of the legal profession. Only time will tell how AI may affect attorneys overall. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n\n<p>Although the future of law remains an important concern, the greater current risk to society is the continuation of a system in which millions of Americans cannot afford basic assistance for civil legal matters. The hope, however tenuous, is that AI can improve this metric by acting as a form of legal triage. An AI bot can act as frontline support to screen cases, answer simple questions, and navigate someone toward professional assistance when necessary. </p>\n<p>The alternative is to maintain the status quo, where the overwhelming majority of low-income Americans face civil matters without any legal representation. </p>\n<p><em>Michelle Mikhels is editor-in-chief of the NYU Undergraduate Law Review.</em> </p>\n</div>",

But it faces stiff headwinds from senators in his own party who have been adamantly opposed to getting rid of the tactic.</p>\n\n<p>A spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) said <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5583744-gop-leader-thune-defends-filibuster-trump/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Thune’s position</a> “on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged.”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) posted on the social platform X that he was a “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5582936-senate-filibuster-john-curtis-trump/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">firm no</a>” on eliminating the filibuster.</p>\n<p>“The filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate. Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t,” Curtis posted.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), while not in the Senate, mostly responded to Trump’s post by pointing out how eliminating the filibuster could boomerang back around to hurt Republicans in the future.</p>\n<p>Johnson argued if Democrats had a majority without the filibuster in place, they would make the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico states, alter the Supreme Court, ban firearms, and “do all sorts of things that would be very harmful for the country.” </p>\n<p>“The filibuster has traditionally been viewed as a very important safeguard. If the shoe was on the other foot, I don’t think our team would like it,” Johnson said. </p>\n\n<p>Trump late Thursday threw a curveball into efforts to end the shutdown with his plea for Senate Republicans to get rid of the filibuster and unilaterally vote to reopen the government. The president made the case that failing to nuke the filibuster, which requires most legislation in the Senate to garner 60 votes, could ultimately harm Republicans politically.</p>\n<p>“If the Democrats ever came back into power, which would be made easier for them if the Republicans are not using the Great Strength and Policies made available to us by ending the Filibuster, the Democrats will exercise their rights, and it will be done in the first day they take office, regardless of whether or not we do it,” Trump posted on Truth Social.</p>\n<p>This week was not the first time Trump has called for an end to the filibuster. He <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/26/donald-trump-kill-the-filibuster-677151\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">did so multiple</a> times in <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/335594-trump-calls-for-end-to-filibuster/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">his first term</a>, using a similar argument that Democrats would try the same thing if they took the majority.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Then-President Biden, then-Vice President Harris and some Democratic senators pushed to alter the filibuster to pass voting rights and abortion legislation, though it <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/politics/senate-voting-legislation-filibuster\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ultimately failed</a> to garner enough support within the party.</p>\n<p>Trump has largely avoided directly weighing in on efforts on Capitol Hill to end the shutdown, and White House allies have argued there is <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5577750-white-house-lacks-urgency-shutdown/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">little incentive</a> for the president to get involved since he has carried out his agenda unabated. Trump’s latest post came on the heels of a trip to Asia, where he worked to broker trade agreements with China, Japan, South Korea and other countries.</p>\n<p>But some close to the president suggested the timing of his filibuster post was a reflection of mounting frustration over Democrats’ continued refusal to back a GOP-led continuing resolution to fund the government at current levels. Any funding measure in the Senate requires at least seven Democrats to join with all 53 Republicans to overcome the filibuster and pass. </p>\n\n<p>“What you’re seeing is an expression of the president’s anger at the situation,” Johnson said. “He is as angry as I am, as the American people are about this madness. And he just desperately wants the government to be reopened so that all these resources can flow to the people who need it so much.”</p>\n<p>Some Senate Republicans have in recent days <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5566292-senate-republicans-filibuster-reform/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">increasingly discussed</a> changing the filibuster’s rules if Democrats do not end the shutdown. But doing so would require a majority of Republicans to back the change, and it’s unlikely the party has the needed support even with Trump’s urging.</p>\n<p>Instead, Thune and other top Republicans have been searching for other ways to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5580101-democrats-republicans-negotiate-aca-subsidies/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">break the stalemate</a> and end the shutdown as it threatens various government programs and causes issues at major airports.</p>\n\n<p>Thune told reporters Wednesday that moderate Democrats are looking for an “off-ramp” to end the shutdown, adding that he’s willing to talk to them about the concessions he has already offered, such as a vote on Democrats’ proposal to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies beyond December.</p>\n<p>Trump on Friday was not asked about the filibuster as he traveled to Florida for the weekend. But he reiterated that he would only meet with Democrats to discuss policy matters after the government was reopened.</p>\n<p>“I’m always willing to meet. All they have to do is open up the country,” Trump told reporters. “Let them open up the country, and we’ll meet. We’ll meet very quickly, but they have to open up the country. It’s their fault. Everything is their fault.”<br/></p>\n</div>",

But he has made it a point to reemerge on the political stage in the weeks before the election to help Democrats win their campaigns. </p>\n<p>This year, in addition to helping Democrats’ campaigns, he has also urged California voters to support Proposition 50, a ballot measure in the state which could reshape the congressional map there and give Democrats up to five seats in the House. </p>\n<p>“California, the whole nation is counting on you,” Obama said in an ad appearing in the state. “Democracy is on the ballot.”</p>\n\n<p>He has also been increasingly outspoken on President Trump and his administration’s policies, and the efforts to weaken democracy. </p>\n<p>“I think there is no doubt that a lot of the norms, civic habits, expectations, institutional guardrails that we had, that we took for granted for our democracy, have been weakened deliberately,” Obama told Marc Maron, on the final episode of the comedian’s podcast. </p>\n<p>The former president’s allies say he, more than anyone, understands the stakes in next week’s elections, and that’s why he has been increasingly vocal in recent weeks. </p>\n\n<p>He is growing worried, allies say, about Trump’s directives and is no longer convinced that the nation can survive another three years of the current administration’s policies. </p>\n<p>“He sees what’s happening and he is distraught, to put it lightly,” one ally to the former president said. </p>\n<p>Still, while Democrats say no one can get out the vote more than Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, they are realistic about their limitations. </p>\n\n<p>“The more we move away from the Obama presidency, the less muscle he has to push,” said one Democratic strategist. “It’s just the reality. We saw that with President Clinton and we’re seeing it now with Obama.” </p>\n<p>The strategist pointed to the 2024 election cycle and how his endorsements of some candidates — including former Vice President Harris — didn’t matter in the end. </p>\n<p>“And that’s with all the buzz around his speech at the convention, and all the rallies in the final days,” the strategist said. “In the end, no one cares about the surrogates. They care about the candidates themselves.”</p>\n\n<p>Rocha agreed with that sentiment. </p>\n<p>“In the multimedia world we’re living in, there is just less and less that endorsements and last minute rallies can do for a campaign overall,” he said. </p>\n</div>",

Instead, Russia continues to do everything to weasel out of diplomacy, and as soon as the issue of long-range capabilities for us — for Ukraine — became less immediate, Russia’s interest in diplomacy faded almost automatically,” Zelensky <a href=\"https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/liniya-frontu-mozhe-buti-pochatkom-diplomatiyi-zvernennya-pr-100889\">said during a daily</a> video address earlier this month. “This signals that this very issue — the issue of our deep strike capabilities — may hold the indispensable key to peace.” </p>\n\n<p>The missiles are built to travel at high, subsonic speeds and low heights to better dodge radars, providing Ukraine with a lot more capability and range to target Russian military outposts and energy facilities deep inside the country, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5557731-trump-tomahawk-missiles-ukraine/\">military experts previously told</a> The Hill. </p>\n<p>Russia has warned the U.S. against sending the missiles to Ukraine, arguing it would represent a major escalation.

Potential targets under consideration are military-controlled airports and ports, including airstrips and naval facilities, the outlet reported, citing one U.S. official. </p>\n\n<p>When asked on Friday if he is considering strikes in Venezuela and if he has made up his mind, Trump denied it. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“No. It’s not true,” the president <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5583516-trump-denies-strikes-venezuela/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told reporters</a> aboard Air Force One while en route to Florida.</p>\n<p>“We are certainly looking at land now because we’ve got the sea under control,” Trump <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5557409-trump-venezuela-covert-operations/\">said</a> at the White House earlier this month when discussing if he was looking at ground strikes in Venezuela. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The administration has taken a more aggressive approach toward the South American country in recent months, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5582059-democrats-seek-legal-rationale/\">blowing up</a> alleged drug-trafficking boats off the coast of Caracas, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5442517-venezuela-maduro-reward-doj/\">doubling</a> the Justice Department’s (DOJ) reward for information leading to an arrest of Maduro to $50 million and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5575511-trump-venezuela-military-pressure-maduro/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dispatching military assets in the region</a>, including <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5571893-uss-gerald-ford-caribbean-deployment/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recently directing</a> the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, and its strike group to the Caribbean. </p>\n<p>Mark Cancian, a former Defense Department (DOD) official and senior adviser at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said the U.S. is now “much more likely” to conduct strikes. </p>\n<p>“First, they’ve been building up assets and activities to do that. They don’t have to do it, but it would be harder to back off unless something happened. I mean, something like, Maduro left, or something like that. But Maduro just stayed there, and the Trump administration did nothing after all this buildup, that would look like a Maduro victory, and he would treat it like that,” Cancian said in an interview with The Hill. </p>\n\n<p>“So they’re going to have to do something, unless Maduro steps down or does something dramatic enough that Trump could claim a success,” he added. </p>\n<p>The Miami Herald <a href=\"https://t.co/LYUuWQe9qf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> Friday, citing unnamed officials, the potential strikes would aim to ax the hierarchy of the drug cartels in Venezuela. Secretary of State Marco Rubio rebuffed the article, <a href=\"https://x.com/marcorubio/status/1984351703760846897?s=46\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">saying</a> it is a “fake story.” </p>\n<p>Christopher Hernandez-Roy, a senior fellow and deputy director of the Americas Program at CSIS, noted the denial of reports by Trump, but added that the U.S. military’s role is to “identify strike packages to provide the President with options.” </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Hernandez-Roy told The Hill that strikes inside Venezuela would represent a “significant escalation” and they would be “more difficult to explain as simply counter-drug operations, especially if the targets are facilities controlled by the Venezuelan military.” </p>\n<p>“If strikes on land occur, I would expect them to be on targets that are more credibly associated with [Drug Trafficking Organizations], say a dock where drug boats are known to depart from, or a warehouse near a dock, or some other infrastructure not connected to the government or the military that is associated with drug trafficking,” he said on Friday. </p>\n<p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, when asked Friday while in Malaysia about the military buildup in the Caribbean, said the administration takes the “security of our hemisphere very seriously.” </p>\n\n<p>“I’m obviously not going to talk about the particulars of why troops are where in every circumstance, but they’ve got a clear mission and they’re executing,” he said. </p>\n<p>The U.S. has <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5575511-trump-venezuela-military-pressure-maduro/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dispatched surveillance planes, fighter jets, warships, at least one submarine</a> and Marines to the region as it continues to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5571471-trump-authorizes-cia-venezuela/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">take out alleged drug-smuggling</a> boats in the Caribbean and East Pacific, operations that so far have killed at least 61 “narco-terrorists.” </p>\n<p>The U.S. currently has the USS Iwo Jima, USS Stockdale, USS Gravely, USS San Antonio, USS Wichita, USS Lake Erie and USS Jason Dunham present in the region, along with the USS Newport News, a nuclear-powered fast-attack submarine, and MV Ocean Trader, a special operations ship that can collect intelligence. </p>\n\n<p>The USS Gettysburg, a Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser, is also now in the Caribbean, a U.S. Navy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed to The Hill on Friday. </p>\n<p>The U.S. does not have enough assets in the region for an invasion, according to Cancian, who said the U.S. military is  “well-positioned to do strikes but not to land on Venezuela.”</p>\n<p>In light of reports of the U.S. eyeing strikes against Venezuelan targets, Russia, a close ally of Caracas, issued support for Venezuela’s leadership in “defending its national sovereignty, taking into account the dynamics of the international &amp; regional situation.” </p>\n\n<p>“We stand ready to respond appropriately to the requests of our partners in light of emerging threats,” Russia’s foreign ministry <a href=\"https://x.com/mfa_russia/status/1984263993087897726\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> Friday in a statement on social platform X. </p>\n<p>Maduro has been asking Iran, China and Russia to bolster its military and for additional assistance, including for jet repairs, defensive radars and potentially missiles, according to documents <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/10/31/russia-venezuela-oil-trump/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">obtained</a> by The Washington Post. </p>\n<p>A Russian aircraft, Ilyushin Il-76, which is sanctioned by the U.S. and has ties to Moscow’s military and Wagner mercenary group, was in Caracas on Sunday after making stops in Armenia, Algeria, Morocco, Senegal and Mauritania, <a href=\"https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/zr1801\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to flight-tracking data. </p>\n\n<p>Maduro claimed last week that Venezuela has at least 5,000 Russian-made Igla-S man-portable surface-to-air missiles that can engage targets between 1,600 feet and about 3.5 miles and up to 2 miles <strong>in </strong>altitude, depending on the variant.</p>\n<p>Venezuela has anti-ship missiles, including Russian-supplied Kh-31 supersonic missiles that can be fired from Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jets. Caracas also has Iranian anti-ship missiles on its Zulfiqar-class air-defense boats, but Hernandez-Roy said he does not expect either system to penetrate the defensive shields of U.S. ships. </p>\n<p>“So those would try to intercept anything that came over Venezuela, whether they’re cruise missiles or aircraft, and they might get lucky if there were actual aircraft that came over Venezuela,” Cancian said. “That’s why I suspect that any air campaign would be done with long-range missiles like Tomahawks. But there are other possibilities too, so you don’t put U.S. service members in danger.” </p>\n\n<p>The American public’s approval of the Navy’s presence around Venezuela has dropped since September, when the first strikes against alleged drug-trafficking boats began taking place, according to a new YouGov <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/international/articles/53298-the-us-navy-deployment-near-venezuela-has-become-even-less-popular\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> which was released on Friday. In September, 36 percent at least somewhat approved of the deployment and 38 percent said otherwise. Now, just 30 percent of Americans approve and 37 percent at least somewhat disapprove. </p>\n<p>More U.S. adults disapprove than approve of the military’s strikes against alleged drug-smuggling vessels around Venezuela and nearly half of Americans, 47 percent, oppose the military striking land targets in the South American nation, the poll found. Only 19 percent support it. </p>\n<p>Progressives, <a href=\"https://x.com/BernieSanders/status/1984311659683549630\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">including</a> Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) <a href=\"https://x.com/RoKhanna/status/1984302891490820562\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">voiced</a> their opposition to the potential strikes inside Venezuela, demanding that Trump get Congress’s approval for military action inside the country, while Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.) <a href=\"https://x.com/MaElviraSalazar/status/1984328285019357655\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">proclaimed</a> that Maduro “wanted an early Christmas, but Halloween always comes first.”</p>\n</div>",
