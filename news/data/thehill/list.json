            "description": "<p>The Trump administration is releasing billions of dollars in disaster aid that were previously awaiting approval from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.</p>\n<p>A source familiar with the situation told The Hill that billions in combined public assistance and hazard mitigation funds are being awarded from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and that the funds were previously held up under Noem’s policy of personally reviewing major expenditures.</p>\n<p>FEMA’s public assistance funds <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/fema_public-assistance-fact-sheet_10-2019.pdf\">help communities recover from disasters</a> while its hazard mitigation funds <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation\">help communities better prepare for future disasters</a>.</p>\n<p>The source said that more than $10 billion in public assistance funds are still awaiting approval. </p>\n<p>The source also said that Minnesota, Illinois, California, Colorado and the Virgin Islands are the only U.S. states and territories that would not receive public assistance awards in the tranche of funding.</p>\n<p>Spokespeople for FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees FEMA, did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment.</p>\n<p>However, a FEMA spokesperson confirmed to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/26/politics/disaster-aid-fema-states-trump-shutdown\">CNN</a>, which first reported that some of the funds would be released, that it was doling out more than $5 billion.</p>\n<p>“This week, FEMA released over $5 billion in recovery funding for projects, some dating back as far as 15 years — a significant win for states, local governments, and hospitals,” the spokesperson said. “To be clear, this is about results, not politics.”</p>\n<p>“Regarding which projects are being funded, FEMA is prioritizing based on project readiness and strict oversight. Obligations are made when projects meet all necessary criteria. Decisions are not based on political considerations; the process is focused on merit and accountability,” they told CNN.</p>\n<p>DHS is requiring that all expenditures of more than $100,000 – including but not limited to FEMA funds –  get Noem’s personal approval before their release.</p>\n<p>The controversial policy has made headlines, including when FEMA staff <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5468696-fema-letter-trump-administration-disaster-response/\">released a letter</a> criticizing the administration and saying that the policy ““reduces FEMA’s authorities and capabilities to swiftly deliver our mission.”</p>\n<p>The administration has also indicated that it plans to “reform” FEMA, though it has not yet released its plans for doing so. Reporting indicated that such changes could include cuts to FEMA staff.</p>\n<p>The funding releases come amid a federal government shutdown at DHS as Democrats and Republicans feud over immigration funding. However, FEMA has funding sources beyond the typical appropriations process through its Disaster Relief Fund, which cover many of its operations even if other appropriations have lapsed.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has previously singled out California, Illinois, Colorado and Minnesota, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5725217-trump-blue-states-funding-minnesota-colorado-evs-hiv/\">revoking health and transportation funds</a> from those states earlier this month.</p>",

            "description": "<p>New polling released on Friday reveals that more Americans say they sympathize with Palestinians than they do with Israelis, a new statistic coming several months after Israel and Hamas struck a deal to pause their devastating war in the Gaza Strip.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/702440/israelis-no-longer-ahead-americans-middle-east-sympathies.aspx\">Gallup</a> found that 41 percent of Americans sympathize with the Palestinians compared to the 36 percent who say they sympathize with the Israelis. The polling firm noted that although this difference is not statistically significant, it contrasts with the lead Israelis have had in similar polls over the past 24 years.</p>\n<p>Israelis consistently held a double-digit lead during that time, typically averaging a 43-point gap between 2001 and 2018. This started to narrow down in 2019, years before Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and shifted further during Israel’s sweeping military campaign in Gaza.</p>\n<p>“The cumulative effect of gradual changes in U.S. attitudes since then has led to the Israelis no longer being viewed more sympathetically,” Gallup stated.</p>\n<p>Gallup also found that 37 percent of Americans hold a favorable view of the Palestinian Territories, which is behind the 46 percent who view Israel favorably. Fifty-seven percent of Americans favor an independent Palestinian state, which comes close to the highest percentage on the subject that Gallup has measured.</p>\n<p>Democrats’ views toward Palestinians have jumped since 2023, with 65 percent now sympathizing more with the Palestinians compared to 17 percent who say they sympathize with the Israelis.</p>\n<p>Seven in 10 Republicans, however, told Gallup that they sympathize with the Israelis, while 13 percent say they sympathize with the Palestinians.</p>\n<p>The poll comes just over a week after President Trump held the first <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5746010-trump-board-of-peace-takeaways/\">“Board of Peace” meeting</a> with other world leaders tasked with overseeing the reconstruction of Gaza following two years of war. The board is the next step in Trump’s 20-point peace plan amid the fragile ceasefire, which requires Hamas to demilitarize and eventually allow a new governing body to lead the Gaza Strip. </p>\n<p>“We will make Gaza very successful and safe and we are also going to maybe take it a step further, where we see hotspots around the world, we could probably do that very easily,” Trump said at the meeting.</p>\n<p>The U.S. gave Hamas a 60-day period to disarm, Israeli Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs said last week. He warned that Israel will restart the war if Hamas does not meet the deadline.</p>\n<p>The Gallup survey was conducted Sept. 2-16 and included 1,001 respondents. The margin of error is 4 percentage points.</p>",

Most of the cheap cuts of meat are very inexpensive,” Kennedy said at an event hosted by MAHA Action, a political action committee dedicated to supporting the “Make America Healthy Again” agenda.</p>\n<p>“If you buy, you know, a porterhouse steak, it’s going to, it is going to take you back.

The Pentagon told The Hill it had nothing further to provide. </p>\n<p>Trump’s announcement came as the DOD delivered its last and final offer to Anthropic Wednesday night, requesting that the company allow the department to access its AI model, Claude, for “all lawful purposes.”  </p>\n<p>Anthropic <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5758006-anthropic-pentagon-ai-talks-stall/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">s</a>aid Thursday that <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5758006-anthropic-pentagon-ai-talks-stall/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“virtually no progress”</a> had been made in discussions with the Pentagon over the terms of use of the model. The company’s CEO Dario Amodei noted in a separate statement that they could not “in good conscience accede” to the DOD’s terms.   </p>\n<p>“New language framed as compromise was paired with legalese that would allow those safeguards to be disregarded at will,” an Anthropic spokesperson told The Hill on Thursday. “Despite DOW’s recent public statements, these narrow safeguards have been the crux of our negotiations for months.” </p>\n<p>Anthropic is one of several companies that inked a $200 million contract with the Pentagon last summer, a deal that is now in jeopardy as the company’s usage policy prevents Claude from being utilized for fully autonomous lethal weapons or mass domestic surveillance of Americans.

            "title": "Iran: US must drop 'excessive demands' in nuclear talks",
            "description": "<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Friday said the U.S. needs to drop its “excessive demands” while the two countries hold talks regarding Iran’s nuclear program, as President Trump <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5759142-trump-iran-strike-decision/\">considers military action</a> if a deal is not reached.</p>\n<p>Araghchi made the remark during a phone conversation with his Egyptian counterpart Badr Abdel Ati, the <a href=\"https://www.isna.ir/news/1404120804587/%DA%AF%D9%81%D8%AA-%D9%88%DA%AF%D9%88%DB%8C-%D9%88%D8%B2%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%87-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%88-%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87-%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%84-%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B7%D9%82%D9%87-%D9%88-%D9%85%D8%B0%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA\">ISNA</a> news agency reported. He said the path toward a deal “requires seriousness and realism on the part of the other side and avoidance of any miscalculation and excessive demands.”</p>\n<p>Iran’s top diplomat did not elaborate on what those “demands” were.</p>\n<p>“[Talks on Thursday] concluded with the mutual understanding that we will continue to engage in a more detailed manner on matters that are essential to any deal –– including sanctions termination and nuclear-related steps,” the diplomat added.</p>\n<p>Araghchi noted that more negotiations will be held parallel to meetings between technical teams in Vienna, Austria, in the coming days.</p>\n<p>Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi on Thursday said talks between the U.S. and Iran showed “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5757110-us-iran-talks-oman-complete/\">significant progress</a>.” </p>\n<p>The negotiations follow rising tensions between the two countries, with Trump on Tuesday accusing Iran of rebuilding its nuclear program despite the U.S. having “obliterated,” in Trump’s words, the program after U.S. strikes in June.</p>\n<p>The president withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran during his first term. Iran hawks in the U.S. claimed the nuclear deal stripped restrictions on the program, allowing for uranium enrichment. Iran has defended its nuclear program and argued that it is for peaceful purposes.</p>\n<p>Trump threatened military action against Iran last month after thousands of anti-government protesters were killed. He’s called for a change in Iran’s leadership and said he is considering a “limited strike.” Last week, Trump gave the Iranians a 10-day timeline to come back to the negotiating table with a deal, otherwise there will be an “unfortunate outcome.”</p>\n<p>That timeline is set to end on Sunday.</p>\n<p>The president has also amassed a naval presence off Iran’s coast as the Middle Eastern country carries out military drill exercises, including some with Russian troops. Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that U.S. warships will sink if the strikes hit his country. </p>\n<p>Trump and Vice President Vance have both said they prefer to see a diplomatic solution. Vance told <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2026/02/26/vance-no-chance-us-will-be-drawn-out-war-middle-east/\">The Washington Post</a> in an interview on Thursday that there’s “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5758310-vance-defends-iran-strikes/\">no chance</a>” that any U.S. action on Iran would lead to a longer conflict akin to the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. </p>\n<p>“I do think we have to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past,” Vance said. “I also think that we have to avoid overlearning the lessons of the past. Just because one president screwed up a military conflict doesn’t mean we can never engage in military conflict again. We’ve got to be careful about it, but I think the president is being careful.”</p>",
