But we’re going to do some testing, yeah,” Trump said on Air Force One. “Other countries do it. If they’re going to do it, we’re going to do it. I’m not going to say here.” </p>\n\n<p>On Wednesday, Trump directed the Pentagon to immediately begin testing U.S. nuclear weapons on an equal basis to China and Russia.  </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” the president wrote in a Truth Social post. “This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice! Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.” </p>\n<p>The announcement came less than hour before his highly anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea on trade. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Trump initially ignored a question from a reporter on the announcement during his meeting with Xi, but told reporters after that the news “had to do with others” when asked whether it had to do with Xi. </p>\n<p>“They seem to all be nuclear testing. We have more nuclear weapons than anybody,” the president said.</p>\n<p>“We don’t do testing, and we halted it many years ago, but with others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also,” he continued. </p>\n\n<p>North Korea is the only country that has carried out nuclear testing since the 1990s. Russia has been testing nuclear-capable weapons tests, which does not include setting off actual bombs. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been testing missiles capable of having nuclear war heads as recently as this week.</p>\n</div>",

Earlier this year, the Pentagon <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5543528-journalists-pentagon-press-policy/\">made most of its hallways off-limits</a> to journalists without an official government escort, a departure from previous hard pass policies.</p>\n\n<p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth then demanded that reporters agree to a new policy under which they would need to pledge to not obtain or use any unauthorized material, even if the information is unclassified — or hand over their press badges in the next 24 hours. Dozens of news outlets <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5554402-pentagon-press-access-outlets-reject-policy/\">rejected the policy</a>.</p>\n</div>",

He called for an investigation into Andrew and said the former prince “needs to be behind bars.”</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Giuffre’s sister-in-law, Amanda Roberts, told the BBC that she “broke down” when she heard the news.</p>\n<p>“Everything she fought for was not in vain,” she added. </p>\n<p>Charles stripped Andrew of his titles on Thursday. In a statement from Buckingham Palace, it was announced that Andrew will move from his Royal Lodge residence in Windsor into a “private accommodation.”</p>\n\n<p>“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegation against him,” the statement continued. “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain, with the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”</p>\n<p>Reps. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5582296-ro-khanna-prince-andrew-epstein/\">both praised</a> the king’s actions. They both filed a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5482096-massie-discharge-petition-epstein/\">discharge petition</a> in September for a bill that would require the Justice Department to publicly disclose all files and information related to Epstein.</p>\n<p>The petition requires 218 signatures to force a House floor vote on that bill. Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva (D-Ariz.) has said she would be the consequential final signee of the petition, but Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5576140-adelita-grijalva-mo-brooks-delay-swear-in-house-gop/\">has yet to swear her in</a>. Johnson sides with President Trump, who has been accused of being associated with Epstein, in opposing the bill, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5565354-mike-johnson-epstein-investigation/\">previously calling it</a> “totally superfluous.” Trump has denied the allegations, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5483932-trump-epstein-files-democrat-hoax/\">referring to</a> the bipartisan push to release the Epstein files a ‘Democrat hoax.’</p>\n<p><strong>“</strong>The U.S. government hold the key to the larger scope of the Jeffrey Epstein case,” Roberts told the BBC. “The U.K. is setting an example for what the U.S. should be doing right now.”</p>\n\n</div>",
