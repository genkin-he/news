Ron Wyden (Ore.), the lead Democratic sponsor of the resolution, said that Trump’s tariffs have increased costs for ordinary Americans.</p>\n<p>“American families are being squeezed by prices going up and up and up.

Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) fired back on Thursday after Vice President Vance defended President Trump for repeatedly targeting the independent-minded congressman and backing a challenger to his reelection bid.</p>\n<p>“When leaders of my own party protect sex traffickers, spend our grandkids into oblivion, fund endless wars, lockdown our citizens, bailout corporations, bow to other countries, and hurt small farmers…,” Massie wrote early Thursday <a href=\"https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1983808712876622098\">on the social platform X</a>, appearing to address the vice president’s remarks.</p>\n\n<p>“…it’s true that I won’t be their yes man,” he continued.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Vance addressed <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5580394-vance-college-students-turning-point-usa-event/\">thousands of students</a> at the University of Mississippi on Wednesday as part of a Turning Point USA (TPUSA) tour. Vance fielded numerous questions from attendees, in a nod to the late TPUSA co-founder Charlie Kirk, who held similar “Prove Me Wrong” events on college campuses.</p>\n<p>The final question of the event addressed Trump’s primary endorsement against Massie, who has bucked his party on numerous issues, including calling for the release of the full Jeffrey Epstein files and voting against Trump’s signature tax and spending bill earlier this year.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The student noted the endorsement and asked: “How would you address those who fear that principled disagreement or independent thinking is discouraged within the party because of how it can be framed as a betrayal, instead of as internal accountability or an opportunity for debate and negotiation?”</p>\n<p>Vance thanked the student for her question, responding “this one is hard for me” because of his extensive relationship with Massie. He said Massie was one of the first people to reach out to him about running for political office, and the vice president said he tried to return the favor, when Massie’s wife died in recent years.</p>\n<p>“She died very unexpectedly, was a very sweet and kind woman, and I was probably one of the first people that called Thomas to offer my condolences,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, Vance said, Massie has bucked the party on so many high-profile issues that the party can no longer rely on him.</p>\n<p>“Being independent, having your own opinions, is one thing,” Vance said. “Voting against the party on every single issue — you’re eventually going to make too many enemies, and that is the problem that Thomas has had.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not one issue. It’s not three or four issues. It’s that every time that we’ve needed Thomas for a vote, he has been completely unwilling to provide it,” he continued.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Vance defended the president, saying loyalty in politics is a two-way street.</p>\n<p>“That is why the President United States has trained his ire on Thomas Massie. It’s because we can never count on him for some of the most difficult votes,” Vance said. “I wish that that weren’t the case. I say that as somebody who’s known Thomas well before I got into politics.”</p>\n<p>“But politics is politics,” he continued, “and when you always vote against the party, you can’t expect the party to actually back you. That’s the reality.”</p>\n\n</div>",

On Oct. 22 and into the following day, Russian missiles and drones hit cities from Kharkiv to Odesa, <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-war-chemical-plant-kyiv/33566126.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">killing at least seven people</a>, including children, and leaving millions without electricity.</p>\n<p>Ukraine’s military had earlier claimed a successful <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/ukrainian-military-says-it-struck-chemical-plant-southern-russias-bryansk-region-2025-10-21/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">strike on a gunpowder plant</a> deep inside Russia, using long-range Franco-British Storm Shadow missiles. The attack was hailed by some as a tactical success, but the response was devastating.</p>\n\n<p>These exchanges are becoming painfully routine. Each “reprisal” triggers another. Each round of strikes pushes the boundaries of escalation. This latest episode coincided with the <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/22/why-planned-trump-putin-talks-collapsed-and-what-it-means-for-ukraine\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">collapse of proposed U.S.-Russia ceasefire talks in Budapest</a>. Negotiations fell apart over irreconcilable demands, and with them went another flicker of hope for ending a war that has already claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and displaced millions more.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>It is now clear that this conflict has become a proxy war in all but name. The United States and its allies continue to pour weapons into Ukraine — Javelins, HIMARS, ATACMS — while promising that these will hasten peace. Instead, the result has been a prolonged stalemate that destroys cities, drains economies, and entrenches divisions. The moral cost is unbearable. I have spoken to Ukrainian families resettled in American cities who still scroll through messages from relatives hiding in basements. A father in Chicago described how his daughter’s school in Zaporizhzhia was leveled by a drone strike. “We have nothing left to rebuild,” he said quietly.</p>\n<p>What these stories reveal is that the suffering endures far beyond the battlefields. More than a million Ukrainians have been displaced again this year alone. Homes are gone, hospitals crippled, and energy systems shattered. Yet the flow of arms continues, as if this were the only language Washington knows how to speak. America’s military-first reflex is not a strategy; it is a habit.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>The U.S. spends more on defense than <a href=\"https://www.pgpf.org/article/chart-pack-defense-spending/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the next nine countries combined</a>. Much of that goes to sustain global commitments that yield little long-term stability. The Pentagon’s vast budget fuels the illusion that every geopolitical problem can be solved with a missile or a military base. But each dollar spent on weapons is one not spent on domestic renewal — on rebuilding bridges, improving health care, or tackling climate resilience at home.</p>\n<p>In Ukraine’s case, that habit has translated into a war without an endgame. Every new shipment of advanced weaponry raises expectations of victory and invites Russian retaliation. The strike in Bryansk, followed by Moscow’s barrage of 405 drones and 28 missiles, showed just how swiftly escalation cycles spin out of control. Russian nuclear drills this week sent another ominous signal. The human cost of this spiral is staggering. In Kharkiv, emergency workers pulled bodies from the rubble. In Odesa, power cuts shut down hospital wards mid-operation.</p>\n<p>This is not strategy — it is endurance testing, financed by American taxpayers.</p>\n\n<p>There are alternatives. If even a fraction of U.S. defense spending were redirected toward diplomacy and reconstruction, it could create the framework for peace. That means funding humanitarian corridors, empowering neutral mediators, and backing UN-led negotiations that involve major regional players like China and India. True diplomacy doesn’t require surrender; it requires realism. It means accepting that no side will achieve absolute victory and that compromise, however distasteful, is the only path to stability.</p>\n<p>Recent history supports this. Détente during the Cold War showed that engagement, not escalation, can ease tensions between nuclear rivals. Restraint is not weakness — it’s wisdom learned from experience. Yet in Washington, political courage is often measured by how many weapons one can authorize, not how many lives one can save.</p>\n<p>Critics argue that dialing back arms shipments would embolden Moscow. But what, exactly, has the current strategy achieved? Russia’s war machine continues to grind on despite unprecedented sanctions. Ukraine, though resilient, is exhausted. Europe faces energy strains and rising costs. The Global South sees Western double standards laid bare: calls for rules-based order ring hollow when paired with selective intervention.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Instead of perpetuating this destructive loop, the U.S. could lead in rebuilding. It could focus on helping Ukraine become energy independent, supporting its agriculture, and preventing food insecurity that spills across borders. That form of leadership would restore credibility to American diplomacy. It would also recognize that security built on cooperation is more durable than security built on arms.</p>\n<p>The global consequences of this war are already immense. Energy prices are climbing again, inflation is squeezing developing economies, and the refugee crisis is straining Europe’s social fabric. The specter of nuclear escalation remains ever-present. These are not distant problems. They shape markets, elections, and the world our children will inherit.</p>\n<p>As winter closes in, blackouts and shortages will make life in Ukraine even harsher. Families will huddle in freezing apartments, lit by candlelight, waiting for the next air raid. The moral question facing Washington is simple: will the United States continue to bankroll destruction, or will it invest in peace?</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n\n<p>America has the power to shift the trajectory. Reducing foreign arms sales, even modestly, could free up billions for diplomacy, climate adaptation and poverty reduction. Supporting dialogue, however fragile, could open doors that missiles can never unlock.</p>\n<p>This war’s latest strikes are not victories to be celebrated. They are tragedies to be mourned. Every explosion is a reminder that endless militarism is not strength but failure. The world doesn’t need another arms race; it needs a race for peace. The United States, with all its influence and resources, still has a choice: continue feeding the cycle of violence or lead the way toward restraint and renewal. It is time to stop treating war as destiny and start treating peace as policy.</p>\n<p><em>Imran Khalid is a physician and has a master’s degree in international relations.</em></p>\n</div>",

It is a grim ritual now, each tragedy blending into the next until even horror feels routine. </p>\n<p>No country on earth bleeds like the U.S. No nation so wealthy, so wired, and so watched has grown so numb to slaughter. Schools, malls, churches, cinemas — each new massacre arrives like bad weather. Flags lower, candles burn and then life resumes. Until the next mass shooting occurs.</p>\n\n<p>Each time, the same arguments are raised. Some blame guns, others entertainment; some point to politics, others to parents. Yet the question that truly matters is rarely ever asked. Why, after seeing so much suffering, do so many still pick up guns and inflict more?</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Every society has angry and alienated people. Only one turns alienation into annihilation with such frequency. America now <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2831132#:~:text=Mass%20shootings%E2%80%94incidents%20where%204,to%20the%20Gun%20Violence%20Archive.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">averages over 500 mass shootings a year</a> — more than one every single day. The difference isn’t merely access to weapons; it’s access to meaning. </p>\n<p>In a country founded on freedom, too many have forgotten what freedom is for. Liberty has been twisted into license, individuality into isolation. The lonely man with a rifle isn’t born a monster. He becomes one, slowly and silently, while the rest of the world scrolls past.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Politicians reach for convenient villains. Conservatives blame fatherlessness, liberals blame firearms. Pundits rail about rhetoric, culture and moral decay. But the real sickness runs deeper. The malady isn’t in screens but in souls. The United States has cultivated a culture that prizes attention over empathy, fame over purpose, grievance over grace. The modern gunman doesn’t seek anonymity but immortality. He has learned that, in the land of viral violence, even murder guarantees an audience.</p>\n<p>Guns are the instrument, not the impulse. The impulse is despair. What was once a nation of builders has become a shoddy patchwork of spectators. The town square has been digitized, drained of life, and controlled by the algorithm. Millions live surrounded by constant noise yet starved of connection. For a few, the gun becomes a merciless megaphone, a way to make the world hear what it ignored.</p>\n<p>To reduce the carnage, the country must rebuild what isolation destroyed. That means restoring belonging as much as tightening laws. Conservatives are right that fathers matter; liberals are right that easy access to assault weapons amplifies catastrophe. Both truths stand. But legislation alone will not heal a culture where despair metastasizes faster than hope. What’s needed is more mentors, not more metal detectors. Communities must learn to listen before they punish. Schools must treat warning signs as pleas, not paperwork.</p>\n\n<p>Practical steps still matter. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/23/red-flag-laws-gun-control\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Red-flag laws</a>, when balanced with due process, save lives. Universal background checks are not tyranny but common sense. Gun ownership should carry the weight of duty, not just the thrill of entitlement. The Second Amendment was written for a very specific reason. Responsibility must again become the companion of freedom.</p>\n<p>Yet reform must reach the culture, not only the code of law. Violence is glorified, commodified, and endlessly recycled. The same society that censors books sells bullets by the box. Music, films, and news alike turn killing into entertainment, then wonder why empathy has eroded. This is not an argument for censorship but for conscience. Art shapes appetite. When cruelty becomes content, compassion vanishes.</p>\n<p>Real prevention begins long before the first shot. It begins when boys are taught that rejection is not ruin and strength is not savagery. It begins in homes where anger is confronted, not buried. It begins in communities that treat mental health as responsibility, not weakness. The path from resentment to massacre is rarely sudden. It is slow, visible and routinely ignored.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>The conversation around guns, like everything else in American life, has become tribal. Each shooting hardens the divide. One side chants “ban guns,” the other “protect rights.” Lost in the shouting are the victims, and the slow-burning despair that breeds the next killer. This is not a partisan plague but a national crisis. The goal should not be confiscation or control, but preservation. Specifically, the preservation of life, liberty, and the quiet dignity that once made both possible.</p>\n<p>The gunman is not born in a vacuum. He is shaped by neglect. He is fueled by nihilism and a culture that confuses notoriety with meaning. To stop him, America must rebuild the meaning. It must make belonging easier to find than revenge.</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>I must make myself very clear. The answer doesn’t lie in limiting freedom, but in strengthening the foundations that make freedom humane: family, faith, responsibility, and restraint.

Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) said she is “seriously weighing” a bit for the U.S. Senate in Texas, and has taken significant steps to bring her closer to a decision.</p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/30/crockett-texas-senate-run-00628699\">interview</a> this week with Politico’s Dasha Burns on “The Conservation” podcast, Crockett said she is investing heavily in polling and has already met multiple times with a prospective campaign manager.</p>\n\n<p>“I am seriously weighing it, to the extent that I’m about to spend a lot of money to get data,” Crockett said, when asked how close she is to making a decision about a potential Senate bid.</p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"mobile\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>“I’m a data-driven person. I will tell you that I personally believe that Texas needs to do something different if they want a different result. That’s just the bottom line,” she continued.</p>\n<p>A crowded field of Democrats have entered a primary for their party’s Senate bid in 2026. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) is up for reelection, but he faces a competitive primary challenge from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, as well as Rep. Wesley Hunt. </p>\n<p>If Paxton wins the primary, a number of Democrats and Republicans alike think there could be an even stronger chance for a Democrat to win the state. No Democrat has been elected to the Senate from Texas since 1988.</p>\n<p>Paxton had been leading early polling, but recent surveys suggest Cornyn <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5489379-paxton-cornyn-poll-analysis/\">has closed the gap</a> and the two Republicans <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5547777-cornyn-paxton-hunt-runoff/\">appear virtually tied</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Crockett said her decision will be based not only on polling data against fellow Democrats but also looking ahead to the general election race.</p>\n<p>She suggested a race against Cornyn <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5575242-rove-cautions-republicans-paxton-cornyn/\">could be unwinnable</a>.</p>\n<p>“Obviously, we are weighing who may be the nominee on the Republican side,” she said. “I’m going to be flat out with you and tell you that I don’t think that there’s a Democrat that can take out Cornyn. And I think NRSC [National Republican Senatorial Committee] knows that, which is why they are spending so much money in this primary to make sure that he is the nominee.”</p>\n<p>“But for me, I would be making a very last-minute decision, because it’s not just about winning the primary. You got to win the general.”</p>\n</div>",

You actually won’t receive any payment in November, for that matter — but have no fear, you’ll still get your intended funds.</p>\n\n<div class=\"nlp-ignore-block article-content rich-text\">\n<aside class=\"promo-link\">\n<a class=\"promo-link__link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/business/5571309-social-security-cola-2026/?ipid=promo-link-block1\" target='\"_blank\"'>\n\t\tSocial Security Administration announces COLA increase\t</a>\n</aside>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/ssi\">SSI</a> beneficiaries include those with disabilities and older adults with little to no income.

(The others were March, June, and September.) This is because November starts on a Saturday. Should the first day of any month land on a weekend or a holiday, the Social Security Administration will send out that month’s payment on the prior business day.</p>\n<p>In the case of November, SSI payments will be sent out on Friday, October 31. </p>\n<div class=\"nexstar-minutemedia-player-container\" data-minutemedia-viewport=\"desktop\" data-player-id=\"k036p9v5\" data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"\" hidden=\"\"></div>\n<p>During some of the months that start on a weekend or holiday, SSI beneficiaries do still receive a check, albeit for the following month. For example, February’s SSI payment went out on January 31 because February 1 fell on a Saturday.

December 1 is on a Monday, meaning the month’s SSI payment will not be impacted. On December 31, beneficiaries will receive January 2026’s payment, since New Year’s Day is considered a holiday.</p>\n<p>Other Social Security payments scheduled for November are scheduled to be sent out as usual: </p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>November 3: Benefits for those who receive Social Security before May 1997, or for beneficiaries who receive Social Security and SSI</li>\n<li>November 12: Benefits if your birth date is between the 1st and 10th</li>\n<li>November 19: Benefits if your birth date is between the 11th and 20th</li>\n<li>November 26: Benefits if your birth date is between the 21st and 31st</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regardless of when SSI payments are disbursed, beneficiaries will receive all of their anticipated funds.
