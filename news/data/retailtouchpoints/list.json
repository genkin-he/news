What used to be distinct calendar moments have collapsed into one long promotional stretch. Halloween now kicks off in July, with Spirit Halloween pop-ups quick to follow. Holiday campaigns begin creeping in by September. Prime Day has stretched into a record four-day event: U.S. consumers spent <a href=\"https://business.adobe.com/blog/prime-day-event-drove-24-billion-in-online-spend-across-us-retailers\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$24.1 billion</a> online from July 8 to 11, 2025, marking a 30.3% year-over-year increase. However, that average daily spending was lower than in previous years, indicating that extending Prime Day may have diluted urgency and fatigued shoppers.</p>\n<p>Retailers may be creating more moments, but the experience for shoppers is anything but magical. Instead of sparking excitement, this constant drumbeat of promotions leaves many feeling overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>The good news is that retailers already have many of the tools they need to close this gap. The challenge now is aligning teams internally and using the right data to guide marketing execution more effectively.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Disconnected Signals</strong></h3>\n<p>At the center of this challenge is a disconnect between commerce planning and marketing execution. Commerce teams have learned to move fast in response to pandemic-era disruptions and ongoing supply chain volatility. That reactive model, once a necessity, has now become the default approach even as conditions have stabilized.</p>\n<p>Marketing, however, hasn’t kept pace. Many teams still rely on fixed campaign calendars and broad messaging that fail to reflect how or when people shop. Commerce teams now respond in real time across ecommerce, in-store and social channels, while marketing remains locked in a playbook built for predictability.</p>\n<p>Consider back-to-school season, when <a href=\"https://www.retailbrew.com/stories/2025/07/17/back-to-school-shopping-started-early-this-year-nrf-survey\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">67% of families</a> began their school shopping by early July, the highest early start since 2018. Many consumers are trying to get ahead of inflation and potential price hikes, but brands continue to push out national campaigns that do not reflect regional differences or changing behaviors. This disconnect, sending the same message everywhere at once, erodes shopper trust and wastes engagement opportunities.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Rethinking the Playbook</strong></h3>\n<p>To fix this, retailers must move from problem to practice. Aligning marketing with commerce planning is key. Commerce teams already make informed decisions based on regional buying patterns, inventory and emerging consumer trends. Marketing should be guided by those same signals to ensure messaging lands at the right time and place.</p>\n<p>This does not require new technology. Marketers need to use the data they already have, including geographic insights, past purchase behavior and inventory levels, to inform messaging decisions. The goal is not just personalization; it is clear, relevant communication that reflects real consumer behavior.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Making Marketing Work for Commerce</strong></h3>\n<p>A commerce-aligned marketing approach recognizes that shopping timelines vary widely. Some households are ready for Halloween décor while others still favor summer essentials like sunscreen and pool gear. Some are in back-to-school mode, while others will not need school supplies for weeks. These insights exist but remain mostly untapped.</p>\n<p>The answer is not more campaigns; it’s smarter ones, grounded in commerce strategy and real consumer behavior. Marketing should engage when shoppers are ready, not just when retailers are ready to sell.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>From Alignment to Impact</strong></h3>\n<p>Looking ahead, success means breaking down silos. Marketing and commerce must act as partners, not separate functions. The data is there; the alignment is not.</p>\n<p>Retailers that reconnect these teams will not just optimize campaigns; they will create better experiences. They will match the right product with the right message at the right time, a realistic goal that starts with internal collaboration and a shared understanding of consumer journeys.</p>\n<p>Marketing aligned with commerce strategy is no longer optional — it is essential. In a fragmented marketplace where consumer attention is fleeting, retailers that align thoughtfully will gain more than short-term sales. They will earn lasting consumer trust.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p><em>David MacDonald is EVP, Head of Retail and Commerce Practice at </em><a href=\"https://www.razorfish.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Razorfish</em></a><em>.

These include the new <a href=\"https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/features/news-briefs/jcpenney-celebrates-inclusivity-with-new-fashion-line-exclusively-for-plus-size-women\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ashley Graham</a> apparel collection exclusively for plus-size women that was introduced earlier this month, which features prices starting at <strong>$40</strong>.</p>\n<p>JCPenney also highlighted value when it contrasted the estimated <strong>$55 million</strong> that Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez spent on their Venice, Italy wedding with one held in <a href=\"https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/retail-innovation/jcpenney-upstages-bezos-with-10000-wedding-in-venice-california\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Venice, Calif.</a> for just <strong>$10,000. </strong>The retailer footed the bill for the less expensive ceremony, including just <strong>$99</strong> for the bride’s gown.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Fashion Collaboration with iHeart Radio Jingle Ball</strong></h3>\n<p>JCPenney’s holiday campaign also includes the debut of a first-ever official iHeart Radio Jingle Ball fashion lineup, created with <a href=\"https://www.iheart.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">iHeart Radio</a>’s holiday concert series. The <strong>29</strong>-piece collection, available only at JCPenney online and in select stores for a limited time, includes sequined tops, faux leather skirts, fur jackets and other types of holiday “glam” at moderate price points.</p>\n<p>Additionally, through December, JCPenney shoppers can participate in a “receipt-to-access” sweepstakes to score tickets to the iHeartRadio Z100 Jingle Ball in New York.

Each week from Nov. 3 to Nov. 28, customers are invited to share their favorite shots based on weekly themes, such as matching pajamas or retro poses, for a chance to win prizes including a free holiday family session with a digital photo album at JCPenney Portrait Studio or a <strong>$500</strong> JCPenney gift card.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Multiple Savings Opportunities Throughout the Season</strong></h3>\n<p>The retailer is bringing back its Black Friday Early Access promotion on Nov. 8, featuring an exclusive Golden Tote gift, which includes a Season of Savings coupon book offering <strong>eight</strong> weeks of savings, with the purchase of <strong>$25</strong> or more.</p>\n<p>Daily Deals begin Nov. 10, with JCPenney releasing a new set of offers, good for only <strong>24</strong> hours, from Monday through Thursday each week through Nov. 20. On Black Friday itself, in-store shoppers can win surprise offers at 5 a.m., 9 a.m., 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., including the opportunity to snag the JCPenney exclusive Snoopy Snow Globe for free.</p>\n</div>",

But what if they had a strategy that doesn’t just sell products, but builds trust, urgency and conversion in one seamless motion? The answer is live shopping. By tapping influencers, retailers are turning social media into the next wave of performance marketing, and they’re using the affiliate infrastructure to do so.</p>\n<p>Consumers trust creators to meet them where they are, in real time. <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/2025-trend-creator-commerce-reshape-retail--social-media\">71%</a><a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/2025-trend-creator-commerce-reshape-retail--social-media\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> of U.S. shoppers</a> purchased a creator-founded product last year, and <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">56% of social media users</a> say they’ll maintain their current level of social purchases through year’s end — even amid economic uncertainty and the on-again, off-again TikTok ban. The underlying principles of affiliate, performance-based compensation, trusted recommendation and scale, are more relevant than ever. What’s changing is <em>how</em> that value is activated.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a></a><strong>From China’s Playbook to U.S. Storefronts</strong></h3>\n<p>Live shopping, which took root in China, has become a mainstream retail channel. By 2026, it’s projected to reach <a href=\"https://voltage-x.com/zh/live-commerce-the-next-stage-for-e-commerce/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">¥8.16 trillion </a>($1.2 trillion), up from ¥5.86 trillion in 2024. As of mid-2023, <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/live-commerce-2023?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">600 million Chinese consumers </a>regularly tuned into shoppable live streams.</p>\n<p>The format’s power lies in its conversion rates. Traditional ecommerce converts <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/blog/ecommerce-conversion-rate?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2% to 3% of browsers</a> into buyers. Live commerce achieves 9% to 30%. In beauty and fashion, it can reach 70% during peak events. Taobao Live alone generates more than <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9213714/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$3 billion </a>in daily sales.</p>\n<p>The U.S. is catching up quickly. Live shopping already represents <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://influencermarketinghub.com/live-streaming-stats/?utm_source%3Dchatgpt.com&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1755729084253148&amp;usg=AOvVaw27xj6S9TmAaVByLaJByzNG\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">18% of online purchases</a>. In the U.S.,<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1276120/livestream-e-commerce-sales-united-states/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> sales are projected to grow to $68 billion by 2026</a>. Platforms such as Ebay, Poshmark and TikTok have built live commerce directly into their ecosystems, making it accessible to mass audiences.</p>\n<p>Retailers also are experimenting on their own turf. Walmart has hosted shoppable livestreams on TikTok and YouTube. Amazon continues to expand Amazon Live, featuring curated gift guides and daily deal streams. Nordstrom and Macy’s have piloted live events with stylists and influencers, blending entertainment with conversion-focused retail.</p>\n<p>Globally, sales reached <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1276120/livestream-e-commerce-sales-united-states/\">$682</a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1276120/livestream-e-commerce-sales-united-states/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> billion in 2023</a> and are forecast to triple by 2030. The appeal is clear: live shopping combines entertainment, urgency and trust. Shoppers can ask questions, watch real-time demonstrations and purchase instantly, mirroring the in-store experience but with the convenience of online access.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a></a><strong>Creator and Affiliate Gets a Glow-Up</strong></h3>\n<p>In tandem, affiliate marketing continues to demonstrate its enduring significance as a powerful sales and marketing strategy. In the U.S.:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Creator and affiliate performance marketing accounts for a substantial <a href=\"https://www.demandsage.com/affiliate-marketing-statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">16% of all ecommerce orders</a>, underscoring its effectiveness in driving conversions and expanding market reach. <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/affiliate-marketing-statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Over 80% of advertisers </a>actively utilize affiliate marketing in their promotional efforts. This indicates a high level of trust and reliance on a network of partners to promote products in exchange for a commission.</li>\n<li>Global spend on affiliate marketing is projected to surpass <a href=\"https://www.publift.com/blog/affiliate-marketing-statistics?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$31 billion by 2031</a>, signifying sustained confidence in its ability to deliver measurable returns.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Affiliate models, which compensate creators and influencers for driving sales through tracked links or codes, are a natural fit for live shopping. The ecosystem now includes various types of affiliates, such as content creators, coupon sites, review sites and loyalty programs, each playing a crucial role in directing qualified traffic and generating sales for advertisers. As these landscapes evolve, retailers need infrastructure that unifies affiliate and app performance, connects network data to in-app journeys and enables creators to be compensated not just for traffic but for revenue.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why TikTok’s Ahead of the Pack</strong></h3>\n<p>Most third-party platforms and social apps struggle with enabling seamless checkout at scale. Off-site redirects, inconsistent deep linking, clunky payment processing and inaccurate attribution often lead to a drop in conversion and misaligned budgets — a hurdle TikTok has begun to overcome. Though TikTok treats these as transactions and not typical affiliate link‑based commissions, the seller still pays a commission, mirroring the affiliate model’s core: pay for performance. TikTok is teaching the market what works.</p>\n<p>Although TikTok’s checkout model differs <em>technically</em>, the overall experience captures the founding principle of affiliate marketing: people (creators/hosts) are rewarded for sales they drive. This performance-driven approach seamlessly aligns with how TikTok engages users, turning passive scrolling into active discovery and purchases.</p>\n<p>TikTok’s live shopping experience represents a fundamental shift in how consumers discover and make purchases. Users aren’t actively searching for something specific to purchase when they’re scrolling through the platform; they, instead, discover new brands and products organically through engaging and entertaining content, personalized feeds and authentic creator recommendations. That’s what makes TikTok users stop scrolling and start interacting.</p>\n<p>And it works!</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://business.tiktokshop.com/us/seller\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">70% of users</a> say they discover new brands and products on the platform.</li>\n<li>Three in four users are likely to buy something while using TikTok.</li>\n<li>One in four users search <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tiktok.forbusiness/reel/DHq0rj6pAPx/?locale=pl\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">within the first 30 seconds</a> of opening the app.</li>\n<li>45% of users continue searching the app for more information after discovering something.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is because brands can showcase their products, personality and values on the platform while the community builds interest and trust among consumers. The influencers users follow are seen as real, genuine people who are knowledgeable experts, often using products in “real life” contexts. This leads to purchase intent — and sometimes even shortens the journey from discovery to impulse buys and conversion.</p>\n<p>As TikTok grows its live shopping model in the U.S., it represents the clearest case of how live commerce can embody affiliate mechanics at scale. What happens when Instagram, Amazon, and YouTube catch up?</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>From Impressions to Impact</strong></h3>\n<p>Advertising is undergoing a fundamental shift. The traditional metric of impressions is being replaced by performance-based models where influence is measured in revenue, not reach. Live shopping sits at the center of this evolution, transforming creators into persuasive sellers who can engage, educate and close sales in real time.</p>\n<p>For retailers, the holiday season is the perfect proving ground. Consumers are scrutinizing every dollar, so content must deliver value. Formats like “Top 10 Under $50” gift guides, product comparisons, tutorials and live Q&amp;As help shoppers feel confident. Pair that with affiliate attribution and frictionless checkout and live shopping becomes one of the most powerful holiday tools of the year.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Tipping Point is Here</strong></h3>\n<p>The U.S. live commerce market is projected to grow at <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/live-commerce-market-report?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">~37% compound annual growth rate </a>from 2025 to 2033. With creator-driven marketing embedded into Instagram, Amazon and YouTube, brands are shifting budgets from impressions to transactions.</p>\n<p>The logic is compelling: why pay for reach when you can pay for revenue? Live commerce, with affiliate mechanics at its core, solves both engagement and ROI in one motion.</p>\n<p>This isn’t a passing trend. It’s the next chapter of commerce, where performance is paramount and influence is monetized only when it converts. This holiday season will reward retailers that treat live commerce as a core revenue channel. Live shopping may be the most reliable helper of all.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p><em>Michael Jaconi is the Co-founder and CEO of </em><a href=\"https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usebutton.com%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cadam%40retailtouchpoints.com%7Cd15f78f8ad5e4637cc4b08de074929ca%7C661c8d9be19e4330b41275dce2d26154%7C0%7C0%7C638956208274425454%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C60000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=w6wCfcHDFpkttbYrAECu%2FnLrTPerkMC8ZKKnogqgXZo%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Button,</em></a><em> a mobile commerce platform that optimizes traffic for the worldʼs leading publishers, retailers and creators that depend on affiliate marketing. Button drives more than $1B in mobile commerce per month with a solution built with AI that is engineered to help Button customers generate more revenue.

Longtime advertising executive Ellis Verdi said he’s “net positive” on the campaign.</p>\n<p>“First of all, it’s very hard to stand out in a crowded environment, so they get points for that — they definitely stood out,” Verdi shares on this week’s episode of the <a href=\"https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/podcasts/legendary-adman-ellis-verdi-on-the-art-of-retail-advertising\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Retail Remix podcast</a>. “They also did associate the individual, the personality, with the product that they’re selling; [the choice of celebrity] wasn’t totally random. And it was selling product — it was talking about and showing their product.</p>\n<p>“By the way, showing product, talking about a product — but not using price — and getting a lot of people’s attention, in and of itself is a challenge. It’s just not an easy thing to do, and they did it,” Verdi added. “<strong>I have never done a piece of advertising that was strong or good that didn’t get some kind of reaction.</strong> In fact, I was a little unhappy if I <strong>didn’t</strong> get one. When you do something pretty good, you should expect it because [it means] there’s a certain amount of truth in what you’re doing.”</p>\n\n<p>Verdi, the Founder and President of agency <a href=\"https://www.devitoverdi.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>DeVito/Verdi</strong></a>, is no stranger to controversy. He launched his agency with the now infamous “straightjacket” ad for off-price retailer <strong>Daffy’s</strong> that was so controversial it sparked protests, and has since gone on to do work for <strong>Macy’s</strong>, <strong>Kohl’s</strong>, <strong>Men’s Wearhouse</strong>, <strong>Meijer</strong> and many others.</p>\n<p>His bottom line is that controversy isn’t bad if it comes from a place of honesty, and he thinks retail advertising has gone too far recently into down-funnel price-focused plays.

For example, in Staten Island, N.Y., BJ’s will donate <strong>$50,000</strong> to the Carl V. Bini Memorial Fund, named for an FDNY firefighter who lost his life on Sept. 11, 2001. The funds will be used to provide groceries, hygiene kits and free health screenings to more than <strong>2,000</strong> underserved residents.</p>\n<p>Shannon Ashton, Lead Recruiter at BJ’s, nominated the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Metro South in Taunton, Mass., where she serves as a volunteer.

Salesforce partnered with <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251014685702/en/Salesforce-Announces-Support-for-Agentic-Commerce-Protocol-in-Collaboration-with-Stripe\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">payment provider Stripe</a> to bring this integration to life through the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP), an open standard protocol designed to facilitate secure, tokenized and privacy-compliant transactions.</p>\n<p><em>Original story from Sept. 30, 2025 Begins-</em></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What ChatGPT’s ‘Instant Checkout’ Offering Means for Retailers</strong></h2>\n<p>U.S. consumers using OpenAI’s <strong>ChatGPT</strong> can now buy the items that their AI-powered search has led them to directly — without leaving their conversations. The checkout connection, dubbed Instant Checkout, is now live with <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Etsy</strong></a> and will be extended to the thousands of merchants on the <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Shopify</strong></a> platform in the near future.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright wp-image-154595 size-medium\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"600\" sizes=\"(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px\" src=\"https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-illustration-397x600.png\" srcset=\"https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-illustration-397x600.png 397w, https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-illustration.png 459w\" width=\"397\"/>“Shopping is changing fast. People are discovering products in AI conversations, not just through search or ads,” said Vanessa Lee, VP of Product at Shopify in a statement. “This will let our merchants show up naturally in those moments and give shoppers a way to buy without breaking their flow. It’s a really exciting shift for commerce.”</p>\n<p>Etsy Chief Product and Technology Officer Rafe Colburn explained how the process works in a <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/news/meeting-buyers-where-they-are-etsy-partners-with-openai-to-enable-ai-powered-shopping\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>: “When users enter a shopping-related query (like: “Help me find a ceramic plate set”), ChatGPT may show results from Etsy. From those results, users can click into the listing to learn more and even complete their purchase from Etsy via credit card, Apple or Google Pay, and other payment methods – all without leaving ChatGPT.”</p>\n<p>While sellers that use the Etsy and Shopify platforms will be auto-enrolled in the feature, other merchants can participate by applying manually, according to Josh Blyskal, who leads Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) strategy at the analytics firm Profound, in a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshua-blyskal_openai-just-launched-instant-checkout-i-activity-7378508559774351361-ocfl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios&amp;rcm=ACoAAAA713wBg4feZJ73VUlftThEvShjImLEzmM\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn post</a>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>With ChatGPT, Merchants Retain Data and Relationships</strong></h3>\n<p>OpenAI is emphasizing that even though ChatGPT leads the shopper to the item, the actual transaction remains the retailer’s. According to the ChatGPT website: “You remain the merchant of record, with full control over orders, payments, fulfillment, and customer relationships.” The platform also emphasized that product results in ChatGPT are ranked by relevance so that they can be discovered organically. <strong>Merchants pay a fee to ChatGPT if a sale occurs, and the fee is refunded if the item is returned.</strong></p>\n<p>The arrival of direct checkout within ChatGPT doesn’t come as a huge surprise — the <em>Financial Times</em> first reported in <a href=\"https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/digital-commerce/openai-shopify-reportedly-working-on-chatgpt-checkout-integration\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">July 2025</a> that Shopify and OpenAI were working on the integration, and it’s an obvious next step as ChatGPT and competitors like <a href=\"https://addepto.com/blog/perplexity-ai-search-diruptor-is-taking-a-big-swing-with-new-shopping-feature/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Perplexity</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/data-analytics/ai-machine-learning/google-aims-to-supercharge-shopping-with-generative-ai-enhanced-search\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Google’s Gemini</strong></a> have beefed up their commerce features. This week’s launch does, however, signal the beginning of a major movement toward a future when AI engines handle more and more of the online path to purchase.</p>\n<p>“[OpenAI’s Instant Checkout] feature still has some wrinkles to iron out, but embedding checkout for hundreds of millions of users could turn ChatGPT into a true commerce destination,” said Zak Stambor, a senior analyst at <em>Emarketer</em> in comments shared with <em>Retail TouchPoints. </em>“If OpenAI can streamline the experience, it could challenge <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>Google</strong> and carve out a lucrative new revenue stream.”</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sales are Great, but the Real Prize is the Data</strong></h3>\n<p>However, that prized data tracking how consumers search, and what leads them to a purchase, will now be even more readily available to OpenAI. While the <em>Financial Times</em>’ <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/449102a2-d270-4d68-8616-70bfbaf212de?utm_campaign=%5BREBRAND%5D+%5BTI-AM%5D+Th&amp;utm_content=1095&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=124'\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reporting</a> emphasized the revenue stream as a key reason for OpenAI to facilitate actual sales, it’s likely the data that’s collected will be equally if not more valuable.</p>\n<p>“OpenAI’s instant checkout is a natural progression of the technology,” said Martin Balaam, CEO of product information management solution provider <a href=\"https://pimberly.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pimberly</a> in comments provided to <em>Retail TouchPoints</em>: “Why send users off the platform to buy products when you can keep them engaged and monetize directly? We’ve seen this playbook before with <strong>Facebook</strong>, and it’s an effective way to accelerate revenue while <strong>capturing invaluable data on what people think about and what ultimately drives them to make a purchase, something even Google has struggled to fully get a handle on.</strong></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>AI as Gatekeeper, Shopping Guide…and Now Cashier?</strong></h3>\n<p>“From a loyalty perspective, most consumers have already chosen their go-to AI ‘buddy,’ so <strong>offering embedded transactions is both an extension of that relationship and a defensive move</strong>,” Balaam added. “If OpenAI doesn’t allow you to buy, you’ll go elsewhere, just like Google.”</p>\n<p>To be sure, Google and other popular AI search platforms are busily working on boosting their own commerce capabilities — and users are rapidly adopting these new tools. The latest <a href=\"https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/omnichannel-alignment/consumers-love-ai-search-and-in-store-shopping-and-retailers-need-to-deliver-both\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Future Consumer Index</em></a> from <a href=\"https://www.ey.com/en_gl\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">EY</a> found that <strong>82%</strong> of consumers say they now trust AI-generated product recommendations, and <strong>75%</strong> would trust AI to auto-refill their shopping carts and automate ordering and delivery. What’s more, <a href=\"https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/features/industry-insights/salesforce-global-holiday-forecast-ai-will-drive-1-6-trillion-in-in-store-sales\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Salesforce predicts</a> that during the 2025 holiday season, AI will drive <strong>$260 billion</strong> in global online sales as well as <strong>$1.6 trillion</strong> in in-store sales.</p>\n<p>“AI is serving as both gatekeeper and guide for the consumer,” said <a href=\"https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fmike-o-donnell-1034971b%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cnicole%40retailtouchpoints.com%7Ce23783a3109c488f53b408de003614cb%7C661c8d9be19e4330b41275dce2d26154%7C0%7C0%7C638948429436453157%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=SNpKSjgoc4yAc%2F0Wbs5LbP8DgOzkEvuU2qiRPM1knMQ%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mike O’Donnell</a>, SVP of Innovation and Business Transformation at digital services firm <a href=\"https://www.flywheeldigital.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Flywheel</a> in comments shared with <em>Retail TouchPoints</em>. “Those who don’t adapt run the risk of being cut out of key steps in the consumer journey. To succeed, brands must move to a proactive, audience-centric approach that balances traditional SEO [search engine optimization] with new GEO [generative engine optimization] strategies, ensuring <strong>products are visible and recommended by both search engines and AI.”</strong></p>\n<p>Adobe Digital Insights already noted this shift during the summer Prime Day sales period, when <strong>both AI-powered shopping interfaces and human creators had a significantly increased influence on Prime Day spend. </strong>While AI search and creator marketing may seem like two fundamentally different forces (one machine, the other human), Vivek Pandya, Director at Adobe Digital Insights, shared in a recent <a href=\"https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/consumer-trends/listen-now-what-24-billion-in-prime-day-spending-tells-us-about-h2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">episode of <em>Retail Remix</em></a> that what happened during Prime Day actually illustrates how interconnected the two are.</p>\n<p>AEO/GEO differs greatly from traditional SEO tactics, and in this new world, social media content like that generated by creators and publishers is crucially important in the race to be visible within these new AI search tools: “It’s really incumbent on brands and retailers to not to just make sure their own ecommerce storefronts are well optimized, but <strong>that they’re promoting their brand across different social networks, across the larger media ecosystem, </strong>so that when people are saying, ‘I want this type of product that has this type of feature,’ they’re being picked up [in AI searches] versus someone else,” Pandya said.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>",
