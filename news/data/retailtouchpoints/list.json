To put the scale of this issue into context, business activities in the EU generate an approximate <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20180328STO00751/sustainable-waste-management-what-the-eu-is-doing?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">166 million tonnes of waste</a> a year.</p>\n<p>These staggering numbers underscore the urgent need for retailers to actively contribute to building a more sustainable, circular economy. In today’s marketplace, embracing sustainable practices is no longer optional; it’s becoming a defining factor for business success in the new era of consumerism.</p>\n<p>For U.S. retailers, this means greater responsibility in ensuring the products they sell meet rising sustainability standards, while also offering an opportunity to lead the charge in shaping a greener marketplace.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it is not just consumers driving the shift toward sustainability; governments are also stepping in to accelerate change. Under initiatives like the EU’s <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/sustainable-products/ecodesign-sustainable-products-regulation_en\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation</a> (ESPR) and its recently published  <a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/document/download/5f7ff5e2-ebe9-4bd4-a139-db881bd6398f_en?filename=FAQ-UPDATE-4th-Iteration_clean.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Energy Labelling Working Plan</a>, new measures are being introduced to push businesses toward more circular practices.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The EU’s Eco-Movement: The ESPR</strong></h3>\n<p>Under the European Commission’s <a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/circular-economy_en\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Circular Economy Action Plan</a> (CEAP), the EU has introduced the ESPR — a significant shift that entered into force in summer 2024 and will apply to any U.S. enterprise placing covered product groups on the EU marketplace, regardless of where they are produced. The regulation underscores the EU’s push toward a more sustainable and resource-efficient future.</p>\n<p>In practice, the ESPR aims to make “sustainable products the norm” in the EU by driving circular business practices. That means products are expected to last longer, use energy and resources more efficiently, be easier to repair and recycle, contain fewer harmful substances and include more recycled content.</p>\n<p>The regulation applies to specified product groups across sectors such as textiles and electronics, requiring businesses and retailers to implement Digital Product Passports (DPPs) for products that fall within these categories.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Retailers Need to Get Ready: The Working Plan Update</strong></h3>\n<p>Although the ESPR itself has now been around for over a year, the 2025 Working Plan update (published in April) officially listed the sectors due to be prioritized by the EU movement. As the Working Plan provides a timeline for the delegated acts — a set of requirements concerning each product group — to be announced, compliance urgency is increasing at speed for retailers across the board, with the textiles industry in particular being listed as an initial target product group. This comes just behind the steel sector, which is due to be the first to comply.</p>\n<p>This update in legislation, and its focus on the timeline for the delegated acts to be announced, serves as another reminder that the compliance clock is ticking for retailers worldwide that sell in the EU marketplace.</p>\n<p>Moreover, with the Working Plans horizontal requirements such as repairability scoring being highlighted (which could include consumer electronics), recycled content and recyclability of electronic equipment set to come into play from 2027 onwards, it is important to note that electronics retailers are also going to need to get ESPR ready imminently.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Integral Role of DPPs Amidst the EU’s Action Plan</strong></h3>\n<p>The integration of DPPs into a business’s ESPR compliance journey is going to prove essential for retailers aiming to tackle the EU’s eco-demands with success.</p>\n<p>Essentially acting as a digital record of a physical product, they can securely capture key information across its lifecycle — from the materials used in production and the environmental impact of manufacturing to authenticity details and end-of-life handling guidance. Consumers will typically access this data via a scannable QR code or barcode on the product itself.</p>\n<p>For retailers, DPPs represent more than just a compliance requirement under the EU’s ESPR; they also unlock new opportunities to build trust and transparency with customers. By offering visibility into a product’s full journey, DPPs can empower consumers to make more sustainable choices while helping retailers validate their sustainability claims, strengthen brand reputation and guard against accusations of greenwashing.</p>\n<p>They also open doors for innovation in retail services: for instance, they could make it easier for retailers to offer take-back programs, resale initiatives and other circular customer processes.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, DPPs don’t just support compliance; they can help retailers position themselves as leaders in the transition to a circular economy.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Taking the First Step Toward Compliance – A DPP Solution Strategy</strong></h3>\n<p>With the ESPR’s Working Plan being recently released, it is likely for retailers to feel overwhelmed by the upcoming regulation and its DPP mandate. This is even more likely amidst the establishment of the horizontal requirements and industry-specific deadlines.</p>\n<p>To combat this regulation and start processing the journey ahead strategically, a first step for retailers should be to assign an employee or team to be at the forefront of upcoming compliance efforts.</p>\n<p>By prioritizing a system whereby an employee or employees are staying updated on the legislation, retail businesses can ensure they remain abreast of industry-specific updates coming down the pipeline. As part of this, it would be advisable to reach out to a DPP advisor and gain a deeper understanding of the mandate’s industry-specific impact. By doing so, companies can carve out a coherent and bespoke strategy accordingly.</p>\n<p>Moreover, to ensure a smooth regulatory journey, businesses should start by mapping where critical product data resides — both within their own operations and throughout their supply chains. During this process, businesses also can start considering which partners are best equipped to support the rollout of DPPs.</p>\n<p>Once a solution is in place, piloting becomes the logical next step. For retailers, running a pilot can help test how new processes work across stores, supply chains and customer touch points. It allows them to uncover operational gaps, train staff effectively and collect valuable insights to better anticipate the scale and timing of a full rollout. With this groundwork laid, retailers will be ready to move quickly as new requirements take effect.</p>\n<p>For U.S. retailers operating in the EU, the ESPR’s DPP mandate will bring both challenges and opportunities. The recent publication of the Working Plan underscores the urgency of preparing for compliance, while also creating a unique chance for retailers to lead in transparency and garner a more sustainable customer base.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the way retailers approach this legislation will shape their brand’s future. Those that view it as more than a compliance exercise, and instead as a chance to strengthen sustainability credentials and customer trust, will be better positioned to stand out as leaders in the next generation of retail.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p><a href=\"https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fmatthew-ekholm%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7CAdam.Blair%40EmeraldX.com%7C45a0387fd83b46ff127a08de11ac12e6%7C661c8d9be19e4330b41275dce2d26154%7C0%7C0%7C638967627934114282%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=otvepVkr0uTdJ%2BYDwCYV7J5Wk6LixcCEGaF2uLzzz4c%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Matthew Ekholm</em></a><em> is Digital Product Passport and Circularity Specialist at </em><a href=\"https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.protokol.com%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7CAdam.Blair%40EmeraldX.com%7C45a0387fd83b46ff127a08de11ac12e6%7C661c8d9be19e4330b41275dce2d26154%7C0%7C0%7C638967627934137498%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=jPtwG0SRYye2nXvf0iiSuMoQN9DKSbQrvbAhzETfB3M%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Protokol</em></a><em>, responsible for Protokol’s DPP offering as well as understanding and translating customer needs into value-adding solutions.

As a result of this latest round of trade and supply chain upheaval, retailers have once again had to shift their sourcing strategies — and a new survey from wholesale marketplace <a href=\"https://www.faire.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Faire</strong></a> illuminates how they’re doing it.</p>\n<p>For retailers both small and large, holiday is the most important trading period of the year. And while consumers don’t typically start thinking about the festive season until the leaves start to turn, data from Faire shows that <strong>holiday prep has become a year-round effort for local retailers.</strong> Over the past <strong>three</strong> years, there hasn’t been <em>a single day</em> when retailers weren’t searching for “Christmas” on the platform, and those searches also are starting earlier each year — from June to July this year, searches for “Christmas” on Faire increased by <strong>124%</strong>, with the numbers only going up from there.</p>\n<p>“The holidays are such a crucial time for small businesses, and this year has been especially challenging for many independent retailers,” said Mia Sakai, owner of <a href=\"https://andalemarket.com/pages/about\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Ándale Market</strong></a> in Chicago, and a Faire user, in comments shared with <em>Retail TouchPoints</em>. “In terms of strategy for this holiday season, <strong>we started planning and buying earlier, but we aren’t taking as many purchasing risks as we might have in other years.</strong>”</p>\n<p>Here’s what else Faire learned about how independent retailers have adjusted their strategies this year to keep the holidays merry (and hopefully profitable) despite all the tumult:</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Buying Closer to Need</strong></h2>\n<p>Since June, Faire has seen a steady increase in retailers reporting they’re <strong>buying smaller quantities per order and placing orders more frequently.</strong> Backing up this trend, <strong>35%</strong> of retailers said in the survey that they’re ordering in smaller batches, allowing small businesses to keep overhead low and respond to customer demand in real time.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Exploring New Categories</strong></h2>\n<p>From May to September, Faire saw a nearly <strong>40%</strong> increase in retailers <strong>expanding into new product categories or trying new brands</strong>, indicating a desire to discover fresh inventory with stronger margins.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Shifting to Duty-free Products</strong></h2>\n<p>With all the tariff back-and-forth this year, it’s likely not surprising that <strong>60%</strong> of retailers on Faire are <strong>searching for new products not impacted by tariffs</strong>, and nearly <strong>50%</strong> are sourcing from domestic partners to reduce costs and shipping times.</p>\n<p>To help with this, Faire recently introduced a new “No Import Duties” filter that <strong>tens of thousands</strong> of retailers have already used it to source products, according to the company.</p>\n<p>“Independent retailers are some of the most resourceful entrepreneurs in the world. Every year, they find new ways to adapt, no matter what’s thrown their way,” said Jen Burke, Chief Revenue Officer of Faire in a <a href=\"https://www.faire.com/news/2025-10-28-how-retailers-are-preparing-for-holiday-2025\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>. “We’re proud that Faire can play a role in helping them stay resilient and successful during the holidays and beyond.”</p>\n</div>",

Snipes also is offering a <a href=\"https://www.snipesusa.com/hbcu/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">merchandise collection</a> from <strong>Pro Standard</strong>, a licensee that has created apparel celebrating <strong>nine</strong> HBCUs.</p>\n<p>The activations are part of the Snipes <a href=\"https://www.snipesusa.com/blog/pay-it-forward-snipes-x-scholarships.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pay It Forward</a> program, which has invested in HBCU scholarships and campus programming since its 2022 launch. This year, Snipes partnered with <a href=\"https://culturecreators.com/the-agency/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Culture Creator Agency</a> for the on-campus programs, which provided students with hands-on experience as campus ambassadors, training them to produce and activate real brand events at their schools. Beyond the events, the Pay It Forward program offers mentorship, micro-grants and career pathways to professional opportunities.</p>\n<p>“Our work with HBCUs goes far beyond a campaign — it’s a commitment,” said Kelley Walton, CMO at Snipes US in a statement. “These efforts are deeply personal to me because I’ve lived the HBCU experience and witnessed how the right support at the right time can change a student’s trajectory. Through Pay It Forward, we’re honored to invest in the next generation of leaders while celebrating the rich heritage that makes HBCU communities so extraordinary.”</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Riding the Nike Bandwagon</strong></h3>\n<p>This year’s first activation, on Oct. 3 at Norfolk State University, was Snipes’ inaugural appearance in the <strong>Nike</strong> Yardrunners initiative, which celebrates HBCUs’ heritage and history. At an event that was open to the public, attendees had exclusive early access to purchase the limited-edition Nike Air Max 95 Norfolk YR sneaker as well as hear live performances and fireside chats with NSU alumni.</p>\n<p>On Oct. 18, Morehouse College played host to a dual Snipes activation: a high-energy music experience combined with a Snipes-branded Yard Hub celebrating culture, fashion and community. At Hampton University on Oct. 25, the activation connected the Snipes brand with students and alumni while also providing scholarship support, as Snipes did at Morehouse.</p>\n</div>",

What used to be distinct calendar moments have collapsed into one long promotional stretch. Halloween now kicks off in July, with Spirit Halloween pop-ups quick to follow. Holiday campaigns begin creeping in by September. Prime Day has stretched into a record four-day event: U.S. consumers spent <a href=\"https://business.adobe.com/blog/prime-day-event-drove-24-billion-in-online-spend-across-us-retailers\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$24.1 billion</a> online from July 8 to 11, 2025, marking a 30.3% year-over-year increase. However, that average daily spending was lower than in previous years, indicating that extending Prime Day may have diluted urgency and fatigued shoppers.</p>\n<p>Retailers may be creating more moments, but the experience for shoppers is anything but magical. Instead of sparking excitement, this constant drumbeat of promotions leaves many feeling overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>The good news is that retailers already have many of the tools they need to close this gap. The challenge now is aligning teams internally and using the right data to guide marketing execution more effectively.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Disconnected Signals</strong></h3>\n<p>At the center of this challenge is a disconnect between commerce planning and marketing execution. Commerce teams have learned to move fast in response to pandemic-era disruptions and ongoing supply chain volatility. That reactive model, once a necessity, has now become the default approach even as conditions have stabilized.</p>\n<p>Marketing, however, hasn’t kept pace. Many teams still rely on fixed campaign calendars and broad messaging that fail to reflect how or when people shop. Commerce teams now respond in real time across ecommerce, in-store and social channels, while marketing remains locked in a playbook built for predictability.</p>\n<p>Consider back-to-school season, when <a href=\"https://www.retailbrew.com/stories/2025/07/17/back-to-school-shopping-started-early-this-year-nrf-survey\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">67% of families</a> began their school shopping by early July, the highest early start since 2018. Many consumers are trying to get ahead of inflation and potential price hikes, but brands continue to push out national campaigns that do not reflect regional differences or changing behaviors. This disconnect, sending the same message everywhere at once, erodes shopper trust and wastes engagement opportunities.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Rethinking the Playbook</strong></h3>\n<p>To fix this, retailers must move from problem to practice. Aligning marketing with commerce planning is key. Commerce teams already make informed decisions based on regional buying patterns, inventory and emerging consumer trends. Marketing should be guided by those same signals to ensure messaging lands at the right time and place.</p>\n<p>This does not require new technology. Marketers need to use the data they already have, including geographic insights, past purchase behavior and inventory levels, to inform messaging decisions. The goal is not just personalization; it is clear, relevant communication that reflects real consumer behavior.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Making Marketing Work for Commerce</strong></h3>\n<p>A commerce-aligned marketing approach recognizes that shopping timelines vary widely. Some households are ready for Halloween décor while others still favor summer essentials like sunscreen and pool gear. Some are in back-to-school mode, while others will not need school supplies for weeks. These insights exist but remain mostly untapped.</p>\n<p>The answer is not more campaigns; it’s smarter ones, grounded in commerce strategy and real consumer behavior. Marketing should engage when shoppers are ready, not just when retailers are ready to sell.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>From Alignment to Impact</strong></h3>\n<p>Looking ahead, success means breaking down silos. Marketing and commerce must act as partners, not separate functions. The data is there; the alignment is not.</p>\n<p>Retailers that reconnect these teams will not just optimize campaigns; they will create better experiences. They will match the right product with the right message at the right time, a realistic goal that starts with internal collaboration and a shared understanding of consumer journeys.</p>\n<p>Marketing aligned with commerce strategy is no longer optional — it is essential. In a fragmented marketplace where consumer attention is fleeting, retailers that align thoughtfully will gain more than short-term sales. They will earn lasting consumer trust.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p><em>David MacDonald is EVP, Head of Retail and Commerce Practice at </em><a href=\"https://www.razorfish.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Razorfish</em></a><em>.

Trump’s own whims, and negotiations with world leaders, have created much of the confusion, but the legal system has added to the turbulence as lawsuits against the tariffs work their way through judicial channels.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>To Recap</strong></h2>\n<p>In May the Court of International Trade (CIT) found that the tariffs were <a href=\"https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/market-news/trump-tariffs-deemed-illegal-by-federal-trade-court\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">illegally imposed</a>, but that decision was promptly stayed until it could be heard by an appeals court, which <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cafc.23105/gov.uscourts.cafc.23105.159.0_1.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">upheld the trade court’s ruling</a> in August. Both courts determined that the<strong> International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which Trump invoked to impose his tariffs in April, does not allow a president to impose worldwide tariffs with no expiration date, as Trump has done.</strong> This appeals court ruling came <strong>three</strong> months after a federal judge in a separate case (<em>Learning Resources v. Trump</em>) ruled that the tariffs the president imposed related to fentanyl and to the International Emergency Powers Act <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/09/trump-tariffs-trade-supreme-court-.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">are also illegal</a>.</p>\n<p>In the case of both rulings, <strong>tariffs have remained in effect while the world awaits an appeal in the Supreme Court</strong>, which is set to take place next Wednesday, Nov. 5. To expedite the process, the court has agreed to consolidate the two rulings into one hearing and agreed to hear the appeal on a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/trump-trade-supreme-court-tariffs-appeal.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">faster-than-normal timeline</a>.  </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Supreme Court May Have the Last Word on Trump Tariffs — or Not</strong></h2>\n<p>And so now here we are, less than a week out from this pivotal hearing that will impact companies not just in America but around the world. Emotions and opinions are running high.</p>\n<p>“We are confident that the Supreme Court, like the CIT and the Federal Circuit, will recognize that the President does not have unilateral tariff power under IEEPA,” said Jeffrey Schwab, Senior Counsel and Director of Litigation at the <a href=\"https://libertyjusticecenter.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Liberty Justice Center</a>, which represented the group of five small businesses that were plaintiffs in <em>V.O.S. v. Trump</em>, in comments to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/09/trump-tariffs-trade-supreme-court-.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>CNBC</em></a>. “<strong>Congress, not the President alone, has the constitutional power to impose tariffs.</strong>”</p>\n<p>Trump has his own arguments, of course, and isn’t afraid to share them in his typical fire-and-brimstone style: On Truth Social he <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114993652992825116\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>predicted</strong></a><strong> a “Great Depression” if the tariffs weren’t upheld and he </strong><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/trump-trade-supreme-court-tariffs-appeal.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>told White House reporters</strong></a><strong> that “we could end up being a third-world country” </strong>if tariffs are removed. And while advocating for an expedited hearing with the Supreme Court, Trump warned that the Treasury Department could be forced to refund between <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/08/trump-tariff-refund-trade-treasury-bessent-supreme-court.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>$750 billion and $1 trillion</strong></a> in collected tariffs if the Court waited until next June to issue a decision.</p>\n<p>“I will tell you that’s one of the most important cases in the history of our country because if we don’t win that case, we will be a weakened, troubled, financial mess for many, many years to come,” Trump said at the White House <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/trumps-dramatic-rhetoric-tariffs-ramps-pressure-supreme-court-rcna238207\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on Oct. 15</a>. He has even suggested that he might attend the hearing himself, something that appears to be unprecedented.</p>\n<p>Whether or not the court agrees with Trump’s assessment of the potential fallout, there’s no doubt that its ruling will have wide-reaching implications. Beyond the global fiscal impacts of the tariffs themselves, the Supreme Court also faces the “hard question” of whether to disrupt a sitting president’s signature economic policy after it has already reshaped the global trade landscape, as former Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-supreme-court-may-choose-200433137.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pointed out</a> at a recent event.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Potential Outcomes, and How Retailers can Prepare</strong></h2>\n\n<p>To try to get a handle on the situation and peek around the curve, <em>Retail TouchPoints</em> sat down with cross-border shipping expert Rathna Sharad, who is the CEO and Founder of logistics platform <a href=\"https://flavorcloud.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FlavorCloud</a> and has a background that spans <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>UPS</strong>, and <strong>three </strong>decades of global trade experience. </p>\n<p class=\"has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ff62a83784f427d73e7d8e9b77e1352a\"><strong><em>Retail TouchPoints: What are the different ways things could go with the Supreme Court on Nov. 5?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rathna Sharad:</strong> If the court [finds this to be legal], then obviously, we continue to have these emergency tariffs. If the tariffs are deemed as not [a legal use] of this emergency power, then the tariffs can no longer be applied. But even in that case the Trump administration can request a stay, and <strong>they have other ways of instituting these tariffs that are not a use of emergency powers.</strong></p>\n<p>For example, there are other tariffs that Trump could impose on specific categories of goods; that is one way he could get around it. We’ve already seen tariffs on steel and aluminum, so you could then see things like apparel tariffs. This would be through the tariff authority granted under Section 232 [of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962].</p>\n<p>There’s also Section 122 [of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows the imposition of tariffs to address “international payment problems”], and they can enact tariffs specifically against China under Section 301 of the Trade Act.</p>\n<p>We obviously don’t know what the Supreme Court’s decision is going to be, but we already know that the Trump administration is going to be looking at alternate mechanisms [to impose these tariffs].</p>\n<p class=\"has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6a7ead1c95c8346fc16c22133e469972\"><strong><em>RTP: So there’s no indication that he would just say, ‘Okay, let’s drop the whole thing’ if the Supreme Court rules against him?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sharad: </strong>No. The entirety of his administration has been about using tariffs to have a policy with every country, and to fine-tune it for every country.</p>\n<p>The other thing to note here is that <strong>tariffs have been collecting [since the spring], and it’s really hard to undo that. How do you give that money back, and who would be responsible for that?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2061c2e5bbec268e706acc303b7ec913\"><strong><em>RTP: Supreme Court decisions take time after the hearing. Is there any chance of a ruling that will come in time to have an impact on the holiday season?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sharad: </strong>I don’t think the Supreme Court ruling is likely to impact anything for the holidays.<strong> </strong>However, we’ve been dealing with this pretty much all year, and that’s not going to change any time soon. We’ve seen this massive flux of back-and-forth with the tariffs that has somewhat stabilized since August, but now we’re starting to hear that <strong>tariffs are back on with China and it could be all the way up to 100%, that Mexico could see another 10% and that the situation is escalating with Canada. <em>Those </em>changes could have an impact over the holidays.</strong></p>\n<p>These things have a real implication for consumers, because brands have to consider price increases to mitigate some of this. You have to offset it somehow, and it has to either come from your bottom line or be passed on to the end consumer.</p>\n<p class=\"has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-40cf94c10949b0b7121e6599dc78d18c\"><strong><em>RTP:</em></strong><em> <strong>Is there anything retailers can do to protect themselves from the volatility of all this?</strong></em><strong><em></em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sharad: </strong>One of the things that we have seen have a very significant impact in increasing conversions and allowing for margins is to <strong>have an accurate pricing strategy.</strong> For that they need technology. It’s one of the things that we do at [FlavorCloud] and it’s called <strong>localized market pricing</strong>. What that allows you to do is, at the product or SKU level, really understand the implications of tariffs and the overall cost, because the <a href=\"https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/market-news/trumps-sweeping-reciprocal-tariffs-spark-widespread-concern-particularly-in-the-apparel-sector\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">elimination of <em>de minimis</em></a> has had a real impact on that as well.</p>\n<p>If they want to pass those costs on, they need to think about <strong>calculating a price for each market.</strong> So for example, if it is a $100 product in the U.S. and you are selling it to Canada, perhaps you want to include the<strong> </strong>25% impact of tariffs in there, so you price it at $125 or $130<strong> </strong>Canadian. For the consumer, that means they also don’t have to worry about what the is tariff today. And it’s programmatically adjusted, so when the tariff shifts to 35% you’re protected, and when the tariff shifts to less, maybe 15%, you’re still protected and the consumer gets the benefit of it.</p>\n<p>Another option is to choose the<strong> Delivery Duties Paid (DDP) model.</strong> What that means is you’re taking advantage of <strong>technology that is able to calculate the duties, taxes, fees, tariffs, and provide that up front so the consumer knows and pays for it.</strong> It’s a slightly different strategy than having market-specific pricing and it may be easier to implement for some. It allows you to ensure that the consumer is not going to get a surprise after the fact and there are no issues at the border as a result.</p>\n<p>Because one of the things that’s happened is, <strong>you’re having to provide additional data for customs clearance and stuff can get caught in customs if it doesn’t have sufficient information.</strong> Country of origin, the value of the goods, the description of the goods, the harmonized commodity code — these are all mandatory pieces of information required by customs. When parcels come in without it, they’re actually rejecting them and sending them back, which is very expensive, or they sit in customs waiting for this information. Every day it sits out there, it’s going to incur more charges, storage fees and additional clearance fees.</p>\n<p class=\"has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-048820bacb6d762c5abb1063948b65c9\"><strong><em>RTP: Do you have any tips for communicating all this with customers?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sharad: </strong>For consumers it’s the flip side of what we talked about [for retailers]. It’s better to understand if all the duties, taxes and fees are included in the product price, whether it is separately shown to them or included. Consumers need to make sure when they’re purchasing that they’re not going to see additional bills after the fact.</p>\n<p class=\"has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-be6991d4b62a991f0ddc6ec41ff7b874\"><strong><em>RTP: I was just reading about some consumers getting bills from shipping carriers like FedEx for duty charges.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sharad: </strong>That’s exactly what happens. Delivery Duties Paid means that the merchant is using technology like ours to accurately calculate all of these costs for the different items in the shopping cart. Either they’re using pricing strategies to create a product price that is inclusive, or they’re displaying it separately and saying, “Here’s the price and here are the duties and tariffs.”</p>\n<p>If you didn’t see that happen, you just see $100 for the product and they didn’t say it was inclusive of everything, then the carrier — it could be UPS, it could be anybody that’s delivering — at the border, they’re going to run into problems<strong>. Customs could then reject the shipment because there’s not enough information.</strong> That means you may not get your parcel, or the fees keep increasing, and then you get a big fat bill of an additional $50 that you didn’t expect. [The carrier] is going to ask you to pay that bill before they will deliver. And if you say, “Well, they didn’t tell me, I don’t want it,” then you don’t get the parcel.</p>\n<p>It’s a really terrible situation for the retailer too, because now they have a real margin issue. It could be, for example, $100 to return this product back to the merchant, which may not be worth it [based on] their wholesale cost, so they may have to just destroy that item. It’s not good for anybody.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-d31e15f elementor-widget elementor-widget-theme-post-content\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-id=\"d31e15f\" data-widget_type=\"theme-post-content.default\">\n<p>The 2025 holiday season is shaping up to be driven by AI-driven discovery, economic caution and performance-obsessed marketing, and retailers are facing a simple choice: compete on price or convert through influence. But what if they had a strategy that doesn’t just sell products, but builds trust, urgency and conversion in one seamless motion? The answer is live shopping. By tapping influencers, retailers are turning social media into the next wave of performance marketing, and they’re using the affiliate infrastructure to do so.</p>\n<p>Consumers trust creators to meet them where they are, in real time. <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/2025-trend-creator-commerce-reshape-retail--social-media\">71%</a><a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/2025-trend-creator-commerce-reshape-retail--social-media\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> of U.S. shoppers</a> purchased a creator-founded product last year, and <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">56% of social media users</a> say they’ll maintain their current level of social purchases through year’s end — even amid economic uncertainty and the on-again, off-again TikTok ban. The underlying principles of affiliate, performance-based compensation, trusted recommendation and scale, are more relevant than ever. What’s changing is <em>how</em> that value is activated.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a></a><strong>From China’s Playbook to U.S. Storefronts</strong></h3>\n<p>Live shopping, which took root in China, has become a mainstream retail channel. By 2026, it’s projected to reach <a href=\"https://voltage-x.com/zh/live-commerce-the-next-stage-for-e-commerce/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">¥8.16 trillion </a>($1.2 trillion), up from ¥5.86 trillion in 2024. As of mid-2023, <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/live-commerce-2023?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">600 million Chinese consumers </a>regularly tuned into shoppable live streams.</p>\n<p>The format’s power lies in its conversion rates. Traditional ecommerce converts <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/blog/ecommerce-conversion-rate?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2% to 3% of browsers</a> into buyers. Live commerce achieves 9% to 30%. In beauty and fashion, it can reach 70% during peak events. Taobao Live alone generates more than <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9213714/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$3 billion </a>in daily sales.</p>\n<p>The U.S. is catching up quickly. Live shopping already represents <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://influencermarketinghub.com/live-streaming-stats/?utm_source%3Dchatgpt.com&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1755729084253148&amp;usg=AOvVaw27xj6S9TmAaVByLaJByzNG\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">18% of online purchases</a>. In the U.S.,<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1276120/livestream-e-commerce-sales-united-states/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> sales are projected to grow to $68 billion by 2026</a>. Platforms such as Ebay, Poshmark and TikTok have built live commerce directly into their ecosystems, making it accessible to mass audiences.</p>\n<p>Retailers also are experimenting on their own turf. Walmart has hosted shoppable livestreams on TikTok and YouTube. Amazon continues to expand Amazon Live, featuring curated gift guides and daily deal streams. Nordstrom and Macy’s have piloted live events with stylists and influencers, blending entertainment with conversion-focused retail.</p>\n<p>Globally, sales reached <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1276120/livestream-e-commerce-sales-united-states/\">$682</a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1276120/livestream-e-commerce-sales-united-states/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> billion in 2023</a> and are forecast to triple by 2030. The appeal is clear: live shopping combines entertainment, urgency and trust. Shoppers can ask questions, watch real-time demonstrations and purchase instantly, mirroring the in-store experience but with the convenience of online access.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a></a><strong>Creator and Affiliate Gets a Glow-Up</strong></h3>\n<p>In tandem, affiliate marketing continues to demonstrate its enduring significance as a powerful sales and marketing strategy. In the U.S.:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Creator and affiliate performance marketing accounts for a substantial <a href=\"https://www.demandsage.com/affiliate-marketing-statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">16% of all ecommerce orders</a>, underscoring its effectiveness in driving conversions and expanding market reach. <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/affiliate-marketing-statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Over 80% of advertisers </a>actively utilize affiliate marketing in their promotional efforts. This indicates a high level of trust and reliance on a network of partners to promote products in exchange for a commission.</li>\n<li>Global spend on affiliate marketing is projected to surpass <a href=\"https://www.publift.com/blog/affiliate-marketing-statistics?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$31 billion by 2031</a>, signifying sustained confidence in its ability to deliver measurable returns.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Affiliate models, which compensate creators and influencers for driving sales through tracked links or codes, are a natural fit for live shopping. The ecosystem now includes various types of affiliates, such as content creators, coupon sites, review sites and loyalty programs, each playing a crucial role in directing qualified traffic and generating sales for advertisers. As these landscapes evolve, retailers need infrastructure that unifies affiliate and app performance, connects network data to in-app journeys and enables creators to be compensated not just for traffic but for revenue.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why TikTok’s Ahead of the Pack</strong></h3>\n<p>Most third-party platforms and social apps struggle with enabling seamless checkout at scale. Off-site redirects, inconsistent deep linking, clunky payment processing and inaccurate attribution often lead to a drop in conversion and misaligned budgets — a hurdle TikTok has begun to overcome. Though TikTok treats these as transactions and not typical affiliate link‑based commissions, the seller still pays a commission, mirroring the affiliate model’s core: pay for performance. TikTok is teaching the market what works.</p>\n<p>Although TikTok’s checkout model differs <em>technically</em>, the overall experience captures the founding principle of affiliate marketing: people (creators/hosts) are rewarded for sales they drive. This performance-driven approach seamlessly aligns with how TikTok engages users, turning passive scrolling into active discovery and purchases.</p>\n<p>TikTok’s live shopping experience represents a fundamental shift in how consumers discover and make purchases. Users aren’t actively searching for something specific to purchase when they’re scrolling through the platform; they, instead, discover new brands and products organically through engaging and entertaining content, personalized feeds and authentic creator recommendations. That’s what makes TikTok users stop scrolling and start interacting.</p>\n<p>And it works!</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://business.tiktokshop.com/us/seller\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">70% of users</a> say they discover new brands and products on the platform.</li>\n<li>Three in four users are likely to buy something while using TikTok.</li>\n<li>One in four users search <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tiktok.forbusiness/reel/DHq0rj6pAPx/?locale=pl\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">within the first 30 seconds</a> of opening the app.</li>\n<li>45% of users continue searching the app for more information after discovering something.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is because brands can showcase their products, personality and values on the platform while the community builds interest and trust among consumers. The influencers users follow are seen as real, genuine people who are knowledgeable experts, often using products in “real life” contexts. This leads to purchase intent — and sometimes even shortens the journey from discovery to impulse buys and conversion.</p>\n<p>As TikTok grows its live shopping model in the U.S., it represents the clearest case of how live commerce can embody affiliate mechanics at scale. What happens when Instagram, Amazon, and YouTube catch up?</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>From Impressions to Impact</strong></h3>\n<p>Advertising is undergoing a fundamental shift. The traditional metric of impressions is being replaced by performance-based models where influence is measured in revenue, not reach. Live shopping sits at the center of this evolution, transforming creators into persuasive sellers who can engage, educate and close sales in real time.</p>\n<p>For retailers, the holiday season is the perfect proving ground. Consumers are scrutinizing every dollar, so content must deliver value. Formats like “Top 10 Under $50” gift guides, product comparisons, tutorials and live Q&amp;As help shoppers feel confident. Pair that with affiliate attribution and frictionless checkout and live shopping becomes one of the most powerful holiday tools of the year.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Tipping Point is Here</strong></h3>\n<p>The U.S. live commerce market is projected to grow at <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/live-commerce-market-report?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">~37% compound annual growth rate </a>from 2025 to 2033. With creator-driven marketing embedded into Instagram, Amazon and YouTube, brands are shifting budgets from impressions to transactions.</p>\n<p>The logic is compelling: why pay for reach when you can pay for revenue? Live commerce, with affiliate mechanics at its core, solves both engagement and ROI in one motion.</p>\n<p>This isn’t a passing trend. It’s the next chapter of commerce, where performance is paramount and influence is monetized only when it converts. This holiday season will reward retailers that treat live commerce as a core revenue channel. Live shopping may be the most reliable helper of all.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p><em>Michael Jaconi is the Co-founder and CEO of </em><a href=\"https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usebutton.com%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cadam%40retailtouchpoints.com%7Cd15f78f8ad5e4637cc4b08de074929ca%7C661c8d9be19e4330b41275dce2d26154%7C0%7C0%7C638956208274425454%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C60000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=w6wCfcHDFpkttbYrAECu%2FnLrTPerkMC8ZKKnogqgXZo%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Button,</em></a><em> a mobile commerce platform that optimizes traffic for the worldʼs leading publishers, retailers and creators that depend on affiliate marketing. Button drives more than $1B in mobile commerce per month with a solution built with AI that is engineered to help Button customers generate more revenue.
