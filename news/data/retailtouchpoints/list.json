What used to be distinct calendar moments have collapsed into one long promotional stretch. Halloween now kicks off in July, with Spirit Halloween pop-ups quick to follow. Holiday campaigns begin creeping in by September. Prime Day has stretched into a record four-day event: U.S. consumers spent <a href=\"https://business.adobe.com/blog/prime-day-event-drove-24-billion-in-online-spend-across-us-retailers\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$24.1 billion</a> online from July 8 to 11, 2025, marking a 30.3% year-over-year increase. However, that average daily spending was lower than in previous years, indicating that extending Prime Day may have diluted urgency and fatigued shoppers.</p>\n<p>Retailers may be creating more moments, but the experience for shoppers is anything but magical. Instead of sparking excitement, this constant drumbeat of promotions leaves many feeling overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>The good news is that retailers already have many of the tools they need to close this gap. The challenge now is aligning teams internally and using the right data to guide marketing execution more effectively.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Disconnected Signals</strong></h3>\n<p>At the center of this challenge is a disconnect between commerce planning and marketing execution. Commerce teams have learned to move fast in response to pandemic-era disruptions and ongoing supply chain volatility. That reactive model, once a necessity, has now become the default approach even as conditions have stabilized.</p>\n<p>Marketing, however, hasn’t kept pace. Many teams still rely on fixed campaign calendars and broad messaging that fail to reflect how or when people shop. Commerce teams now respond in real time across ecommerce, in-store and social channels, while marketing remains locked in a playbook built for predictability.</p>\n<p>Consider back-to-school season, when <a href=\"https://www.retailbrew.com/stories/2025/07/17/back-to-school-shopping-started-early-this-year-nrf-survey\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">67% of families</a> began their school shopping by early July, the highest early start since 2018. Many consumers are trying to get ahead of inflation and potential price hikes, but brands continue to push out national campaigns that do not reflect regional differences or changing behaviors. This disconnect, sending the same message everywhere at once, erodes shopper trust and wastes engagement opportunities.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Rethinking the Playbook</strong></h3>\n<p>To fix this, retailers must move from problem to practice. Aligning marketing with commerce planning is key. Commerce teams already make informed decisions based on regional buying patterns, inventory and emerging consumer trends. Marketing should be guided by those same signals to ensure messaging lands at the right time and place.</p>\n<p>This does not require new technology. Marketers need to use the data they already have, including geographic insights, past purchase behavior and inventory levels, to inform messaging decisions. The goal is not just personalization; it is clear, relevant communication that reflects real consumer behavior.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Making Marketing Work for Commerce</strong></h3>\n<p>A commerce-aligned marketing approach recognizes that shopping timelines vary widely. Some households are ready for Halloween décor while others still favor summer essentials like sunscreen and pool gear. Some are in back-to-school mode, while others will not need school supplies for weeks. These insights exist but remain mostly untapped.</p>\n<p>The answer is not more campaigns; it’s smarter ones, grounded in commerce strategy and real consumer behavior. Marketing should engage when shoppers are ready, not just when retailers are ready to sell.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>From Alignment to Impact</strong></h3>\n<p>Looking ahead, success means breaking down silos. Marketing and commerce must act as partners, not separate functions. The data is there; the alignment is not.</p>\n<p>Retailers that reconnect these teams will not just optimize campaigns; they will create better experiences. They will match the right product with the right message at the right time, a realistic goal that starts with internal collaboration and a shared understanding of consumer journeys.</p>\n<p>Marketing aligned with commerce strategy is no longer optional — it is essential. In a fragmented marketplace where consumer attention is fleeting, retailers that align thoughtfully will gain more than short-term sales. They will earn lasting consumer trust.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p><em>David MacDonald is EVP, Head of Retail and Commerce Practice at </em><a href=\"https://www.razorfish.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Razorfish</em></a><em>.

Trump’s own whims, and negotiations with world leaders, have created much of the confusion, but the legal system has added to the turbulence as lawsuits against the tariffs work their way through judicial channels.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>To Recap</strong></h2>\n<p>In May the Court of International Trade (CIT) found that the tariffs were <a href=\"https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/market-news/trump-tariffs-deemed-illegal-by-federal-trade-court\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">illegally imposed</a>, but that decision was promptly stayed until it could be heard by an appeals court, which <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cafc.23105/gov.uscourts.cafc.23105.159.0_1.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">upheld the trade court’s ruling</a> in August. Both courts determined that the<strong> International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which Trump invoked to impose his tariffs in April, does not allow a president to impose worldwide tariffs with no expiration date, as Trump has done.</strong> This appeals court ruling came <strong>three</strong> months after a federal judge in a separate case (<em>Learning Resources v. Trump</em>) ruled that the tariffs the president imposed related to fentanyl and to the International Emergency Powers Act <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/09/trump-tariffs-trade-supreme-court-.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">are also illegal</a>.</p>\n<p>In the case of both rulings, <strong>tariffs have remained in effect while the world awaits an appeal in the Supreme Court</strong>, which is set to take place next Wednesday, Nov. 5. To expedite the process, the court has agreed to consolidate the two rulings into one hearing and agreed to hear the appeal on a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/trump-trade-supreme-court-tariffs-appeal.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">faster-than-normal timeline</a>.  </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Supreme Court May Have the Last Word on Trump Tariffs — or Not</strong></h2>\n<p>And so now here we are, less than a week out from this pivotal hearing that will impact companies not just in America but around the world. Emotions and opinions are running high.</p>\n<p>“We are confident that the Supreme Court, like the CIT and the Federal Circuit, will recognize that the President does not have unilateral tariff power under IEEPA,” said Jeffrey Schwab, Senior Counsel and Director of Litigation at the <a href=\"https://libertyjusticecenter.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Liberty Justice Center</a>, which represented the group of five small businesses that were plaintiffs in <em>V.O.S. v. Trump</em>, in comments to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/09/trump-tariffs-trade-supreme-court-.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>CNBC</em></a>. “<strong>Congress, not the President alone, has the constitutional power to impose tariffs.</strong>”</p>\n<p>Trump has his own arguments, of course, and isn’t afraid to share them in his typical fire-and-brimstone style: On Truth Social he <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114993652992825116\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>predicted</strong></a><strong> a “Great Depression” if the tariffs weren’t upheld and he </strong><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/trump-trade-supreme-court-tariffs-appeal.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>told White House reporters</strong></a><strong> that “we could end up being a third-world country” </strong>if tariffs are removed. And while advocating for an expedited hearing with the Supreme Court, Trump warned that the Treasury Department could be forced to refund between <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/08/trump-tariff-refund-trade-treasury-bessent-supreme-court.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>$750 billion and $1 trillion</strong></a> in collected tariffs if the Court waited until next June to issue a decision.</p>\n<p>“I will tell you that’s one of the most important cases in the history of our country because if we don’t win that case, we will be a weakened, troubled, financial mess for many, many years to come,” Trump said at the White House <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/trumps-dramatic-rhetoric-tariffs-ramps-pressure-supreme-court-rcna238207\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on Oct. 15</a>. He has even suggested that he might attend the hearing himself, something that appears to be unprecedented.</p>\n<p>Whether or not the court agrees with Trump’s assessment of the potential fallout, there’s no doubt that its ruling will have wide-reaching implications. Beyond the global fiscal impacts of the tariffs themselves, the Supreme Court also faces the “hard question” of whether to disrupt a sitting president’s signature economic policy after it has already reshaped the global trade landscape, as former Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-supreme-court-may-choose-200433137.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pointed out</a> at a recent event.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Potential Outcomes, and How Retailers can Prepare</strong></h2>\n\n<p>To try to get a handle on the situation and peek around the curve, <em>Retail TouchPoints</em> sat down with cross-border shipping expert Rathna Sharad, who is the CEO and Founder of logistics platform <a href=\"https://flavorcloud.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FlavorCloud</a> and has a background that spans <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>UPS</strong>, and <strong>three </strong>decades of global trade experience. </p>\n<p class=\"has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ff62a83784f427d73e7d8e9b77e1352a\"><strong><em>Retail TouchPoints: What are the different ways things could go with the Supreme Court on Nov. 5?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rathna Sharad:</strong> If the court [finds this to be legal], then obviously, we continue to have these emergency tariffs. If the tariffs are deemed as not [a legal use] of this emergency power, then the tariffs can no longer be applied. But even in that case the Trump administration can request a stay, and <strong>they have other ways of instituting these tariffs that are not a use of emergency powers.</strong></p>\n<p>For example, there are other tariffs that Trump could impose on specific categories of goods; that is one way he could get around it. We’ve already seen tariffs on steel and aluminum, so you could then see things like apparel tariffs. This would be through the tariff authority granted under Section 232 [of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962].</p>\n<p>There’s also Section 122 [of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows the imposition of tariffs to address “international payment problems”], and they can enact tariffs specifically against China under Section 301 of the Trade Act.</p>\n<p>We obviously don’t know what the Supreme Court’s decision is going to be, but we already know that the Trump administration is going to be looking at alternate mechanisms [to impose these tariffs].</p>\n<p class=\"has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6a7ead1c95c8346fc16c22133e469972\"><strong><em>RTP: So there’s no indication that he would just say, ‘Okay, let’s drop the whole thing’ if the Supreme Court rules against him?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sharad: </strong>No. The entirety of his administration has been about using tariffs to have a policy with every country, and to fine-tune it for every country.</p>\n<p>The other thing to note here is that <strong>tariffs have been collecting [since the spring], and it’s really hard to undo that. How do you give that money back, and who would be responsible for that?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2061c2e5bbec268e706acc303b7ec913\"><strong><em>RTP: Supreme Court decisions take time after the hearing. Is there any chance of a ruling that will come in time to have an impact on the holiday season?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sharad: </strong>I don’t think the Supreme Court ruling is likely to impact anything for the holidays.<strong> </strong>However, we’ve been dealing with this pretty much all year, and that’s not going to change any time soon. We’ve seen this massive flux of back-and-forth with the tariffs that has somewhat stabilized since August, but now we’re starting to hear that <strong>tariffs are back on with China and it could be all the way up to 100%, that Mexico could see another 10% and that the situation is escalating with Canada. <em>Those </em>changes could have an impact over the holidays.</strong></p>\n<p>These things have a real implication for consumers, because brands have to consider price increases to mitigate some of this. You have to offset it somehow, and it has to either come from your bottom line or be passed on to the end consumer.</p>\n<p class=\"has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-40cf94c10949b0b7121e6599dc78d18c\"><strong><em>RTP:</em></strong><em> <strong>Is there anything retailers can do to protect themselves from the volatility of all this?</strong></em><strong><em></em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sharad: </strong>One of the things that we have seen have a very significant impact in increasing conversions and allowing for margins is to <strong>have an accurate pricing strategy.</strong> For that they need technology. It’s one of the things that we do at [FlavorCloud] and it’s called <strong>localized market pricing</strong>. What that allows you to do is, at the product or SKU level, really understand the implications of tariffs and the overall cost, because the <a href=\"https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/market-news/trumps-sweeping-reciprocal-tariffs-spark-widespread-concern-particularly-in-the-apparel-sector\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">elimination of <em>de minimis</em></a> has had a real impact on that as well.</p>\n<p>If they want to pass those costs on, they need to think about <strong>calculating a price for each market.</strong> So for example, if it is a $100 product in the U.S. and you are selling it to Canada, perhaps you want to include the<strong> </strong>25% impact of tariffs in there, so you price it at $125 or $130<strong> </strong>Canadian. For the consumer, that means they also don’t have to worry about what the is tariff today. And it’s programmatically adjusted, so when the tariff shifts to 35% you’re protected, and when the tariff shifts to less, maybe 15%, you’re still protected and the consumer gets the benefit of it.</p>\n<p>Another option is to choose the<strong> Delivery Duties Paid (DDP) model.</strong> What that means is you’re taking advantage of <strong>technology that is able to calculate the duties, taxes, fees, tariffs, and provide that up front so the consumer knows and pays for it.</strong> It’s a slightly different strategy than having market-specific pricing and it may be easier to implement for some. It allows you to ensure that the consumer is not going to get a surprise after the fact and there are no issues at the border as a result.</p>\n<p>Because one of the things that’s happened is, <strong>you’re having to provide additional data for customs clearance and stuff can get caught in customs if it doesn’t have sufficient information.</strong> Country of origin, the value of the goods, the description of the goods, the harmonized commodity code — these are all mandatory pieces of information required by customs. When parcels come in without it, they’re actually rejecting them and sending them back, which is very expensive, or they sit in customs waiting for this information. Every day it sits out there, it’s going to incur more charges, storage fees and additional clearance fees.</p>\n<p class=\"has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-048820bacb6d762c5abb1063948b65c9\"><strong><em>RTP: Do you have any tips for communicating all this with customers?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sharad: </strong>For consumers it’s the flip side of what we talked about [for retailers]. It’s better to understand if all the duties, taxes and fees are included in the product price, whether it is separately shown to them or included. Consumers need to make sure when they’re purchasing that they’re not going to see additional bills after the fact.</p>\n<p class=\"has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-be6991d4b62a991f0ddc6ec41ff7b874\"><strong><em>RTP: I was just reading about some consumers getting bills from shipping carriers like FedEx for duty charges.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sharad: </strong>That’s exactly what happens. Delivery Duties Paid means that the merchant is using technology like ours to accurately calculate all of these costs for the different items in the shopping cart. Either they’re using pricing strategies to create a product price that is inclusive, or they’re displaying it separately and saying, “Here’s the price and here are the duties and tariffs.”</p>\n<p>If you didn’t see that happen, you just see $100 for the product and they didn’t say it was inclusive of everything, then the carrier — it could be UPS, it could be anybody that’s delivering — at the border, they’re going to run into problems<strong>. Customs could then reject the shipment because there’s not enough information.</strong> That means you may not get your parcel, or the fees keep increasing, and then you get a big fat bill of an additional $50 that you didn’t expect. [The carrier] is going to ask you to pay that bill before they will deliver. And if you say, “Well, they didn’t tell me, I don’t want it,” then you don’t get the parcel.</p>\n<p>It’s a really terrible situation for the retailer too, because now they have a real margin issue. It could be, for example, $100 to return this product back to the merchant, which may not be worth it [based on] their wholesale cost, so they may have to just destroy that item. It’s not good for anybody.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-d31e15f elementor-widget elementor-widget-theme-post-content\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-id=\"d31e15f\" data-widget_type=\"theme-post-content.default\">\n<p>The 2025 holiday season is shaping up to be driven by AI-driven discovery, economic caution and performance-obsessed marketing, and retailers are facing a simple choice: compete on price or convert through influence. But what if they had a strategy that doesn’t just sell products, but builds trust, urgency and conversion in one seamless motion? The answer is live shopping. By tapping influencers, retailers are turning social media into the next wave of performance marketing, and they’re using the affiliate infrastructure to do so.</p>\n<p>Consumers trust creators to meet them where they are, in real time. <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/2025-trend-creator-commerce-reshape-retail--social-media\">71%</a><a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/2025-trend-creator-commerce-reshape-retail--social-media\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> of U.S. shoppers</a> purchased a creator-founded product last year, and <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">56% of social media users</a> say they’ll maintain their current level of social purchases through year’s end — even amid economic uncertainty and the on-again, off-again TikTok ban. The underlying principles of affiliate, performance-based compensation, trusted recommendation and scale, are more relevant than ever. What’s changing is <em>how</em> that value is activated.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a></a><strong>From China’s Playbook to U.S. Storefronts</strong></h3>\n<p>Live shopping, which took root in China, has become a mainstream retail channel. By 2026, it’s projected to reach <a href=\"https://voltage-x.com/zh/live-commerce-the-next-stage-for-e-commerce/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">¥8.16 trillion </a>($1.2 trillion), up from ¥5.86 trillion in 2024. As of mid-2023, <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/live-commerce-2023?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">600 million Chinese consumers </a>regularly tuned into shoppable live streams.</p>\n<p>The format’s power lies in its conversion rates. Traditional ecommerce converts <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/blog/ecommerce-conversion-rate?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2% to 3% of browsers</a> into buyers. Live commerce achieves 9% to 30%. In beauty and fashion, it can reach 70% during peak events. Taobao Live alone generates more than <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9213714/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$3 billion </a>in daily sales.</p>\n<p>The U.S. is catching up quickly. Live shopping already represents <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://influencermarketinghub.com/live-streaming-stats/?utm_source%3Dchatgpt.com&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1755729084253148&amp;usg=AOvVaw27xj6S9TmAaVByLaJByzNG\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">18% of online purchases</a>. In the U.S.,<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1276120/livestream-e-commerce-sales-united-states/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> sales are projected to grow to $68 billion by 2026</a>. Platforms such as Ebay, Poshmark and TikTok have built live commerce directly into their ecosystems, making it accessible to mass audiences.</p>\n<p>Retailers also are experimenting on their own turf. Walmart has hosted shoppable livestreams on TikTok and YouTube. Amazon continues to expand Amazon Live, featuring curated gift guides and daily deal streams. Nordstrom and Macy’s have piloted live events with stylists and influencers, blending entertainment with conversion-focused retail.</p>\n<p>Globally, sales reached <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1276120/livestream-e-commerce-sales-united-states/\">$682</a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1276120/livestream-e-commerce-sales-united-states/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> billion in 2023</a> and are forecast to triple by 2030. The appeal is clear: live shopping combines entertainment, urgency and trust. Shoppers can ask questions, watch real-time demonstrations and purchase instantly, mirroring the in-store experience but with the convenience of online access.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a></a><strong>Creator and Affiliate Gets a Glow-Up</strong></h3>\n<p>In tandem, affiliate marketing continues to demonstrate its enduring significance as a powerful sales and marketing strategy. In the U.S.:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Creator and affiliate performance marketing accounts for a substantial <a href=\"https://www.demandsage.com/affiliate-marketing-statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">16% of all ecommerce orders</a>, underscoring its effectiveness in driving conversions and expanding market reach. <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/affiliate-marketing-statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Over 80% of advertisers </a>actively utilize affiliate marketing in their promotional efforts. This indicates a high level of trust and reliance on a network of partners to promote products in exchange for a commission.</li>\n<li>Global spend on affiliate marketing is projected to surpass <a href=\"https://www.publift.com/blog/affiliate-marketing-statistics?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$31 billion by 2031</a>, signifying sustained confidence in its ability to deliver measurable returns.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Affiliate models, which compensate creators and influencers for driving sales through tracked links or codes, are a natural fit for live shopping. The ecosystem now includes various types of affiliates, such as content creators, coupon sites, review sites and loyalty programs, each playing a crucial role in directing qualified traffic and generating sales for advertisers. As these landscapes evolve, retailers need infrastructure that unifies affiliate and app performance, connects network data to in-app journeys and enables creators to be compensated not just for traffic but for revenue.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why TikTok’s Ahead of the Pack</strong></h3>\n<p>Most third-party platforms and social apps struggle with enabling seamless checkout at scale. Off-site redirects, inconsistent deep linking, clunky payment processing and inaccurate attribution often lead to a drop in conversion and misaligned budgets — a hurdle TikTok has begun to overcome. Though TikTok treats these as transactions and not typical affiliate link‑based commissions, the seller still pays a commission, mirroring the affiliate model’s core: pay for performance. TikTok is teaching the market what works.</p>\n<p>Although TikTok’s checkout model differs <em>technically</em>, the overall experience captures the founding principle of affiliate marketing: people (creators/hosts) are rewarded for sales they drive. This performance-driven approach seamlessly aligns with how TikTok engages users, turning passive scrolling into active discovery and purchases.</p>\n<p>TikTok’s live shopping experience represents a fundamental shift in how consumers discover and make purchases. Users aren’t actively searching for something specific to purchase when they’re scrolling through the platform; they, instead, discover new brands and products organically through engaging and entertaining content, personalized feeds and authentic creator recommendations. That’s what makes TikTok users stop scrolling and start interacting.</p>\n<p>And it works!</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://business.tiktokshop.com/us/seller\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">70% of users</a> say they discover new brands and products on the platform.</li>\n<li>Three in four users are likely to buy something while using TikTok.</li>\n<li>One in four users search <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tiktok.forbusiness/reel/DHq0rj6pAPx/?locale=pl\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">within the first 30 seconds</a> of opening the app.</li>\n<li>45% of users continue searching the app for more information after discovering something.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is because brands can showcase their products, personality and values on the platform while the community builds interest and trust among consumers. The influencers users follow are seen as real, genuine people who are knowledgeable experts, often using products in “real life” contexts. This leads to purchase intent — and sometimes even shortens the journey from discovery to impulse buys and conversion.</p>\n<p>As TikTok grows its live shopping model in the U.S., it represents the clearest case of how live commerce can embody affiliate mechanics at scale. What happens when Instagram, Amazon, and YouTube catch up?</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>From Impressions to Impact</strong></h3>\n<p>Advertising is undergoing a fundamental shift. The traditional metric of impressions is being replaced by performance-based models where influence is measured in revenue, not reach. Live shopping sits at the center of this evolution, transforming creators into persuasive sellers who can engage, educate and close sales in real time.</p>\n<p>For retailers, the holiday season is the perfect proving ground. Consumers are scrutinizing every dollar, so content must deliver value. Formats like “Top 10 Under $50” gift guides, product comparisons, tutorials and live Q&amp;As help shoppers feel confident. Pair that with affiliate attribution and frictionless checkout and live shopping becomes one of the most powerful holiday tools of the year.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Tipping Point is Here</strong></h3>\n<p>The U.S. live commerce market is projected to grow at <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/live-commerce-market-report?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">~37% compound annual growth rate </a>from 2025 to 2033. With creator-driven marketing embedded into Instagram, Amazon and YouTube, brands are shifting budgets from impressions to transactions.</p>\n<p>The logic is compelling: why pay for reach when you can pay for revenue? Live commerce, with affiliate mechanics at its core, solves both engagement and ROI in one motion.</p>\n<p>This isn’t a passing trend. It’s the next chapter of commerce, where performance is paramount and influence is monetized only when it converts. This holiday season will reward retailers that treat live commerce as a core revenue channel. Live shopping may be the most reliable helper of all.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p><em>Michael Jaconi is the Co-founder and CEO of </em><a href=\"https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usebutton.com%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cadam%40retailtouchpoints.com%7Cd15f78f8ad5e4637cc4b08de074929ca%7C661c8d9be19e4330b41275dce2d26154%7C0%7C0%7C638956208274425454%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C60000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=w6wCfcHDFpkttbYrAECu%2FnLrTPerkMC8ZKKnogqgXZo%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Button,</em></a><em> a mobile commerce platform that optimizes traffic for the worldʼs leading publishers, retailers and creators that depend on affiliate marketing. Button drives more than $1B in mobile commerce per month with a solution built with AI that is engineered to help Button customers generate more revenue.

Whether you liked it or not, the campaign sparked discussion and, according to American Eagle, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddm7z3p2vlo\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sales</a>, which is after all the ultimate goal. Longtime advertising executive Ellis Verdi said he’s “net positive” on the campaign.</p>\n<p>“First of all, it’s very hard to stand out in a crowded environment, so they get points for that — they definitely stood out,” Verdi shares on this week’s episode of the <a href=\"https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/podcasts/legendary-adman-ellis-verdi-on-the-art-of-retail-advertising\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Retail Remix podcast</a>. “They also did associate the individual, the personality, with the product that they’re selling; [the choice of celebrity] wasn’t totally random. And it was selling product — it was talking about and showing their product.</p>\n<p>“By the way, showing product, talking about a product — but not using price — and getting a lot of people’s attention, in and of itself is a challenge. It’s just not an easy thing to do, and they did it,” Verdi added. “<strong>I have never done a piece of advertising that was strong or good that didn’t get some kind of reaction.</strong> In fact, I was a little unhappy if I <strong>didn’t</strong> get one. When you do something pretty good, you should expect it because [it means] there’s a certain amount of truth in what you’re doing.”</p>\n\n<p>Verdi, the Founder and President of agency <a href=\"https://www.devitoverdi.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>DeVito/Verdi</strong></a>, is no stranger to controversy. He launched his agency with the now infamous “straightjacket” ad for off-price retailer <strong>Daffy’s</strong> that was so controversial it sparked protests, and has since gone on to do work for <strong>Macy’s</strong>, <strong>Kohl’s</strong>, <strong>Men’s Wearhouse</strong>, <strong>Meijer</strong> and many others.</p>\n<p>His bottom line is that controversy isn’t bad if it comes from a place of honesty, and he thinks retail advertising has gone too far recently into down-funnel price-focused plays.

The Ebay x Twiggy campaign, developed as part of Vogue World London in 2023, was honored with a first-ever Luxury and Lifestyle Cannes Lions award.</p>\n<p>Now the partners will work together to <strong>integrate even more closely at cultural tentpole moments and with expanded storytelling in Condé Nast’s publications.</strong> Future initiatives also will broaden the partnership beyond fashion and luxury, underscoring both brands’ ambition to “lead the next era of sustainable style and authenticated resale,” according to a press release from Condé Nast.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ebay Wants to Be Fashion’s First Choice for Secondhand</strong></h2>\n<p>There was a time when Ebay was effectively the only game in town for online resale, but the platform faces lots of competition today, particularly in fashion, where newer competitors such as <strong>ThredUp, Poshmark</strong> and <strong>Rebag </strong>are rapidly gaining ground.

The baby and children’s apparel retailer, which operates <strong>1,000+</strong> stores total, also plans to cut about <strong>300</strong> office positions, or <strong>15%</strong> of its corporate workforce, by the end of 2025. Additionally, Carters is looking to make more than <strong>$10 million</strong> in annual spending reductions across multiple categories, with these savings beginning in 2026.</p>\n<p>“Our third quarter performance reflected continued improvement in U.S. retail business demand as we achieved positive comparable sales and improved pricing for the second consecutive quarter,” said Douglas Palladini, CEO and President of Carter’s in a statement discussing the retailer’s Q3 financial results. “However, elevated product costs, in part due to the impact of higher tariffs, as well as additional investment, weighed meaningfully on our profitability.</p>\n<p>“While we are steadying our business in 2025, there’s still meaningful work to do for Carter’s to unlock its full potential in terms of exceeding both consumer and shareholder expectations,” Palladini added. “We are pursuing several initiatives, including closing low-margin retail stores, right-sizing our organization and honing product choices, which we believe will generate significant savings, improve overall cost structure and provide investment capacity.”</p>\n<p>For Q3, Carter’s net sales decreased by <strong>0.1%</strong> to <strong>$757.8 million</strong>, compared to <strong>$758.5 million </strong>during Q3 2024. Sales results were brought down by a net sales decrease of <strong>5.1%</strong> in the U.S. wholesale segment, but offset by U.S. retail and international segment sales increases of <strong>2.6% </strong>and <strong>4.9%</strong>, respectively. Retail comparable net sales increased <strong>2%</strong> during this period compared to the same period last year.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/data-analytics/how-carters-is-evolving-with-the-needs-of-gen-z-parents\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">December 2024</a> Carter’s implemented a fresh direction and new product assortments as it sought to appeal to the new cohort of Gen Z parents.

Grubhub’s <strong>20 million</strong> customers can now order from Instacart’s network of more than <strong>1,000</strong> national, regional and local grocery retailers directly through the Grubhub app and website.</p>\n<p>The experience begins rolling out on Grubhub today and will be available nationwide, where Instacart grocery retailers and services are available, by the end of October. Customers also will gain <strong>access to order from select pharmacies</strong> through the partnership in the coming months.</p>\n<p>Grubhub and Instacart, along with competitors <strong>DoorDash</strong> and <strong>Uber Eats</strong>, have been consistently ratcheting up the ante in the hyper-competitive arena of instant delivery for the past few years. Regular announcements from all <strong>four</strong> companies tout new technology and new retail partnerships, both with grocers and across other verticals.</p>\n<p>DoorDash, for example, <a href=\"https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/fulfillment-last-mile/doordash-launches-fulfillment-services-party-city-cvs-among-first-to-trial\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced last month</a> a nationwide expansion of its partnership with <strong>Kroger</strong> as well as the debut of a new fulfillment service for retailers, while Uber Eats has added <strong>Hibbett</strong>, <strong>Best Buy</strong>, <strong>Dollar Tree</strong> and <strong>Dollar General </strong>to its roster over the last <a href=\"https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/features/news-briefs/hibbett-partners-with-uber-eats-for-delivery-of-sneakers-and-athletic-fashion\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">three months</a>. This new pairing of Grubhub and Instacart may mark an important turning point in the ongoing battle for delivery dominance.</p>\n<p>“With our unmatched selection of grocers and our leading technology and fulfillment capabilities, we’re helping Grubhub expand its platform and reach,” said Ryan Hamburger, VP of Commercial Partnerships at Instacart in a statement. “It’s another way we’re a true grocery technology enablement company — continuously driving value for our retail partners by powering seamless grocery experiences wherever people shop online.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Grubhub Offers Grocery Specials to Celebrate Instacart Partnership</strong></h2>\n<p>The new experience is hosted on Grubhub, with orders fulfilled and delivered by Instacart shoppers. To start shopping, customers tap the Grocery icon in the Grubhub app, select a nearby store, add items to their cart and check out. Deliveries can be tracked in real time, just as with traditional Grubhub or Instacart orders.</p>\n<p>To celebrate the partnership, Grubhub+ members will enjoy special savings, including <strong>$0</strong> standard delivery fees on eligible grocery orders of <strong>$25</strong> or more from participating retailers. All customers can get <strong>30%</strong> off up to <strong>three</strong> grocery orders of <strong>$75</strong> or more for the next <strong>three</strong> months.</p>\n<p>“This partnership marks an exciting step forward for Grubhub,” said Howard Migdal, CEO of Grubhub in a statement. “As we strengthen our grocery offering, our Grubhub+ program becomes even more powerful. By integrating Instacart into our platform, we’re making it easier than ever for customers to get everything they need, from their favorite meals to everyday essentials.”</p>\n</div>",
