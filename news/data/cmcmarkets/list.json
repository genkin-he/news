In fact it will be anything but. Spread across Wednesday and Thursday we have earnings from three major players in the AI space: <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/adobe-inc\">Adobe</a>, <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/oracle-corp\">Oracle</a> and <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/broadcom-inc\">Broadcom</a>. On top of that, the US Federal Reserve will set interest rates on Wednesday, with markets pricing in a roughly 87% probability of a quarter-point cut, according to CME FedWatch. The prospect of a rate cut is fuelling Wall Street expectations that the <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/us-spx-500-cash\">S&amp;P 500</a> could rise roughly 10% from current levels to more than 7,500 points by the end of 2026, as reported by the Financial Times. </p><h2>US Federal Reserve interest rate decision</h2><p><b>Wednesday 10 December </b><br/>\r\nMost traders expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%. The probability of a quarter-point cut has been hovering between 85-90% in recent days. However, a cut – if there is one – may not be the headline news. The most important thing could be what Fed chair Jerome Powell says in his follow-up press conference, and whether he hints at the possibility of a further cut in January. Beyond December, the market currently isn’t pricing in another cut until March. </p><p>Similarly, the dot plot –  aka the Summary of Economic Projections, the survey of Fed officials which captures their expectations for where interest rates, inflation and growth will be in the coming years – will also be closely watched. That said, official expectations could shift next year after Powell’s term ends in May. The April meeting will be his last as Fed chair. </p><p>The market will also be monitoring the number of dissenters. The rate-setting committee has been split on the question of rate cuts, with some members openly stating they are not in favour of easing monetary policy. That makes the level of dissent at this month’s meeting a key factor in gauging what the Fed might do at subsequent meetings in January, March and April. </p><p>The dollar has the most to lose from this month’s meeting, especially if the Fed comes across as more dovish (pro-cuts) than expected. And with the Bank of Japan potentially set to raise rates at its meeting a week later, the yen could benefit versus the dollar. Until about two weeks ago, the yen had spent seven months weakening against the dollar. But now – with yield differentials between US <a href=\"/en-gb/markets-treasuries\">treasuries</a> and JGBs narrowing sharply, and the Fed expected to cut interest rates – the <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/usd-jpy\">USD/JPY</a> uptrend has broken down. The pair now appears to be sitting on support around ¥154.50 per dollar. If that support breaks any time soon, USD/JPY could fall towards ¥150.</p><p><b>USD/JPY, October 2024 - present</b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_05_12_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_05_12_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_05_12_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_05_12_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_05_12_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_05_12_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_05_12_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_05_12_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_05_12_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_05_12_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_05_12_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h2>Oracle Q2 earnings</h2><p><b>Wednesday 10 December</b><br/>\r\nThe last time Oracle released quarterly results, its <a href=\"/en-gb/markets-shares\">shares</a> surged by nearly 40%. Since then, however, the stock has given back almost all those gains. It now trades at roughly $215 a share – below where it was before those results were released. The shift reflects a growing focus among investors on the company’s capital expenditure and free cash flow, which makes the upcoming second-quarter results and guidance especially significant.</p><p>Analysts expect the NYSE-listed software company to report that its Q2 earnings grew 11.4% to $1.64 a share as revenue rose 15.4% to $16.2bn. Capex is projected to have more than doubled to $8.3bn, with free cash flow down $5.1bn. Looking ahead to the third fiscal quarter, analysts expect earnings growth of 16.8% to $1.72 a share on a revenue uptick of 19.3% to $16.9bn. Capex is projected to expand to $8.9bn, with free cash flow falling a further $1.8bn.</p><p>Implied volatility for Oracle options is already around 100%, and is likely to go even higher before the company reports. This setup implies that the stock could move about 10% in either direction post-earnings. Interestingly, options positioning in Oracle is very bearish, suggesting that the shares could increase following the results as implied volatility falls and put premiums decay. On the other hand, if the results are particularly poor or the company signals plans to ramp up spending, either through higher capex or weaker-than-expected free cash flow, the market could see that as a negative, potentially sending the shares lower.</p><p>If the shares were to drop below support at around $190, they could sink further to fill a gap near $175 that was created in June. If the shares were to break to the upside, they could move towards the next area of resistance at around $245. </p><p><b>Oracle share price, November 2024 - present</b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/oracle_05_12_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/oracle_05_12_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/oracle_05_12_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/oracle_05_12_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/oracle_05_12_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/oracle_05_12_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/oracle_05_12_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/oracle_05_12_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/oracle_05_12_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/oracle_05_12_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/oracle_05_12_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h2>UK October GDP</h2><p><b>Friday 12 December</b><br/>\r\nThe UK has endured weak economic growth in 2025. Gross domestic product increased 0.7% in Q1, 0.3% in Q2, and just 0.1% in Q3. On a monthly basis, the economy contracted 0.1% in September. Economists expect a flat reading for October – an improvement on the previous month but hardly an encouraging one. </p><p>The country’s growth struggles support the case for a Bank of England rate cut at its next meeting on 18 December. The market is pricing in a more than 90% chance of a quarter-point cut to help stimulate the economy. The prospect of a rate cut has weighed on the pound, although it has recently rebounded somewhat against the dollar. A better-than-expected GDP print could push <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/gbp-usd\">GBP/USD</a> above resistance at $1.335, and possibly back up to $1.35 if the Fed signals an intention to keep cutting rates. However, a failure to push through resistance at $1.335 could see GBP/USD retest the recent lows around $1.305. </p><p><b>GBP/USD, April 2025 - present </b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_05_12_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_05_12_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_05_12_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_05_12_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_05_12_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_05_12_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_05_12_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_05_12_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_05_12_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_05_12_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_05_12_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h1>Economic and company events calendar</h1><p>Major upcoming economic announcements and scheduled US and UK company reports include:</p><h2>Sunday 7 December</h2><p>• Japan: Q3 gross domestic product (GDP)</p><h2>Monday 8 December</h2><p>• China: November exports, imports and trade balance<br/>\r\n• Eurozone: December Sentix investor confidence index <br/>\r\n• Germany: October industrial production <br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Compass Minerals (Q4)</p><h2>Tuesday 9 December</h2><p>• Australia: Reserve Bank of Australia interest rate decision<br/>\r\n• Germany: October trade balance<br/>\r\n• UK: November like-for-like retail sales<br/>\r\n• US: September and October JOLTS job openings<br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Ashtead (Q2), AutoZone (Q1), Chemring (FY), GameStop (Q3), Moonpig (FY)</p><h2>Wednesday 10 December</h2><p>• Canada: Bank of Canada interest rate decision<br/>\r\n• China: November consumer price index (CPI) <br/>\r\n• US: Federal Reserve interest rate decision<br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Adobe (Q4), Oracle (Q2), Synopsys (Q4)</p><h2>Thursday 11 December</h2><p>• Australia: November unemployment rate and employment change<br/>\r\n• Switzerland: Swiss National Bank interest rate decision <br/>\r\n• US: November producer price index (PPI), weekly initial jobless claims <br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Broadcom (Q4), Ciena (Q4), Costco (Q1), Lululemon (Q3)</p><h2>Friday 12 December</h2><p>• France: November CPI<br/>\r\n• Germany: November CPI<br/>\r\n• UK: October GDP <br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Johnson Outdoors (Q4)</p><p><i>Note: While we check all dates carefully to ensure that they are correct at the time of writing, the above announcements are subject to change.</i></p><p> </p><!--START-WIDGET-62FA3159-F784-446C-BEEF-153F0A7A21EF--><!--END-WIDGET-62FA3159-F784-446C-BEEF-153F0A7A21EF--><!--START-WIDGET-624479DD-930C-497F-A09D-8E9B0A7A21EF--><!--END-WIDGET-624479DD-930C-497F-A09D-8E9B0A7A21EF--><p></p></div>",

Although US government agencies are up and running again after the shutdown, economic data releases are still not on a normal schedule, so there will be no JOLTS or <a href=\"/en-gb/trading-guides/learn-non-farm-payrolls-trading\">non-farm payrolls</a> reports as one would expect in the first week of a new month. That matters because the US Federal Reserve, which will meet to set interest rates on Wednesday 10 December, will have to rely on alternative data points to gauge the health of the US economy. These include the upcoming purchasing managers’ index (PMI) readings from the Institute of Supply Management (ISM), offering insights into the health of the manufacturing and services sectors, and private sector employment data from payroll processing firm ADP. Meanwhile the current earnings season is winding down, but a few multi-billion dollar businesses are still to report, including cloud software company <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/salesforce-inc\">Salesforce</a>. </p><h2>US November ISM data</h2><p><b>Monday 1 December (manufacturing PMI)<br/>\r\nWednesday 3 December (services PMI)</b><br/>\r\nThe US manufacturing sector has been in contraction – as indicated by readings below 50 – since March. In contrast, the services sector has been in expansion territory, with readings above 50, in every month of this year but May. As far as the Fed’s upcoming interest rate decision is concerned, the prices paid and employment data for both the manufacturing and services subcomponents may offer some insights into the path of inflation and the labour market, both of which are under scrutiny from policymakers and the market.</p><p>If the data supports a rate cut, then the euro may rise as the US dollar weakens. The technical chart below suggests that <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/eur-usd\">EUR/USD</a> has formed a double bottom, though further data is needed to confirm the pattern. That confirmation could come if EUR/USD rises above $1.165 in the near term. The relative strength index (RSI) is trending higher, signalling that a trend change may be underway. A breakout above the neckline of the double bottom pattern near $1.165 could send the pair back to $1.176.</p><p><b>EUR/USD, May 2025 - present</b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_27_11_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_27_11_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_27_11_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_27_11_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_27_11_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_27_11_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_27_11_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_27_11_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_27_11_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_27_11_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_27_11_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h2>US November ADP jobs report</h2><p><b>Wednesday 3 December</b><br/>\r\nThe US labour market is transmitting mixed signals. While the ADP data for October was better than expected, the bigger picture of the past six months is one of weakness. If the Fed cuts interest rates because the jobs market is softening, then <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/gold-cash\">gold</a> could receive a boost, supported by lower interest rates and a weaker dollar.</p><p>Gold has been consolidating over the past few weeks and is now very close to breaking out and moving higher again.

Markets will also close early on Friday. With limited trading days, volatility may rise and global liquidity could be thinner than usual. In the UK, attention will turn to the autumn Budget on Wednesday. Speculation continues over what chancellor Rachel Reeves will announce, with the prospect of higher taxes – in one form another – among the possibilities. The uncertainty appears to be weighing on the pound, which may come under further pressure depending on the Budget’s details. It’s certainly something to watch in this eventful week.</p><h2><a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/dell-technologies\">Dell</a> Q3 earnings</h2><p><b>Tuesday 25 November</b><br/>\r\nAnalysts expect Dell to report that third-quarter earnings increased 15% year-on-year to $2.47 a share as revenue rose an estimated 11.3% to $27.1bn. Looking ahead to Q4, analysts forecast earnings growth of 20.4% to $3.23 a share, with revenue rising 15.3% to $27.6bn. </p><p>Options markets imply traders are expecting the technology firm’s share price to move by an average of 9.5% in either direction after the earnings announcement. Dell shares fell 1.7% on Thursday to end the day at $117.40. So far in 2025, the stock – which is a component of the <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/us-ndaq-100-cash\">Nasdaq</a> 100 – has gained just 0.8%. But that essentially sideways shift could be about to take on a different shape. </p><p>While implied volatility for Dell options expiring on Friday 28 November is extremely high, overall option positioning in Dell is quite bearish. This suggests that, once Dell has reported its results, the shares could rise – something we haven’t seen very often in discussions of possible earnings outcomes.</p><p>Technical analysis indicates that Dell shares are resting on a crucial support level near $118. If this support breaks, the stock could drop to $108. However, it is worth noting that the stock is approaching oversold levels, with a <a href=\"/en-gb/trading-guides/relative-strength-index\">relative strength index</a> (RSI) reading of 34 and the share price near the lower Bollinger Band. A dip before the earnings announcement, followed by a rebound afterwards, remains possible. But if the $118 area holds, the stock could rally back towards its mid-November level of roughly $130. </p><p><b>Dell share price, September 2024 - present</b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/dell_21_11_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/dell_21_11_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/dell_21_11_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/dell_21_11_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/dell_21_11_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/dell_21_11_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/dell_21_11_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/dell_21_11_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/dell_21_11_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/dell_21_11_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/dell_21_11_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h2>US economic data</h2><p><b>Tuesday 25 November and Wednesday 26 November</b><br/>\r\nWith the US government shutdown now over, the economic data taps are being turned back on and numbers are going to gush out. A belated jobs report released on Thursday 20 November showed that the US economy added a greater-than-expected 119,000 jobs in September. In the coming week we can look forward to September retail sales and producer price data on Tuesday, followed by the October personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index and Q3 GDP figures on Wednesday. </p><p>Although some of these reports are more than a month old, they remain important because they will shape the Federal Reserve's thinking on whether to proceed with an interest rate cut in December. Currently, the market is pricing in a roughly 40% chance that the Fed will cut rates next month. The odds have fluctuated over the past few weeks as several Fed officials have come out in opposition to a cut.</p><p>The chatter around rate cuts is likely to continue to impact <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/gbp-usd\">GBP/USD</a>. As already mentioned, the British pound has weakened amid uncertainty around the upcoming Budget, and it could fall further versus the dollar if upcoming data releases show the US economy to be performing well. The pair has dipped below support at $1.31 and crucially, from a technical analysis perspective, it has broken to the downside of a bear flag – a move that typically signals the resumption of the preceding downtrend. An extension of this pattern could imply a slide towards approximately $1.2788, with stronger support near $1.2715.</p><p><b>GBP/USD, December 2024 - present</b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_21_11_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_21_11_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_21_11_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_21_11_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_21_11_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_21_11_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_21_11_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_21_11_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_21_11_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_21_11_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_21_11_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h2>Australia, Tokyo inflation</h2><p><b>Wednesday 26 November (Australia October CPI)<br/>\r\nThursday 27 November (Tokyo November CPI)</b><br/>\r\nThis pair of consumer price index (CPI) readings could have an impact on the Australian dollar-Japanese yen currency cross. <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/aud-jpy\">AUD/JPY</a> is often seen as a global risk-on/risk-off gauge, since AUD is sensitive to global growth and investor optimism, while JPY is a traditional safe-haven currency that strengthens during times of uncertainty. When global risk appetite increases (risk-on), AUD/JPY tends to rise as traders buy the growth-sensitive AUD and sell JPY. Conversely, when fear prevails (risk-off), investors flee to the safe-haven JPY, selling AUD and causing AUD/JPY to fall. </p><p>In the past two weeks, AUD/JPY has risen from around ¥99 per Australian dollar to around ¥101, largely due to political issues in Japan. Anything that further strengthens AUD could put additional pressure on JPY. For example, if the Tokyo CPI print – widely considered a leading indicator of Japan’s overall CPI as it is published weeks before the nationwide reading – were to come in hotter than expected, it could push bond yields higher and increase market concerns about the fiscal package that Japan’s new prime minister Sanae Takaichi is looking to implement. That could drive AUD/JPY even higher. </p><p>Currently, AUD/JPY is approaching a key resistance level around ¥102.5. If it breaks through that level, it could lead to a significant weakening of the yen, potentially sending the pair up towards ¥105.50. </p><p><b>AUD/JPY, March 2023 - present </b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/audjpy_21_11_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/audjpy_21_11_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/audjpy_21_11_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/audjpy_21_11_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/audjpy_21_11_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/audjpy_21_11_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/audjpy_21_11_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/audjpy_21_11_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/audjpy_21_11_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/audjpy_21_11_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/audjpy_21_11_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h1>Economic and company events calendar</h1><p>Major upcoming economic announcements and scheduled US and UK company reports include:</p><h2>Monday 24 November</h2><p>• Germany: November IFO business sentiment index <br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Agilent Technologies (Q4), Keysight Technologies (Q4), Symbotic (Q4), Zoom Communications (Q3)</p><h2>Tuesday 25 November</h2><p>• Germany: Q3 gross domestic product (GDP)<br/> \n• US: September retail sales, September producer price index (PPI), November consumer confidence index<br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Alibaba (Q3), Analog Devices (Q4), Autodesk (Q3), Best Buy (Q3), Burlington Stores (Q3), Compass (FY), Cranswick (HY), Dell Technologies (Q3), Dick's Sporting Goods (Q3), EasyJet (FY), HP (Q4), NetApp (Q2), Nutanix (Q1), Telecom Plus (HY), Workday (Q3), Zscaler (Q1)</p><h2>Wednesday 26 November</h2><p>• Australia: October consumer price index (CPI)<br/>\r\n• New Zealand: Reserve Bank of New Zealand interest rate decision, Q3 retail sales<br/>\r\n• UK: Autumn Budget<br/>\r\n• US: October personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, Q3 flash GDP<br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Deere &amp; Co (Q4), Pets At Home (HY)</p><h2>Thursday 27 November</h2><p>• Eurozone: November business climate survey, November consumer confidence index<br/>\r\n• Germany: December GfK consumer confidence survey<br/>\r\n• Japan: November Tokyo CPI<br/>\r\n• US: Markets closed (Thanksgiving Day) <br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Halfords (HY), Pennon (HY)</p><h2>Friday 28 November</h2><p>• Canada: Q3 GDP <br/>\r\n• France: November flash CPI<br/>\r\n• Germany: October retail sales, November flash CPI <br/>\r\n• Switzerland: Q3 GDP <br/>\r\n• US: Markets closed from 1pm (New York time)<br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: <i>No major scheduled earnings announcements</i></p><p> </p><p><i>Note: While we check all dates carefully to ensure that they are correct at the time of writing, the above announcements are subject to change.</i></p><p> </p><!--START-WIDGET-62FA3159-F784-446C-BEEF-153F0A7A21EF--><!--END-WIDGET-62FA3159-F784-446C-BEEF-153F0A7A21EF--><!--START-WIDGET-624479DD-930C-497F-A09D-8E9B0A7A21EF--><!--END-WIDGET-624479DD-930C-497F-A09D-8E9B0A7A21EF--><p></p></div>",

As federal offices reopen, the flow of US economic data – covering inflation, jobs and more – should resume in the coming days. The precise timing of data releases remains unknown, so it’ll be important to pay attention to any announcements on release dates, and to be in a position to react when the numbers come in. While we may get the September jobs report by the end of next week, there have also been warnings that the October and November reports may never be released as data was not collected in full during the shutdown. It’s therefore possible that we could be left with a two-month gap in official economic figures, potentially complicating traders’ models. </p><p>Amid this uncertainty, one scheduled announcement that is sure to capture the market’s attention in the coming week is <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/nvidia-corp\">Nvidia</a>’s third-quarter results, which we preview below. Also coming up are the latest consumer price index (CPI) readings from the UK and Japan. </p><h2>UK October CPI</h2><p><b>Wednesday 19 November</b><br/>\r\nThe probability the market is placing on a quarter-point rate cut by the Bank of England at its meeting on 18 December has increased to roughly 80% following a weaker-than-expected UK labour market report, which showed the unemployment rate rising to 5%. So, unless the CPI print for October comes in significantly higher than the expected 3.7% (following three consecutive months at 3.8%), it seems likely that the BoE will lower its benchmark interest rate to 3.75% next month in a bid to stimulate the economy. </p><p>Retail sales data, out on Friday 21 November, will also help shape the Bank’s monetary policy decision, though probably to a lesser extent than the inflation numbers. </p><p>A rate cut could put further pressure on the pound, with <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/gbp-usd\">GBP/USD</a> already struggling to break back above resistance at $1.3170. If the pair manages to clear that level, it could rise towards $1.33. However, if an in-line or cooler-than-expected CPI reading locks in market expectations of a December rate cut, there is potential for the pound to slip from current levels towards $1.27, a rate not seen since early April.</p><p><b>GBP/USD, February 2025 - present</b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_14_11_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_14_11_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_14_11_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_14_11_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_14_11_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_14_11_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_14_11_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_14_11_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_14_11_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_14_11_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_14_11_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h2>Nvidia Q3 earnings</h2><p><b>Wednesday 19 November</b><br/>\r\nNvidia will have the stage to itself when it reveals its results after the close of trading on Wednesday. Analysts expect the chipmaker to report that Q3 earnings rose 53.8% to $1.25 a share as revenue increased an estimated 56.3% to $54.8bn. Gross profit margin is forecast to have tightened to 73.5%, compared to 75% in the year-ago quarter.</p><p>Looking ahead to the fiscal fourth quarter, analysts expect revenue to grow 56.1% to $61.4bn, delivering earnings growth of 60% to $1.42 a share. They see gross margin expanding to 74.5% from 73.5% a year ago.</p><p>The <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/us-ndaq-100-cash\">Nasdaq</a>-listed tech giant has a history of beating Wall Street expectations. Investors have become accustomed to Nvidia beating its own revenue guidance by $2bn to $3bn and then raising guidance for the next quarter by a further $2bn to $3bn above analysts’ forecasts. Because of this pattern, it may take significantly better-than-expected numbers to boost the Nvidia share price, which closed at $186.86 on Thursday, up 35% year-to-date. </p><p>It should come as no surprise that implied volatility for Nvidia stock is quite high, currently around 70%. These implied volatility levels are likely to increase further ahead of the results. From an options perspective, the stock is – again unsurprisingly – positioned bullishly. Given this setup, the shares could come under pressure unless the results exceed estimates by even more than the typical $2bn-$3bn beat.</p><p>Technical analysis indicates that the Nvidia share price has been holding above a support level around $183, which also aligns with an important options-related support zone at $185. But if the stock moves lower after the results, there is a chance it could fall to around $165 (the area highlighted by the blue bar on the below chart), as that is the next major technical support level. Momentum, as indicated by the <a href=\"/en-gb/trading-guides/relative-strength-index\">relative strength index</a> (RSI) is weakening and trending lower – it’s at about 46 at the time of writing. Meanwhile, the lower Bollinger Band is currently around $175. Taken together, these indicators suggest that there may be ample room for the <a href=\"/en-gb/markets-shares\">shares</a> to fall following the results to between $165 and $175.</p><p><b>Nvidia share price, June 2025 - present</b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/nvda_14_11_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/nvda_14_11_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/nvda_14_11_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/nvda_14_11_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/nvda_14_11_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/nvda_14_11_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/nvda_14_11_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/nvda_14_11_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/nvda_14_11_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/nvda_14_11_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/nvda_14_11_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h2>Japan October CPI</h2><p><b>Thursday 20 November </b><br/>\r\nJapan’s CPI report comes at a crucial moment for the Japanese yen, which has been weakening again as the Bank of Japan holds off on raising interest rates.

This means attention will turn elsewhere, particularly to the UK, with the autumn Budget due in two weeks’ time. It will be important to monitor developments in the UK labour market (Tuesday) and economic growth, with Thursday’s preliminary Q3 GDP reading one to watch. </div><div> </div><div>US earnings reports are also slowing to a trickle, with companies such as <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/cisco-systems-inc\">Cisco Systems</a> and <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/walt-disney-co\">Walt Disney</a> releasing results, while newer AI players like <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/coreweave-inc\">CoreWeave</a> are also likely to attract investors’ attention. </div><div> </div><h2>UK October labour report </h2><div><b>Tuesday 11 November</b></div><div>Unemployment data in the UK accelerated in June and July, but slowed sharply in August. As a result, the employment picture in September becomes particularly important, as the Bank of England now appears poised to cut rates at its next meeting in December, following the close call in November. Weaker data could seal the case for a rate cut, which would be a negative sign for the British pound, and could see it retrace all the way back to $1.271.</div><div> </div><div>Recently, the pound fell below support at $1.31 and has since been consolidating sideways, which is to be expected given its oversold condition  with the relative strength index (RSI) dropping below 30, and the currency trading beneath its lower Bollinger Band. However, weaker data may lead to further declines and additional weakness against the dollar. Conversely, stronger data could allow the pound to rebound and retest resistance around $1.3160, although a breakout above resistance appears unlikely. </div><div> </div><h3><a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/gbp-usd\">GBP/USD</a> chart, February-6 November 2025</h3><p></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd071125_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd071125_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd071125_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd071125_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd071125_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd071125_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd071125_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd071125_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd071125_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd071125_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd071125.webp\"/></picture><sup>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</sup><h2>Cisco Systems Q1 results</h2><div><b>Wednesday 12 November</b></div><div>The NASDAQ-listed networking company is expected to report fiscal first-quarter 2026 earnings growth of 7.9% year-on-year to $0.98 per share. Revenue is forecast to increase by 6.7% to $14.8bn, while gross margins are expected to decline to 68.1%, down from 69.3% a year earlier.

These five companies together account for around 45% of the NASDAQ 100's total market capitalisation weighting, and nearly 25% of the S&amp;P 500's total market capitalisation. These tech giants are likely to help determine how the US stock <a href=\"/en-gb/markets-indices\">indices</a> perform for the rest of the year. </p><p>While most of the attention will be on earnings, traders should keep a close eye on a trio of important central bank meetings this week, from the US Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, and European Central Bank.</p><h2>Fed, BoJ, ECB meetings</h2><p><b>Wednesday 29 October </b><br/>\r\nThe US Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points this week, while the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the European Central Bank (ECB) are predicted to remain on hold. However, the key focus of the BoJ meeting will be on any discussion or hint of a rate hike in December. Although the odds of a December rate increase remain low, the election of a new prime minister and the easing of trade tensions suggest that the opportunity for a move could be approaching. </p><p>The ECB, meanwhile, is not expected to make any changes, but the market will be looking to determine whether the central bank is truly finished with its rate-cutting cycle. The euro remains more vulnerable to further weakness against the US dollar than the yen. The <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/eur-usd\">EUR/USD</a> pair is currently sitting right on support at $1.161. If the ECB manages to convincingly signal that it has completed its rate cuts, the euro may rebound and potentially start to rise. However, if the bank’s messaging proves unconvincing, it could lead to the euro breaking support, with a possible move towards $1.14. </p><h3><b>EUR/USD chart, April-23 October 2025</b></h3><p></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_241025_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_241025_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_241025_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_241025_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_241025_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_241025_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_241025_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_241025_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_241025_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_241025_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_241025.webp\"/></picture><sup>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</sup><h2><a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/meta-platforms-inc\">Meta Platforms</a> Q3 results</h2><p><b>Wednesday 29 October </b><br/>\r\nThe NASDAQ-listed social media company is forecast to report a 10.8% increase in earnings to $6.68 per share in the third quarter, while revenue is projected to rise by 21.6% to $49.4bn. Capital expenditure (capex) is expected to more than double to $19.8bn, up from $8.3bn a year earlier. For Q4, analysts anticipate earnings growth of less than 1%, to $8.09 per share, with revenue projected to increase by 18.1% to $57.1bn, while capex is forecast to surge by 68.6% to $24.3bn. </p><p>The stock is expected to move by around 7% following the earnings release.

At present, the stock is trading near the upper end of that range, around $736, suggesting that exceptionally strong earnings and favourable guidance might be required to propel it meaningfully above $750. Additionally, Meta’s <a href=\"/en-gb/trading-guides/relative-strength-index\">relative strength index</a> (RSI) has been trending lower, signalling a potential bearish divergence. A break below $712 would confirm the double-top formation and a break of the neckline, potentially paving the way for a decline towards the $675–$650 range. </p><h3><b>Meta Platforms share price, March-23 October 2025</b></h3><p></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/meta_241025_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/meta_241025_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/meta_241025_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/meta_241025_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/meta_241025_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/meta_241025_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/meta_241025_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/meta_241025_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/meta_241025_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/meta_241025_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/meta_241025.webp\"/></picture><sup>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</sup><h2>Microsoft Q1 results</h2><p><b>Wednesday 29 October </b><br/>\r\nFirst-quarter earnings for the NASDAQ-listed software company are expected to rise by 10.5% to $3.67 per share, while revenue is projected to increase by 14.7% to $75.3bn.

However, some private-sector reports are due this week, which could provide a sense of what is happening in the economy. Additionally, there will be a Bank of England rate decision later in the week, and the US earnings season will continue, although most of the major mega-cap companies have now reported.</p><h2>US Economic Data </h2><p><b>Monday, 3 November</b></p><p>The ISM Manufacturing Report will be released, followed by the ADP Employment Report and the ISM Services Report on Wednesday, 5 November. Together, these three reports should help shed light on the employment picture, overall economic activity, and the health of the US economy. Additionally, the price indices in the ISM reports may offer insight into broader inflation trends. This data is likely to have a significant impact on <a href=\"/en-gb/forex-trading\">currency markets</a>, with the USD/JPY in particular focus now that the Bank of Japan has once again stalled on raising rates.</p><p>The yen appears to be weakening against the dollar as it breaks above a rising channel and approaches a key resistance level around 154.5. Should it move beyond this level, the yen could be on course to weaken further, towards 158 against the dollar. The RSI also indicates that momentum has shifted, pointing to continued yen weakness versus the dollar. However, it is worth noting that the RSI is nearing 70, which may suggest a pause around the 154.5 level is possible first, with stronger US economic data likely required to drive additional yen depreciation.</p><h3>USD/JPY CHART AUGUST 2024 -  OCTOBER 2025</h3><p></p><img src=\"blob:https://bakery.cmc.local/47a1e3a3-4a92-4ee8-abea-c9987bb5e0d8\"/><sup><span>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</span></sup><h2>Palantir Earning</h2><p><b>Monday, 3 November</b></p><p><b> </b>The NASDAQ-listed technology company is expected to report third-quarter earnings growth of 68.4% year-on-year to $0.17 per share, on revenue growth of more than 50% to $1.1 billion. For the fourth quarter, analysts forecast earnings of $0.19 per share, up 36.3%, and revenue of $1.2 billion, up 43.9%. The options market is pricing in 10% post-earnings move in the stock.</p><p>Implied volatility levels for Palantir are extremely elevated, likely exceeding 100% for options expiring in the week of 7 November, by the time the company reports on Monday after the close of trading. Option positioning is also bullish, with a large gamma level at 200 expected to provide strong resistance, and overall delta positioning is firmly positive. However, as seen in similar cases, extreme bullish positioning can lead to negative market-maker flows as implied volatility declines and as call premiums decay, potentially exerting downward pressure on the <a href=\"/en-gb/markets-shares\">shares</a>.</p><p>Palantir has struggled to break above the $200 level and has largely remained range-bound around that area since August. If the stock manages to surpass $200, there appears to be room for it to rise towards $210, based on current option positioning.</p><p>From a technical perspective, however, the stock is nearing overbought territory ahead of earnings. With the shares trading above the upper Bollinger Band and the RSI approaching 70, the risk of a reversal is increasing. A bearish divergence has also formed, with the RSI making lower highs while the share price has made higher lows. This setup suggests that earnings could act as a catalyst for a potential reversal, which might see the shares fall back towards the lower end of their trading range, around $160, or possibly as low as $145.</p><h3>PALANTIR TEHCNOLOGIES INC.

As a result, investors will be listening closely for any dovish signals from the BOE at this meeting. Any indication of a near-term rate cut could have a significant negative impact on the British pound, particularly now that it appears the Federal Reserve may not cut rates as aggressively as markets had initially anticipated.</p><p>The pound is currently on the verge of breaking a major support level around 1.31, and if that occurs, it could lead to a decline towards 1.275. The 1.31 area appears to be acting as a neckline for what looks like either a head-and-shoulders pattern or a potential double top — in either case, it is a critical level to watch.  </p><p><a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/gbp-usd\">GBP/USD</a> CHART, JANUARY 2025 - OCTOBER 2025</p><p></p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"file:////Users/gzeguile/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image002.png\"/><img src=\"blob:https://bakery.cmc.local/0ae426c4-c1b2-4476-8ef1-6ca5ce948ed6\"/><sup><span>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</span></sup><p> </p><!--START-WIDGET-62FA3159-F784-446C-BEEF-153F0A7A21EF--><!--END-WIDGET-62FA3159-F784-446C-BEEF-153F0A7A21EF--><!--START-WIDGET-624479DD-930C-497F-A09D-8E9B0A7A21EF--><!--END-WIDGET-624479DD-930C-497F-A09D-8E9B0A7A21EF--><p></p></div>",

This suggests that if the VIX 1-Day remains elevated going into the CPI report on Friday, there is a strong possibility that the stock market could rally – unless the data comes in significantly worse than expected.</div><div> </div><div><b>Cboe 1-Day Volatility Index, 18 August-16 October 2025</b></div><div><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/1dayvolindex_171025_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/1dayvolindex_171025_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/1dayvolindex_171025_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/1dayvolindex_171025_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/1dayvolindex_171025_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/1dayvolindex_171025_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/1dayvolindex_171025_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/1dayvolindex_171025_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/1dayvolindex_171025_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/1dayvolindex_171025_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/1dayvolindex_171025.webp\"/></picture><sup>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</sup></div><div> </div><h2>Economic and company events calendar</h2><div>Major upcoming economic announcements and scheduled US and UK company reports include:</div><div> </div><h3>Monday 20 October</h3><div>•<span></span>China: GDP (Q3)</div><div>•<span></span>UK: Rightmove house price index (Oct)</div><div>•<span></span><b>Results</b>: WR Berkley (Q3)</div><div> </div><h3>Tuesday 21 October</h3><div>•<span></span>Canada: CPI (Sep)</div><div>•<span></span>UK: Public sector net borrowing (Sep)</div><div>•<span></span><b>Results</b>: Coca-Cola (Q3), Netflix (Q3), Phillip Morris International (Q3), RTX (Q3), Texas Instruments (Q3)</div><div> </div><h3>Wednesday 22 October</h3><div>•<span></span>UK: CPI (Sep), producer price index (Sep), retail price index (Sep)</div><div>•<span></span><b>Results</b>: AT&amp;T (Q3), Barclays (Q3), GE Vernova (Q3), International Business Machines (Q3), Lam Research (Q1), Sofcat (FY),  Tesla (Q3), Thermo Fisher Scientific (Q3)</div><div> </div><h3>Thursday 23 October</h3><div>•<span></span>Australia: Manufacturing PMI (Oct); services PMI (Oct)</div><div>•<span></span>Eurozone: Consumer confidence (Oct)</div><div>•<span></span>US: Existing home sales (Sep); new home sales (Sep)</div><div>•<span></span><b>Results</b>: Blackstone (Q3), Intel (Q3), Lloyds Banking Group (Q3), T-Mobile (Q3) </div><div> </div><h3>Friday 24 October</h3><div>•<span></span>Eurozone: Manufacturing PMI (Oct); services PMI (Oct)</div><div>•<span></span>UK: Consumer confidence (Oct); retail sales (Sep); manufacturing PMI (Oct); services PMI (Oct)</div><div>•<span></span>US: Consumer price index (Sep); manufacturing PMI (Oct); services PMI (Oct); Michigan consumer sentiment index (Oct)</div><div>•<span></span><b>Results</b>: NatWest Group (Q3), Procter &amp; Gamble (Q1)</div><div> </div><div><i>Note: While we check all dates carefully to ensure that they are correct at the time of writing, the above announcements are subject to change.</i></div><!--START-WIDGET-62FA3159-F784-446C-BEEF-153F0A7A21EF--><!--END-WIDGET-62FA3159-F784-446C-BEEF-153F0A7A21EF--><!--START-WIDGET-624479DD-930C-497F-A09D-8E9B0A7A21EF--><!--END-WIDGET-624479DD-930C-497F-A09D-8E9B0A7A21EF--><p></p></div>",

Consequently, the timely arrival of a fresh earnings season may move markets even more than usual. <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/us-banks\">US banks</a> kick things off, with <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/jpmorgan-chase-co\">JPMorgan</a> – the largest US bank by assets under management and market capitalisation – and <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/goldman-sachs-group-inc\">Goldman Sachs</a> among the major financial institutions set to report third-quarter results on Tuesday. In Britain, the release of monthly gross domestic product (GDP) figures on Thursday will put economic growth in the spotlight ahead of the Budget on 26 November.</p><h2>JPMorgan Chase Q3 earnings</h2><p><b>Tuesday 14 October </b><br/>\r\nAnalysts expect JPMorgan to report that Q3 earnings grew 10.5% year-on-year to $4.83 a share, as revenue increased an estimated 4.8% to $45.39bn. Net interest income – a measure of profitability as it represents the difference between the interest earned on assets (eg, loans) and the interest paid on liabilities (eg, customer savings) – is projected to be up 3.1% at $24.1bn. Analysts are also forecasting loan loss provisions of $3.1bn.</p><p>Looking ahead to Q4, the NYSE-listed megabank is expected to guide net interest income of $24.7bn, implying total net interest income of around $95.4bn for 2025 and $98.4bn for 2026. That’s based on analyst estimates of Q4 revenue growth of 2.9% to $45bn, with earnings expected to decline less than 1% to $4.78 a share. The JPMorgan Chase share price – up 27% year-to-date at $305.53, as of Thursday’s close – is anticipated to move about 4% following the Q3 results, based on options market positioning.</p><p>There is significant negative options gamma positioning around the $300 strike price, which could provide strong support for the stock, as long as the company’s results and guidance do not disappoint investors. This support area also aligns with the late-July highs, as shown on the technical chart below. However, if the stock were to fall below $300, it could open a path towards the next major level of support near $280.</p><p><b>JPMorgan Chase share price, January 2025 - present</b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/jpm_10_10_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/jpm_10_10_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/jpm_10_10_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/jpm_10_10_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/jpm_10_10_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/jpm_10_10_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/jpm_10_10_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/jpm_10_10_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/jpm_10_10_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/jpm_10_10_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/jpm_10_10_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h2>Goldman Sachs Q3 earnings</h2><p><b>Tuesday 14 October </b><br/>\r\nGoldman Sachs, which holds the largest weighting in the price-weighted <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/us-30-cash\">Dow Jones</a> Industrial Average, is expected to report that Q3 earnings soared 30.1% year-on-year to $10.99 a share, with revenue increasing 11% to $14.1bn, according to analysts. Trading income is forecast to be up 8.0% at $3.2bn. </p><p>For the fourth quarter, earnings are projected to fall 4.2% to $11.45 a share, while revenue is forecast to decline less than 1% to $13.8bn. The investment bank’s <a href=\"/en-gb/markets-shares\">shares</a> – which have gained 36% this year to close on Thursday just at a few cents shy of $780 – are expected to move by around 4.5% following the Q3 earnings announcement. Given the stock’s significant weighting in the Dow, the results could have an outsized impact on the index.</p><p>Goldman’s options positioning appears bullish, with a large build-up of call gamma at $800, which is likely to act as resistance should the stock advance after the results are released. However, the shares have formed a bearish divergence on the relative strength index (RSI), which is making lower highs while the share price itself makes higher highs within a rising megaphone pattern. Facing strong resistance around $800, the stock could undergo a post-earnings dip and may test the lower end of the megaphone pattern near $740.</p><p><b>Goldman Sachs share price, March 2023 - present</b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gs_10_10_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gs_10_10_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gs_10_10_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gs_10_10_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gs_10_10_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gs_10_10_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gs_10_10_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gs_10_10_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gs_10_10_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gs_10_10_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gs_10_10_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h2>UK August GDP</h2><p><b>Thursday 16 October </b><br/>\r\nChancellor Rachel Reeves will outline the government's tax and spending plans on Wednesday 26 November. Between now and then, investors will be paying close attention to economic readings such as GDP and productivity to assess the likely impact of the government’s plans, and whether they may leave any fiscal gaps. </p><p>After GDP growth flatlined in July, economists are expecting a meagre 0.1% month-on-month uptick for August. A weaker-than-expected GDP reading could cause anxiety among investors, leading to a rise in long-end gilt yields and a weaker pound. We’ve already seen these symptoms emerge. In September, a wider-than-expected budget deficit triggered a spike in rates and a sharp weakening of the pound.</p><p>This has put <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/gbp-usd\">GBP/USD</a> under pressure. The pair has broken support at $1.33, and on Friday morning was trading below $1.3290. Further weakness could send the pair towards $1.3170. Whether the pound falls through <i>that </i>level may depend on how quickly the UK economy is growing – if it’s growing at all. A break of support at $1.3170 risks extending the pound’s weak run and sending GBP/USD below $1.30.</p><p><b>GBP/USD, February 2025 - present </b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_10_10_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_10_10_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_10_10_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_10_10_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_10_10_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_10_10_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_10_10_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_10_10_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_10_10_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_10_10_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_10_10_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h1>Economic and company events calendar</h1><p>Major upcoming economic announcements and scheduled US and Uk company reports include:</p><h2>Monday 13 October</h2><p>• China: September exports, imports and trade balance<br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Fastenal (Q3)</p><h2>Tuesday 14 October</h2><p>• Australia: Reserve Bank of Australia meeting minutes <br/>\r\n• Eurozone: October economic sentiment index <br/>\r\n• Germany: September consumer price index (CPI)<br/>\r\n• UK: September jobs data (claimant count change, unemployment rate, employment change, average earnings)<br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Bellway (FY), BlackRock (Q3), Citigroup (Q3), Domino's Pizza (Q3), Goldman Sachs (Q3), Johnson &amp; Johnson (Q3), JPMorgan Chase (Q3), Wells Fargo (Q3), YouGov (FY)</p><h2>Wednesday 15 October</h2><p>• China: September CPI<br/>\r\n• Eurozone: August industrial production<br/>\r\n• France: September CPI <br/>\r\n• Spain: September CPI<br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Abbott Laboratories (Q3), Bank of America (Q3), Morgan Stanley (Q3), Progressive (Q3), Prologis (Q3)</p><h2>Thursday 16 October</h2><p>• Australia: September jobs data (unemployment rate  employment change, etc)<br/>\r\n• Italy: September CPI<br/>\r\n• UK: August gross domestic product (GDP) <br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Charles Schwab (Q3), Interactive Brokers (Q3), Marsh McLennan (Q3), United Airlines (Q3), Whitbread (HY)</p><h2>Friday 17 October</h2><p>• Eurozone: September harmonised CPI<br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: American Express (Q3)</p><p><i>Note: While we check all dates carefully to ensure that they are correct at the time of writing, the above announcements are subject to change.</i></p><p> </p><!--START-WIDGET-62FA3159-F784-446C-BEEF-153F0A7A21EF--><!--END-WIDGET-62FA3159-F784-446C-BEEF-153F0A7A21EF--><!--START-WIDGET-624479DD-930C-497F-A09D-8E9B0A7A21EF--><!--END-WIDGET-624479DD-930C-497F-A09D-8E9B0A7A21EF--><p></p></div>",

The shutdown – the first for seven years – has resulted in roughly 750,000 federal workers going on unpaid leave. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will not publish the September jobs figures as planned today (Friday 3 October), and other scheduled data releases are likely to be delayed or cancelled. </p><p>The absence of official data could be a double-edged sword: while many traders may welcome a break from the volatility that economic data can trigger, the market might lean more heavily on less reliable information, which could create even more volatility than usual in the near term. It’s unclear when the shutdown will end, leaving us without crucial signals about the health of the world’s largest economy for the foreseeable future. </p><p>One release that is still set to go ahead is the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index on Friday 10 October. Away from the US, it’s business as usual, with eurozone retail sales figures – out on Monday – among the releases to watch. We preview both below, alongside a look at US carrier <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/delta-air-lines-inc\">Delta Air Lines</a>’ third-quarter results. </p><h2>Eurozone August retail sales</h2><p><b>Monday 6 October </b><br/>\r\nAnalysts estimate that retail sales in the eurozone increased 0.1% month-on-month in August, a much stronger performance than the 0.5% decline in July. Eurozone retail sales have been quite volatile in recent months, with several large swings up and down, and – perhaps more importantly – a reversal of what had been a steady uptrend. The upcoming data is therefore likely to be important, with investors looking for a rebound. Retail sales serve as an indicator of consumer spending, so a high reading is generally seen as bullish for the euro, while a low increase or a decline is seen as bearish. </p><p>This means that <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/eur-usd\">EUR/USD</a> remains vulnerable to further declines. The technical setup, as shown on the chart below, looks weak. The pair has trended lower since mid-September, and the <a href=\"/en-gb/trading-guides/relative-strength-index\">relative strength index</a> (RSI) is also falling, suggesting that momentum has shifted from bullish to bearish. At this rate, EUR/USD needs to find support at $1.157, since a break below that level could risk a further weakening towards $1.14.</p><p><b>EUR/USD, January 2025 - present</b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_03_10_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_03_10_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_03_10_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_03_10_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_03_10_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_03_10_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_03_10_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_03_10_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_03_10_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_03_10_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_03_10_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h2>Delta Air Lines Q3 earnings</h2><p><b>Thursday 9 October</b><br/>\r\nDelta Air Lines is set to report that its Q3 earnings rose 1.7% year-on-year to $1.53 a share as revenue increased 2.9% to $15.0bn, based on analysts’ estimates. Looking ahead to Q4, earnings are expected to fall 12.5% year-on-year to $1.62 a share, even though revenue is projected to rise 1.2% over the period to $14.6bn. Shares of the world’s largest airline by revenue have dropped 3.4% year-to-date, closing at $57.08 on Thursday 2 October. The stock could see a post-earnings move of about 6.8%, based on options market positioning. </p><p>Options positioning is relatively bullish heading into results week, but also suggests that potential upside may be capped at around $62, where there is a significant concentration of call gamma. Meanwhile, the largest amount of put gamma sits near $50.</p><p>Technical trends indicate a more bearish outlook, as the below chart illustrates. The <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/us-spx-500-cash\">S&amp;P 500</a> constituent's stock price is in a clear downtrend and the RSI is also trending lower. Based on momentum and the prevailing trend, it seems possible that Delta’s <a href=\"/en-gb/markets-shares\">shares</a> may continue to decline following the results, unless the company delivers better-than-expected earnings or guidance. The next area of support lies around $50, a level that dates back to July and coincides with the large put gamma concentration.</p><p><b>Delta Air Lines share price, June 2024 - present</b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/delta_03_10_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/delta_03_10_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/delta_03_10_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/delta_03_10_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/delta_03_10_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/delta_03_10_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/delta_03_10_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/delta_03_10_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/delta_03_10_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/delta_03_10_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/delta_03_10_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h2>Michigan October consumer sentiment index</h2><p><b>Friday 10 October</b><br/>\r\nUS consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan’s monthly survey, has been trending lower in recent months, following a rebound from the lows of April and May. Any sign of improving consumer spending – a key driver of the US economy – could boost the dollar, which has lost ground against other major currencies in 2025. The dollar could benefit not only against the euro but also against the British pound, with <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/gbp-usd\">GBP/USD</a> having trended lower recently. </p><p>Whatever positive momentum the pound had from August to early September, as recorded by a rise in GBP/USD’s RSI during that period, now appears to have faded. The RSI has resumed its downtrend, indicating that momentum has turned bearish. Currently, the pound is holding onto support around $1.34. A break below this level could see GBP/USD weaken towards $1.317, which has acted as support on two occasions in 2025.</p><p>If, however, US consumer confidence has deteriorated further in October, it is possible that GBP/USD could rise on dollar weakness and rebound towards resistance at $1.357. That said, such an outcome seems unlikely given the prevailing trends.</p><p><b>GBP/USD, July 2024 - present </b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_03_10_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_03_10_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_03_10_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_03_10_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_03_10_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_03_10_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_03_10_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_03_10_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_03_10_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_03_10_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_03_10_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h1>Economic and company events calendar</h1><p>Major upcoming economic announcements and scheduled US and UK company reports include:</p><h2>Monday 6 October</h2><p>• Eurozone: August retail sales<br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Constellation Brands (Q2)</p><h2>Tuesday 7 October</h2><p>• Australia: October Westpac consumer confidence <br/>\r\n• Germany: August factory orders <br/>\r\n• UK: September like-for-like retail sales <br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: CVS Group (FY), McCormick &amp; Company (Q3)</p><h2>Wednesday 8 October</h2><p>• Germany: August industrial production<br/>\r\n• New Zealand: Reserve Bank of New Zealand interest rate decision <br/>\r\n• US: Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes<br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Netcall (FY)</p><h2>Thursday 9 October</h2><p>• Australia: October consumer inflation expectations<br/>\r\n• Eurozone: European Central Bank policy meeting accounts<br/>\r\n• Germany: August trade balance <br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Applied Digital (Q1), Delta Air Lines (Q3), Levi Strauss &amp; Co.
