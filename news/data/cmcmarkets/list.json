These five companies together account for around 45% of the NASDAQ 100's total market capitalisation weighting, and nearly 25% of the S&amp;P 500's total market capitalisation. These tech giants are likely to help determine how the US stock <a href=\"/en-gb/markets-indices\">indices</a> perform for the rest of the year. </p><p>While most of the attention will be on earnings, traders should keep a close eye on a trio of important central bank meetings this week, from the US Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, and European Central Bank.</p><h2>Fed, BoJ, ECB meetings</h2><p><b>Wednesday 29 October </b><br/>\r\nThe US Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points this week, while the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the European Central Bank (ECB) are predicted to remain on hold. However, the key focus of the BoJ meeting will be on any discussion or hint of a rate hike in December. Although the odds of a December rate increase remain low, the election of a new prime minister and the easing of trade tensions suggest that the opportunity for a move could be approaching. </p><p>The ECB, meanwhile, is not expected to make any changes, but the market will be looking to determine whether the central bank is truly finished with its rate-cutting cycle. The euro remains more vulnerable to further weakness against the US dollar than the yen. The <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/eur-usd\">EUR/USD</a> pair is currently sitting right on support at $1.161. If the ECB manages to convincingly signal that it has completed its rate cuts, the euro may rebound and potentially start to rise. However, if the bank’s messaging proves unconvincing, it could lead to the euro breaking support, with a possible move towards $1.14. </p><h3><b>EUR/USD chart, April-23 October 2025</b></h3><p></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_241025_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_241025_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_241025_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_241025_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_241025_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_241025_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_241025_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_241025_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_241025_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_241025_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_241025.webp\"/></picture><sup>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</sup><h2><a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/meta-platforms-inc\">Meta Platforms</a> Q3 results</h2><p><b>Wednesday 29 October </b><br/>\r\nThe NASDAQ-listed social media company is forecast to report a 10.8% increase in earnings to $6.68 per share in the third quarter, while revenue is projected to rise by 21.6% to $49.4bn. Capital expenditure (capex) is expected to more than double to $19.8bn, up from $8.3bn a year earlier. For Q4, analysts anticipate earnings growth of less than 1%, to $8.09 per share, with revenue projected to increase by 18.1% to $57.1bn, while capex is forecast to surge by 68.6% to $24.3bn. </p><p>The stock is expected to move by around 7% following the earnings release. Options positioning appears very bullish, and based on past experience, when it becomes excessively bullish, shares often move lower after results, as implied volatility resets and market makers’ hedging activity unwinds. </p><p>Meta may have formed a double-top pattern, with the neckline situated between $715 and $736. At present, the stock is trading near the upper end of that range, around $736, suggesting that exceptionally strong earnings and favourable guidance might be required to propel it meaningfully above $750. Additionally, Meta’s <a href=\"/en-gb/trading-guides/relative-strength-index\">relative strength index</a> (RSI) has been trending lower, signalling a potential bearish divergence. A break below $712 would confirm the double-top formation and a break of the neckline, potentially paving the way for a decline towards the $675–$650 range. </p><h3><b>Meta Platforms share price, March-23 October 2025</b></h3><p></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/meta_241025_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/meta_241025_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/meta_241025_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/meta_241025_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/meta_241025_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/meta_241025_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/meta_241025_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/meta_241025_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/meta_241025_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/meta_241025_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/meta_241025.webp\"/></picture><sup>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</sup><h2>Microsoft Q1 results</h2><p><b>Wednesday 29 October </b><br/>\r\nFirst-quarter earnings for the NASDAQ-listed software company are expected to rise by 10.5% to $3.67 per share, while revenue is projected to increase by 14.7% to $75.3bn. Capex is anticipated to climb by 48.7% to $22.2bn, reflecting continued investment in cloud infrastructure and AI capacity. For the fiscal second quarter, analysts expect the company to guide for revenue growth of 14.8% to $79.9bn. Capex is forecast to rise by 38.4% to $21.86bn, indicating sustained high levels of spending tied to Azure and AI-related initiatives. </p><p>The stock is expected to move by around 4.3% following the results. Options positioning appears mixed, with support around $510 and resistance near $550. The technical charts show that the shares have traded largely sideways since the company last reported results in July, with little directional momentum. Based on the implied post-earnings move, the stock may remain in this trading range even after the results.  </p><p><i>Please note: Michael Kramer and clients of Mott Capital own stock in MSFT. </i></p><h3>Microsoft share price, June-23 October 2025</h3><p></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/microsoft_241025_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/microsoft_241025_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/microsoft_241025_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/microsoft_241025_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/microsoft_241025_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/microsoft_241025_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/microsoft_241025_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/microsoft_241025_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/microsoft_241025_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/microsoft_241025_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/microsoft_241025.webp\"/></picture><sup>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</sup><h2>Economic and company events calendar</h2><p>Major upcoming economic announcements and scheduled US and UK company reports include:</p><h4>Monday 27 October</h4><p><b>US</b>: Durable goods (Sep), 2-year, 5-year treasury note auctions <br/><b>Results</b>: Cadence Design Systems (Q3)</p><h4>Tuesday 28 October</h4><p><b>UK</b>: BRC shop price index (Oct)<br/><b>US</b>: Consumer confidence (Oct), Richmond Fed manufacturing index (Oct), S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price indices (Aug) <br/><b>Results</b>: HSBC Holdings (Q3), United HealthGroup (Q3), <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/visa-inc\">Visa</a> (Q4)</p><h4>Wednesday 29 October</h4><p><b>Australia</b>: Consumer price index (Q3)<br/><b>Canada</b>: Bank of Canada interest-rate decision, monetary policy report &amp; press conference <br/><b>UK</b>: M4 money supply (Sep)<br/><b>US</b>: Pending home sales (Sep), US Federal Reserve interest-rate decision, monetary policy statement &amp; press conference <br/><b>Results</b>: Alphabet (Q3), <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/boeing-co\">Boeing</a> (Q3), Caterpillar (Q3), GSK (Q3), Meta Platforms (Q3), Microsoft (Q1), ServiceNow (Q3), Verizon Communications (Q3)<br/>\r\n <br/>\r\nThursday 30 October</p><p><b>Japan</b>: Bank of Japan interest-rate decision, monetary policy statement &amp; press conference<br/><b>Eurozone</b>: Business climate (Oct), consumer confidence (Oct), GDP (Q3), unemployment rate (Sep), European Central Bank main refinancing interest-rate decision, monetary policy statement &amp; press conference<br/><b>US</b>: GDP (Q3) <br/><b>Results</b>: Amazon (Q3), Apple (Q4), Eli Lilly (Q3), <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/mastercard-inc\">Mastercard</a> (Q3), Merck (Q3), <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/shell-plc-gb\">Shell</a> (Q3), <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/standard-chartered-plc\">Standard Chartered</a> (Q3)</p><h4>Friday 31 October</h4><p><b>Eurozone</b>: Consumer price index (Oct)<br/><b>US</b>: Core PCE price index (Sep), personal income (Sep), personal spending (Sep), Chicago PMI (Oct)<br/><b>Results</b>: Abbvie (Q3), <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/chevron-corp\">Chevron</a> (Q3), <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/exxon-mobil-corp\">Exxon Mobil</a> (Q3), Linde (Q3)</p><div><i>Note: While we check all dates carefully to ensure that they are correct at the time of writing, the above announcements are subject to change.</i></div><!--START-WIDGET-62FA3159-F784-446C-BEEF-153F0A7A21EF--><!--END-WIDGET-62FA3159-F784-446C-BEEF-153F0A7A21EF--><!--START-WIDGET-624479DD-930C-497F-A09D-8E9B0A7A21EF--><!--END-WIDGET-624479DD-930C-497F-A09D-8E9B0A7A21EF--><p></p></div>",

However, some private-sector reports are due this week, which could provide a sense of what is happening in the economy. Additionally, there will be a Bank of England rate decision later in the week, and the US earnings season will continue, although most of the major mega-cap companies have now reported.</p><h2>US Economic Data </h2><p><b>Monday, 3 November</b></p><p>The ISM Manufacturing Report will be released, followed by the ADP Employment Report and the ISM Services Report on Wednesday, 5 November. Together, these three reports should help shed light on the employment picture, overall economic activity, and the health of the US economy. Additionally, the price indices in the ISM reports may offer insight into broader inflation trends. This data is likely to have a significant impact on <a href=\"/en-gb/forex-trading\">currency markets</a>, with the USD/JPY in particular focus now that the Bank of Japan has once again stalled on raising rates.</p><p>The yen appears to be weakening against the dollar as it breaks above a rising channel and approaches a key resistance level around 154.5. Should it move beyond this level, the yen could be on course to weaken further, towards 158 against the dollar. The RSI also indicates that momentum has shifted, pointing to continued yen weakness versus the dollar. However, it is worth noting that the RSI is nearing 70, which may suggest a pause around the 154.5 level is possible first, with stronger US economic data likely required to drive additional yen depreciation.</p><h3>USD/JPY CHART AUGUST 2024 -  OCTOBER 2025</h3><p></p><img src=\"blob:https://bakery.cmc.local/47a1e3a3-4a92-4ee8-abea-c9987bb5e0d8\"/><sup><span>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</span></sup><h2>Palantir Earning</h2><p><b>Monday, 3 November</b></p><p><b> </b>The NASDAQ-listed technology company is expected to report third-quarter earnings growth of 68.4% year-on-year to $0.17 per share, on revenue growth of more than 50% to $1.1 billion. For the fourth quarter, analysts forecast earnings of $0.19 per share, up 36.3%, and revenue of $1.2 billion, up 43.9%. The options market is pricing in 10% post-earnings move in the stock.</p><p>Implied volatility levels for Palantir are extremely elevated, likely exceeding 100% for options expiring in the week of 7 November, by the time the company reports on Monday after the close of trading. Option positioning is also bullish, with a large gamma level at 200 expected to provide strong resistance, and overall delta positioning is firmly positive. However, as seen in similar cases, extreme bullish positioning can lead to negative market-maker flows as implied volatility declines and as call premiums decay, potentially exerting downward pressure on the <a href=\"/en-gb/markets-shares\">shares</a>.</p><p>Palantir has struggled to break above the $200 level and has largely remained range-bound around that area since August. If the stock manages to surpass $200, there appears to be room for it to rise towards $210, based on current option positioning.</p><p>From a technical perspective, however, the stock is nearing overbought territory ahead of earnings. With the shares trading above the upper Bollinger Band and the RSI approaching 70, the risk of a reversal is increasing. A bearish divergence has also formed, with the RSI making lower highs while the share price has made higher lows. This setup suggests that earnings could act as a catalyst for a potential reversal, which might see the shares fall back towards the lower end of their trading range, around $160, or possibly as low as $145.</p><h3>PALANTIR TEHCNOLOGIES INC.

As a result, investors will be listening closely for any dovish signals from the BOE at this meeting. Any indication of a near-term rate cut could have a significant negative impact on the British pound, particularly now that it appears the Federal Reserve may not cut rates as aggressively as markets had initially anticipated.</p><p>The pound is currently on the verge of breaking a major support level around 1.31, and if that occurs, it could lead to a decline towards 1.275. The 1.31 area appears to be acting as a neckline for what looks like either a head-and-shoulders pattern or a potential double top — in either case, it is a critical level to watch.  </p><p><a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/gbp-usd\">GBP/USD</a> CHART, JANUARY 2025 - OCTOBER 2025</p><p></p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"file:////Users/gzeguile/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image002.png\"/><img src=\"blob:https://bakery.cmc.local/0ae426c4-c1b2-4476-8ef1-6ca5ce948ed6\"/><sup><span>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</span></sup><p> </p><!--START-WIDGET-62FA3159-F784-446C-BEEF-153F0A7A21EF--><!--END-WIDGET-62FA3159-F784-446C-BEEF-153F0A7A21EF--><!--START-WIDGET-624479DD-930C-497F-A09D-8E9B0A7A21EF--><!--END-WIDGET-624479DD-930C-497F-A09D-8E9B0A7A21EF--><p></p></div>",

Analysts forecast revenue growth of 3.8% to $26.1bn, while earnings are expected to decline by 26.3% to $0.53 per share, with gross margins slipping to 17.4% from 19.9% a year ago. Total automotive revenue is projected to fall to $19.5bn. </div><div> </div><div>The company doesn’t provide formal guidance, but analysts expect Q4 revenue to decline by 1.3% year-on-year to $25.4bn, and earnings to drop by 35.5% to $0.47 per share, with gross margins of 17.2%. The stock is expected to rise or fall by around 7.4% following the earnings release. </div><div> </div><div>Given the sharp run-up in the stock, options positioning is highly bullish, and implied volatility levels are likely to remain well above 100% for the options expiry on 24 October. This suggests that once the company reports, implied volatility may fall sharply, leading to a decline in call premiums and potentially creating additional stock for sale.</div><div> </div><div>The chart appears to show a topping, diamond-like pattern, suggesting that if the stock falls below support at $410, it could drop towards approximately $370, or even lower to the next major support level at $350.

Consequently, the timely arrival of a fresh earnings season may move markets even more than usual. <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/us-banks\">US banks</a> kick things off, with <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/jpmorgan-chase-co\">JPMorgan</a> – the largest US bank by assets under management and market capitalisation – and <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/goldman-sachs-group-inc\">Goldman Sachs</a> among the major financial institutions set to report third-quarter results on Tuesday. In Britain, the release of monthly gross domestic product (GDP) figures on Thursday will put economic growth in the spotlight ahead of the Budget on 26 November.</p><h2>JPMorgan Chase Q3 earnings</h2><p><b>Tuesday 14 October </b><br/>\r\nAnalysts expect JPMorgan to report that Q3 earnings grew 10.5% year-on-year to $4.83 a share, as revenue increased an estimated 4.8% to $45.39bn. Net interest income – a measure of profitability as it represents the difference between the interest earned on assets (eg, loans) and the interest paid on liabilities (eg, customer savings) – is projected to be up 3.1% at $24.1bn. Analysts are also forecasting loan loss provisions of $3.1bn.</p><p>Looking ahead to Q4, the NYSE-listed megabank is expected to guide net interest income of $24.7bn, implying total net interest income of around $95.4bn for 2025 and $98.4bn for 2026. That’s based on analyst estimates of Q4 revenue growth of 2.9% to $45bn, with earnings expected to decline less than 1% to $4.78 a share. The JPMorgan Chase share price – up 27% year-to-date at $305.53, as of Thursday’s close – is anticipated to move about 4% following the Q3 results, based on options market positioning.</p><p>There is significant negative options gamma positioning around the $300 strike price, which could provide strong support for the stock, as long as the company’s results and guidance do not disappoint investors. This support area also aligns with the late-July highs, as shown on the technical chart below. However, if the stock were to fall below $300, it could open a path towards the next major level of support near $280.</p><p><b>JPMorgan Chase share price, January 2025 - present</b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/jpm_10_10_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/jpm_10_10_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/jpm_10_10_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/jpm_10_10_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/jpm_10_10_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/jpm_10_10_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/jpm_10_10_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/jpm_10_10_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/jpm_10_10_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/jpm_10_10_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/jpm_10_10_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h2>Goldman Sachs Q3 earnings</h2><p><b>Tuesday 14 October </b><br/>\r\nGoldman Sachs, which holds the largest weighting in the price-weighted <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/us-30-cash\">Dow Jones</a> Industrial Average, is expected to report that Q3 earnings soared 30.1% year-on-year to $10.99 a share, with revenue increasing 11% to $14.1bn, according to analysts. Trading income is forecast to be up 8.0% at $3.2bn. </p><p>For the fourth quarter, earnings are projected to fall 4.2% to $11.45 a share, while revenue is forecast to decline less than 1% to $13.8bn.

Given the stock’s significant weighting in the Dow, the results could have an outsized impact on the index.</p><p>Goldman’s options positioning appears bullish, with a large build-up of call gamma at $800, which is likely to act as resistance should the stock advance after the results are released. However, the shares have formed a bearish divergence on the relative strength index (RSI), which is making lower highs while the share price itself makes higher highs within a rising megaphone pattern. Facing strong resistance around $800, the stock could undergo a post-earnings dip and may test the lower end of the megaphone pattern near $740.</p><p><b>Goldman Sachs share price, March 2023 - present</b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gs_10_10_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gs_10_10_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gs_10_10_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gs_10_10_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gs_10_10_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gs_10_10_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gs_10_10_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gs_10_10_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gs_10_10_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gs_10_10_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gs_10_10_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h2>UK August GDP</h2><p><b>Thursday 16 October </b><br/>\r\nChancellor Rachel Reeves will outline the government's tax and spending plans on Wednesday 26 November. Between now and then, investors will be paying close attention to economic readings such as GDP and productivity to assess the likely impact of the government’s plans, and whether they may leave any fiscal gaps. </p><p>After GDP growth flatlined in July, economists are expecting a meagre 0.1% month-on-month uptick for August. A weaker-than-expected GDP reading could cause anxiety among investors, leading to a rise in long-end gilt yields and a weaker pound. We’ve already seen these symptoms emerge. In September, a wider-than-expected budget deficit triggered a spike in rates and a sharp weakening of the pound.</p><p>This has put <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/gbp-usd\">GBP/USD</a> under pressure. The pair has broken support at $1.33, and on Friday morning was trading below $1.3290. Further weakness could send the pair towards $1.3170. Whether the pound falls through <i>that </i>level may depend on how quickly the UK economy is growing – if it’s growing at all. A break of support at $1.3170 risks extending the pound’s weak run and sending GBP/USD below $1.30.</p><p><b>GBP/USD, February 2025 - present </b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_10_10_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_10_10_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_10_10_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_10_10_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_10_10_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_10_10_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_10_10_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_10_10_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_10_10_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_10_10_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/gbpusd_10_10_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h1>Economic and company events calendar</h1><p>Major upcoming economic announcements and scheduled US and Uk company reports include:</p><h2>Monday 13 October</h2><p>• China: September exports, imports and trade balance<br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Fastenal (Q3)</p><h2>Tuesday 14 October</h2><p>• Australia: Reserve Bank of Australia meeting minutes <br/>\r\n• Eurozone: October economic sentiment index <br/>\r\n• Germany: September consumer price index (CPI)<br/>\r\n• UK: September jobs data (claimant count change, unemployment rate, employment change, average earnings)<br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Bellway (FY), BlackRock (Q3), Citigroup (Q3), Domino's Pizza (Q3), Goldman Sachs (Q3), Johnson &amp; Johnson (Q3), JPMorgan Chase (Q3), Wells Fargo (Q3), YouGov (FY)</p><h2>Wednesday 15 October</h2><p>• China: September CPI<br/>\r\n• Eurozone: August industrial production<br/>\r\n• France: September CPI <br/>\r\n• Spain: September CPI<br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Abbott Laboratories (Q3), Bank of America (Q3), Morgan Stanley (Q3), Progressive (Q3), Prologis (Q3)</p><h2>Thursday 16 October</h2><p>• Australia: September jobs data (unemployment rate  employment change, etc)<br/>\r\n• Italy: September CPI<br/>\r\n• UK: August gross domestic product (GDP) <br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Charles Schwab (Q3), Interactive Brokers (Q3), Marsh McLennan (Q3), United Airlines (Q3), Whitbread (HY)</p><h2>Friday 17 October</h2><p>• Eurozone: September harmonised CPI<br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: American Express (Q3)</p><p><i>Note: While we check all dates carefully to ensure that they are correct at the time of writing, the above announcements are subject to change.</i></p><p> </p><!--START-WIDGET-62FA3159-F784-446C-BEEF-153F0A7A21EF--><!--END-WIDGET-62FA3159-F784-446C-BEEF-153F0A7A21EF--><!--START-WIDGET-624479DD-930C-497F-A09D-8E9B0A7A21EF--><!--END-WIDGET-624479DD-930C-497F-A09D-8E9B0A7A21EF--><p></p></div>",

The shutdown – the first for seven years – has resulted in roughly 750,000 federal workers going on unpaid leave. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will not publish the September jobs figures as planned today (Friday 3 October), and other scheduled data releases are likely to be delayed or cancelled. </p><p>The absence of official data could be a double-edged sword: while many traders may welcome a break from the volatility that economic data can trigger, the market might lean more heavily on less reliable information, which could create even more volatility than usual in the near term. It’s unclear when the shutdown will end, leaving us without crucial signals about the health of the world’s largest economy for the foreseeable future. </p><p>One release that is still set to go ahead is the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index on Friday 10 October. Away from the US, it’s business as usual, with eurozone retail sales figures – out on Monday – among the releases to watch. We preview both below, alongside a look at US carrier <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/delta-air-lines-inc\">Delta Air Lines</a>’ third-quarter results. </p><h2>Eurozone August retail sales</h2><p><b>Monday 6 October </b><br/>\r\nAnalysts estimate that retail sales in the eurozone increased 0.1% month-on-month in August, a much stronger performance than the 0.5% decline in July. Eurozone retail sales have been quite volatile in recent months, with several large swings up and down, and – perhaps more importantly – a reversal of what had been a steady uptrend. The upcoming data is therefore likely to be important, with investors looking for a rebound. Retail sales serve as an indicator of consumer spending, so a high reading is generally seen as bullish for the euro, while a low increase or a decline is seen as bearish. </p><p>This means that <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/eur-usd\">EUR/USD</a> remains vulnerable to further declines. The technical setup, as shown on the chart below, looks weak. The pair has trended lower since mid-September, and the <a href=\"/en-gb/trading-guides/relative-strength-index\">relative strength index</a> (RSI) is also falling, suggesting that momentum has shifted from bullish to bearish. At this rate, EUR/USD needs to find support at $1.157, since a break below that level could risk a further weakening towards $1.14.</p><p><b>EUR/USD, January 2025 - present</b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_03_10_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_03_10_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_03_10_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_03_10_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_03_10_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_03_10_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_03_10_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_03_10_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_03_10_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_03_10_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_03_10_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h2>Delta Air Lines Q3 earnings</h2><p><b>Thursday 9 October</b><br/>\r\nDelta Air Lines is set to report that its Q3 earnings rose 1.7% year-on-year to $1.53 a share as revenue increased 2.9% to $15.0bn, based on analysts’ estimates. Looking ahead to Q4, earnings are expected to fall 12.5% year-on-year to $1.62 a share, even though revenue is projected to rise 1.2% over the period to $14.6bn. Shares of the world’s largest airline by revenue have dropped 3.4% year-to-date, closing at $57.08 on Thursday 2 October. The stock could see a post-earnings move of about 6.8%, based on options market positioning. </p><p>Options positioning is relatively bullish heading into results week, but also suggests that potential upside may be capped at around $62, where there is a significant concentration of call gamma. Meanwhile, the largest amount of put gamma sits near $50.</p><p>Technical trends indicate a more bearish outlook, as the below chart illustrates. The <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/us-spx-500-cash\">S&amp;P 500</a> constituent's stock price is in a clear downtrend and the RSI is also trending lower. Based on momentum and the prevailing trend, it seems possible that Delta’s <a href=\"/en-gb/markets-shares\">shares</a> may continue to decline following the results, unless the company delivers better-than-expected earnings or guidance. The next area of support lies around $50, a level that dates back to July and coincides with the large put gamma concentration.</p><p><b>Delta Air Lines share price, June 2024 - present</b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/delta_03_10_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/delta_03_10_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/delta_03_10_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/delta_03_10_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/delta_03_10_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/delta_03_10_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/delta_03_10_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/delta_03_10_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/delta_03_10_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/delta_03_10_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/delta_03_10_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h2>Michigan October consumer sentiment index</h2><p><b>Friday 10 October</b><br/>\r\nUS consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan’s monthly survey, has been trending lower in recent months, following a rebound from the lows of April and May. Any sign of improving consumer spending – a key driver of the US economy – could boost the dollar, which has lost ground against other major currencies in 2025. The dollar could benefit not only against the euro but also against the British pound, with <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/gbp-usd\">GBP/USD</a> having trended lower recently. </p><p>Whatever positive momentum the pound had from August to early September, as recorded by a rise in GBP/USD’s RSI during that period, now appears to have faded. The RSI has resumed its downtrend, indicating that momentum has turned bearish. Currently, the pound is holding onto support around $1.34. A break below this level could see GBP/USD weaken towards $1.317, which has acted as support on two occasions in 2025.</p><p>If, however, US consumer confidence has deteriorated further in October, it is possible that GBP/USD could rise on dollar weakness and rebound towards resistance at $1.357.

Highlights include the purchasing managers’ index (PMI) readings from the Institute of Supply Management (ISM), offering insights into the health of the manufacturing and services sectors, and jobs data for September. Hiring in the US slowed significantly in August, with <a href=\"/en-gb/trading-guides/learn-non-farm-payrolls-trading\">non-farm payrolls</a> increasing by just 22,000, well below the expected 75,000. </p><p>Away from the US, the UK’s revised second-quarter GDP figures are due out on Tuesday, which could be significant given the country’s budget deficit and the emphasis on growth as a means of managing the debt burden. The initial estimate put economic growth in Q2 at 0.3%, following an increase of 0.7% in Q1. Any revision up or down could impact the pound and gilts. </p><p>Corporate earnings announcements slow to a trickle before the next wave of quarterly reports in mid-October, but there are still a few big names releasing updates in the week ahead, including <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/nike-inc\">Nike</a>, <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/tesco-plc\">Tesco</a>, and cruise operator <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/carnival\">Carnival</a>. </p><h2>Nike Q1 earnings</h2><p><b>Tuesday 30 September</b><br/>\r\nAnalysts expect Nike to report that fiscal first-quarter earnings fell 61.2% year-on-year to $0.27 a share, with revenue down 5.1% at $11bn. Gross profit margins are forecast to come in at 41.7%, down from 45.4% a year ago. Looking ahead to Q2, analysts see earnings falling 36.3% year-on-year to $0.50 a share, while revenue is expected to drop 3% to $11.9bn. Gross profit margins are forecast to tighten to 41.4% from 43.6%. The Nike share price – down 6% this year at $69.24 as of Thursday’s close – could swing 7.2% after the Q1 results, based on options market positioning.</p><p>The options market appears to be taking a bearish stance towards shares of the NYSE-listed sports apparel giant, with the largest concentration of negative options gamma at $67. This implies that Nike stock may find support around that level. However, the shares could rally from there, unless the results are weaker than expected. </p><p>The technical chart below suggests that the stock is already oversold. The <a href=\"/en-gb/trading-guides/relative-strength-index\">relative strength index</a> (RSI) – the purple line on the lower panel – has slipped below 30, indicating oversold conditions, while the share price itself is sitting on the lower Bollinger Band. These signals suggest that Nike might be poised for at least a short-term rebound. If the stock rallies after Tuesday’s results announcement, it could rise towards $75, where a gap remains from late August. However, downside risks are significant. The large gap down to $62 means that a break below support at $67 could trigger a steeper decline.</p><p><b>Nike share price, November 2024 - present</b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/nike_26_09_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/nike_26_09_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/nike_26_09_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/nike_26_09_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/nike_26_09_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/nike_26_09_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/nike_26_09_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/nike_26_09_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/nike_26_09_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/nike_26_09_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/nike_26_09_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h2>US September ISM data</h2><p><b>Wednesday 1 October (manufacturing PMI)<br/>\r\nFriday 3 October (services PMI)</b><br/>\r\nEconomic activity in the US manufacturing sector is expected to have improved slightly in September. Analysts expect the ISM manufacturing PMI to rise to 49.2, up from 48.7 in August, though yet another reading below 50 would mean a seventh straight month of contraction. </p><p>Meanwhile, the ISM services print is forecast to remain unchanged at 52, with a reading above 50 indicating expansion. </p><p>Although recent US economic data points have highlighted some apparent contradictions (for instance, between robust economic growth on the one hand, and weak housing and jobs data on the other), the Federal Reserve appears intent on cutting interest rates regardless.

This suggests that – unless the jobs report is a complete disaster – US equities could rally on Friday as volatility resets and hedges from the previous day are unwound.</p><p><b>Vix 1-day volatility index, July 2025 - present </b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/vix_26_09_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/vix_26_09_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/vix_26_09_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/vix_26_09_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/vix_26_09_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/vix_26_09_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/vix_26_09_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/vix_26_09_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/vix_26_09_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/vix_26_09_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/vix_26_09_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h1>Economic and company events calendar</h1><p>Major upcoming economic announcements and scheduled US and UK company reports include:</p><h2>Monday 29 September</h2><p>• Eurozone: September business climate, September consumer confidence index<br/>\r\n• Japan: August retail trade<br/>\r\n• US: August pending home sales<br/>\r\n• <b>Results </b>: Carnival (Q3), Jefferies Financial (Q3) </p><h2>Tuesday 30 September</h2><p>• Australia: Reserve Bank of Australia interest rate decision<br/>\r\n• China: September National Bureau of Statistics purchasing managers’ index (PMI) data, September RatingDog (formerly Caixin) PMI data<br/>\r\n• Germany: August retail sales, September consumer price index (CPI)<br/>\r\n• Japan: Q3 Tankan large manufacturing index <br/>\r\n• UK: Q2 gross domestic product (GDP) <br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: AG Barr (HY), Close Brothers (FY), Nike (Q1), Paychex (Q1)</p><h2>Wednesday 1 October</h2><p>• Eurozone: September harmonised CPI<br/>\r\n• US: September ADP employment change, September ISM manufacturing PMI<br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Acuity (Q4), Conagra Brands (Q1), RPM International (Q1)</p><h2>Thursday 2 October</h2><p>• Australia: August trade balance<br/>\r\n• Switzerland: September CPI <br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Tesco (HY)</p><h2>Friday 3 October</h2><p>• US: September jobs report (including non-farm payrolls and average hourly earnings), September ISM services PMI<br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: JD Wetherspoon (FY)</p><p><i>Note: While we check all dates carefully to ensure that they are correct at the time of writing, the above announcements are subject to change.</i></p><p> </p><!--START-WIDGET-62FA3159-F784-446C-BEEF-153F0A7A21EF--><!--END-WIDGET-62FA3159-F784-446C-BEEF-153F0A7A21EF--><!--START-WIDGET-624479DD-930C-497F-A09D-8E9B0A7A21EF--><!--END-WIDGET-624479DD-930C-497F-A09D-8E9B0A7A21EF--><p></p></div>",

The global economy has become increasingly difficult to assess. Shifting data points are creating apparent contradictions, particularly in the US where stock markets are running at record highs despite weak jobs data and rising inflation. Traders and investors will be eager to see how September is shaping up in the hope of finding some clarity. Meanwhile, <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/micron-technology\">Micron</a> will report quarterly results, also on Tuesday, offering the latest snapshot of the artificial intelligence industry. The market will be keen to hear how the AI growth story is developing and whether there are any signs of a slowdown.</p><h2>Eurozone, UK and US September PMIs</h2><p><b>Tuesday 23 September</b><br/>\r\nGenerally speaking, PMI readings have improved across the US, the UK and Europe since the northern hemisphere’s spring, supporting the view that the challenges seen at the start of the year have eased. That trend seems likely to continue. Barring any major surprises, the PMI data’s impact on currency markets may be muted. While the euro has shown signs of breaking out against the US dollar, it could come under pressure if it fails to clear resistance near $1.19.</p><p>If <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/eur-usd\">EUR/USD</a> can break through $1.19, it has a relatively clear path higher, with little resistance until around $1.226. However, if the attempted breakout fails and the pair cannot move above $1.19, the euro might weaken against the dollar, potentially slipping back towards support at $1.16.</p><p><b>EUR/USD, May 2021 - present</b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_19_09_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_19_09_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_19_09_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_19_09_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_19_09_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_19_09_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_19_09_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_19_09_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_19_09_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_19_09_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/eurusd_19_09_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h2><a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/micron-technology-inc\">Micron Technology</a> Q4 earnings</h2><p><b>Tuesday 23 September</b><br/>\r\nThe <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/us-ndaq-100-cash\">Nasdaq</a>-listed memory chip manufacturer is set to report that revenue grew 44.8% to $11.2bn in the fiscal fourth quarter, according to analyst estimates. Earnings are expected to have more than doubled to $2.86 a share, up from $1.18 a year ago. Meanwhile, the company’s gross margin is expected to have expanded to 43.4%, up from 36.5% a year earlier. As ever, guidance will be key, with analysts looking for revenue to increase 36.9% to $11.9bn in Q1 as margins edge up to 45.2%, resulting in earnings of $3.03 a share. The Micron share price, up more than 90% this year at about $169, could rise or fall around 9.2% following the Q4 results, based on options market positioning.</p><p>Implied volatility is likely to be well over 100% for at-the-money options expiring on 26 September. Positioning appears to be very bullish and, given Micron stock’s strong run since late August (it’s up about 40% in three weeks), the shares unsurprisingly find themselves overbought heading into Tuesday’s results, with the <a href=\"/en-gb/trading-guides/relative-strength-index\">relative strength index</a> (RSI) above 86 and the share price trading at its upper Bollinger Band.</p><p>Further upside is possible, but with volatility levels so high and the stock technically overbought, it is also possible that once the results are released and implied volatility falls, call option premiums could decay quickly, sending the <a href=\"/en-gb/markets-shares\">shares</a> lower. In fact, a decline back to the 20-day moving average at $133 does not seem implausible. Ultimately, the post-results price action may depend on whether the company surprises investors in a manner similar to <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/broadcom-inc\">Broadcom</a> or <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/oracle-corp\">Oracle</a> – no easy feat.</p><p><b>Micron Technology share price, April 2024 - present</b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/mu_19_09_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/mu_19_09_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/mu_19_09_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/mu_19_09_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/mu_19_09_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/mu_19_09_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/mu_19_09_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/mu_19_09_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/mu_19_09_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/mu_19_09_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/mu_19_09_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h2>US August PCE price index</h2><p><b>Friday 26 September</b><br/>\r\nThe Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation is expected to indicate that price growth is accelerating. The headline Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index is expected to have risen 0.3% month-on-month and 2.8% year-on-year in August, faster than July’s increases of 0.2% m-o-m and 2.6% y-o-y. Meanwhile, the closely watched core PCE price index – which excludes volatile food and energy prices to paint a clearer picture of underlying inflation trends – is expected to have held at 0.3% on a monthly basis in August, while accelerating to 3% on an annual basis, up from 2.9% in July.</p><p>After the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to a target range of 4% to 4.25% on 17 September, hot PCE data – or even data in line with estimates – could be a cause for concern among long-duration bondholders and those betting against the US dollar. A global rush into short positions on the dollar could be unwound if PCE surprises to the upside, as it would point to higher Treasury rates and a stronger dollar.</p><p>The Japanese yen had appeared to be on course to strengthen against the dollar, yet <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/usd-jpy\">USD/JPY</a> has remained stuck between ¥146.50 and ¥148.50 per dollar since early August. Any sign of US inflation heating up again is likely to send USD/JPY higher, signalling a weakening yen. In fact, a hot PCE report could push the pair towards the upper end of its long-term trading channel around ¥153. Conversely, cooler-than-expected PCE figures could trigger a fresh bout of dollar weakness, with USD/JPY potentially falling towards ¥140.</p><p><b>USD/JPY, September 2024 - present </b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_19_09_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_19_09_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_19_09_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_19_09_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_19_09_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_19_09_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_19_09_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_19_09_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_19_09_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_19_09_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_19_09_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h1>Economic and company events calendar</h1><p>Major upcoming economic announcements and scheduled US and UK company reports include:</p><h2>Monday 22 September</h2><p>• Australia: September flash purchasing managers’ index (PMI) data<br/>\r\n• China: People’s Bank of China interest rate decision<br/>\r\n• Eurozone: September flash consumer confidence index<br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Elixirr International (HY), Firefly Aerospace (Q2)</p><h2>Tuesday 23 September</h2><p>• Eurozone, France, Germany, UK, US: September flash PMI data<br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: AutoZone (Q4), Kingfisher (HY), Micron Technology (Q4), Oxford Biomedica (HY), Raspberry Pi (HY), Smiths (FY)</p><h2>Wednesday 24 September</h2><p>• Australia: August consumer price index (CPI)<br/>\r\n• Japan: Bank of Japan monetary policy meeting minutes<br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Cintas (Q1), JD Sports Fashion (HY)</p><h2>Thursday 25 September</h2><p>• Switzerland: Swiss National Bank interest rate decision<br/>\r\n• Japan: September Tokyo CPI<br/>\r\n• US: Q2 gross domestic product (GDP), weekly initial jobless claims <br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Accenture (Q4), CarMax (Q2), Costco Wholesale (Q4), Jabil (Q4), TD Synnex (Q3)</p><h2>Friday 26 September</h2><p>• Canada: July GDP<br/>\r\n• Spain: Q2 GDP<br/>\r\n• US: August personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index<br/>\r\n• <b>Results</b>: Ceres Power (HY)</p><p><i>Note: While we check all dates carefully to ensure that they are correct at the time of writing, the above announcements are subject to change.</i></p><p> </p><!--START-WIDGET-62FA3159-F784-446C-BEEF-153F0A7A21EF--><!--END-WIDGET-62FA3159-F784-446C-BEEF-153F0A7A21EF--><!--START-WIDGET-624479DD-930C-497F-A09D-8E9B0A7A21EF--><!--END-WIDGET-624479DD-930C-497F-A09D-8E9B0A7A21EF--><p></p></div>",

Ahead of their rate meetings, the UK and Japan will release inflation updates that could shape policymakers’ rate decisions and what they say about the future path of monetary policy. Also of note is Australia’s jobs report, which could have a bearing on whether <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/aud-jpy\">AUD/JPY</a> can keep moving higher. Combined, the coming week’s events are likely to stir up market volatility, particularly across currencies. </p><h2>Central bank rate decisions</h2><p><b>Wednesday 17 September (US Federal Reserve), Thursday 18 September (Bank of England), Friday 19 September (Bank of Japan)</b><br/>\r\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates, with the market pricing in a cut as a 100% probability – it’s seemingly just a question of whether policymakers cut by 25 or 50 basis points. The CME’s FedWatch tool suggests that the former is more likely. A cut of any size would be the Fed’s first rate reduction since December 2024. The Fed will also publish its Summary of Economic Projections, a quarterly report outlining the rate-setting committee’s forecasts for interest rates and other economic data points over the coming year. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan are expected to keep rates unchanged in the face of persistent inflationary pressures. That said, the Bank of England is still expected to lower rates once more this year, possibly at its November meeting, in a bid to stimulate economic growth. In contrast, the Bank of Japan is expected to raise rates at some point in Q4, either in October or December. The market will look to the central banks’ statements and minutes for clues on the timing and the pace of any future changes in monetary policy. </p><p>If the Fed signals that it is about to embark on a series of rate cuts while the Bank of Japan signals a willingness to raise rates before the end of the year, the dollar-yen pair could rise. Over the past two months <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/usd-jpy\">USD/JPY</a> has moved sideways near ¥147.50 per dollar, despite the yield differential between US and Japanese five-year government bonds continuing to narrow. The more the spread between US <a href=\"/en-gb/markets-treasuries\">Treasuries</a> and Japanese government bonds (JGBs) compress, the more likely it becomes that USD/JPY will head towards ¥140. A BoJ commitment to higher rates could be what ultimately gets the yen to strengthen against the dollar.</p><p><b>USD/JPY vs yield differential between five-year US Treasuries and JGBs, July 2020 - present</b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_12_09_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_12_09_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_12_09_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_12_09_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_12_09_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_12_09_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_12_09_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_12_09_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_12_09_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_12_09_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/usdjpy_12_09_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h2>UK, Japan August CPI</h2><p><b>Wednesday 17 September (UK), Thursday 18 September (Japan)</b><br/>\r\nBoth the UK and Japan will release consumer price data a day before their respective central banks make their interest rate decisions. While the two countries have faced persistent inflation pressures in recent months, CPI is rising in the UK (3.8% in July, up from 3.6% in June) but falling in Japan (3.1% in July, down from 3.3% in June). Nevertheless, inflation remains above target in both countries. </p><p>If inflation continues to pose a problem for the UK and Japan, then one would expect both countries’ central banks to maintain higher rates for longer. For the Bank of England in particular, this would imply fewer rate cuts or a delay to the rate-cutting timetable.

Meanwhile, US inflation figures will play a key role in shaping the Federal Open Market Committee’s thinking ahead of its own rate decision on 17 September. Prior to these announcements, <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/oracle-corp\">Oracle</a> will release its first-quarter results on Tuesday, giving the market an update on tech and artificial intelligence trends. </p><h2>Oracle Q1 earnings</h2><p><b>Tuesday 9 September </b><br/>\r\nAnalysts expect Oracle to report that Q1 earnings grew 6.6% year-on-year to $1.48 a share as revenue rose an estimated 13% over the same period to $15.0bn, with gross margin slipping to 70.0% from 71.8% a year ago. Looking ahead to the fiscal second quarter, analysts forecast earnings of $1.62 a share on revenue growth of 15.3% to $16.2bn, with a gross margin of 70.1%. The tech group’s <a href=\"/en-gb/markets-shares\">shares</a> – up 34% this year at $223, as of Thursday’s close – could rise or fall around 8% following the Q1 results, based on options market positioning.</p><p>Options traders appear to be taking a bearish stance against the New York Stock Exchange-listed company, whose shares have fallen more than 10% from the year-to-date highs they reached in early August. Further analysis indicates that $215 (the uppermost dotted orange line on the chart below) could be a key level of support for Oracle, should the stock fall after it publishes its Q1 results. A break below this level could send the share price down towards $175, filling a gap that was created after the previous earnings release. </p><p>Momentum, as measured by the <a href=\"/en-gb/trading-guides/relative-strength-index\">relative strength index</a> (RSI), has declined to 35, just above the 30-mark that typically represents oversold territory, suggesting that the stock may have further to fall in the near term. Upside potential seems more limited, with strong resistance around $240. The <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/us-spx-500-cash\">S&amp;P 500</a> constituent may need to deliver very strong results on Tuesday to break through this barrier. Moreover, the stock’s recent weakness could be a warning sign ahead of the release.</p><p><b>Oracle share price, October 2024 - present</b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/oracle_05_09_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/oracle_05_09_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/oracle_05_09_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/oracle_05_09_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/oracle_05_09_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/oracle_05_09_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/oracle_05_09_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/oracle_05_09_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/oracle_05_09_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/oracle_05_09_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/oracle_05_09_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h2>ECB interest rate decision</h2><p><b>Thursday 11 September </b><br/>\r\nThe market expects the ECB to keep interest rates unchanged at its upcoming meeting. And it might be a while before rates are lowered again – markets are pricing in the next rate cut for March 2026. However, eurozone inflation ticked up to 2.1% in the year to August, casting doubt over the prospect of further reductions to the cost of borrowing.</p><p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates this month and the ECB likely to signal that it intends to keep rates on hold, the near-term outlook should be supportive for the euro. However, after its upward move in the first half of the year, <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/eur-usd\">EUR/USD</a> has moved sideways since July. The pair has failed to break out of the trading range around $1.17, and in the past month the RSI has also moved sideways, underlining the lack of momentum. </p><p>That said, the period of stagnation may be drawing to a close. As highlighted on the below chart, the long-term uptrend and shorter-term downtrend are converging, hinting at the potential for a breakout.

These figures may be Fed hawks’ last hope of avoiding a first rate cut of 2025. Unless there’s a sharp spike in inflation, it’s likely that on 17 September policymakers will vote to cut the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a target range of 4% to 4.25%. </p><p>The inflation data may also represent the dollar’s last chance for support. The dollar-yen pair, currently trading near ¥148 per dollar, has been behaving somewhat unusually of late. As rates in Japan rise, the interest rate differential with the US has been narrowing. Typically, contracting spreads would be expected to lead to a stronger yen. However, <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/usd-jpy\">USD/JPY</a> has been trading sideways, much like EUR/USD.</p><p>A CPI report broadly in line with consensus estimates could give the Fed the cover it needs to cut rates later this month.

Writing in our weekly market preview column <a href=\"/en-gb/news-and-analysis/the-week-ahead-ism-data-us-jobs-report-broadcom-earnings\"><i>The Week Ahead</i></a>, Kramer outlined how Broadcom is expected to report that Q3 earnings grew 32.9% to $1.65 per share as revenue rose 21% to $15.8bn, based on analysts’ estimates, though gross margins may dip to 77.0% from 79.4%. That robust performance seems set to continue in Q4, with analysts anticipating revenue of $17.0bn, margins at 76.4%, and earnings of $1.79 per share.</p><p>Yet despite bullish sentiment among options traders pointing to an up to 7% post-earnings move for the stock, technical indicators are weakening. The stock has broken below a key uptrend, faces resistance from $316 to $320, and the falling <a href=\"/en-gb/trading-guides/relative-strength-index\">relative strength index</a> indicates weakening momentum. If Q3 results disappoint, “the stock could fall towards strong technical and options support around $270,” wrote Kramer. </p><p><b>Broadcom share price, February 2025 - present</b><br/></p><picture><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/broadcom_29_08_25_small.webp 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/broadcom_29_08_25_medium.webp 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/broadcom_29_08_25_large.webp 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/broadcom_29_08_25_extra.webp 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/broadcom_29_08_25_extraExtra.webp 1600w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><source srcset=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/broadcom_29_08_25_small.png 480w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/broadcom_29_08_25_medium.png 768w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/broadcom_29_08_25_large.png 992w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/broadcom_29_08_25_extra.png 1200w,https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/broadcom_29_08_25_extraExtra.png 1600w\" type=\"image/png\"/><img data-responsive=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/broadcom_29_08_25.webp\"/></picture><sup><i>Sources: CMC Markets, TradingView, Michael Kramer</i></sup><p> </p><h2>Consensus price target remains positive</h2><p>Overall, shares of Broadcom – which has overtaken <a href=\"/en-gb/instruments/tesla-inc\">Tesla</a> to become the seventh most valuable listed US company – are expected to tick higher over the medium to long term.
