            "description": "<div class=\"content__text\">\n<span class=\"content__text__location\"><strong>INDIANAPOLIS — </strong></span><p><a href=\"https://spectronrx.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">SpectronRx</a>, a leading radiopharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO/CMO) and isotope producer, today announced it has commenced mass production of high-purity Actinium-225 (Ac-225). Using a proprietary accelerator-based method, SpectronRx is now producing this critical medical isotope at a commercial scale sufficient to meet rising global demand for targeted radiopharmaceutical therapies.</p><p>SpectronRx’s innovative production method overcomes longstanding challenges associated with the limited availability of Ac-225, which has been a major bottleneck for advancing life-saving drugs. By addressing this shortfall, SpectronRx is enabling drug developers, manufacturers and researchers worldwide to access a reliable, abundant supply of Ac-225 for medical use. </p><p>“This marks a significant milestone for our company, our clients and the patients who will benefit from the advancements in Actinium-225-labeled drug products,” said John Zehner, CEO of SpectronRx. “With the expanding pipeline of Ac-225-based radiopharmaceuticals making progress toward FDA approval, there's promising evidence that the prognosis for certain cancers and other diseases could substantially improve. However, consequently, this has increased demand for Ac-225-labeled drugs, leading to notable shortages. But now we can meet that demand, which is what makes this development so exciting for the future of patient care.”</p><p>SpectronRx now owns multiple accelerators that can produce Ac-225 and plans to add more as it continues to scale its operations to meet global demand. SpectronRx has made an essential advancement in de-risking the Ac-225 supply chain. </p><p>“Our team has successfully scaled a robust process for manufacturing high-purity Ac-225, and we are ready to supply the market,” said Anwer Rizvi, President of SpectronRx. “We have established the quality systems and manufacturing capacity to support our partners from early-phase clinical trials through to commercial launch. This milestone reinforces our commitment to leadership in radiopharmaceuticals and our confidence in the profound clinical potential of Actinium-225 as a powerful tool against cancer.”</p><p>Ac-225 is a highly sought-after alpha-emitting isotope. When attached to a targeting molecule, it can be delivered directly to cancer sites, where it destroys tumor cells with minimal damage to surrounding healthy tissue and has the potential to inhibit replication. Until now, the scarcity of Ac-225 has been a significant barrier to its widespread use in medicine. SpectronRx’s production capability directly resolves this historical challenge.</p><p>SpectronRx boasts an impressive footprint with over 250,000 square feet of CDMO space, more than 50 state-of-the-art hot cells and clean rooms and a dedicated team of 220 employees across five locations in the US and Europe. As a global leader in radiolabeling and supply, SpectronRx manufactures and delivers Ac-225 radiolabeled drug products across 29 countries. Collaborating with more than 31 pharmaceutical and biotech companies, SpectronRx’s highly skilled radiopharmaceutical experts are at the forefront of developing and producing life-saving nuclear medicines.</p><p>To learn more, visit <a href=\"https://spectronrx.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">SpectronRx.com</a>.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"large medium article-body\">\n<h3>Dive Brief:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hemab Therapeutics raised a $157 million Series C round to advance a pipeline of drugs aimed at what it describes as “underserved” blood disorders. </li>\n<li>The startup has two prospects in clinical testing for a pair of conditions that hinder the body’s ability to properly clot blood. One, sutacimig, will begin a pivotal trial in Glanzmann thrombasthenia next year. The other, HMB-002, is currently in an <a href=\"https://www.hemab.com/news-items/hemab-therapeutics-presents-positive-clinical-and-preclinical-data-across-bleeding-disorder-pipeline-at-isth-2025-congress\">early-stage study</a> that’s shown “proof of mechanism,” CEO Benny Sorensen told BioPharma Dive.  </li>\n<li>Hemab’s funding was led by Sofinnova Partners and involved a dozen other firms, including Novo Holdings and multiple “crossover” investors that back private and publicly traded companies. The cash will support testing of its top two medicines and other to-be-announced drug programs. “All of this is in the spirit of building the ultimate coagulation disorders company,” Sorensen said. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3>Dive Insight:</h3>\n<p>Innovation in hemophilia has taken off over the last decade or so. Longer-lasting “replacement” therapies, antibody drugs and gene therapies have all given patients a better ability to control the spontaneous bleeds that characterize their condition. </p>\n<p>But progress in multiple other bleeding diseases has been slower going. In the three Hemab is focusing on — <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538270/\">Glanzmann thrombasthenia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/von-willebrand-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354978\">Von Willebrand</a> and <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5406770/\">Factor VII deficiency</a> — questions about market size have left drugmakers with “less commercial incentive” to develop treatments, Sorensen said. These disorders also require more “complex innovations and bioengineering” to unearth better options, he added. </p>\n<figure class=\"image-right inside_story\">\n<div class=\"figure_content\">\n<div><img alt=\"A headshot of Benny Sorensen, the CEO of Hemab Therapeutics.\" data-imagemodel=\"188374\" src=\"https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/wryfsR95aMgQyJxM2AVH_zMxN4VSII6EBUhVUqx2J9Y/g:ce/rs:fit:1600:0/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9CZW5ueV9Tw7hyZW5zZW5fSGVhZHNob3RfMjAyNV8xLmpwZw==.webp\"/></div>\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"inside_story_caption\">\n<div class=\"caption_text\">Benny Sorensen is the CEO of Hemab Therapeutics.</div>\n<div class=\"source_text\">Permission granted by Hemab Therapeutics</div>\n<div class=\"clearfix\"> </div>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>That might be changing, however. In Von Willebrand, a group of drugmakers including Hemab, <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/star-therapeutics-von-willebrand-series-d/761286/\">Star Therapeutics</a> and larger pharmaceutical companies like <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06998524\">Roche</a> have been working on newer approaches. As with hemophilia, they’re aiming for better alternatives to the clotting factor-replacement therapies that require frequent infusions or injections. </p>\n<p>Roche, for instance, is evaluating its antibody drug Hemlibra in certain Von Willebrand patients. Star also has what it hopes will prove a longer-lasting, subcutaneously injected antibody. </p>\n<p>Hemab’s drug is also an antibody, but works differently, binding to a key area of the clotting protein that’s lacking in Von Willebrand. That interaction is supposed to boost circulating levels of that “Von Willebrand” factor as well as another clotting protein, Factor VIII, in turn providing a more durable and convenient treatment, Sorensen said.</p>\n<p>Hemab is aiming for once-monthly dosing, and Sorensen claimed HMB-002 is the only molecule that “directly targets the underlying pathophysiology” of the disease. </p>\n<p>In Glanzmann thrombasthenia and Factor VII deficiency — two rarer disorders — Hemab is working on a dual-targeting antibody that effectively drags a clotting protein to activated platelets. The goal is to precisely “plug” a bleed, which Hemab believes could offer advantages over other therapies. Phase 2 testing in the former condition showed a <a href=\"https://www.hemab.com/news-items/hemab-therapeutics-presents-interim-data-from-ongoing-phase-2-study-of-hmb-001-as-first-ever-prophylactic-treatment-in-glanzmann-thrombasthenia-and-preclinical-data-from-hmb-002-in-von-willebrand-disease-at-the-2025-eahad-annual-congress\">greater than 50% reduction</a> in yearly bleeds. A Phase 2 study in the latter disease will read out results next year, according to Sorensen.</p>\n<p>Hemab’s fundraise comes amid a recent upswing in venture funding after a slow start to 2025. October has been the most active month since January <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/biotech-venture-capital-funding-startup-tracker/726829/\">among the roughly two dozen firms tracked by BioPharma Dive</a>, with 17 financings announced so far, 10 of which have been worth $100 million or more. </p>\n<p>“I can only speak for our own experience,” Sorensen said, but Hemab “experienced lots of interest” and its funding was “significantly oversubscribed.”</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"large medium article-body\">\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>The healthcare landscape has never been more complex than it is today. As the population ages, more people are developing complex and chronic conditions that require specialized care. Advanced therapies make up an increasing percentage of new approvals, and their momentum keeps accelerating. For instance, some 25% of all FDA-approved cell and gene therapies were green-lit within the last 18 months alone<sup style=\"font-size: 10px;\">1</sup>.  Biologics that have been available for less than a decade, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1s) for weight loss, are gaining ever-greater market share. </span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>With this increase in healthcare complexity, the number of prescriptions for specialty medications has risen dramatically over the past five years. Most of the patients prescribed these drugs have multiple comorbidities, with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity and hypertension frequently coexisting, for instance. Between 60 and 80% of specialty pharmacy patients are taking multiple medications, with the number of drugs typically increasing with age.<sup style=\"font-size: 10px;\">2</sup></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>To overcome these obstacles, biopharma companies need to adopt a more holistic, patient-centric approach that prioritizes patient experience and engagement across the product life cycle. All stakeholders — including manufacturers, payers, providers and pharmacies — must work together to break down silos and deliver truly patient-centric care. Community pharmacies are uniquely positioned to serve as a bridge connecting patients to the education, support and medicines they need to achieve the best possible health outcomes. </span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span>“Our focus on the whole patient makes us a strategic partner for biopharma, not just a tactical one,” says Anita Patel, Vice President of Pharmacy Services Development at Walgreens. “We’re activating pathways that help patients stay on the drugs they need to improve outcomes. We do this through education and long-term patient engagement, providing immunizations, support for patients with chronic conditions, and guidance at multiple touchpoints along the care journey. Through this continuous contact, we are able to amplify the effectiveness of care.”</span></span></span></span></p>\n<h4><span><span><span><span>Transforming clinical trials across research areas</span></span></span></span></h4>\n<p><span><span><span><span>Finding the right patients — and encouraging them to participate in clinical trials — has long been a challenge. Community pharmacies, with their established patient trust and local accessibility, are emerging as critical partners for trial sponsors interested in bringing research into local communities.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>AstraZeneca highlighted this potential in 2024 with the launch of AIRE (Accelerating Innovations and Research Excellence in Clinical Trials) Mobile Unit. This mobile clinical research initiative uses buses as trial sites, with the goal of making trials more representative of the U.S. population by increasing accessibility. When the AIRE mobile unit program needed a reliable and visible place to park its vehicles, Walgreens — with more than 8,500 store locations across the U.S. and a long history of community involvement — stood out as a collaborator of choice. By partnering with Walgreens, the AIRE team was able to leverage the trust the pharmacy had cultivated throughout 125 years of caring for communities to optimize the program and expand its reach. </span></span></span></p>\n\n<h4><span><span><span><span>Adding convenience boosts care quality and outcomes</span></span></span></span></h4>\n<p><span><span><span><span>For biopharma, reaching the right patients at the right time is essential for both clinical and commercial success. The right partnerships can help biopharma bridge the gap between trials and post-launch patient experience, giving today’s healthcare consumers the personalized, supportive experiences they expect and seek out.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span>One way this comes to life is through health screenings, which not only detect conditions early but also expand the pool of patients who can benefit from advanced therapies. Collaborating with biopharma companies, Walgreens community pharmacies educate patients while distributing at-home testing kits for a range of conditions including colorectal cancer screening (CRC), HbA1c and kidney function. Partnering with health plans, Walgreens takes a multi-channel engagement approach to help members complete colorectal cancer screening. The process starts with education on the importance of screening and continues until the patient receives test results. Some 70% of members who request a kit at the pharmacy counter complete their screenings, demonstrating the value of this approach.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<h4><span><span><span><span>Closing care gaps before they appear</span></span></span></span></h4>\n<p><span><span><span><span>Pharmacies can serve as proactive partners to help biopharma companies advance whole-person care. In one case, a drug manufacturer notified Walgreens of an impending product shortage that was expected to last about 2.5 weeks, potentially impacting thousands of patients. After coordinating its remaining inventory of the drug with the manufacturer’s stocking requirements, Walgreens began monitoring patient need, set up inter-company transfers to optimize supply, and temporarily adjusted some 90-day prescriptions to 30-day ones. Because no therapeutic equivalent was available for the drug, Walgreens pharmacists selectively used alternate strengths of the product to avoid therapy interruptions. Patients and prescribers were informed about the necessary changes until the manufacturer resolved the product shortage. This is a clear example of how pharmacy–biopharma collaboration keeps patients on therapies even in times of disruption.</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<h4><span><span><span><span>Improving medication affordability unlocks access</span></span></span></span></h4>\n<p>Many patients today struggle to afford their medications. In a recent Gallup survey, 11% of people said they could not afford medication and care within the past three months.<sup style=\"font-size: 10px;\">3</sup></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span>Community pharmacies play an important role in helping to connect patients to critical financial support programs. Walgreens, for instance, helped 66% of its oncology patients achieve a zero-dollar out-of-pocket cost for their oncology and concomitant medications in 2024. As a part of onboarding, Walgreens pharmacists proactively assess patient needs and match individuals with available assistance from drug manufacturers or foundations on a case-by-case basis. Beginning with a baseline assessment of how well patients fit applicable program criteria, Walgreens can either enroll the patient (with consent) into the program or help the patient submit their own application for assistance. </span></span></span></span></p>\n<h4><span><span><span>Working side by side to streamline and elevate care</span></span></span></h4>\n<p><span><span><span>As healthcare grows more complex, patients require more support to navigate the system and achieve the best outcomes. Community pharmacies play an important role that goes far beyond dispensing medicines, helping to simplify and coordinate care. As the healthcare partner closest to patients, these pharmacies are the ideal site to deliver high-touch, tech-enabled support that meets patients where they are and helps them understand their treatment journey, improving adherence to life-changing therapies.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>“We have visibility across the entire continuum of care,” says Anthony Scatamacchia, Head of Biopharma Services Growth at Walgreens. “With a view of all the medications a patient is taking, all the conditions they have and all the benefits they’re entitled to from their insurer. And pharmacists have earned patients’ trust, which enables them to be effective as educators and influencers. In a complex world, this is something you can’t do without.”</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.walgreenshealth.com/biopharma\" target=\"_blank\">Discover how Walgreens can work with you to improve patient engagement, streamline care, and drive better outcomes.</a></p>\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"font-size: 10px\">1.

            "title": "Ventyx shares soar after study suggests cardiovascular benefits for experimental drug",
            "description": "<div class=\"large medium article-body\">\n<h3>Dive Brief:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Shares of Ventyx Biosciences, a San Diego-based drug company, nearly doubled Thursday morning after the company said an experimental medicine it’s been studying in people with obesity <a href=\"http://ir.ventyxbio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ventyx-biosciences-announces-positive-topline-results-phase-2\">showed significant effects on cardiovascular risk factors</a> in a mid-stage trial.</li>\n<li>The medicine, code-named VTX3232, failed to help trial participants lose more weight when given alone or as an add-on therapy to semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy. It did, however, significantly reduce biological markers of inflammation, fat levels and liver illness, Ventyx said late Wednesday.</li>\n<li>Analysts argue the results lend more support to Ventyx’s approach of fighting disease by focusing on an <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3893\" target=\"_blank\">inflammasome</a> known as NLRP3. Shares of a rival company also targeting NLRP3, BioAge Labs, jumped more than 30% in early trading Thursday.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3>Dive Insight:</h3>\n<p>While Ventyx’s data “technically missed” by showing no effect on obesity, Wall Street analysts did not have high expectations for the medicine on that front, according to Jefferies analyst Andrew Tsai. The study’s other findings, meanwhile, could attract a partner to advance the drug in cardiovascular diseases instead, Tsai wrote in a note to clients.</p>\n<p>“VTX3232, as an oral, once daily drug, represents a transformative opportunity in the treatment of cardiovascular disease,” the company said in its release. There’s “growing evidence,” the company added, that targeting NLRP3 can benefit patients by curbing inflammation that can lead to atherosclerosis, arrhythmias, heart failure and other cardiometabolic disorders.</p>\n<p>The promise of NLRP3 in a variety of diseases has attracted companies ranging from <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/nodthera-parkinsons-clinical-trial-immune-system-drug/709638/\">startups like NodThera</a> to <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/roche-inflazome-nlrp3-inflammasome-drug-deal/585566/\">pharmaceutical giants like Roche</a>. Ventyx is also testing VTX3232 in patients with early Parkinson’s disease. And it has another NLRP3 drug, VTX2735, in development for a condition in which the membrane surrounding the heart becomes inflamed multiple times.</p>\n<p>In this latest study, VTX3232 met the main goal, which was safety and tolerability. The secondary aim was to observe drug’s effects on “hsCRP” — short for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, a biomarker that helps predict the risk of coronary artery disease. Researchers also looked at weight loss and other measures of inflammation.</p>\n<p>The company conducted two hsCRP analyses of patients receiving VTX3232. They showed those given the experimental drug had either a 64% or 78% reduction in hsCRP after 12 weeks, compared with a 3% increase among participants on a placebo. VTX3232-treated patients also showed reductions in liver inflammation and levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6.</p>\n<p>Ventyx shifted its focus more toward NLRP3 drugs after a setback with another type of medicine designed to treat <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/ventyx-cancel-tyk2-research-crohns-disease-data/722628/\">Crohn’s disease</a>. In its release Wednesday, the company said it will update investors “in future disclosures” on its plans for advancing VTX3232.</p>\n<p>At the high point, Ventyx shares traded at $7.82 Thursday morning.</p>\n</div>",

The deal hands Chugai partial rights to <strong>sparsentan</strong>, a medicine <strong>Travere Therapeutics</strong> developed and sells in the U.S. and Europe as <strong>Filspari</strong> for the kidney disease IgA nephropathy. Renalys has been running a Phase 3 IgA nephropathy trial in Japan and expects results in the fourth quarter. Should that study read out positively and yield approvals in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, Chugai will add another 16 billion yen to the deal. — <em>Ben Fidler</em></p>\n\n\n<p>Drug prices rose at a rate higher than inflation and gross domestic product growth between 2022 and 2024, according to a <a href=\"https://icer.org/pressreleases/new-institute-for-clinical-and-economic-review-report-shows-significant-jump-in-launch-prices-exceeding-inflation-and-gdp-growth/\">report released Thursday</a> by the <strong>Institute for Clinical and Economic Review</strong>. ICER's report focused on the \"net price\" paid for prescription drugs after rebates and discounts. It found that, when adjusted for inflation, the annual launch prices of drugs increased by 51% from 2022 to 2024, while the yearly \"list price\" climbed 24% over that timeframe. The findings show that \"in many cases, we are overpaying for treatments,\" alleged ICER president and CEO <strong>Sarah Emond</strong>, in a statement. — <em>Ben Fidler</em></p>\n<p><strong>Arcturus Therapeutics</strong> lost more than half of its market value Wednesday after an inhalable, messenger RNA-based therapy for cystic fibrosis <a href=\"https://ir.arcturusrx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/arcturus-therapeutics-provides-interim-phase-2-data-cystic\">didn’t meaningfully improve lung function</a> in a Phase 2 trial. Initial study results of Arcturus’ drug, ARCT-032, from a group of six patients found that five still had a decline in function after 28 days. Arcturus said the treatment was well-tolerated, and showed signs of improvement on certain imaging analyses. Enrollment is also ongoing in a cohort receiving a higher dose, with study results expected next year. Still, shares fell from over $20 apiece to about $11, as the results were “underwhelming,” wrote <strong>Leerink Partners</strong> analyst Lili Nsongo. — <em>Ben Fidler</em></p>\n<p>Shares of <strong>Terns Pharmaceuticals</strong> fell around 7% on Wednesday after <a href=\"https://ir.ternspharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/terns-pharmaceuticals-reports-topline-12-week-data-its-phase-2\">announcing plans to cancel work</a> on its GLP-1 pill for obesity because of disappointing study data. The drug, TERN-601, achieved statistically significant weight loss totals at three dose levels compared with a placebo, with study participants losing up to 4.6 percentage points more than placebo recipients after 12 weeks of treatment. However, three of the 134 trial volunteers treated with the drug had severe liver enzyme elevations, and two of them had signs of organ damage. Terns previously decided to <a href=\"https://ir.ternspharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/terns-pharmaceuticals-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial\">focus resources on</a> an experimental leukemia treatment while partnering off its metabolic disease work. — <em>Jonathan Gardner</em></p>\n\n<div class=\"hide-small show-large\" id=\"desktop-inline-signup\"></div>\n<p><strong>Summit Therapeutics </strong><a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251022041844/en/Summit-Therapeutics-Raises-%24500-Million-in-Private-Placement\">raised $500 million</a> in a private share sale to a group of investors that included some of its own executives as well as its development partner <strong>Akeso</strong>. Summit sold 26.7 million shares at $18.74 apiece, their closing price on Tuesday. The raise announced Wednesday came three days after Summit <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/summit-akeso-ivonescimab-harmoni6-lung-cancer-trial/803193/\">reported updated data</a> from one of the studies testing its PD-1 and VEGF inhibitor ivonescimab and ahead of plans to <a href=\"https://www.smmttx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_PR_1020-_-Q3-2025-Earnings-Press-Release-_-FINAL-v1-1.pdf\">seek U.S. approval</a> in a <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/summit-ivonescimab-pd1-vegf-egfr-lung-cancer-study-results/749401/\">form of lung cancer</a>.

            "title": "Sanofi says ‘soft’ start to fall immunizations slowed vaccine sales",
            "description": "<div class=\"large medium article-body\">\n<p>Sanofi on Friday reported a sharp decline in quarterly vaccine sales, a development the French company partially tied to lower immunization rates in the U.S.</p>\n<p>In its latest earnings report, Sanofi said that its overall <a href=\"https://www.sanofi.com/assets/dotcom/pressreleases/2025/2025-10-24-05-30-00-3172594-en.pdf\">vaccine sales fell by 7.8% to €3.4 billion,</a> or $3.9 billion, between July and September. The pullback was largely driven by a slowdown in influenza shots, which, combined with the revenue Sanofi derives from Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine Nuvaxovid, decreased by 16.8%, to €1.5 billion. Sanofi’s COVID-19 and influenza vaccine sales are down a total of 14% this year, the company said.</p>\n\n\n<p>In prepared remarks and on an earnings call with analysts, Sanofi executives claimed the lower numbers were “expected.” CEO Paul Hudson cited “price competition” in Germany and a slowdown in the U.S. </p>\n<p>“It's early. We're still in October. But I think it's fair that with the first few weeks that we observed a little bit of vaccination rate on the soft side when it comes to flu vaccination, particularly in the U.S.,” Thomas <span>Triomphe</span>, Sanofi’s head of vaccines R&amp;D, told analysts. </p>\n<p>Vaccines have faced heightened commercial pressure in the U.S. since the confirmation of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Kennedy overhauled a key committee guiding U.S. vaccine policy, <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/cdc-acip-panel-vaccine-evidence-question-rfk/751649/\">replacing them</a> with <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/acip-cdc-covid-vaccine-guidelines-coverage-prescriptions/760660/\">a handpicked group</a> more aligned with <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/cdc-acip-meeting-preview-vaccines-covid-measles-kennedy/760113/\">his skeptical views on immunizations.</a> The Food and Drug Administration has also set in place a <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/fda-covid-booster-approval-framework-makary-prasad-nejm/748580/\">stricter framework for COVID-19 shots</a>, leading to narrower clearances than in years past. </p>\n<p>Over that time, vaccination rates for <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/kindergarten-routine-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline/\">routine childhood immunizations</a> have declined, even as a measles outbreak has taken hold. Rates of flu shots have also been in a prolonged downswing in the U.S., according to a report earlier this year from the nonprofit group <a href=\"https://www.rheumatologyadvisor.com/news/2020-to-2024-saw-drop-in-flu-vaccine-uptake-among-us-adults/\">PLOS Global Health</a>. </p>\n<p>Sanofi, one of the world’s preeminent vaccine makers, continues to invest in the space, however. The company, for instance, has multiple combination shots for influenza and other viruses <a href=\"https://www.sanofi.com/assets/dotcom/pressreleases/2025/2025-10-24-05-30-00-3172594-en.pdf\">in development.</a></p>\n<p>“Sanofi has a proud legacy of flu vaccines, and we remain committed on bringing innovation to strengthen our leadership in flu and to provide better protection for patients,” Hudson said Friday. </p>\n\n<div class=\"hide-small show-large\" id=\"desktop-inline-signup\"></div>\n<p>Despite the slowdown in vaccine sales, Sanofi’s overall revenue rose by 2.3%, boosted in part by revenue for its blockbuster anti-inflammatory drug Dupixent. Sales of Dupixent surged by 26.2% to €4.2 billion, a quarterly record that beat consensus estimates, wrote Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger. </p>\n<p>Sanofi’s Beyfortus, a preventive drug for <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/rsv-drug-approved-fda-sanofi-astrazeneca-beyfortus/688056/\">respiratory syncytial virus in infants</a>, also bested Wall Street projections. Sales jumped 14.6% to €739 million, or about $860 million, between April and June. Newer drug launches — which include the hemophilia medication <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/sanofi-altuviiio-fda-approval-hemophilia-longer-lasting/643444/\"><span>Altuviiio</span></a> and Ayvakit, a rare disease therapy <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/sanofi-blueprint-medicines-acquisition-deal-immunology/749557/\">acquired in Sanofi’s buyout of Blueprint Medicine</a>s — climbed 57.1%, reaching €1 billion for the quarter.</p>\n</div>",
