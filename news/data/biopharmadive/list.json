            "description": "<div class=\"large medium article-body\">\n<h3>Dive Brief:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bristol Myers Squibb on Thursday touted <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260225116016/en/SystImmune-and-Bristol-Myers-Squibb-Highlight-Positive-Phase-III-Interim-Topline-Results-for-izalontamab-brengitecan-Iza-bren-in-Previously-Treated-Unresectable-Locally-Advanced-or-Metastatic-Triple-Negative-Breast-Cancer\">the results of a Chinese study</a> that showed positive results for a cancer treatment it licensed in 2023.</li>\n<li>Researchers tested the drug, iza-bren, in patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer whose disease had progressed after previous therapy. They found that the experimental medication improved the chances of progression-free survival and overall survival, compared with chemotherapy.</li>\n<li>Sichuan Biokin, the parent company of Bristol Myers’ partner SystImmune, sponsored the study in mainland China. Outside of the country, Bristol Myers and SystImmune are co-developing the drug under an agreement that could <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/bristol-myers-systimmune-adc-cancer-drug-deal/702223/\">potentially be worth more than $8 billion</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3>Dive Insight:</h3>\n<p>The study is another win for antibody drug conjugates, a class that has <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/merck-daiichi-sankyo-adc-antibody-drug-conjugate-pharma/697322/\">generated considerable attention among drugmakers</a> in recent years. Bristol Myers, Merck, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Gilead and Eli Lilly are among the major pharmaceutical companies that have inked deals to gain access to the medicines, which have spurred startups aiming to <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/neok-bio-bispecific-adc-biotech-startup-launch-abl/804378/\">take the technology a step further</a>. </p>\n<p>The drugs offer the promise of more targeted care for patients instead of traditional chemotherapy. The antibodies can bind to cancer cells and unleash toxins directly into them, sparing the healthy tissue that often falls victim to a blast of chemotherapy. </p>\n<p>It’s an approach that has already seen great success. A leader in the class, AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo’s Enhertu, targets HER2, a protein that is overexpressed in as much as a fifth of breast cancers. Initially approved in <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/astrazeneca-daiichi-enhertu-fda-approve-breast-cancer/569547/\">2019</a>, Enhertu is generating <a href=\"https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/dam/az/PDF/2025/Q4-FY/Full-year-Q4-2025-results-announcement.pdf#:~:text=(Growth%20numbers%20at%20constant%20exchange,CVRM%2C%20R%26I%20and%20Rare%20Disease\">billions</a> of dollars in sales and <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/enhertu-fda-approval-first-line-her2-breast-cancer/807969/\">changing the way certain breast cancers</a> are treated.</p>\n<p>Iza-bren is among a number of experimental medicines designed to improve on the basic idea of antibody drug conjugates. Instead of one target, iza-bren seeks out two, EGFR and HER3. Both are highly expressed in a range of cancers, Bristol Myers said. </p>\n<p>The Chinese study focused specifically on patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Bristol Myers and SystImmune are also developing the medicine <a href=\"https://www.bms.com/assets/bms/us/en-us/pdf/investor-info/doc_presentations/2025/BMY-2025-Q4-Results-Investor-Presentation.pdf\">for other indications</a>, including lung cancer. And in China, two applications for the drug for <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41571-025-01094-y\">nasopharyngeal carcinoma</a> and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma have already been accepted for review.</p>\n<p>With its regulatory flexibility and lower costs, China has become a <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/china-biotech-drug-licensing-trends-pitchbook-cell-gene-therapy/810478/\">top destination</a> for drugmakers like Bristol Myers looking to <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/china-biotech-drug-licensing-deals-pipeline/758283/\">beef up their pipelines</a>. Bristol Myers has struggled with looming patent expirations and <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/bristol-myers-johnson-johnson-milvexian-study-results-acs/805535/\">clinical setbacks</a>. But executives say the company is <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/jpm26-china-biotech-pfizer-obesity-bristol-sarepta-elevidys-sales/809320/\">entering a “data-rich” period</a> that will yield a younger and more diverse portfolio for the future.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"article-body add-drop-cap\">\n<p>The makeup of the world’s pharmaceutical pipeline is changing. China’s fast-growing biotechnology industry is a big reason why. </p>\n<p>Over the past decade, China’s government has sought to upgrade the country’s drugmaking capabilities. Its efforts birthed a burgeoning ecosystem of homegrown companies and science parks that mirror — and even rival —  U.S. hubs in Boston and San Francisco. Lower costs and regulatory flexibility have helped China’s biotech startups move faster than their U.S. counterparts, producing a sprawling inventory of drug prospects. While many are designed to be superior versions of medicines either on the market or in development elsewhere, more and more are innovative, challenging the U.S.’s long-held biotech advantage. </p>\n\n<p>Large pharma companies and venture capital investors have taken note. Many are licensing experimental drugs from China, either to add to their drug portfolios or build new biotechs around. The shift has been rapid, with dealmaking spiking in recent years. According to analysts, licensing agreements were on a record pace in 2025. Fully one-third of the industry’s licensing spending in 2025 involved drugs sourced from China, per the investment bank Jefferies.</p>\n<p>These deals reveal important insights about the types of medicines drugmakers and investors want in their portfolios. With this database, we’re tracking deals from 2025 onward in which China-based drugmakers licensed to U.S. and European companies rights to human therapeutics.

            "description": "<div class=\"large medium article-body\">\n<h4><span><span><span><strong>What are VHH antibodies?</strong></span></span></span></h4>\n<p><span><span><span>VHH antibodies, single<span>‑</span>domain antibodies (sdAbs) or nanobodies, are tiny, highly stable antibody fragments. They are gaining attention, because they combine powerful biological activity with unique structural advantages that traditional antibodies don’t have. They’re small, stable and highly engineerable, which makes them ideal for both therapeutic and diagnostic applications. However, while they offer strong advantages for biological development, they also introduce complexities for development and manufacturing.</span></span></span></p>\n\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>The discovery of the distinctive structure of heavy-chain-only antibodies in species belonging to the Camelidae family in 1989 sparked interest in their variable antigen-binding domain (VHH).</span></span> Caplacizumab (Cablivi®), the first FDA-approved VHH therapeutic in 2019, opened the door to many more programs. By the end of 2025, that momentum resulted in five globally approved VHH therapeutics and more than 49 sequences advancing into clinical development.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>In addition to indicators of growing clinical confidence and investment in next-generation biologics, the global VHH antibody market is growing, with CAGR estimates around 15%. This growth is driven by their promise for use in applications such as oncology, immunology and diagnostic imaging.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>VHH antibodies have been shown to accelerate progress from concept to clinic when supported by the right development infrastructure. This infrastructure is key, as they differ fundamentally from conventional antibodies, and so they bring distinct challenges in discovery, humanization, expression and analytical characterization. However, there are differences in structure that give VHH antibodies their potential. </span></span></span></p>\n<h4><span><span><span><strong>What’s so different about VHH structure?</strong></span></span></span></h4>\n<p><span><span><span>VHH antibodies differ from traditional antibodies in several critical ways:</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><strong><em>Small size - </em></strong><span>VHHs are extremely small (12–15 kDa), about one‑tenth the size of conventional IgGs, allowing them to reach cryptic epitopes, penetrate tissues more effectively and even cross certain biological barriers such as the blood–brain barrier.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><strong><em>Simple but stable structure - </em></strong>VHHs consist of a single variable domain, making folding straightforward. They exhibit exceptional thermal and chemical stability, enabling use across challenging formulation conditions, including respiratory and digestive environments. This inherent stability also supports robust, efficient manufacturability.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><strong><em>Flexible engineering - </em></strong>The lack of a light chain gives VHHs exceptional design flexibility for multi<span>‑</span>specific formats. Their unique paratope geometry creates an adaptable scaffold, enabling modular use as building blocks for complex therapeutics. VHHs can be readily fused with effector domains, including enzymes, toxins and Fc regions, to create highly functional, customizable molecules.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><strong><em>Low-cost manufacturing - </em></strong>Unlike conventional monoclonal antibodies that require mammalian expression, VHHs can be produced in simpler systems such as <em>E. coli</em> and yeast. This flexibility significantly shortens production timelines and can reduce overall process development costs.</span></span></span></p>\n<h4><span><span><span><strong>What are the challenges for VHH development and manufacturing?</strong></span></span></span></h4>\n<p><span><span><span>As an emerging technology, VHH therapeutics do not yet have the well‑established CMC pathways available for IgGs. Full‑length antibodies, by contrast, are supported by decades of GMP practice and clearly defined regulatory standards. This lack of clarity can prolong the development time for VHHs. </span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>Despite the maturity of library‑based VHH discovery methods, challenges persist in library generation and diversity. These include sequence diversity loss, difficulty conducting functional assays and the considerable time required.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>Process development and manufacturing challenges can include issues around platform fit and expression systems, due to the differences in the host system used. Scaling the process is often challenging as the small size of the VHHs increases their risk of loss during filtration and ultrafiltration. In addition, tailored analytical methods may be required. </span></span></span></p>\n\n<h4><span><span><span><strong>Where next for VHH antibodies?</strong></span></span></span></h4>\n<p><span><span><span>VHH (single<span>‑</span>domain) antibodies already have strong scientific momentum, but commercial success depends on:</span></span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><span><span>Discovery quality - VHH success begins with producing high<span>‑</span>quality binders that match or surpass full<span>‑</span>length antibodies</span></span></span></li>\n<li><span><span><span>Engineering robustness - well<span>‑</span>engineered VHHs can outperform IgGs on size, tissue penetration, and manufacturability, with careful design</span></span></span></li>\n<li><span><span><span>Manufacturability - VHHs promise lower cost of goods sold (COGS), but only if manufacturing is optimized</span></span></span></li>\n<li><span><span><span>Regulatory clarity – clear regulatory pathways and comparability frameworks will be essential</span></span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><span><span>VHH antibodies: they’re not just small; they are modular engineering platforms. The only limit is our imagination!</span></span></span></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"large medium article-body\">\n<p>Super Bowl ads have long been a cultural bellwether, and at this year’s big game, AI was a top trend with about <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/super-bowl-revealed-ai-messaging-crisis/\">23% of commercials</a> related to the technology.</p>\n<p>Like any impactful innovation, AI has led to lots of handwringing, from concerns about the <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/ai-has-environmental-problem-heres-what-world-can-do-about\">heavy environmental toll</a> of AI data centers to the potential negative effects on <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/14/nx-s1-5674741/ai-schools-education\">children’s cognitive growth</a>. For workers across industries, the threat of job losses also remains heavy. </p>\n<p>As large corporations pursue greater efficiency and bottom-line growth, AI is replacing human workers at an astonishing clip. Amazon <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/28/tech/amazon-layoffs-ai\">announced 16,000 layoffs</a> last month after it already <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/28/business/amazon-layoffs\">axed 14,000 jobs earlier in the year.</a></p>\n\n\n<p>“As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-on-generative-ai\">Amazon CEO Andy Jassy</a> wrote in June 2025.</p>\n<p>Despite this worrying shift, biopharma will likely be spared from such losses for now.</p>\n<p>“I wouldn't say that AI is necessarily replacing jobs one-for-one,” said Jae Yoo, executive director of EPM Scientific, a recruitment firm specializing in pharma, biotech and R&amp;D hiring. “It's rehousing and reshaping the types of jobs that are now coming in.”</p>\n<p>A recent poll of industry executives echoed that sentiment, with pharma’s C-suite <a href=\"https://www.pharmavoice.com/news/c-suite-pharma-future-ai-drug/808885/\">leaders reporting</a> that they don’t think AI will lead to major job losses.</p>\n<p>“Rather than replacing jobs, AI creates new roles and elevates existing ones, making curiosity, creativity and critical thinking essential skills for the future,” according to <a href=\"https://www.pfizer.com/news/announcements/accelerating-innovation-pfizers-2025-ai-festival\">Pfizer’s December announcement</a> of its second annual AI Festival.</p>\n<h3 class=\"standard-heading\">Reshaping the job landscape</h3>\n<p>Although biotech job losses <a href=\"https://www.pharmavoice.com/news/layoffs-biopharma-2026-drug-pharma/810386/\">have surged</a>, last year’s spike hasn’t necessarily been linked to AI. </p>\n<p>In fact, AI has added jobs at some Big Pharma companies. Eli Lilly announced it’s working with Nvidia to build an <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/lilly-ai-factory-nvidia-blackwell-dgx-superpod/\">“AI factory for drug discovery”</a> and <a href=\"https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/2gkZCv2YjAf2920LySziJIQYkzb?domain=investor.lilly.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">co-innovation lab in San Francisco</a> that will create new scientific and technical roles.</p>\n<p>AI hiring is also top of mind for the life sciences industry, with <a href=\"https://www.pharmavoice.com/news/ai-expertise-pharma-hiring-need-eli-lilly/749194/\">more than half of surveyed biotech execs</a> saying that AI experts are among the top three roles they need to fill in the coming years. The search for AI talent is especially critical as life sciences companies invest in and build more in-house AI teams.</p>\n\n<div class=\"hide-small show-large\" id=\"desktop-inline-signup\"></div>\n<p>“I'm seeing more in-house analytics buildouts versus in previous years where they would outsource a lot of these to vendors,” Yoo said. “Instead of using one person to oversee a vendor, they'll create that team internally.”</p>\n<p>Pharma job titles are also being reshaped by AI, creating hybrid roles that merge several functions and capabilities, such as commercial analytics and market access.</p>\n<p>“AI is allowing a lot of companies to transform some roles and make them more productive, versus hiring routine and repetitive rules-based positions,” Yoo said. “Our clients are asking us more for cross-functional skill sets than maybe a technical expert in just one area.”</p>\n<p>Yoo pointed to one company that combined departments after adding AI capabilities, requiring employees to work more cross-functionally.</p>\n<p>“You can call it restructuring, but there was not a single employee that was displaced,” he said.</p>\n<h3 class=\"standard-heading\">Where AI skills are in demand</h3>\n<p>Drug discovery is the biggest area where life sciences companies will not only add AI functions but jobs as well, Yoo said.</p>\n<p>“AI is allowing companies to discover therapies and drugs at a fraction of the cost that it took before, and a fraction of the resources. So there's a booming demand for AI and [machine learning] engineering talent, specifically in discovery,” he said.</p>\n<p>Commercial analytics roles are also in high demand, with a need for workers who can analyze commercial data and real-world evidence.</p>\n<p>“Any positions and departments that directly affect time-to-market and any type of regulatory success is going to remain in high demand,” he said. “That cross-functional piece, I think, is going to be really important.”</p><div class=\"show-small hide-large\" id=\"mobile-inline-signup\"></div><section class=\"storylines-carousel-wrapper hide-small show-large\" id=\"desktop-carousel\"></section>\n<p>Whether AI will eventually lead to major job losses in pharma remains to be seen, but for now Yoo believes the industry’s broader focus beyond revenue will help it retain jobs that are being lost in other industries.</p>\n<p>“At companies like Amazon or any tech company, there's more of a bottom line that you have to prioritize,” he said. “Whereas in pharma, you're prioritizing therapies, drugs and patients.”</p>\n</div>",
