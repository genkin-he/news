            "description": "<div class=\"content__text\">\n<span class=\"content__text__location\"><strong>INDIANAPOLIS — </strong></span><p><a href=\"https://spectronrx.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">SpectronRx</a>, a leading radiopharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO/CMO) and isotope producer, today announced it has commenced mass production of high-purity Actinium-225 (Ac-225). Using a proprietary accelerator-based method, SpectronRx is now producing this critical medical isotope at a commercial scale sufficient to meet rising global demand for targeted radiopharmaceutical therapies.</p><p>SpectronRx’s innovative production method overcomes longstanding challenges associated with the limited availability of Ac-225, which has been a major bottleneck for advancing life-saving drugs. By addressing this shortfall, SpectronRx is enabling drug developers, manufacturers and researchers worldwide to access a reliable, abundant supply of Ac-225 for medical use. </p><p>“This marks a significant milestone for our company, our clients and the patients who will benefit from the advancements in Actinium-225-labeled drug products,” said John Zehner, CEO of SpectronRx. “With the expanding pipeline of Ac-225-based radiopharmaceuticals making progress toward FDA approval, there's promising evidence that the prognosis for certain cancers and other diseases could substantially improve. However, consequently, this has increased demand for Ac-225-labeled drugs, leading to notable shortages. But now we can meet that demand, which is what makes this development so exciting for the future of patient care.”</p><p>SpectronRx now owns multiple accelerators that can produce Ac-225 and plans to add more as it continues to scale its operations to meet global demand. SpectronRx has made an essential advancement in de-risking the Ac-225 supply chain. </p><p>“Our team has successfully scaled a robust process for manufacturing high-purity Ac-225, and we are ready to supply the market,” said Anwer Rizvi, President of SpectronRx. “We have established the quality systems and manufacturing capacity to support our partners from early-phase clinical trials through to commercial launch. This milestone reinforces our commitment to leadership in radiopharmaceuticals and our confidence in the profound clinical potential of Actinium-225 as a powerful tool against cancer.”</p><p>Ac-225 is a highly sought-after alpha-emitting isotope. When attached to a targeting molecule, it can be delivered directly to cancer sites, where it destroys tumor cells with minimal damage to surrounding healthy tissue and has the potential to inhibit replication. Until now, the scarcity of Ac-225 has been a significant barrier to its widespread use in medicine. SpectronRx’s production capability directly resolves this historical challenge.</p><p>SpectronRx boasts an impressive footprint with over 250,000 square feet of CDMO space, more than 50 state-of-the-art hot cells and clean rooms and a dedicated team of 220 employees across five locations in the US and Europe. As a global leader in radiolabeling and supply, SpectronRx manufactures and delivers Ac-225 radiolabeled drug products across 29 countries. Collaborating with more than 31 pharmaceutical and biotech companies, SpectronRx’s highly skilled radiopharmaceutical experts are at the forefront of developing and producing life-saving nuclear medicines.</p><p>To learn more, visit <a href=\"https://spectronrx.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">SpectronRx.com</a>.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"article-body add-drop-cap\">\n<p>Drug development is an expensive, risky endeavor. Biotechnology companies just starting out are many years away from seeing profits, if ever. So more often than not, a startup’s success turning science into medicines can come down to how much money it raises. That’s where venture capitalists step in, investing many millions of dollars for stakes in newly formed companies.</p>\n<p>Young drugmakers rely on these private partners to survive until they can reach major milestones like entering clinical testing, or going public. And over the past two decades, they’ve had more and more help. The amount of money put into biotech has climbed considerably, resulting in the creation of hundreds of new companies.</p>\n\n<p>Tracking that investment can reveal important patterns, showing how different drug types or diseases rise or fall out of favor with investors. BioPharma Dive built this database to help make that larger picture clear.</p>\n<p>We’ve focused on a group of 26 venture capital firms that are highly active in creating new drug developers.

We screened for rounds involving at least one of a group of 26 highly active venture capital firms involved in company creation.</p>\n<p>This group was selected by comparing data from SVB, HSBC, William Blair and Bay Bridge Bio that identified the most active biotech venture capital firms in 2023 and 2024 (SVB, HSBC, William Blair), 2022 (SVB), 2021 (SVB) and in 2018 to 2023 (Bay Bridge Bio). Investment activity in those lists was defined by the number of fundraising rounds in which each firm participated that year.</p>\n<p>We then eliminated firms that were primarily a “crossover” investor. That yielded a list of 26 venture capital firms.</p>\n<p>This core group of 26 firms is narrow by definition. But the activity of these firms provides a meaningful snapshot of investment trends in the industry. Over time, we plan to expand on this initial database by adding in more firms that meet our target focus.</p>\n<p>This database is similarly limited by time. We focused on rounds that were completed and announced on or after Jan. 1, 2022. This captures a period of time in which the biotech sector experienced a downturn after a record high and the sector’s subsequent recovery. We also plan to add historical data from prior to Jan. 1, 2022 in later updates.</p>\n<p>For each round identified, we collected information on the relevant company’s drugmaking modality and therapeutic area of focus, as well as the company’s stage of development and lead investors, if not one of the core group of 26 firms.</p>\n<p>We generally used a company’s lead program to determine its modality, therapeutic area of focus and stage of development at the time of each round’s completion. The only exceptions to this are companies that inherited a late-stage candidate, but identified an earlier candidate as their priority and reason for raising funds. We categorized companies’ phase of development by the latest stage begun at the time of financing. So a company raising money to start a Phase 2 clinical trial that it hadn’t yet begun would be classified as in Phase 1.</p>\n<p>The modalities listed are broadly defined and may not precisely describe an individual company’s experimental drug(s). They were chosen to better show overall trends in investment activity. “Drug discovery,” as a category, is meant to indicate those companies exploring new areas of science broadly, rather than focusing on a specific type of medicine.</p>\n<p>Similarly, therapeutic areas cover a large number of diseases and, in some cases, such as with rare conditions, overlap with others. Common diseases that didn’t fit in the categories listed, such as those primarily affecting the heart, lungs, kidneys and endocrine system, were classified under “other.” When companies identified more than one therapeutic area with equal priority, we classified them as working on “multiple” therapeutic areas. Those that identified multiple areas, but prioritized one over others were classified under that priority area.</p>\n<p>The nomenclature of venture capital rounds is fairly consistent, but some firms did not identify whether their round was seed or Series A, B, C, etc. In those cases, we classified the round as “undisclosed.” Extensions, expansions, or other add-on raises to an earlier Series round are noted, but not classified separately.</p>\n<p>Nearly all rounds were announced in U.S. dollars. A handful were priced in euros or other foreign currencies, which we converted to dollars using exchange rate data from the relevant country’s central bank on the day the round was announced.</p>\n<p>We organized rounds by the date they were announced, which in some cases is much later than when the round was actually raised if a company was initially operating in stealth. We did this for consistency, and to better match when a round’s existence was public knowledge. </p>\n<p>BioPharma Dive will update this database as rounds that meet our screening criteria are announced, but there may be some delay in when new rounds are added.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"article-body add-drop-cap\">\n<p>The makeup of the world’s pharmaceutical pipeline is changing. China’s fast-growing biotechnology industry is a big reason why. </p>\n<p>Over the past decade, China’s government has sought to upgrade the country’s drugmaking capabilities. Its efforts birthed a burgeoning ecosystem of homegrown companies and science parks that mirror — and even rival —  U.S. hubs in Boston and San Francisco. Lower costs and regulatory flexibility have helped China’s biotech startups move faster than their U.S. counterparts, producing a sprawling inventory of drug prospects. While many are designed to be superior versions of medicines either on the market or in development elsewhere, more and more are innovative, challenging the U.S.’s long-held biotech advantage. </p>\n\n<p>Large pharma companies and venture capital investors have taken note. Many are licensing experimental drugs from China, either to add to their drug portfolios or build new biotechs around. The shift has been rapid, with dealmaking spiking in recent years. According to analysts, licensing agreements are on a record pace in 2025. Fully one-third of the industry’s licensing spending this year has involved drugs sourced from China, per the investment bank Jefferies.</p>\n<p>These deals reveal important insights about the types of medicines drugmakers and investors want in their portfolios. With this database, we’re tracking 2025 deals in which China-based drugmakers licensed to U.S. and European companies rights to human therapeutics.

Zepbound’s cost for people using this option is 50% lower than the list price of other GLP-1 obesity medications, Lilly said.</li>\n<li>The Walmart partnership extends a push that began <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/lilly-zepbound-obesity-self-pay-single-dose-vials/725346/\">more than a year ago</a> as Lilly sought to fight back against drug compounders and telehealth companies selling knockoff versions of Zepbound. It’s also a way to sidestep insurers that can limit access to treatment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3>Dive Insight:</h3>\n<p>Obesity medicine is evolving into a different market than many other drugs, with a substantial number of people with prescriptions for Zepbound and <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/amgen-maritide-trials-duchenne-base-editing-wegovy-discount/741651/\">Novo Nordisk’s competing shot Wegovy</a> paying exclusively in cash. Insurance coverage limits have been a big reason why, along with the availability of cheap, compounded versions sold by telehealth companies.</p>\n<p>According to Lilly, which reports earnings on Thursday, 35% of new prescriptions in the second quarter of 2025 were filled through direct-to-consumer channel, an online service called “LillyDirect.”</p>\n<p>“The growth of LillyDirect's direct-to-consumer offering underscores the momentum behind a more modern, consumer-driven model of care,” said Jennifer Mazur, senior vice president and general manager of LillyDirect, in a statement. \"LillyDirect, powered by Walmart, builds on that progress — extending convenience and choice to patients while reinforcing LillyDirect's mission to empower more people on their health journey.\"</p>\n<p>Through the cash-pay program, Lilly sells Zepbound in vials, rather than the auto-injectors offered under other coverage. The 2.5 milligram starter dose is available at $349 a month, with higher doses ranging from 5 to 15 milligrams all available at $499.</p>\n<p>People receiving those higher doses must enter the “self-pay journey program,” which is meant to support continuity of care and access to Zepbound.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"large medium article-body\">\n<h3>Dive Brief:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hemab Therapeutics raised a $157 million Series C round to advance a pipeline of drugs aimed at what it describes as “underserved” blood disorders. </li>\n<li>The startup has two prospects in clinical testing for a pair of conditions that hinder the body’s ability to properly clot blood. One, sutacimig, will begin a pivotal trial in Glanzmann thrombasthenia next year. The other, HMB-002, is currently in an <a href=\"https://www.hemab.com/news-items/hemab-therapeutics-presents-positive-clinical-and-preclinical-data-across-bleeding-disorder-pipeline-at-isth-2025-congress\">early-stage study</a> that’s shown “proof of mechanism,” CEO Benny Sorensen told BioPharma Dive.  </li>\n<li>Hemab’s funding was led by Sofinnova Partners and involved a dozen other firms, including Novo Holdings and multiple “crossover” investors that back private and publicly traded companies. The cash will support testing of its top two medicines and other to-be-announced drug programs. “All of this is in the spirit of building the ultimate coagulation disorders company,” Sorensen said. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3>Dive Insight:</h3>\n<p>Innovation in hemophilia has taken off over the last decade or so. Longer-lasting “replacement” therapies, antibody drugs and gene therapies have all given patients a better ability to control the spontaneous bleeds that characterize their condition. </p>\n<p>But progress in multiple other bleeding diseases has been slower going. In the three Hemab is focusing on — <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538270/\">Glanzmann thrombasthenia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/von-willebrand-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354978\">Von Willebrand</a> and <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5406770/\">Factor VII deficiency</a> — questions about market size have left drugmakers with “less commercial incentive” to develop treatments, Sorensen said. These disorders also require more “complex innovations and bioengineering” to unearth better options, he added. </p>\n<figure class=\"image-right inside_story\">\n<div class=\"figure_content\">\n<div><img alt=\"A headshot of Benny Sorensen, the CEO of Hemab Therapeutics.\" data-imagemodel=\"188374\" src=\"https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/wryfsR95aMgQyJxM2AVH_zMxN4VSII6EBUhVUqx2J9Y/g:ce/rs:fit:1600:0/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9CZW5ueV9Tw7hyZW5zZW5fSGVhZHNob3RfMjAyNV8xLmpwZw==.webp\"/></div>\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"inside_story_caption\">\n<div class=\"caption_text\">Benny Sorensen is the CEO of Hemab Therapeutics.</div>\n<div class=\"source_text\">Permission granted by Hemab Therapeutics</div>\n<div class=\"clearfix\"> </div>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>That might be changing, however. In Von Willebrand, a group of drugmakers including Hemab, <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/star-therapeutics-von-willebrand-series-d/761286/\">Star Therapeutics</a> and larger pharmaceutical companies like <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06998524\">Roche</a> have been working on newer approaches. As with hemophilia, they’re aiming for better alternatives to the clotting factor-replacement therapies that require frequent infusions or injections. </p>\n<p>Roche, for instance, is evaluating its antibody drug Hemlibra in certain Von Willebrand patients. Star also has what it hopes will prove a longer-lasting, subcutaneously injected antibody. </p>\n<p>Hemab’s drug is also an antibody, but works differently, binding to a key area of the clotting protein that’s lacking in Von Willebrand. That interaction is supposed to boost circulating levels of that “Von Willebrand” factor as well as another clotting protein, Factor VIII, in turn providing a more durable and convenient treatment, Sorensen said.</p>\n<p>Hemab is aiming for once-monthly dosing, and Sorensen claimed HMB-002 is the only molecule that “directly targets the underlying pathophysiology” of the disease. </p>\n<p>In Glanzmann thrombasthenia and Factor VII deficiency — two rarer disorders — Hemab is working on a dual-targeting antibody that effectively drags a clotting protein to activated platelets. The goal is to precisely “plug” a bleed, which Hemab believes could offer advantages over other therapies. Phase 2 testing in the former condition showed a <a href=\"https://www.hemab.com/news-items/hemab-therapeutics-presents-interim-data-from-ongoing-phase-2-study-of-hmb-001-as-first-ever-prophylactic-treatment-in-glanzmann-thrombasthenia-and-preclinical-data-from-hmb-002-in-von-willebrand-disease-at-the-2025-eahad-annual-congress\">greater than 50% reduction</a> in yearly bleeds. A Phase 2 study in the latter disease will read out results next year, according to Sorensen.</p>\n<p>Hemab’s fundraise comes amid a recent upswing in venture funding after a slow start to 2025. October has been the most active month since January <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/biotech-venture-capital-funding-startup-tracker/726829/\">among the roughly two dozen firms tracked by BioPharma Dive</a>, with 17 financings announced so far, 10 of which have been worth $100 million or more. </p>\n<p>“I can only speak for our own experience,” Sorensen said, but Hemab “experienced lots of interest” and its funding was “significantly oversubscribed.”</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"large medium article-body\">\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>The healthcare landscape has never been more complex than it is today. As the population ages, more people are developing complex and chronic conditions that require specialized care. Advanced therapies make up an increasing percentage of new approvals, and their momentum keeps accelerating. For instance, some 25% of all FDA-approved cell and gene therapies were green-lit within the last 18 months alone<sup style=\"font-size: 10px;\">1</sup>.  Biologics that have been available for less than a decade, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1s) for weight loss, are gaining ever-greater market share. </span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>With this increase in healthcare complexity, the number of prescriptions for specialty medications has risen dramatically over the past five years. Most of the patients prescribed these drugs have multiple comorbidities, with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity and hypertension frequently coexisting, for instance. Between 60 and 80% of specialty pharmacy patients are taking multiple medications, with the number of drugs typically increasing with age.<sup style=\"font-size: 10px;\">2</sup></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>To overcome these obstacles, biopharma companies need to adopt a more holistic, patient-centric approach that prioritizes patient experience and engagement across the product life cycle. All stakeholders — including manufacturers, payers, providers and pharmacies — must work together to break down silos and deliver truly patient-centric care. Community pharmacies are uniquely positioned to serve as a bridge connecting patients to the education, support and medicines they need to achieve the best possible health outcomes. </span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span>“Our focus on the whole patient makes us a strategic partner for biopharma, not just a tactical one,” says Anita Patel, Vice President of Pharmacy Services Development at Walgreens. “We’re activating pathways that help patients stay on the drugs they need to improve outcomes. We do this through education and long-term patient engagement, providing immunizations, support for patients with chronic conditions, and guidance at multiple touchpoints along the care journey. Through this continuous contact, we are able to amplify the effectiveness of care.”</span></span></span></span></p>\n<h4><span><span><span><span>Transforming clinical trials across research areas</span></span></span></span></h4>\n<p><span><span><span><span>Finding the right patients — and encouraging them to participate in clinical trials — has long been a challenge. Community pharmacies, with their established patient trust and local accessibility, are emerging as critical partners for trial sponsors interested in bringing research into local communities.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>AstraZeneca highlighted this potential in 2024 with the launch of AIRE (Accelerating Innovations and Research Excellence in Clinical Trials) Mobile Unit. This mobile clinical research initiative uses buses as trial sites, with the goal of making trials more representative of the U.S. population by increasing accessibility. When the AIRE mobile unit program needed a reliable and visible place to park its vehicles, Walgreens — with more than 8,500 store locations across the U.S. and a long history of community involvement — stood out as a collaborator of choice. By partnering with Walgreens, the AIRE team was able to leverage the trust the pharmacy had cultivated throughout 125 years of caring for communities to optimize the program and expand its reach. </span></span></span></p>\n\n<h4><span><span><span><span>Adding convenience boosts care quality and outcomes</span></span></span></span></h4>\n<p><span><span><span><span>For biopharma, reaching the right patients at the right time is essential for both clinical and commercial success. The right partnerships can help biopharma bridge the gap between trials and post-launch patient experience, giving today’s healthcare consumers the personalized, supportive experiences they expect and seek out.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span>One way this comes to life is through health screenings, which not only detect conditions early but also expand the pool of patients who can benefit from advanced therapies. Collaborating with biopharma companies, Walgreens community pharmacies educate patients while distributing at-home testing kits for a range of conditions including colorectal cancer screening (CRC), HbA1c and kidney function. Partnering with health plans, Walgreens takes a multi-channel engagement approach to help members complete colorectal cancer screening. The process starts with education on the importance of screening and continues until the patient receives test results. Some 70% of members who request a kit at the pharmacy counter complete their screenings, demonstrating the value of this approach.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<h4><span><span><span><span>Closing care gaps before they appear</span></span></span></span></h4>\n<p><span><span><span><span>Pharmacies can serve as proactive partners to help biopharma companies advance whole-person care. In one case, a drug manufacturer notified Walgreens of an impending product shortage that was expected to last about 2.5 weeks, potentially impacting thousands of patients. After coordinating its remaining inventory of the drug with the manufacturer’s stocking requirements, Walgreens began monitoring patient need, set up inter-company transfers to optimize supply, and temporarily adjusted some 90-day prescriptions to 30-day ones. Because no therapeutic equivalent was available for the drug, Walgreens pharmacists selectively used alternate strengths of the product to avoid therapy interruptions. Patients and prescribers were informed about the necessary changes until the manufacturer resolved the product shortage. This is a clear example of how pharmacy–biopharma collaboration keeps patients on therapies even in times of disruption.</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<h4><span><span><span><span>Improving medication affordability unlocks access</span></span></span></span></h4>\n<p>Many patients today struggle to afford their medications. In a recent Gallup survey, 11% of people said they could not afford medication and care within the past three months.<sup style=\"font-size: 10px;\">3</sup></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span>Community pharmacies play an important role in helping to connect patients to critical financial support programs. Walgreens, for instance, helped 66% of its oncology patients achieve a zero-dollar out-of-pocket cost for their oncology and concomitant medications in 2024. As a part of onboarding, Walgreens pharmacists proactively assess patient needs and match individuals with available assistance from drug manufacturers or foundations on a case-by-case basis. Beginning with a baseline assessment of how well patients fit applicable program criteria, Walgreens can either enroll the patient (with consent) into the program or help the patient submit their own application for assistance. </span></span></span></span></p>\n<h4><span><span><span>Working side by side to streamline and elevate care</span></span></span></h4>\n<p><span><span><span>As healthcare grows more complex, patients require more support to navigate the system and achieve the best outcomes. Community pharmacies play an important role that goes far beyond dispensing medicines, helping to simplify and coordinate care. As the healthcare partner closest to patients, these pharmacies are the ideal site to deliver high-touch, tech-enabled support that meets patients where they are and helps them understand their treatment journey, improving adherence to life-changing therapies.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>“We have visibility across the entire continuum of care,” says Anthony Scatamacchia, Head of Biopharma Services Growth at Walgreens. “With a view of all the medications a patient is taking, all the conditions they have and all the benefits they’re entitled to from their insurer. And pharmacists have earned patients’ trust, which enables them to be effective as educators and influencers. In a complex world, this is something you can’t do without.”</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.walgreenshealth.com/biopharma\" target=\"_blank\">Discover how Walgreens can work with you to improve patient engagement, streamline care, and drive better outcomes.</a></p>\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"font-size: 10px\">1.
