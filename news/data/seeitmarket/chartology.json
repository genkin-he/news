            "description": "<div class=\"td-post-content tagdiv-type\">\n<!-- image -->\n<!-- content -->\n\n<p>Bitmine (NASDAQ: BMNR) has quietly become one of the most interesting crypto-related stocks on the board — not because it mines Bitcoin, but because it no longer does.</p>\n<p>The company made a decisive pivot away from Bitcoin mining and went all-in on Ethereum. </p><!-- /126710690/ims/SeeItMarket/In_text_1 -->\n\n<p>Instead of managing expensive hardware and power costs, Bitmine raised capital, accumulated ETH, and shifted its business model toward an Ethereum-first treasury built around holdings and staking yield.</p>\n<p>To understand why that matters, you must understand Ethereum.</p>\n<p>Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily functions as digital money, Ethereum is more like a financial operating system. </p>\n<p>It powers decentralized finance, smart contracts, stablecoins, tokens, and a growing universe of digital assets. </p>\n<p>Ether (ETH) is the currency that fuels this network — and as adoption grows, demand for ETH grows with it.</p>\n<p>Bitmine’s strategy: hold Ethereum, generate yield through staking, and give investors stock market access to ETH exposure without needing wallets or crypto exchanges.</p>\n<p>That’s where the story gets interesting.</p>\n<p>When Tom Lee stepped in and aligned the company with a long-term Ethereum vision, the market responded instantly. </p>\n<p>BMNR surged dramatically as investors recognized it as a public equity proxy for Ethereum. Since then, the stock has behaved less like a traditional crypto miner and more like a high-beta reflection of ETH itself.</p>\n<p>When Ethereum rallies, Bitmine often amplifies the move.<br/>When Ethereum pauses, Bitmine tends to cool as well.</p>\n<p>That relationship makes the chart essential.</p>\n<p>Last week, I called for a bottom in Bitmine, when so many were thinking the crypto space was dead.</p>\n<p>And so far, that call is paying off. Price held key support, momentum has turned higher, and the stock is beginning to show signs of leadership. </p>\n<p>Now the focus shifts to whether that momentum continues and whether Ethereum itself maintains strength.</p>\n<p>The bigger picture is this:<br/>Companies holding Ethereum on their balance sheets are becoming the new way traditional investors gain crypto exposure through equities. </p>\n<p>Bitmine is emerging as one of the clearest examples of that trend.</p>\n<p>As Ethereum continues to establish itself as the infrastructure behind digital finance, stocks tied closely to its price and adoption could become important leadership indicators.</p>\n<p>For now, keep your eyes on the relationship between Ethereum and Bitmine. Because in this phase of the market, they are telling the same story.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://youtube.com/shorts/rlfoI_UWCKQ?si=Fu3QAO4LbRghZNE4\">Video</a></strong></p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Big Pharma Is Buying — Why Biotech Stocks Could Outperform in 2026",
            "description": "<div class=\"td-post-content tagdiv-type\">\n<!-- image -->\n<!-- content -->\n\n<p>Biotech is quietly stepping into a leadership role here in early 2026 — and the move is not happening in a vacuum.</p>\n<p>After years of underperformance from 2021 through much of 2024, the sector began a powerful rebound in the second half of 2025. </p><!-- /126710690/ims/SeeItMarket/In_text_1 -->\n\n<p>That rally was significant. From its April 2025 lows, the SPDR S&amp;P Biotech ETF (NASDAQ: IBB) surged roughly 75%, dramatically outperforming the broader market’s move over the same period.</p>\n<p>In many ways, that outperformance looked like a long-overdue catch-up trade. </p>\n<p>The real question now is whether that catch-up has further to run — or whether biotech is shifting into a sustained leadership phase.</p>\n<p>Right now, the evidence suggests the latter.</p>\n<p><strong>The Fundamental Tailwinds</strong></p>\n<p>Healthcare demand continues to grow globally, and with it, investment into biotechnology. This is not just speculative capital — it is strategic capital flowing into innovation pipelines.</p>\n<p>Advancements in gene editing and next-generation therapies are accelerating research timelines and expanding what is medically possible. At the same time, we are seeing a steady stream of encouraging clinical trial data and improved FDA filing activity.</p>\n<p>Successful trials and new approvals create real valuation support for companies across the biotech space. These are not hypothetical technologies anymore — they are moving toward commercialization and revenue generation.</p>\n<p>Another key factor is public awareness. Acceptance of biotechnology solutions, from genetic therapies to obesity drugs to personalized medicine, continues to expand. That growing comfort level helps support demand, funding, and long-term adoption.</p>\n<p><strong>Follow the Big Money: M&amp;A and Partnerships</strong></p>\n<p>Perhaps the most important theme to watch in 2026 is mergers and acquisitions.</p>\n<p>Large pharmaceutical companies are facing major patent expirations — what the industry calls “loss of exclusivity” cliffs. Those cliffs represent massive revenue gaps that must be filled. The fastest way to fill them is by acquiring or partnering with innovative biotech firms that already have promising drug pipelines.</p>\n<p>That dynamic sets up a supportive backdrop for biotech valuations.<br/>Strategic partnerships and early-stage acquisitions can reward investors and create a floor under many emerging companies.</p>\n<p><strong>Capital Rotation Back to Risk</strong></p>\n<p>We are also seeing a rotation of capital back into higher-beta growth sectors, including biotech. After a period where investors favored mega-cap technology and defensive positioning, money is starting to move into areas with stronger upside potential.</p>\n<p>Biotech sits squarely in that category.</p>\n<p>When risk appetite improves, biotech often becomes a destination for capital seeking outsized returns. That rotation is one of the clearest signs of improving confidence in the broader market environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Risks to Respect</strong></p>\n<p>Of course, biotech is never without risk.</p>\n<p>Interest rate pressures remain a macro consideration. Higher rates can weigh on growth-oriented sectors that rely heavily on future earnings potential. Regulatory headlines, drug pricing debates, and company-specific clinical setbacks can also introduce volatility.</p>\n<p>There is also ongoing competition for capital. Artificial intelligence and other high-growth themes continue to attract significant investment flows that might otherwise find their way into biotech.</p>\n<p>Yet despite these risks, sector fundamentals remain strong. Robust drug development pipelines, improving clinical data, and the likelihood of continued M&amp;A activity all support the longer-term outlook.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></p>\n<p>Biotech’s recent outperformance is not just a short-term bounce. It reflects improving fundamentals, renewed capital flows, and strategic demand from large pharmaceutical companies.</p>\n<p>If the sector continues to attract investment and deliver positive clinical and regulatory developments, leadership could persist well into 2026.</p>\n<p>For investors and traders alike, biotech is no longer a space to ignore.<br/>It is a space to watch closely — because when innovation, capital, and momentum align, this sector can move fast.</p>\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"597\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/T81Y3b_Jgm0\" title=\"Big Pharma Is Buying Again — Why Biotech Could Explode in 2026!\" width=\"336\"></iframe></p>\n<p></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"td-post-content tagdiv-type\">\n<!-- image -->\n<!-- content -->\n<p>The price of oil is pretty much near a five-year low, in a world where <em>everything</em> costs much more than it used to.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, our cars don’t run on gold.</p><!-- /126710690/ims/SeeItMarket/In_text_1 -->\n\n<p>Before delving into the Canadian energy space and the developments in Venezuela, here’s a brief synopsis from our reading, research, and thinking on oil.</p>\n<p>First, there’s too much oil in the world as we move into 2026, with both supply and demand sharing the blame. Supply has increased thanks largely to a few mega projects ramping up (e.g., the facilities in Guyana’s Stabroek Block); U.S. production holding up even with less drilling; and, obviously, OPEC removing previous production cuts.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, demand growth has been flat and is much more complex as the relationship between economic growth and oil demand has softened. The rising share of EVs and hybrids is having a gradual impact on gasoline demand, perhaps magnified somewhat by the hybrid work-from-home evolution that has simply reduced miles driven. China, historically a driver of oil demand, has also seen flat demand over the past few years. This is partly due to increased EVs, but their real estate crisis has likely been more impactful. Construction activity is a heavy user of oil.</p>\n<p>On the positive side, other emerging markets are seeing rising demand, most notably India and Indonesia. Air travel is expanding, and while planes are more fuel efficient, this is a positive demand. Petrochemicals as feedstocks are also becoming the most impactful demand factor.</p>\n<p>Add this all up, plus a dozen factors not listed, and we have too much oil. The world knows this, the market knows this, the forward energy curve knows this, and hence oil is trading where it was five years ago.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-so-what-happens-next\">So what happens next?</h2>\n<p>We’re contrarian by nature, so when everyone is saying the same thing, we become interested. Currently, oil has a record number of speculative shorts or bearish bets. Often at extremes, this is a very good contrarian indicator.</p>\n<p>Near-term bounce potential aside, what about that surplus?</p>\n\n<p>On the demand side, there are a few factors that may prove the broader consensus wrong. The EV/hybrid rising adoption trend will continue, but it may be moderating somewhat based on subsidy reductions and fewer announcements from auto manufacturers. And while work-from-home trends are sticky, the gradual trend is<br/>pointing toward more days in the office.</p>\n<p>The bigger lift may come from developing economies. China’s real estate crisis is not over, but it’s starting to improve. And the economic momentum across the broader developing economies appears strong. All this may help firm up the demand side of the equation. We would add the caveat that if an economic slowdown manifests, which isn’t really in anyone’s forecast, all bets are off. That’s always a risk though.</p>\n<p>Supply is a bit more encouraging as well. There have been very few large projects started in the past number of years, and this may start to help on the supply side. Add to this the fact that U.S. production growth optimism is falling, and drilled uncompleted wells (DUCs) are at historical lows as the extended period of lowish oil prices has reduced drilling activity.</p>\n<p>Based on the first chart, the surplus is already set to moderate somewhat in 2026 from the second half of 2025 (green bars are smaller).<strong> If a few of the above variations develop, perhaps the market is a little too bearish on oil.</strong></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Venezuela situation</h2>\n<p>We could write multiple editions of Ethos on everything that is still unknown about this evolving situation. On the surface, Venezuela still has huge reserves of heavy oil, which is primarily what we have in Canada, so it’s a direct competitor as a key feedstock for U.S. refiners. And before Venezuela gradually nationalized its energy assets a few decades ago, it produced three million barrels per day. Today, that figure sits at less than one million, with most exports going to China before last week’s events. As Venezuela’s exports fell, Canada and Mexico filled the void.</p>\n\n<p>Will U.S. energy giants jump back in with investments, given their previous experiences? Some are still owed billions from Venezuela for seized assets. The structure of the fields and the status of infrastructure and port facilities are big variables in any capex required to start improving production. Companies remember past experiences and what can happen when new leadership takes hold, whether in Venezuela or in the U.S. Even the ways in which the Venezuelan government evolves in the near term are a big unknown.</p>\n<p>Huge reserves with low cash costs are attractive. But there are likely additional costs from importing diluent, upgrading, transportation inefficiencies, and a history of theft. Bloomberg New Energy estimates break-even costs just under $40/bbl, roughly the same as in-situ oil sands. The timing of the production ramp is also pretty wide: most are clustering around two to five years.</p>\n<p>Increasing production from Venezuela would put pressure on differentials, a negative for Canadian energy names. It’s worth noting that this production may start coming online when the world needs more oil, assuming the global surplus fades. If two million barrels of production hit the market today … yikes. If it happens in 2027–2029, it likely won’t be as bad.</p>\n<p>At the very least, this should encourage policymakers in Canada to push harder for infrastructure to help reach new markets for our energy resources. We don’t think it is a coincidence that Prime Minister Mark Carney is visiting China shortly. Once Venezuelan oil shipments were curtailed a few weeks ago, China began quoting more Canadian oil for import.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>We believe it’s a bit premature to take oil headlines at face value and make broad-based assumptions or guesses. Venezuelan developments add a smidge more risk, but at this point, we wouldn’t overreact and would view equity weakness as an opportunity. But we could see some weakness from a few factors:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Global energy demand is seasonally weak during Q1; this may exacerbate talk around the size of the current global surplus.</li>\n<li>The Venezuelan situation may embolden the U.S. administration to be ‘extra prickly’ during the U.S.-Mexico-Canda Agreement (USMCA) renewal negotiations, which could weigh on equities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the meantime, we believe in patiently and comfortably holding pre-existing positions, clipping dividends, and hoping the market overreacts.</p>\n</div>",
