Eli Lilly (LLY) and AbbVie (ABBV) are 2 top companies in that space. ABBV is also heavily investing in AI to enhance their R&amp;D and manufacturing processes. </p>\n<p><strong>White biotechnology: Industrial</strong></p>\n<p>Also known as industrial biotechnology, this sector focuses on using biological systems to create new products and improve manufacturing processes to be more efficient and sustainable, such as biofuels.</p>\n<p>Valero Energy (VLO) is a leader in biofuel space.</p>\n<p>The weekly chart of IBB shows a massive double bottom made in April 2022 and April 2025.</p>\n<p>Essentially, IBB can run to 190 as a reasonable target over time.</p>\n<p>We are also interested in promising and rapidly evolving areas in biotechnology that include advanced gene editing, synthetic biology, AI-powered drug discovery, next-generation therapeutics, and nanobiotechnology. Crisper CRSP is one, and Recursion Pharma RXRX another. </p>\n<p>Modern (MrNA) a covid darling made a huge move today.</p>\n<p>Let’s have a look at both Moderna and another biotech stock Pfizer. </p>\n<p>In late September 2025, <strong>Pfizer </strong>reached a landmark agreement with the Trump administration aimed at lowering prescription drug costs. </p>\n<p>The deal was a voluntary response to the administration’s push for a “Most-Favored-Nation” (MFN) pricing model, which seeks to align U.S. drug costs with the lowest prices paid in other wealthy nations.</p>\n<p>Also in September, Pfizer announced its acquisition of Metsera, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on next-generation obesity and cardiometabolic treatments. </p>\n<p>This move came after a bidding war with Novo Nordisk. </p>\n<p>No wonder I am interested in this company and the stock.</p>\n<p>Let’s go to the chart. </p>\n\n<p>The recent spike you see on the Daily chart is post the announcement with Trump and the acquisition.</p>\n<p>However, PFE could not hold the gains.</p>\n<p>PFE gets interesting over $25 with a tight risk parameter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>mRNA therapeutics:</strong> Building on the success of COVID-19 vaccines, mRNA technology is being developed for a much wider range of applications, including personalized cancer vaccines and therapies for autoimmune diseases.</p>\n<p>Moderna rose 17% after a report that it has held talks with at least one large drugmaker on a deal of “significant scope,” according to a STAT News report.</p>\n<p>This has not been verified.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, earnings will be released on November 6<sup>th</sup>.</p>\n<p>Right now, the chart looks very interesting.</p>\n<p>Of course, a lot depends on whether Moderna is bought out.</p>\n<p>Looking strictly at the technical analysis, today’s rally stopped right at the 200-DMA (green line). So that must clear. </p>\n<p>Over $30 this can easily go to $35 or higher. It must hold $24. </p>\n<p>The bigger point is that there are many stocks that stretch across the biotech sector, and many are undervalued right now.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"td-post-content tagdiv-type\">\n<!-- image -->\n<!-- content -->\n\n<p>In this, my last daily market update until I return from a trip to New York, I will focus on the India Country Fund (NYSEARCA: INDA).</p>\n<p>India has captured my attention lately.</p><!-- /126710690/ims/SeeItMarket/In_text_1 -->\n\n<p>Here are four reasons why I am watching India and the INDA etf.</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Rare Earth Minerals</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Gold accumulation</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Focus on AI</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Technical Analysis</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Rare Earth Minerals. </strong></p>\n<p>India holds a substantial amount of reserves, along with being a significant producer. </p>\n<p>India falls 5<sup>th</sup> in mineral reserves although with a relatively big gap of its reserves versus the leaders (China, Vietnam, Brazil, Russia). China leads everyone by a large margin.</p>\n<p>The government is creating a National Critical Mineral Stockpile for rare earths, aiming to ensure a two-month supply in response to China’s export curbs. </p>\n<p><strong>Gold Accumulation</strong></p>\n<p>Indian households have the largest private holdings of gold in the world, with estimates suggesting holdings of 25,000 to 35,000 tonnes.</p>\n<p>As of mid-2025, India’s gold reserves reached a record high of 880 tonnes, ranking it among the top global central bank holders. This is a significant increase from just over 600 tonnes in 2019.</p>\n<p>Hence, this has created a significant “wealth effect” for Indian households. This increase in perceived wealth can boost consumer spending and economic momentum.</p>\n<p>In recent years, digital gold transactions have surged in India, attracting investors seeking the security of the metal without the traditional issues of buying and storing physical pieces.</p>\n<p><strong>India and AI</strong></p>\n<p>India is emerging as a global powerhouse in artificial intelligence, driven by significant government initiatives, major investments from global tech companies, and high rates of AI adoption across its economy. This push is supported by a large, skilled technology workforce and a vibrant startup ecosystem.</p>\n<p>AI is projected to help achieve a $1 trillion digital economy by 2028.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is the country fund ETF so underperforming?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The underperformance of the India country fund relative to the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) can be attributed to several factors, including recent U.S. tariffs on Indian goods, expensive valuations for Indian stocks, a strong U.S. dollar, and the concentration of returns in U.S. mega-cap technology companies.</p>\n<p>However, I see strong long-term growth potential just like I did in Vietnam.</p>\n<p>And, for those who know me, I am typically early on these types of calls.</p>\n<p>The first chart (top of article) is a Daily timeframe.</p>\n<p>If we look first at the Real Motion or momentum indicator, we see a bullish divergence. This means that the red dots are above the 50-DMA (blue) while the price chart shows the price still under the 50-DMA.</p>\n<p>When there is a bullish divergence, we wait for the phase change to confirm before investing.</p>\n<p>On the weekly chart however, the price is above the 50-WMA which means INDA is in a weekly bullish phase.</p>\n<p>Yet another divergence, only this time in timeframe. </p>\n\n<p>The monthly chart is probably the best for determining a real shift in trend for INDA.</p>\n<p>The blue line here is the 23-month moving average. Down below you see the 80-month MA.</p>\n<p>I love the 23-month as it accurately measures a 2-year business cycle shift.</p>\n<p>Once INDA closes a month over that 2-year cycle, it signals an economic expansion. </p>\n<p>INDA has been above it so far in October, while currently it struggles to maintain that level.</p>\n<p>Should the Daily chart confirm a phase change to bullish, that will put the monthly chart price over the 23-month moving average.</p>\n<p>Then we can say we have a weekly confirmation and positive momentum.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>",

It did.</p>\n<p>The gold to silver ratio bounced from a low of 79 (generally inflationary) up to 81 with today’s sell off.</p>\n<p>A break under 79 (gold trades 79 times the price of silver) should be a catalyst for higher prices and more inflation.</p>\n<p>For now, a correction in both gold and silver would be considered a gift.</p>\n<p>Gold could head to $3800, and a 10% correction would be $3600 though I doubt it gets there.</p>\n<p>Silver could go $45.00 and worst case, $42.00.</p>\n<p>Regardless, the longer-term trend remains bullish.

Precisely, the VIX Volatility Index.</p>\n<p>The VIX Volatility Index represents expected 30-day volatility derived from S&amp;P 500 index options.</p>\n<p>It is often called the <em>“fear gauge”</em> because it rises when markets are stressed and investors seek downside protection.</p>\n<p>VIX does not track historical volatility but instead anticipates how volatile the market will be in the near future.</p>\n<p>On the chart, note that with the market making all-time highs, volatility bottomed out on September 18<sup>th</sup>. </p>\n<p>The low that day was 32.64.</p>\n<p>Monday’s low was 32.68 before the bounce and the closing price with a gain of 5%.</p>\n<p>While “fear” still underperforms the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY), the momentum to the upside is also gaining traction.</p>\n<p>The VIX Volatility ETF (NYSEARCA: VXX) is far from the 50-DMA and the July 6-month calendar range low.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, if we combine gold on new highs, the Russell’s that can easily fail last week’s lows and volatility illustrating some anticipation that volatility will pick up, you all have enough to watch this week.</p>\n<p>We advise you to have stops in place in case.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>",
