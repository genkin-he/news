Eli Lilly (LLY) and AbbVie (ABBV) are 2 top companies in that space. ABBV is also heavily investing in AI to enhance their R&amp;D and manufacturing processes. </p>\n<p><strong>White biotechnology: Industrial</strong></p>\n<p>Also known as industrial biotechnology, this sector focuses on using biological systems to create new products and improve manufacturing processes to be more efficient and sustainable, such as biofuels.</p>\n<p>Valero Energy (VLO) is a leader in biofuel space.</p>\n<p>The weekly chart of IBB shows a massive double bottom made in April 2022 and April 2025.</p>\n<p>Essentially, IBB can run to 190 as a reasonable target over time.</p>\n<p>We are also interested in promising and rapidly evolving areas in biotechnology that include advanced gene editing, synthetic biology, AI-powered drug discovery, next-generation therapeutics, and nanobiotechnology. Crisper CRSP is one, and Recursion Pharma RXRX another. </p>\n<p>Modern (MrNA) a covid darling made a huge move today.</p>\n<p>Let’s have a look at both Moderna and another biotech stock Pfizer. </p>\n<p>In late September 2025, <strong>Pfizer </strong>reached a landmark agreement with the Trump administration aimed at lowering prescription drug costs. </p>\n<p>The deal was a voluntary response to the administration’s push for a “Most-Favored-Nation” (MFN) pricing model, which seeks to align U.S. drug costs with the lowest prices paid in other wealthy nations.</p>\n<p>Also in September, Pfizer announced its acquisition of Metsera, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on next-generation obesity and cardiometabolic treatments. </p>\n<p>This move came after a bidding war with Novo Nordisk. </p>\n<p>No wonder I am interested in this company and the stock.</p>\n<p>Let’s go to the chart. </p>\n\n<p>The recent spike you see on the Daily chart is post the announcement with Trump and the acquisition.</p>\n<p>However, PFE could not hold the gains.</p>\n<p>PFE gets interesting over $25 with a tight risk parameter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>mRNA therapeutics:</strong> Building on the success of COVID-19 vaccines, mRNA technology is being developed for a much wider range of applications, including personalized cancer vaccines and therapies for autoimmune diseases.</p>\n<p>Moderna rose 17% after a report that it has held talks with at least one large drugmaker on a deal of “significant scope,” according to a STAT News report.</p>\n<p>This has not been verified.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, earnings will be released on November 6<sup>th</sup>.</p>\n<p>Right now, the chart looks very interesting.</p>\n<p>Of course, a lot depends on whether Moderna is bought out.</p>\n<p>Looking strictly at the technical analysis, today’s rally stopped right at the 200-DMA (green line). So that must clear. </p>\n<p>Over $30 this can easily go to $35 or higher. It must hold $24. </p>\n<p>The bigger point is that there are many stocks that stretch across the biotech sector, and many are undervalued right now.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"td-post-content tagdiv-type\">\n<!-- image -->\n<!-- content -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Despite some high-profile misses this week, S&amp;P 500<sup>®</sup> EPS growth for Q3 2025 accelerated to 9.2%</li>\n<li>All eyes will be on Mag 7 reports this week: Microsoft, Met and Alphabet out on Wednesday, and Apple and Amazon out on Friday</li>\n<li>Potential earnings surprises this week: UnitedHealth, Verizon, Booking Holdings, CVS Health Corp, Fox Corp, Estee Lauder and more</li>\n<li>Peak weeks for the Q3 season run from October 27 – November 14</li>\n</ul>\n<p>US stocks were mixed last week as investors digested a heavy slate of corporate earnings that included high-profile disappointments from Tesla and IBM, but ultimately finished higher on Friday due to tamer-than-expected inflation data. </p>\n<p>For the week, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up slightly more than 1.6%, while the Dow was up 2%. Both the DJIA and S&amp;P 500 hit record levels on Friday. Market sentiment has been shaped by three major factors: the peak of Q3 earnings season, dovish commentary from the Federal Reserve, and anticipation for delayed inflation data which ended up coming in better-than-expected. </p><!-- /126710690/ims/SeeItMarket/In_text_1 -->\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-second-week-of-q3-earnings-season-delivers-mixed-results\">The Second Week of Q3 Earnings Season Delivers Mixed Results</h3>\n<p>After getting started on the right footing with impressive results from big banks two weeks ago, things began to take a turn with reports from regional banks later in the week, and some big tech names last week. </p>\n<p>The biggest upsets last week came from Tesla and IBM. While Tesla beat expectations on the top-line, profits fell 37% from the previous year.<sup>1</sup> After the report, the stock dropped 4%. Next up was IBM which beat expectations on the bottom-line, but showed slowing growth in its core cloud software services, as competitors such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) continue to own the market.<sup>2</sup> Netflix also didn’t have such a rosy report when they released results on Tuesday. Despite the success of “KPop Demon Hunters,” the streamer’s most watched movie ever with over 325 million views, NFLX still missed earnings estimates due to a one-time tax dispute with Brazilian authorities.<sup>3</sup> That miss caused the stock to fall 5% after the report. </p>\n<p>On the brighter side, industrials had a better showing. Honeywell reported on Thursday and beat analyst estimates on both the top and bottom-line as a result of strength in its aerospace division.<sup>4</sup> The stock popped 4% after the report. American Airlines followed in the footsteps of its competitors and reported better-than-expected results due to travel demand, and issued strong Q4 and full year guidance.<sup>5</sup> And Intel delighted investors by reporting beats on both the top and bottom-line due to AI driven chip demand, propelling shares to gain 3% for the week.<sup>6</sup></p>\n<p>With the addition of those reports, the S&amp;P 500 blended EPS growth rate stands at 9.2%, up from 8.5% the week prior. According to FactSet, this would be the ninth consecutive quarter of growth. Revenues are now anticipated to grow 7.0% YoY, up from an expectation of 6.6% in the week prior.<sup>7</sup></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-jobless-claims-rise-as-corporate-restructuring-wave-continues\">Jobless Claims Rise as Corporate Restructuring Wave Continues</h3>\n<p>While the government shutdown has halted most federal labor data, the Department of Labor made state-level data available for Weekly Jobless Claims on Thursday. The Labor Department didn’t release their usual weekly report, and hasn’t since September 25, but an analysis of the data showed that initial claims increased to about 227,000 in the week ended October 18, showing applications for US unemployment benefits on an upward trend.<sup>8</sup></p>\n<p>Layoffs and restructuring seemed to be a theme of the week as many large US corporations announced workforce reduction plans. Among them, Meta announced its latest round of layoffs, cutting 600 positions from its AI division.9 Rivian Auto announced they would be cutting more than 600 employees due to the recent EV pullback.<sup>10</sup> Target revealed they were cutting 1,800 corporate jobs on Thursday, 1,000 of those are jobs currently held and 800 are open hires. This is the discount retailer’s first major layoff in decades.<sup>11</sup> By Friday GM reported they had laid off more than 200 employees after raising guidance earlier in the week as they released Q3 earnings.<sup>12</sup> And Amazon, while they didn’t announce layoffs, internal documents from the company showed they plan to replace over half-a-million jobs with robots in the next seven years.<sup>13</sup></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-mag-7-reports-on-deck-this-week-nbsp\">Mag 7 Reports On Deck this Week </h3>\n<p>This week marks the first peak week of the Q3 2025 earnings season, kicking off with results from a slew of Mag 7 names, including <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/microsoft-earnings-calendar\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/meta-earnings-calendar\">Meta</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/alphabet-earnings-calendar\">Alphabet</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/apple-earnings-calendar\">Apple</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/amazon-earnings-calendar\">Amazon</a>. These names are expected to have an outsized impact on growth this quarter. Prior to last week’s onslaught of results, the Mag 7 names were expected to see YoY EPS growth of 14.9%, vs. the rest of the 493 companies of the S&amp;P 500 which were only anticipated to grow 6.7%.<sup>14</sup> If they don’t perform as expected the overall growth rate could take a hit.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Outlier Earnings Dates This Week</h3>\n<p>Academic research shows that when a company confirms a quarterly earnings date that is later than when they have historically reported, it’s typically a sign that the company will share bad news on their upcoming call, while moving a release date earlier suggests the opposite.<sup>15</sup></p>\n<p>This week we get results from a number of large companies on major indexes that have pushed their Q3 2025 earnings dates outside of their historical norms. Fourteen companies within the S&amp;P 500 confirmed outlier earnings dates for this week, seven of which are earlier than usual and therefore have positive DateBreaks Factors*. Those names are Teradyne (TER), PPG Industries (PPG), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Verizon Communications (VZ), Ameriprise Financial (AMP), Edwards Lifesciences (EW), and Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB).  The names with positive DateBreak Factors are Xylem (XYL), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Booking Holding (BKNG), CVS Health Corp (CVS), Fox Corp (FOXA), Estee Lauder Companies (EL) and Cardinal Health (CAH).</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p>* <em>Wall Street Horizon DateBreaks Factor: statistical measurement of how an earnings date (confirmed or revised) compares to the reporting company’s 5-year trend for the same quarter. Negative means the earnings date is confirmed to be later than historical average while Positive is earlier.</em></p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Q3 Earnings Wave</h3>\n<p>The peak weeks of the Q3 earnings season are expected to fall between October 27 – November 14, with each week expected to see over 2,000 reports. Currently, November 6 is predicted to be the most active day with 1,188 companies anticipated to report. Thus far, only 72% of companies have confirmed their earnings date (out of our universe of 11,000+ global names), so this is subject to change. The remaining dates are estimated based on historical reporting data.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bottom Line</h3>\n<p>As markets close at record highs, the tamer-than-expected inflation data seems to have overpowered last week’s mixed corporate signals and unsettling layoff news. This relief rally, however, now faces its most significant trial. The focus shifts decisively from macroeconomics back to fundamentals as the heart of the ‘Magnificent 7’—Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Meta—prepare to report. With expectations for this group carrying the weight of the market’s overall growth, the coming week will determine if the economy’s disinflationary trend is being matched by the corporate strength needed to sustain these new altitudes.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sources:</em></strong></p>\n<p>1 Tesla Q3 2025 Earnings Release, October 22, 2025, <a href=\"https://assets-ir.tesla.com/tesla-contents/IR/TSLA-Q3-2025-Update.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://assets-ir.tesla.com</a><br/>2 IBM Q3 2025 Earnings Release, October 22, 2025,  <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/131cf87ab633199f\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ibm.com</a><br/>3 Netflix Q3 2025 Earnings Release, October 21, 2025, <a href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/FINAL-Q3-25-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://s22.q4cdn.com</a><br/>4 Honeywell Q3 2025 Earnings Release, October 23, 2025, <a href=\"https://investor.honeywell.com/static-files/a717f8a5-7e62-4591-8f67-b699d7bc4fb3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://investor.honeywell.com</a><br/>5 American Airlines Q3 2025 Earnings Release, October 23, 2025, <a href=\"https://americanairlines.gcs-web.com/static-files/00461c40-36fd-4912-bc7b-e38e61af16cf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://americanairlines.gcs-web.com</a><br/>6 Intel Q3 2025 Earnings Release, October 23, 2025, <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_a9c76828df1af0b055f7cffea57824a7/intel/db/887/9148/earnings_release/Q3%2725+EarningsRelease+FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net</a><br/>7 Intel Q3 2025 Earnings Release, October 23, 2025, <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_a9c76828df1af0b055f7cffea57824a7/intel/db/887/9148/earnings_release/Q3%2725+EarningsRelease+FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net</a><br/>8 “US Initial Jobless Claims Rose Last Week, State Data Suggest,” Bloomberg, Nazmul Ahasan, October 23, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/us-initial-jobless-claims-rose-last-week-state-data-suggest\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bloomberg.com</a><br/>9 “Meta lays off 600 from ‘bloated’ AI unit as Wang cements leadership,” CNBC, Ashley Capoot and Jonathan Vanian, October 22, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/22/meta-layoffs-ai.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cnbc.com</a><br/>10 “Rivian Lays Off More Than 600 Workers Amid EV Pullback,” Wall Street Journal, Becky Peterson, October 23, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.comgaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=awetsqccgn6rknz1qyyg5e2np-wrk-8jqvvjf2vn2ss23rx0vnqzkzqdvruca5sejv8=&amp;gaa_ts=68fbbd97&amp;gaa_sig=8u4816lvhy_ad7moe5qtyglexi78tojdx0ogw7h-5j-fgibkd5fqorilz6v2s8f2qm5biepa10pft5g-yutqua==/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wsj.com</a><br/>11 “Target cuts 1,800 corporate jobs in its first major layoffs in a decade,” CNBC, Melissa Repko, October 23, 2025 <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/23/target-layoffs-corporate-jobs-sales-slump.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cnbc.com</a><br/>12 “GM lays off more than 200 salaried workers in latest round of job cuts,” CNBC, Michael Wayland, October 24, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/24/gm-layoffs-job-cuts.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cnbc.com</a><br/>13 “Amazon Plans to Replace More Than Half a Million Jobs With Robots,” New York Times, Karen Weise, October 21, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/technology/inside-amazons-plans-to-replace-workers-with-robots.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com</a><br/>14 FactSet Earnings Insight, John Butters, October 17, 2025, <a href=\"https://advantage.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_101725B.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://advantage.factset.com</a><br/>15 Time Will Tell: Information in the Timing of Scheduled Earnings News, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, Eric C.

            "description": "<div class=\"td-post-content tagdiv-type\">\n<!-- image -->\n<!-- content -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Caterpillar shares have jumped to a sizable lead among the Dow 30 Year-To-Date (YTD), and the Texas company reports Q3 results next week</li>\n<li>Johnson &amp; Johnson, NVIDIA, and Goldman Sachs are in a race for the second spot, each with a unique momentum story ongoing</li>\n<li>UnitedHealth Group has struggled the most, while Apple was the star earlier this week</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nasdaq stocks seem to always be in the spotlight, right? Let’s go old school this week by scanning key events with some of the best names on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). We’ll also wag a finger at the DJIA’s worst component as we head into the heart of the <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/blog/Q3-2025-Earnings-Preview\">Q3 earnings season</a>. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dow-basics-nbsp\">Dow Basics </h3>\n<p>Just to level set, the Dow consists of 30 stocks, weighted by share price. It’s a rudimentary way to track how the U.S. equity market performs, but you can’t argue with tradition. The index has existed for more than 100 years, and when General Electric (now GE Aerospace) slipped the surly bonds of the DJIA in 2018, none of the original dozen Dow companies were left.</p><!-- /126710690/ims/SeeItMarket/In_text_1 -->\n\n<p>Named after Charles Dow and Edward Jones, the index’s current complexion remains more value-oriented than the growthy-heavy Nasdaq Composite or even the S&amp;P 500. Just take a look at the sector breakdown via the <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/blog/New-Funds-New-Strategies\">SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA)</a>.</p>\n<p>The $40 billion product holds a plurality of Financials at a 26% weighting. Information Technology (more than 35% of the S&amp;P 500 SPDR Trust ETF (SPY)) makes up just 20% of DIA. There are no Utilities holdings, as that has its own index—the Dow Jones Utilities Average. Real Estate is also absent from the Dow.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-top-performer-caterpillar\">The Top Performer: Caterpillar</h3>\n<p>OK, class dismissed. Let’s talk ideas and individual stocks.</p>\n<p>So far in 2025, the Dow’s top dog is CAT—Caterpillar, that is. Shares are up 49%, dividends included, year to date. The $247 billion market cap Industrials-sector position has plowed higher, not from farming equipment demand, but thanks to its AI presence. CAT is a leader in turbine manufacturing, and it plays a vital role in the buildout of power generation for data center proliferation.</p>\n<p>Don’t overlook its earnings date of Wednesday, October 29, BMO. Its report is surrounded on the calendar by some of the Nasdaq’s heavyweights, such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META). CAT’s executive team’s commentary around the AI boom and related electricity needs could move industries well beyond Construction Machinery &amp; Heavy Transportation Equipment.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-j-amp-j-s-healthy-year\">J&amp;J’s Healthy Year</h3>\n<p>As CAT purrs, there’s a fight for the No. 2 YTD performance slot among the Dow 30. As of this writing, the tie goes narrowly to a company that may raise some eyebrows. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) has returned nearly 38% in 2025. The pharma giant and household name issued strong profit numbers last week, all while JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon was talking cockroaches! Shares rallied sharply heading into the October 14 third-quarter release, and the bulls remained in charge despite rising S&amp;P 500 volatility. </p>\n<p>JNJ is popular with income investors, given its forward dividend yield of 2.7%—about twice that of the S&amp;P 500. And with a guidance hike issued alongside the revenue and net income numbers, vital signs have looked good. The bears may point to a somewhat swollen price-to-earnings ratio just below 18x for this slow &amp; steady Health Care stock. </p>\n<p>JNJ’s corporate event calendar is light. Its management team has just a pair of speaking engagements on November 11: <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/blog/25-Q4-Conference-Highlights\">The UBS Global Healthcare Conference</a> and the Guggenheim Global Healthcare Innovation Conference. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-nvidia-keeps-rolling-nbsp\">NVIDIA Keeps Rolling </h3>\n<p>The third-best DJIA stock of the year is NVIDIA (NVDA). The world’s most valuable public company has seen its equity return 37% and more than double from the April post-Liberation Day low below $90. The chip giant is always a late-season reporter, so we won’t hear its Q3 2026 results until Wednesday, November 19, AMC.</p>\n<p>But NVIDIA is among the busiest on the conference circuit. After an appearance at PyTorch 2025 today and tomorrow, executives will take part in Money 20/20 US 2025, Open Data Science Conference (ODSC) West 2025, and Adobe MAX – The Creativity Conference next week. Be on guard for business and strategy updates from any of those gatherings. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-goldman-sachs-from-leader-to-recent-laggard\">Goldman Sachs: From Leader to Recent Laggard</h3>\n<p>Goldman Sachs (GS) was the best Dow stock YTD for much of September, but its alpha has abated alongside some softness in the Financials sector. Nevertheless, arguably Wall Street’s most esteemed investment bank beat on both the top and bottom lines last week and outlined a $100 billion alternatives fundraising target. </p>\n<p>Shares were mildly caught up in the bank selloff then but jumped out of the gate this week with a 2% Monday advance. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-unitedhealth-s-struggles-and-comeback-nbsp\">UnitedHealth’s Struggles and Comeback </h3>\n<p>Let’s wrap up on a sour note. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has endured its share of bad news in the past year. Down 27%, it has gone back and forth with Salesforce (CRM) for the dubious honor of being the worst DJIA component in 2025. To its credit, the August low has been durable. The stock caught a notable boost after Berkshire Hathaway confirmed it had taken a stake in the now $323 billion Health Care stalwart.</p>\n<p>UNH has a chance to build on its newfound momentum when it posts Q3 results next Tuesday morning. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-aapl-hits-record-high\">AAPL Hits Record High</h3>\n<p>A quick shoutout to Apple. Strong iPhone 17 sales out of China resulted in sellside upgrades before the bell on Monday. Price action was strong enough to take AAPL to its first record closing price of the year, and it led the DJIA to begin this week. Its Q4 2025 report hits on Thursday, October 30. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-bottom-line-nbsp\">The Bottom Line </h3>\n<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average isn’t as sexy as the Nasdaq, and it has lagged the S&amp;P 500 consistently since the bull market began three years ago. Still, investors can gain a sense of what’s going on under the surface by analyzing performance data among its best and worst members.</p>\n<p>Critical events are on tap with some high-flying DJIA companies and one sagging Dow stock. Who will claim the 2025 performance crown? Events over the next few weeks may determine that accolade.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"td-post-content tagdiv-type\">\n<!-- image -->\n<!-- content -->\n\n<p>In this, my last daily market update until I return from a trip to New York, I will focus on the India Country Fund (NYSEARCA: INDA).</p>\n<p>India has captured my attention lately.</p><!-- /126710690/ims/SeeItMarket/In_text_1 -->\n\n<p>Here are four reasons why I am watching India and the INDA etf.</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Rare Earth Minerals</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Gold accumulation</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Focus on AI</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Technical Analysis</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Rare Earth Minerals. </strong></p>\n<p>India holds a substantial amount of reserves, along with being a significant producer. </p>\n<p>India falls 5<sup>th</sup> in mineral reserves although with a relatively big gap of its reserves versus the leaders (China, Vietnam, Brazil, Russia). China leads everyone by a large margin.</p>\n<p>The government is creating a National Critical Mineral Stockpile for rare earths, aiming to ensure a two-month supply in response to China’s export curbs. </p>\n<p><strong>Gold Accumulation</strong></p>\n<p>Indian households have the largest private holdings of gold in the world, with estimates suggesting holdings of 25,000 to 35,000 tonnes.</p>\n<p>As of mid-2025, India’s gold reserves reached a record high of 880 tonnes, ranking it among the top global central bank holders. This is a significant increase from just over 600 tonnes in 2019.</p>\n<p>Hence, this has created a significant “wealth effect” for Indian households. This increase in perceived wealth can boost consumer spending and economic momentum.</p>\n<p>In recent years, digital gold transactions have surged in India, attracting investors seeking the security of the metal without the traditional issues of buying and storing physical pieces.</p>\n<p><strong>India and AI</strong></p>\n<p>India is emerging as a global powerhouse in artificial intelligence, driven by significant government initiatives, major investments from global tech companies, and high rates of AI adoption across its economy. This push is supported by a large, skilled technology workforce and a vibrant startup ecosystem.</p>\n<p>AI is projected to help achieve a $1 trillion digital economy by 2028.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is the country fund ETF so underperforming?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The underperformance of the India country fund relative to the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) can be attributed to several factors, including recent U.S. tariffs on Indian goods, expensive valuations for Indian stocks, a strong U.S. dollar, and the concentration of returns in U.S. mega-cap technology companies.</p>\n<p>However, I see strong long-term growth potential just like I did in Vietnam.</p>\n<p>And, for those who know me, I am typically early on these types of calls.</p>\n<p>The first chart (top of article) is a Daily timeframe.</p>\n<p>If we look first at the Real Motion or momentum indicator, we see a bullish divergence. This means that the red dots are above the 50-DMA (blue) while the price chart shows the price still under the 50-DMA.</p>\n<p>When there is a bullish divergence, we wait for the phase change to confirm before investing.</p>\n<p>On the weekly chart however, the price is above the 50-WMA which means INDA is in a weekly bullish phase.</p>\n<p>Yet another divergence, only this time in timeframe. </p>\n\n<p>The monthly chart is probably the best for determining a real shift in trend for INDA.</p>\n<p>The blue line here is the 23-month moving average. Down below you see the 80-month MA.</p>\n<p>I love the 23-month as it accurately measures a 2-year business cycle shift.</p>\n<p>Once INDA closes a month over that 2-year cycle, it signals an economic expansion. </p>\n<p>INDA has been above it so far in October, while currently it struggles to maintain that level.</p>\n<p>Should the Daily chart confirm a phase change to bullish, that will put the monthly chart price over the 23-month moving average.</p>\n<p>Then we can say we have a weekly confirmation and positive momentum.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"td-post-content tagdiv-type\">\n<!-- image -->\n<!-- content -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Earnings season gets underway this week, with reports from major banks providing the first look at corporate performance</li>\n<li>The technology sector is expected to be the standout performer with over 20% projected earnings growth, driven by the ongoing “AI arms race”</li>\n<li>Sectors that rely on lower-end consumer spending are expected to see earnings decline as shoppers become more “value-conscious</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Earnings season kicks into high gear this week, with the big banks unofficially firing the starting gun <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/jpmorgan-earnings-calendar\">on Tuesday</a>. As the season begins, major U.S. indices are at record levels, even amidst a government shutdown, creating a dynamic environment with no shortage of significant events.</p>\n<p>Sell-side analysts and investors alike are optimistic heading into the reports. For the first time since late 2021, Wall Street analysts have actually <em>raised</em> their earnings estimates heading into the reporting period, a rare vote of confidence in corporate America.</p><!-- /126710690/ims/SeeItMarket/In_text_1 -->\n\n<p>The consensus is for an impressive 8% year-over-year earnings growth for the S&amp;P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY), a figure that would mark the ninth straight quarter of expansion. Revenue growth is expected at 6.3%.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>But don’t let the headline number fool you. Under the surface, a “have and have-not” economy is becoming more entrenched. While the AI darlings and financial giants are poised for a strong showing, other sectors are starting to feel the pinch of a more discerning consumer and persistent inflation. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-key-themes-for-q3-2025-earnings-season-nbsp\">Key Themes for Q3 2025 Earnings Season </h3>\n<p><strong>Big Banks Poised for Another Strong Showing</strong></p>\n<p>Financials are expected to be one of the leading sectors this season, as the environment for banks has gotten better, but there are still headwinds. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), Citigroup (NYSE: C) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) get the party started on Tuesday and here’s what we’re looking for updates in three key areas: </p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Dealmaking</strong> – both M&amp;A and IPO markets have cautiously been thawing in 2025.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>M&amp;A Reawakens: While deal volume remains below historical highs, the value of transactions surged in Q3. According to our data at Wall Street Horizon, Q3 saw 111 M&amp;A announcements. This is in-line with the first two quarters of the year, and a marked improvement from the M&amp;A dearth of 2023, but still well-below the record quarters seen in 2022. The value of those deals on the other-hand neared a Q3 record. Dealogic data shows global M&amp;A volumes hit $1.26 trillion, up 40% year-over-year, making it the second-best third quarter on record by value.<sup>2</sup> Companies are hunting for scale, and a record number of mega-deals (over $10 billion) have been announced this year. </p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The IPO Window Creaks Open: The market for initial public offerings is no longer frozen shut. Blockbuster IPOs in the tech and fintech sectors, such as those for CoreWeave and Circle Internet, have demonstrated strong investor appetite. According to our data, there were 150 IPO announcements in Q3, the best quarter since Q4 2021. Expect banks to highlight this renewed momentum, signaling a healthier outlook for capital markets.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Lending</strong> – the tailwind from high interest rates which has boosted profits for the last couple of years is starting to show its downside.</p>\n<p>Net Interest Income (NII) Under Pressure: NII—the difference between what banks earn on loans and pay on deposits—is expected to see modest growth or even begin to flatten. While the Federal Reserve’s rate cut in September offered some relief, banks are now facing intense competition for deposits. Customers are moving their cash to higher-yielding accounts, forcing banks to pay more for funding.</p>\n<p>Loan Growth: Demand for new loans has been sluggish for a while now as high borrowing costs have deterred both consumers and businesses. However, banks started to signal some optimism in this area as loan growth was better-than-expected in Q2.<sup>3</sup> Listen for commentary from Bank of America and Wells Fargo on mortgage and auto loan demand, which are key indicators of consumer health.</p>\n<p>Credit Quality in Focus: While credit remains generally stable, any uptick in delinquencies or provisions for credit losses will be heavily scrutinized. The focus will be on commercial real estate, as well as potential stress among lower-to-middle income consumer borrowers.</p>\n<p><strong>Trading</strong> – Likely a bright spot once again this quarter due to volatility. Market volatility, driven by shifting expectations around Fed policy, inflation, and geopolitical uncertainty, creates opportunities for Wall Street trading desks.</p>\n<p>Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities (FICC): Uncertainty around the future path of interest rates and asynchronous monetary policy from global central banks likely drove significant client activity in interest rate and currency products. This is a core strength for firms like JPMorgan and Citigroup.</p>\n<p>Equities: Equity markets were resilient in Q3, with strong ETF inflows and a renewed “buy the dip” mentality from investors. The anticipation and eventual arrival of the September Fed rate cut sparked a rally in small-cap stocks, driving volume and creating profitable conditions for equities trading divisions.</p>\n\n<p><em>Source: Wall Street Horizon. Companies market with an * are unconfirmed. Data as of October 9, 2025.</em></p>\n<p><strong>The AI Arms Race Continues</strong></p>\n<p>The tech sector, and particularly the Mag7, is once again expected to do the heavy lifting this quarter. If you need any evidence of that just look at the number of multi-billion dollar AI partnerships and deals announced in only the last few weeks.<sup>4</sup></p>\n<p>Companies that provide the picks and shovels for the AI gold rush are set to report another round of stellar numbers. According to FactSet, earnings growth for S&amp;P 500 tech names is expected to top 20.9%.<sup>5</sup> Look for companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and other semiconductor players to continue their impressive growth trajectory. The enterprise software space is also one to watch, as companies are pouring money into AI-powered solutions to boost efficiency. To put it bluntly, if you don’t have an AI story to tell this quarter, you’d better have a reason. AI is so important to the US economy right now, that AI corporate spending makes up around 40% of US GDP growth this year.<sup>6</sup></p>\n<p><strong>A Bifurcated Consumer</strong></p>\n<p>While the tech boom has been a boon for some, there are growing concerns about the lower-end consumer. We’ll be keeping a close eye on reports from big-box retailers and consumer staples companies for clues on the health of Main Street, most of which report in a month’s time. Expect to hear a lot about “value-conscious” shoppers and the ongoing battle for market share between legacy brands and private-label alternatives. The consumer staples (expected EPS decline of -3.1%) and consumer discretionary (expected EPS decline of -1.7%) sectors are expected to be laggards this quarter, a sign that the post-pandemic spending splurge may be running out of steam.<sup>7</sup></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Q3 Earnings Wave</h3>\n<p>The peak weeks of the Q3 earnings season are expected to fall between October 27 – November 14, with each week expected to see over 2,000 reports. Currently, November 7 is predicted to be the most active day with 1,238 companies anticipated to report. Thus far, only 48% of companies have confirmed their earnings date (out of our universe of 11,000+ global names), so this is subject to change. The remaining dates are estimated based on historical reporting data.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bottom Line</h3>\n<p>This earnings season is shaping up to be a tale of two markets. While the tech sector is likely to continue its impressive run, the real test will be whether the rest of the market can keep pace. The unusual optimism from Wall Street analysts is a good sign, but it also sets a high bar for companies to clear. Any disappointments could be met with a swift and punishing response from investors.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong><em>Sources:</em></strong></p>\n<p>1 FactSet Earnings Insight, John Butters, October 10, 2025, <a href=\"https://advantage.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_101025.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://advantage.factset.com</a><br/>2 “For global M&amp;A, third quarter was one of the best – and worst – in recent history,” Reuters, Dawn Kopecki, Charlie Conchie and Kane Wu, October 1, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/global-ma-third-quarter-was-one-best-worst-recent-history-2025-09-30/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reuters.com</a><br/>3 “Aggregate loan growth at US banks shoots to a 3-year high in Q2 2025,” S&amp;P Global, Robert Clark, August 18, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2025/8/aggregate-loan-growth-at-us-banks-shoots-to-a-3year-high-in-q2-2025-91975014\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.spglobal.com</a><br/>4 “From OpenAI to Meta, firms channel billions into AI infrastructure as demand booms,” Reuters, October 6, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/companies-pouring-billions-advance-ai-infrastructure-2025-10-06/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reuters.com</a><br/>5 FactSet Earnings Insight, John Butters, October 10, 2025, <a href=\"https://advantage.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_101025.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://advantage.factset.com</a><br/>6 “How AI became our personal assistant,” Financial Times, Dan Clark and Caroline Nevitt, October 7, 2025, <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/ai-personal-assistant/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://ig.ft.com</a><br/>7 FactSet Earnings Insight, John Butters, October 10, 2025, <a href=\"https://advantage.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_101025.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://advantage.factset.com</a></p>\n</div>",

That might take the spotlight off a string of recent AI-related investments and corporate dealmaking (stress: <em>might</em>).</p>\n<p>With the official economic data spigot closed, happenings at the company-specific level are front and center. It’s clear that the tech boom is currently driving U.S. economic growth, but the consumer soon takes center stage as the holiday shopping season comes closer into view.</p><!-- /126710690/ims/SeeItMarket/In_text_1 -->\n\n<p>According to Adobe Analytics, online shopping volume is expected to rise by 5.3% year-on-year over the November-December stretch.<sup>1</sup> That would be a deceleration from a stout 8.7% pace in 2024 but higher than the previous two years. We’ve mentioned the “have and have-not” economy before, and investors may get clues on the lower-end cohorts from two mainstay U.S. consumer firms in the days ahead. </p>\n<p>The silver lining, if you can call it that, is that the broader economy seems less dependent than ever on the lower-end consumer. So far this year, GDP growth has been fueled by affluent households and a wave of AI-driven capital investment. Here are three events to keep on your radar:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-general-mills-investor-day\">General Mills Investor Day</h3>\n<p>General Mills (GIS) hosts its 2025 Investor Day the same day that JPMorgan Chase (JPM) <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/jpmorgan-earnings-calendar\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">kicks off the Q3 reporting season</a>, October 14. Shareholders and analysts (and really anybody) can tune into the webcast to hear the latest trends in the Packaged Foods and Meats industry. Based on price action in the past year, General Mills might soon be drop-ranked to lieutenant—the stock is down 30% over the past 12 months. Shifting consumer preferences and cash-strapped lower-income households are clear and ongoing risks.</p>\n<p>The trend toward cheaper private-label brands has hurt, but GIS did beat on earnings when it reported fiscal Q1 numbers on September 17. The $27 billion market cap Consumer Staples company also maintained its $0.61 quarterly dividend (the yield is now among the highest in the S&amp;P 500 at 4.9% on a forward basis).<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>Sentiment is low as we approach the Investor Day. When the event begins on Tuesday morning, investors should be on the lookout for details on General Mills’ five-year Accelerate strategy that was detailed at this past February’s Consumer Analyst Group of New York (CAGNY) 2025 <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/blog/25-Q4-Conference-Highlights\">Conference</a>.<sup>3</sup></p>\n<p>It’s apparent that brand-building is a key theme, but results have yet to materialize, at least according to the market. On the Q1 call, analysts questioned whether ongoing volume declines stem from structural market issues or General Mills’ botched pricing efforts. We may get color on that front next week.</p>\n<p>The Investor Day is particularly important as it’s possibly the last we’ll hear from GIS executives until its unconfirmed Q2 2026 earnings report on December 17.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dollar-tree-investor-conference\">Dollar Tree Investor Conference</h3>\n<p>Sticking with the consumer, Dollar Tree (DLTR) welcomes the Street on Wednesday, October 15. There’s also a pending speaking engagement at the NASDAQ MarketSite from Mike Creedon, CEO, and Stewart Glendinning, CFO. So, the highly volatile stock (now down almost 20% from its August high) could be on the move next week.</p>\n<p>Dollar Tree, or “Dollar-Twenty-Five Tree” if you frequent the stores, features a high 8.4% short interest. Last month, its management team outlined a 4% to 6% comp-store sales growth target as it expands its product selection.<sup>4</sup> After a few years of tough inflation and rising labor costs, the Consumer Staples firm focuses on the expense side of the ledger, perhaps nearly as much as it does on growing revenue.</p>\n<p>Stakeholders can expect to learn the fine points of a refreshed long-term growth strategy as well as a renewed financial outlook now that the Family Dollar divestiture is settled.<sup>5</sup> Despite the earnings beat reported in early September, the bears have a grip on the price trend.</p>\n<p>Lower-end consumers could be gravitating toward Walmart (WMT), the low-cost behemoth attracting a range of households across income levels. Market share trends will likely be a topic at next week’s events. Dollar Tree’s next earnings report is unconfirmed to be released on Wednesday, December 3.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-salesforce-gen-ai-summit-amp-investor-day\">Salesforce Gen AI Summit &amp; Investor Day</h3>\n<p>Deals are being agreed to on a seemingly daily basis in the tech world right now. The AI arms race feels like it has been ratcheted up since Labor Day, but naturally, not every player has been a winner. Just this week, Salesforce (CRM) dethroned UnitedHealth Group (UNH) to claim a rather dubious honor: CRM is now the worst-performing stock on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. With shares down 29% so far in 2025, the Application Software industry company is among the most high-profile AI laggards.</p>\n<p>CRM runs Agentforce (you may have heard about it from Matthew McConaughey), an autonomous corporate AI tool that learns, adapts, and streamlines workflows. Key to Salesforce’s success, the industry still questions the software. On Wednesday, October 15, CEO Marc Benioff, CFO Amy Weaver, and other executives will present on strategic priorities, AI innovations, and CRM’s long-term financial outlook.</p>\n<p>The event, in conjunction with Dreamforce (the world’s largest enterprise tech conference), comes after a solid Salesforce double-beat on revenue and earnings. Despite a guidance raise on September 3, the share price fell 4.9%—a third straight post-earnings slump. As far as the stock is concerned, things are not alright, alright, alright.</p>\n<p>Benioff and the team may be on their back foot ahead of what’s a busy corporate event calendar period.

These events, along with incoming profit reports, could offer key tells on the health of the consumer and where large enterprises are allocating their capital. We are a bit of a wet blanket this week (calling out a trio of sputtering stocks), but now is a chance for GIS, DLTR, and CRM to right the ship.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong><em>Sources:</em></strong></p>\n<p>1 Online holiday spending growth set to slow to 5.3% as shoppers seek discounts, CNBC, Melissa Repko, October 6, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/06/online-holiday-spending-growth-adobe-report.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cnbc.com</a><br/>2 General Mills Reports Fiscal 2026 First-quarter Results and Reaffirms Full-year Outlook, General Mills, September 17, 2025, <a href=\"https://investors.generalmills.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/General-Mills-Reports-Fiscal-2026-First-quarter-Results-and-Reaffirms-Full-year-Outlook/default.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://investors.generalmills.com</a><br/>3 General Mills Reports Fiscal 2026 First-quarter Results and Reaffirms Full-year Outlook, General Mills, September 17, 2025, <a href=\"https://investors.generalmills.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/General-Mills-Highlights-Five-Years-of-Progress-Against-Accelerate-Strategy/default.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://investors.generalmills.com</a><br/>4 Dollar Tree, Inc.

            "description": "<div class=\"td-post-content tagdiv-type\">\n<!-- image -->\n<!-- content -->\n\n<p><strong>Retail Stumbles Below Support</strong></p>\n<p>The Retail Sector ETF (NYSEARCA: XRT) just lost its grip on the 50-day moving average, a key short-term support level that often marks the line between healthy pullbacks and trend reversals.</p><!-- /126710690/ims/SeeItMarket/In_text_1 -->\n\n<p>This isn’t just a technical trip — it’s a sentiment signal that the American consumer, long the backbone of this market, may be running low on gas.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The Retail Sector ETF (XRT) closed decisively below its 50-DMA after multiple failed attempts to hold above it in late September.</li>\n<li>Momentum indicators such as RSI have rolled over, confirming fading buying pressure.</li>\n<li>Volume has been heavier on down days, a classic distribution pattern suggesting institutional selling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If XRT can’t recover quickly, we could be looking at a phase shift from Bullish to Caution, and possibly even to Distribution.</p>\n<p><strong>WHY IT MATTERS FOR INVESTORS</strong></p>\n<p>Retail sits at the center of the Economic Modern Family — the pulse of the consumer and, by extension, the broader economy.</p>\n<p>When the Retail sector weakens, it often precedes broader market fatigue.</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"1\">\n<li>Consumer resilience is under pressure. Rising living costs, student loan repayments, and mounting credit card delinquencies are taking a toll.</li>\n<li>Equal-weight construction reveals the real story. Unlike the cap-weighted giants, XRT shows how <em>average</em> retailers are struggling.</li>\n<li>Breadth deterioration. A weak XRT often foreshadows softness in small caps (IWM) and transports (IYT).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Investors should pay attention because consumer spending drives 70% of U.S. GDP — when Granny sneezes, the market catches a cold.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, KRE of the Regional Banks sector, already showed us signs of weakness with only a shallow bounce following news of Fifth Third Bank’s acquisition of Comerica Bank.</p>\n<p>KRE has to hold around 63.00</p>\n<p>The timing of this failure is crucial. The Fed remains caught between easing inflation and sustaining growth. Retail softness may be the first crack in the “soft landing” narrative.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Oil prices</strong> are rebounding, threatening to keep inflation sticky.</li>\n<li><strong>Wage growth</strong> has stalled, especially for lower earners.</li>\n<li><strong>Credit conditions</strong> remain tight, limiting spending power.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If Retail stocks continue to weaken, the Fed’s path to rate cuts could narrow — not because inflation is roaring back, but because <strong>growth is rolling over</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>TECHNICAL WATCHLIST</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n<p>Keep an eye on COST, TGT, WMT, and AMZN — leadership in these names will determine whether the consumer narrative stabilizes or cracks further.</p>\n<p>Also watch IWM (Small Caps) for confirmation; if both fail simultaneously, the risk-on trade could unwind quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>TAKEAWAY</strong><strong></strong></p>\n<p>Retail’s stumble below the 50-DMA isn’t just another chart event — it’s a <strong>warning flag</strong>.</p>\n<p>Retail stocks often lead turns in both directions.</p>\n<p>If the consumer is finally feeling the strain, the next few weeks could tell us whether this market still has the spending power to sustain the rally — or whether the Family matriarch just signaled it’s time to take some profits.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>",
