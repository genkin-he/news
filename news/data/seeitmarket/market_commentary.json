            "description": "<div class=\"td-post-content tagdiv-type\">\n<!-- image -->\n<!-- content -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A packed week of shareholder meetings and investor days could set the market’s tone for November</li>\n<li>Elon Musk’s $1 trillion compensation vote and BofA’s first Investor Day since 2011 headline the action</li>\n<li>Chip manufacturers Lam Research and KLA get the party going with Annual General Meetings and possible AI commentary</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It seems like ages ago now, with Mag-7 names posting <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/blog/Q3-EPS-Growth-Accelerates-Despite-Misses-But-the-Real-Test-Is-This-Week\">Q3 profit numbers</a> today and tomorrow, but the big banks clocked in a clean sweep of bottom-line beats two weeks ago. That sets the foundation for what’s turning out to be one of the strongest quarterly reporting periods in years. What’s more, S&amp;P 500 consensus EPS estimates for the next 12 months are closing in on $300 for the first time.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>The S&amp;P 500’s (INDEXCBOE: .SPX) ascent to 6800+ yields a P/E ratio just below 23x. In short, both price and profits are in rally mode, which the bulls are happy to see. Meanwhile, volatility across the stock and bond markets has cooled after a mid-October scare that saw the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) spike near 29. It’s back in the mid-teens now, just as the ICE BofA MOVE Index of Treasury volatility sputters close to 47-month lows.</p><!-- /126710690/ims/SeeItMarket/In_text_1 -->\n\n<p>The bond market gets its time in the spotlight today, Fed Day, of course. Yields have eased since May, thanks, in part, to gradually softening economic uncertainty. The macro backdrop is not pristine, but stocks seem to be pricing in a Goldilocks scenario. Big tech, big banks, and the man with the biggest net worth are in focus this week, not from an earnings perspective, but from several potentially revealing shareholder events.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-november-4-5-lam-research-and-kla-two-semiconductor-bellwethers-take-the-stage\">November 4–5: Lam Research and KLA, Two Semiconductor Bellwethers, Take the Stage</h3>\n<p>Chips are in focus on Tuesday and Wednesday next week. The days may be getting darker (for those of us in the Northern Hemisphere), but times have seemingly never been brighter within semiconductors. Both Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA Corporation (KLAC) are in the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH). The fund has more than doubled off its April low, and all eyes will soon be on NVIDIA’s (NVDA) <a href=\"https://wallstreethorizon.com/nvidia-earnings-calendar\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fiscal Q3 2026 earnings report</a> due out on Wednesday, November 19.</p>\n<p>Before that, Lam (virtually) hosts its Annual Meeting of Stockholders next Tuesday. There, shareholders could hear about new capital allocation decisions, which is particularly interesting right now given the heavy investment in AI and semiconductor manufacturing. Lam reported its fiscal Q1 numbers a week ago, beating on both the top and bottom lines. Projecting resilient revenue for the year ahead (despite sagging demand out of China) it’s reasonable to expect an upbeat shareholder event.</p>\n<p>As for KLA, it reports tonight (October 29), after a slew of sell-side upgrades across the semiconductor equipment industry. Shares are higher by almost 100% on the year, and any additional clues on its order backlog or developments in China could move the stock. All the commentary sets the table for NVIDIA’s show later in the month.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-november-5-bank-of-america-s-first-investor-day-since-2011-nbsp\">November 5: Bank of America’s First Investor Day Since 2011 </h3>\n<p>Perhaps the most consequential corporate event hits next Wednesday, when Bank of America (BAC) hosts its first Investor Day in 14 years.<sup>2</sup> The long hiatus makes this gathering particularly noteworthy. The banking industry has undergone massive changes since 2011, from the implementation of Dodd-Frank amid the zero-interest-rate-policy era to the digital banking revolution. Today, with crypto making institutional inroads and Treasury yields dropping from multi-decade highs, there are mixed signals for the big money-center banks. </p>\n<p>CEO Brian Moynihan will presumably grab the mic and offer details on BofA’s plans to navigate the new era. He usually keeps an upbeat tone, unlike his counterpart at JPMorgan Chase (JPM). Recall that Jamie Dimon talked of cockroaches lurking behind banking walls earlier in October. </p>\n<p>BofA shareholders may seek fresh clues on the health of the consumer, along with how the housing market may evolve with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dipping ever closer to a 5-handle. Furthermore, any added color on deposit trends, delinquency rates, or spending behavior will feed directly into how markets assess the health of the economy heading into 2026. </p>\n<p>The Financials sector as a whole has been sagging on an absolute and relative basis. The group was leading for much of 2024 and into the first half of this year. An optimistic tone would nicely buttress BofA’s <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/blog/Q3-2025-Earnings-Season-Kicks-Off\">big earnings beat</a> two weeks ago.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-november-6-tesla-shareholders-have-their-say\">November 6: Tesla Shareholders Have Their Say</h3>\n<p>If BofA’s Investor Day is the C-SPAN of key corporate events in early November, Tesla’s (TSLA) shareholder meeting is like <em>Entertainment Tonight</em>. The list of key agenda items will be long, but surely the most anticipated is the vote on Elon Musk’s enormous proposed pay package. </p>\n<p>The company’s board asks equity holders to approve a performance-based compensation award for the world’s richest person. It also stresses that if the package is not approved, the EV automaker—with its valuation pinned to robotics and AI—risks losing Musk’s “time, energy, and considerable talents.”<sup>3</sup> </p>\n<p>It’s estimated that if the ambitious milestones are met, the package could net Musk a staggering $1 trillion in equity. That would require a TSLA market cap of a seemingly out-of-reach $8.5 trillion, along with other operational and strategic targets.<sup>4</sup> If it’s not given a thumbs-up, Musk could retaliate or make other threats as the firm’s clear leader. </p>\n<p>The shareholder meeting transcends Tesla and Musk, though. It could be viewed as a litmus test on corporate governance. It remains to be seen how aligned the board is with Musk, how independent it is, and how shareholder-friendly the incentives are. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-bottom-line\">The Bottom Line</h3>\n<p>Q3 earnings data and corporate commentary will be huge in the next few weeks, but investors should also keep close tabs on developments from virtual and in-person shareholder meetings and Investor/Analyst Days. Facts and figures regarding AI, the global banking environment, and perhaps even the future of corporate governance are financial wildcards in the week ahead.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong><em>Sources:</em></strong></p>\n<p>1 FactSet Earnings Insight, John Butters, October 24, 2025, <a href=\"https://advantage.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_102425.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://advantage.factset.com</a><br/>2 Bank of America chief Brian Moynihan shakes up leadership team, Financial Times, Akila Quinio, September 12, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/82e1d2db-cccc-4080-876a-fab28b1a2676\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ft.com</a><br/>3 The Future of Tesla Is in Your Hands, Tesla, October 28, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.votetesla.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.votetesla.com</a><br/>4 Why Tesla just threw $1 trillion at Elon Musk, CNN, Chris Isldore, September 7, 2025, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/07/business/elon-musk-tesla-trillion\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://edition.cnn.com</a></p>\n</div>",

These two corporate event types can surprise investors, as new information about short-term trends and strategic plans crosses the wires. </p><!-- /126710690/ims/SeeItMarket/In_text_1 -->\n\n<p>We’ve seen that play out already this week—Uber Technologies (UBER) took part in a Fireside Chat with Goldman Sachs analysts on Monday. On tap today are a trio of headliners: Visa (V) welcomes stakeholders at its Investor Day 2025, Apple’s (AAPL) Reveal Event in Cupertino, Calif., is the center of the tech world in the afternoon, and Nike (NKE) addresses analysts’ questions throughout the day. </p>\n<p>These firm-specific and focused meetings are the little clues between earnings seasons that can help investors stay abreast of emerging developments. What’s more, they bring color to macro data. Inflation numbers continue rolling in this week, but soon Wall Street’s attention will turn to two key areas. </p>\n<p><strong>Retail Sales: </strong>According to our Economic Calendar, with data licensed from Econoday Inc., those numbers cross the wires at 8:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday the 16th. Recall that the July report put out by the US Census Bureau during the middle of last month was solid, with material upward revisions to June’s spending data. From many accounts, the <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/blog/Back-to-School-Spending-Season-in-Full-Swing-Key-Events-Ahead\">back-to-school shopping season</a> was a success, though higher tariff rates loom for US <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/blog/Consumer-Health-in-the-Spotlight-Ahead-of-Key-Retail-Earnings-Reports\">consumers</a> and small business owners. </p>\n<p><strong>Federal Reserve Policy: </strong>The two-day policy meeting is a so-called “live” one, as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is widely expected to cut its policy rate. Ahead of Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, a quarter-point ease is anticipated. If very soft inflation data comes across for August, a jumbo 50-basis-point cut can’t be ruled out. Many CEOs and CFOs, along with investors, will surely be tuned into what Chair Powell says during his press conference next Wednesday afternoon. Don’t forget that it’s September, which means we’ll get a fresh set of the “dots,” or the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), along with the rate decision. </p>\n<p>Four global companies have a chance to react to the macro news at their respective Analyst Days and Shareholder Meetings through month-end. (There’s even a bellwether earnings report tossed in the mix.) Together, a better sense of the business landscape may be garnered heading into the fourth quarter. Here are the four company events to watch: </p>\n<p><strong>September 17: CrowdStrike (CRWD) Analyst Day</strong> </p>\n<p>The world’s largest cybersecurity company has seen its stock price dip thus far in the second half. CRWD peaked at $518 in early July, then tumbled more than 20% to $403 last week. Nothing appears to be wrong—the $105 billion market cap company topped revenue and adjusted earnings estimates in its latest quarterly report, along with logging record net new annual recurring revenue. A light Q3 guide stung shares, however.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>CrowdStrike’s team is on the speaking schedule this afternoon at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia Technology Conference in San Francisco. They also present at Fal.Con 2025 next week on the 15th. It all culminates with an Investor Briefing from Fal.Con just as the Fed’s rate decision comes across. CrowdStrike’s next earnings report is Tuesday, November 25 AMC (unconfirmed). </p>\n<p><strong>September 19: Wynn Resorts (WYNN) Analyst Day</strong> </p>\n<p>CRWD has come off its high, but WYNN has been winning. Shares of the casino and gaming company have nearly doubled from their April low amid record adjusted profits from its Las Vegas operations. Interestingly, recent news reports suggest that Vegas vacations are not all they could be.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>Still, despite missing on adjusted EPS, Wynn tallied robust booking trends domestically, while its Macau (China) activity could be on the mend after a years-long struggle.<sup>3</sup> Stockholders may receive color on all these areas at the Analyst Meeting from the Wynn Culinary Festival Las Vegas 2025 gathering. Wynn’s next earnings report is Tuesday, November 4 AMC (unconfirmed). </p>\n<p><strong>September 25: Alibaba (BABA) Shareholder Meeting</strong> </p>\n<p>Speaking of China, the BABA bulls have been charging forward. The retailer’s shares are a few dollars and a few months from reaching a four-year high. Fundamentally, the company rocked parts of the tech world after its Q1 2026 quarterly report when it announced the development of new AI chips to potentially fill the void left by <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/blog/NVIDIA-PCE-Inflation-and-Auto-Sales-May-Shape-the-September-Backdrop\">NVIDIA</a>.<sup>4</sup>Alibaba’s next earnings report is Friday, November 14 AMC (unconfirmed). </p>\n<p><strong>September 29: FedEx (FDX) Shareholder Meeting</strong> </p>\n<p>Bringing it home, FedEx delivers its fiscal first-quarter earnings report next Thursday night (the 18th). The bar could be low, given a 20% stock-price decline over the past 12 months. Investors continue to await details on the firm’s intention to spin off its Freight division—maybe they’ll get that clarity on the morning of September 29.<sup>5</sup> That’s when CEO Raj Subramaniam and other FedEx executives welcome investors at the company’s virtual Annual General Meeting.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-bottom-line-nbsp\">The Bottom Line </h3>\n<p>Markets face a busy stretch of macro releases and firm-specific events in the coming weeks. Is fear running high? No. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) hovers around 15, suggesting only modest expected day-to-day swings in the S&amp;P 500. The price-action backdrop can change swiftly, though, and investors have the opportunity to hear the latest nuggets of industry wisdom at Analyst Days and Shareholder Meetings through the end of the month.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sources:</em></strong></p>\n<p>1 CrowdStrike Swings to Loss, Revenue View Undershoots, The Wall Street Journal, Dean Seal, August 27, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/crowdstrike-swings-to-loss-revenue-view-undershoots-658653d1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wsj.com</a><br/>2 Visitors dropped for a 6th straight month in Las Vegas as head of tourism insists Sin City isn’t dead, Andres Gutlerrez, August 30, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/las-vegas-visitors-tourism-drop-sin-city/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cbsnews.com</a><br/>3 Wynn Resorts Logs Lower Profit, The Wall Street Journal, Kelly Cloonan, August 7, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/wynn-resorts-logs-lower-profit-c2ee07ab\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wsj.com</a><br/>4 China’s Alibaba develops new AI chip to help fill Nvidia void, WSJ reports, Reuters, August 29, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-alibaba-develops-new-ai-chip-help-fill-nvidia-void-wsj-reports-2025-08-29/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reuters.com</a><br/>5 How FedEx’s Freight spinoff could impact shipper contracts, Supply Chain Drive, Max Garland, August 7, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/fedex-freight-spinoff-bundled-contract-impact/756866\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.supplychaindive.com</a></p>\n<p></p>\n</div>",

So future.</p>\n<p>What also came up is IBM (NYSE: IBM).</p>\n<p>Now, we did catch the huge move up early this year, exited and have not been involved since the drop in late June.</p>\n<p>This is what I learned about IBM:</p>\n<p>IBM is a founding member of the Hyperledger Project. The platform enables tokenization in an enterprise setting, allowing for the creation of digital assets representing real-world items like patents, carbon credits, or securities.</p>\n<p>Its focus is on <strong>providing infrastructure and solutions for businesses to use blockchain</strong>, rather than directly issuing public cryptocurrency tokens.</p>\n<p>As for the chart…</p>\n<p>The price cleared the 200-day moving average after making a bottoming formation in early August.</p>\n<p>Only now, IBM outperforms the benchmark though it has a way to go in momentum.</p>\n<p>Ideally, Id like to see another close over 253 to confirm.</p>\n<p>Then, the risk is clear and the trip to July highs would be a first test of just how strong IBM might be.</p>\n<p>Tokenization will explode. Currently, using tokens to as a digital representation of a real thing is already in use in China.</p>\n<p>Essentially, someone can buy a token that represents a small piece of a house, making real estate more affordable for everyone.</p>\n<p>In China (and here) that alone is huge.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned as I get more informed, I will continue to share with you, especially regarding the investment side.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"td-post-content tagdiv-type\">\n<!-- image -->\n<!-- content -->\n<p>Few would disagree that the U.S. Fed was late to the game in fighting inflation a few years ago. Of course, it was a rather unique time in history coming out of a pandemic that had supply constraints still lingering while demand soared. People were bored sitting at home and had piles of accumulated savings, so revenge travel became a trend as did just paying up.</p>\n<p>After waiting too long, claiming inflation was transitory, central banks around the world moved rates up aggressively to combat inflation.</p><!-- /126710690/ims/SeeItMarket/In_text_1 -->\n\n<p>The chart below is kind of fun, contrasting the 70s with the 20s. In the 1970s, central bankers were on it, raising rates quickly to fight inflation. But after initial success it came back and then required rates to go even higher and stay up there longer to finally beat down inflation. This led to a pretty bad recession in the 80s, then a beautiful time for consumers and markets that lasted decades.</p>\n\n<p>We are not saying 2020s inflation will follow the same path, that would be too simplistic. However, it does appear inflation may be stirring once again. Inflation has come down from a high of around 8.5% to the current 2.7% based on U.S. CPI year-over-year. This probably is not deemed a success from the central bank’s perspective, but it isn’t their fault.</p>\n<p>The Fed was late to get started but even when the hikes began, fiscal spending in the U.S. continued very aggressively with monetary policy pulling the rope in one direction and fiscal policy in the other. So apart from very interest rate-sensitive pockets of the economy, there really wasn’t much of a slowdown to alleviate the inflation pressures. Instead, they mainly came down because we all blew through accumulated savings, and the higher cost of doing things sped this process. And supply or capacity caught up with demand.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, inflation hasn’t come down as much as policy makers and consumers hoped. And it does potentially appear to be starting to turn back up. Meanwhile, the Fed is expected to cut rates in September, which would be the first rate cut in 2025. At the same time, a number of factors appear to be signaling that inflation may re-accelerate, which may cause some surprise for markets later in 2025.</p>\n<p><strong>Tariffs – </strong>As tariffs begin to be collected, they push prices higher, making them inflationary, but it also depends on how consumers respond. If higher prices result in less demand, slower economic activity could help offset inflation. But, with consumer spending still resilient, and renewed fiscal spending, the economy may not slow down or slow enough to mitigate the upward move in inflation from tariffs. With new and expanded tariffs starting to filter through the supply chain, tariff-driven cost increases usually take two-six months to fully show up in CPI. That means in Q4 we could start to see this impact, or sooner if companies choose to increase prices earlier.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at earnings transcripts for mentions of rising costs and prices, it would appear companies are starting to raise prices already. Keep in mind this is for Q2, even before most of the tariffs started. Q3, which we will see in October, will likely be higher – a sign of more inflation ahead. The good news is that costs are not yet rising, which means profit margins may see a positive impact. This could be good for equities, not so much for bonds.</p>\n<p><strong>Services – </strong>Tariffs impact goods inflation but for developed economies, such as the U.S. and Canada, services matter more so. And for services, wages matter the most. Wage growth has been moderating slowly, but unless we start seeing material weakness in employment, wage growth will likely continue. PMI surveys for service business pricing has been accelerating to the upside, which historically leads to overall inflation.</p>\n\n<p>Inflation is a mindset problem, and the real damage comes when people begin to think inflation is here to stay. This causes behaviours to change — from consumption to wage growth expectations. It is worth noting that the University of Michigan survey data didn’t see long-term inflation expectations (5-10 year) move higher during the 2021-22 inflation spike. But they are moving higher now, with a jump in this month’s survey. Partial erosion of Fed independence, whether real or perceived, is likely adding to the view that inflation may run hotter for longer, with less effective policy control.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Reducing rates, adding more fiscal stimulus in the Big Beautiful Bill, and the impact of tariffs — inflation risks are adding up in the coming months. Of course, if we get a soft patch in the economic data, that may provide the release valve. But if we don’t get a slowdown, this inflation risk may bleed into yields in the coming months.</p>\n</div>",
