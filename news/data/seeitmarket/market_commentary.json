These two corporate event types can surprise investors, as new information about short-term trends and strategic plans crosses the wires. </p><!-- /126710690/ims/SeeItMarket/In_text_1 -->\n\n<p>We’ve seen that play out already this week—Uber Technologies (UBER) took part in a Fireside Chat with Goldman Sachs analysts on Monday. On tap today are a trio of headliners: Visa (V) welcomes stakeholders at its Investor Day 2025, Apple’s (AAPL) Reveal Event in Cupertino, Calif., is the center of the tech world in the afternoon, and Nike (NKE) addresses analysts’ questions throughout the day. </p>\n<p>These firm-specific and focused meetings are the little clues between earnings seasons that can help investors stay abreast of emerging developments. What’s more, they bring color to macro data. Inflation numbers continue rolling in this week, but soon Wall Street’s attention will turn to two key areas. </p>\n<p><strong>Retail Sales: </strong>According to our Economic Calendar, with data licensed from Econoday Inc., those numbers cross the wires at 8:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday the 16th. Recall that the July report put out by the US Census Bureau during the middle of last month was solid, with material upward revisions to June’s spending data. From many accounts, the <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/blog/Back-to-School-Spending-Season-in-Full-Swing-Key-Events-Ahead\">back-to-school shopping season</a> was a success, though higher tariff rates loom for US <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/blog/Consumer-Health-in-the-Spotlight-Ahead-of-Key-Retail-Earnings-Reports\">consumers</a> and small business owners. </p>\n<p><strong>Federal Reserve Policy: </strong>The two-day policy meeting is a so-called “live” one, as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is widely expected to cut its policy rate. Ahead of Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, a quarter-point ease is anticipated. If very soft inflation data comes across for August, a jumbo 50-basis-point cut can’t be ruled out. Many CEOs and CFOs, along with investors, will surely be tuned into what Chair Powell says during his press conference next Wednesday afternoon. Don’t forget that it’s September, which means we’ll get a fresh set of the “dots,” or the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), along with the rate decision. </p>\n<p>Four global companies have a chance to react to the macro news at their respective Analyst Days and Shareholder Meetings through month-end. (There’s even a bellwether earnings report tossed in the mix.) Together, a better sense of the business landscape may be garnered heading into the fourth quarter. Here are the four company events to watch: </p>\n<p><strong>September 17: CrowdStrike (CRWD) Analyst Day</strong> </p>\n<p>The world’s largest cybersecurity company has seen its stock price dip thus far in the second half. CRWD peaked at $518 in early July, then tumbled more than 20% to $403 last week. Nothing appears to be wrong—the $105 billion market cap company topped revenue and adjusted earnings estimates in its latest quarterly report, along with logging record net new annual recurring revenue. A light Q3 guide stung shares, however.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>CrowdStrike’s team is on the speaking schedule this afternoon at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia Technology Conference in San Francisco. They also present at Fal.Con 2025 next week on the 15th. It all culminates with an Investor Briefing from Fal.Con just as the Fed’s rate decision comes across. CrowdStrike’s next earnings report is Tuesday, November 25 AMC (unconfirmed). </p>\n<p><strong>September 19: Wynn Resorts (WYNN) Analyst Day</strong> </p>\n<p>CRWD has come off its high, but WYNN has been winning. Shares of the casino and gaming company have nearly doubled from their April low amid record adjusted profits from its Las Vegas operations. Interestingly, recent news reports suggest that Vegas vacations are not all they could be.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>Still, despite missing on adjusted EPS, Wynn tallied robust booking trends domestically, while its Macau (China) activity could be on the mend after a years-long struggle.<sup>3</sup> Stockholders may receive color on all these areas at the Analyst Meeting from the Wynn Culinary Festival Las Vegas 2025 gathering. Wynn’s next earnings report is Tuesday, November 4 AMC (unconfirmed). </p>\n<p><strong>September 25: Alibaba (BABA) Shareholder Meeting</strong> </p>\n<p>Speaking of China, the BABA bulls have been charging forward. The retailer’s shares are a few dollars and a few months from reaching a four-year high. Fundamentally, the company rocked parts of the tech world after its Q1 2026 quarterly report when it announced the development of new AI chips to potentially fill the void left by <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/blog/NVIDIA-PCE-Inflation-and-Auto-Sales-May-Shape-the-September-Backdrop\">NVIDIA</a>.<sup>4</sup>Alibaba’s next earnings report is Friday, November 14 AMC (unconfirmed). </p>\n<p><strong>September 29: FedEx (FDX) Shareholder Meeting</strong> </p>\n<p>Bringing it home, FedEx delivers its fiscal first-quarter earnings report next Thursday night (the 18th). The bar could be low, given a 20% stock-price decline over the past 12 months. Investors continue to await details on the firm’s intention to spin off its Freight division—maybe they’ll get that clarity on the morning of September 29.<sup>5</sup> That’s when CEO Raj Subramaniam and other FedEx executives welcome investors at the company’s virtual Annual General Meeting.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-bottom-line-nbsp\">The Bottom Line </h3>\n<p>Markets face a busy stretch of macro releases and firm-specific events in the coming weeks. Is fear running high? No. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) hovers around 15, suggesting only modest expected day-to-day swings in the S&amp;P 500. The price-action backdrop can change swiftly, though, and investors have the opportunity to hear the latest nuggets of industry wisdom at Analyst Days and Shareholder Meetings through the end of the month.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sources:</em></strong></p>\n<p>1 CrowdStrike Swings to Loss, Revenue View Undershoots, The Wall Street Journal, Dean Seal, August 27, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/crowdstrike-swings-to-loss-revenue-view-undershoots-658653d1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wsj.com</a><br/>2 Visitors dropped for a 6th straight month in Las Vegas as head of tourism insists Sin City isn’t dead, Andres Gutlerrez, August 30, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/las-vegas-visitors-tourism-drop-sin-city/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cbsnews.com</a><br/>3 Wynn Resorts Logs Lower Profit, The Wall Street Journal, Kelly Cloonan, August 7, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/wynn-resorts-logs-lower-profit-c2ee07ab\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wsj.com</a><br/>4 China’s Alibaba develops new AI chip to help fill Nvidia void, WSJ reports, Reuters, August 29, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-alibaba-develops-new-ai-chip-help-fill-nvidia-void-wsj-reports-2025-08-29/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reuters.com</a><br/>5 How FedEx’s Freight spinoff could impact shipper contracts, Supply Chain Drive, Max Garland, August 7, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/fedex-freight-spinoff-bundled-contract-impact/756866\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.supplychaindive.com</a></p>\n<p></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"td-post-content tagdiv-type\">\n<!-- image -->\n<!-- content -->\n<p>Few would disagree that the U.S. Fed was late to the game in fighting inflation a few years ago. Of course, it was a rather unique time in history coming out of a pandemic that had supply constraints still lingering while demand soared. People were bored sitting at home and had piles of accumulated savings, so revenge travel became a trend as did just paying up.</p>\n<p>After waiting too long, claiming inflation was transitory, central banks around the world moved rates up aggressively to combat inflation.</p><!-- /126710690/ims/SeeItMarket/In_text_1 -->\n\n<p>The chart below is kind of fun, contrasting the 70s with the 20s. In the 1970s, central bankers were on it, raising rates quickly to fight inflation. But after initial success it came back and then required rates to go even higher and stay up there longer to finally beat down inflation. This led to a pretty bad recession in the 80s, then a beautiful time for consumers and markets that lasted decades.</p>\n\n<p>We are not saying 2020s inflation will follow the same path, that would be too simplistic. However, it does appear inflation may be stirring once again. Inflation has come down from a high of around 8.5% to the current 2.7% based on U.S. CPI year-over-year. This probably is not deemed a success from the central bank’s perspective, but it isn’t their fault.</p>\n<p>The Fed was late to get started but even when the hikes began, fiscal spending in the U.S. continued very aggressively with monetary policy pulling the rope in one direction and fiscal policy in the other. So apart from very interest rate-sensitive pockets of the economy, there really wasn’t much of a slowdown to alleviate the inflation pressures. Instead, they mainly came down because we all blew through accumulated savings, and the higher cost of doing things sped this process. And supply or capacity caught up with demand.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, inflation hasn’t come down as much as policy makers and consumers hoped. And it does potentially appear to be starting to turn back up. Meanwhile, the Fed is expected to cut rates in September, which would be the first rate cut in 2025. At the same time, a number of factors appear to be signaling that inflation may re-accelerate, which may cause some surprise for markets later in 2025.</p>\n<p><strong>Tariffs – </strong>As tariffs begin to be collected, they push prices higher, making them inflationary, but it also depends on how consumers respond. If higher prices result in less demand, slower economic activity could help offset inflation. But, with consumer spending still resilient, and renewed fiscal spending, the economy may not slow down or slow enough to mitigate the upward move in inflation from tariffs. With new and expanded tariffs starting to filter through the supply chain, tariff-driven cost increases usually take two-six months to fully show up in CPI. That means in Q4 we could start to see this impact, or sooner if companies choose to increase prices earlier.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at earnings transcripts for mentions of rising costs and prices, it would appear companies are starting to raise prices already. Keep in mind this is for Q2, even before most of the tariffs started. Q3, which we will see in October, will likely be higher – a sign of more inflation ahead. The good news is that costs are not yet rising, which means profit margins may see a positive impact. This could be good for equities, not so much for bonds.</p>\n<p><strong>Services – </strong>Tariffs impact goods inflation but for developed economies, such as the U.S. and Canada, services matter more so. And for services, wages matter the most. Wage growth has been moderating slowly, but unless we start seeing material weakness in employment, wage growth will likely continue. PMI surveys for service business pricing has been accelerating to the upside, which historically leads to overall inflation.</p>\n\n<p>Inflation is a mindset problem, and the real damage comes when people begin to think inflation is here to stay. This causes behaviours to change — from consumption to wage growth expectations. It is worth noting that the University of Michigan survey data didn’t see long-term inflation expectations (5-10 year) move higher during the 2021-22 inflation spike. But they are moving higher now, with a jump in this month’s survey. Partial erosion of Fed independence, whether real or perceived, is likely adding to the view that inflation may run hotter for longer, with less effective policy control.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Reducing rates, adding more fiscal stimulus in the Big Beautiful Bill, and the impact of tariffs — inflation risks are adding up in the coming months. Of course, if we get a soft patch in the economic data, that may provide the release valve.

            "description": "<div class=\"td-post-content tagdiv-type\">\n<!-- image -->\n<!-- content -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The IPO floodgates have swung open for breakthrough AI and crypto companies ready to shake up the market</li>\n<li>Figma’s (NYSE: FIG) debut joined CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) and Circle (NYSE: CRCL) in a rollercoaster ride of quick gains and sharp dips</li>\n<li>A fresh name hits the trading floor this week as investors scout the next IPO winners</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to our IPO data, licensed from IPOScoop, Bullish is set to IPO this week. It’s a Cayman Islands-based crypto exchange seeking to raise more than $600 million, according to an SEC filing earlier this month.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>A sign of the times? Perhaps.</p><!-- /126710690/ims/SeeItMarket/In_text_1 -->\n\n<p>It’s enough to make contrarian investors’ ears perk up, given the name. After a handful of successful go-public story stocks this year, the firm led by CEO Tom Farley, a former president of the New York Stock Exchange, has a lot to live up to.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-figma-s-volatile-debut-joins-coreweave-and-circle-s-ipo-rollercoaster\">Figma’s Volatile Debut Joins CoreWeave and Circle’s IPO Rollercoaster</h3>\n<p>Circle (CRCL) is the big IPO winner so far this year, returning 418% from its first day of trading, while AI player CoreWeave (CRWV) sports a 173% gain since it listed in early June.<sup>2</sup> The latest IPO craze surrounds Figma (FIG), a browser-based designing interface company, which brought about mid-late 1990s vibes when it began trading in July.</p>\n<p>But is the shine coming off the 2025 IPO Cinderella story? CRCL was cut in half from its June peak to below $150 for a time last week, CRWV dropped 55% over the early summer, and Figma (FIG) fell hard after an early burst. Still, the Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO), which holds shares of recent IPOs, notched fresh highs going back to Q1 2022 as August got underway.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ipo-window-opens-in-some-spots\">IPO Window Opens…In Some Spots</h3>\n<p>It’s clear that the IPO environment is more conducive than it was a few quarters ago, but there’s still uncertainty for currently private companies considering testing the public waters. Sure, it’s high times for AI and crypto adjacent going concerns, but companies in other, more cyclical industries may still be treading lightly.​</p>\n<p>Recent manufacturing and services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) readings have not been all that upbeat, while earnings growth away from the Magnificent Seven stocks is paltry. Thus, the story with IPOs mirrors what we see in most of the US stock market: Party on in tech (AI and crypto, specifically) and good luck to everyone else, particularly domestic small and mid-sized companies.</p>\n<p>Space startup Firefly Aerospace (FLY) hit the tape last week on Thursday August 7th, and it aims for more durable success than Voyager Technologies (VOYG), which popped and dropped after its June IPO.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-bullish-s-ipo-follows-figma-s-pricing-challenges\">Bullish’s IPO Follows Figma’s Pricing Challenges</h3>\n<p>What happens this week with Bullish (which trades under the ticker BLSH) will be the latest data point on the broader trend. Pressure was undoubtedly on its underwriters in the wake of Figma’s pricing. FIG priced at $33, opened at $85, then peaked on its second session at $142. Its market cap topped out near $70 billion, which (at the time) made it larger than 340 S&amp;P 500 constituents. </p>\n<p>You see, when a stock is priced significantly below its post-IPO trading level, many experts argue that substantial money was “left on the table.” Had the underwriting banks set a higher price, original investors might have enjoyed even greater gains. Instead, the quick profits went to new shareholders who bought in at the IPO price.​</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-increasing-ipo-filings-signal-a-gradual-market-recovery\">Increasing IPO Filings Signal a Gradual Market Recovery<strong>​</strong></h3>\n<p>Bigger picture, there remains a clear, though gradual, upward trend in the number of new IPO filings. The count (on a trailing 12-month basis) hit a low in Q1 2024, and we’ve seen modest year-over-year increases since then. Not even halfway through the third quarter, and we have already reached about 70% of the total IPO filings for Q3 2024. All the while, high-profile private companies bide their time, surely eyeing that perfect moment to tap the public arena.</p>\n<p><strong>IPO Count Gradually Recovering Since Early 2024</strong></p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Predicting the Next Big IPO: Klarna and Other Contenders</h3>\n<p>Who might be next? There’s an online prediction market for that. According to Kalshi, bettors place an 81% chance that Klarna, a Swedish fintech company specializing in the buy now, pay later niche, will IPO by the end of the year.<sup>3</sup> The latest reports suggest Klarna will restart its public offering process as soon as September. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">SpaceX, OpenAI, and Anthropic Await Market Debuts</h3>\n<p>Discord, Cerebras, and Databricks are other possible IPOs as we approach the end of 2025, but the real heavyweights to come are SpaceX, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Valuations run in the hundreds of billions of dollars for those private behemoths, with higher estimated price tags every time a funding round happens, it seems. Wall Street bankers are no doubt champing at the bit to organize IPO roadshows, while Elon Musk and Sam Altman could capitalize on ever-increasing valuations.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Macro Conditions and M&amp;A Activity Influence the Broader IPO Market Outlook</h3>\n<p>As for the ex-tech space, it may take time for macro conditions to turn more favorable for IPOs to flourish. Lower interest rates would help spur equity unlocks, so long as a protracted economic downturn is avoided. Our team will also be watching M&amp;A trends as a potential first step toward a pickup in cyclical-sector go-public activity.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bottom Line</h3>\n<p>With so many massive day-one IPO winners, casual investors might think the IPO market is as hot as ever. That’s not the case when eyeing the data. Still, capital markets are stronger compared to recent years, and the IPO pipeline is filled with AI and high-tech power players.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sources:</em></strong></p>\n<p>1 Peter Thiel-backed Bullish seeks up to $4.2 billion valuation in U.S. IPO, CNBC, Reuters, August 5, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com\">https://www.cnbc.com</a><br/>2 CRCL, StockCharts, August 8, 2025, <a href=\"https://schrts.co/psVDVaxg\">https://schrts.co/psVDVaxg</a><br/>3 Kalshi, Which Companies will Officially Announce an IPO this year?, August 8, 2025, <a href=\"https://kalshi.com/markets/kxipo/ipos\">https://kalshi.com/markets/kxipo/ipos</a></p>\n</div>",
