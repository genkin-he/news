But in the end, it comes down to earnings.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to visualize this is by breaking down market returns into the underlying components. In the short term, multiple expansion or contraction is often the biggest driver, including the past year.</p><!-- /126710690/ims/SeeItMarket/In_text_1 -->\n\n<p>However, over the long term it is earnings growth that dominates as a driver of market returns.</p>\n<p>The chart below shows the return decomposition for the S&amp;P 500 Index (INDEXSP: .INX) broken down into dividends, earnings growth and multiple expansion for calendar years and then on the right over the past 5 and 10 years. Note how the grey bars dominate long term.</p>\n\n<p>It’s anyone’s guess if risk appetites will rise or fall in the coming months, though they’re more likely to fall given they do appear decently high right now. However, on an encouraging note earnings continue to improve.</p>\n<p>Estimates for 2026 calendar year earnings have risen by 12% for emerging markets (EM) since the summer of last year. TSX and Japan have also enjoyed strongly positive earnings revisions. And guess what are the best performing markets so far in 2026? Yep, Japan is at the top, followed by emerging markets and then the TSX. Europe and the US are the laggards, still up but not nearly as much.</p>\n\n<p>So is the place to be in 2026 Japan, emerging markets and the TSX? We would agree with the first two, but we are a little less enthusiastic about the TSX, largely because of where that earnings growth is coming from. The chart below includes the overall TSX’s 2026 earnings revisions and as you can see it is ‘ALL’ coming from materials, led by gold. No question, gold companies are printing a lot of cashflow. But the market may not pay up much for such volatile earnings.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, the U.S. market has one big star as well from an earnings revision perspective: technology. And lately, more sectors are seeing improving revisions as well. It’s certainly worth noting, especially considering the tech space has been a bit soft of late.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Good earnings growth that is now more global compared to years past is a very good news story. And recent trends in revisions have been positive, helping this market — which has been struggling with headlines of late — show some resilience.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"td-post-content tagdiv-type\">\n<!-- image -->\n<!-- content -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Amid earnings and conferences, a packed week of macro releases could reshape the growth and inflation narratives heading into March</li>\n<li>Q4 GDP and PCE inflation data may test whether the bond market’s slowdown signal holds up</li>\n<li>FOMC Minutes, Flash PMIs, and UMich sentiment round out a pivotal stretch for policy expectations and risk assets</li>\n</ul>\n<p>January Retail Sales was the big data point to kick off the holiday-shortened trading week on Wall Street… just kidding… at least it was in an alternate, non-government-shutdown universe! Alas, it appears we won’t get the first complete consumer read for a few more weeks. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t a busy data slate for the balance of this week. </p>\n<p>Let me toss another curveball your way. Stocks are up big to start the year—international stocks, that is. The often-unsung MSCI All-Country World ex-USA Index (NASDAQ: ACWX) sports its best return relative to the S&amp;P 500 Index (INDEXSP: .INX) in data going back to at least 1995. A three-decade alpha sprint to begin 2026 comes as the U.S. large-cap index drifted into the red YTD this past Tuesday morning. Indeed, “the stock market” is not a monolith. </p><!-- /126710690/ims/SeeItMarket/In_text_1 -->\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-rotation-nation-nbsp\">Rotation Nation </h3>\n<p>Diversification and dispersion are the asset-allocation passwords at the moment. Domestic “SMID” caps have been outperforming, along with defensive sectors like Consumer Staples and the embattled Real Estate niche. Energy and Materials, presumed “late-cycle” plays, remain best among the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors through the year’s first 31 trading days.  </p>\n<p>And it’s that combination—defensives and late-cycle names—that makes some market technicians nervous. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-seasonal-jitters-and-ai-s-heel-turn-nbsp\">Seasonal Jitters and AI’s Heel Turn </h3>\n<p>The anxiety hits during a notorious calendar period. Recall that equities topped on February 19th in 2020 and 2025. Three’s a charm if you’re a bear. Just as COVID-19 and the tariff meltdown were downside drivers in past years, a new bugaboo could be spooking investors this go-round. </p>\n<p>Call it the “software-as-a-<em>dis</em>service” trade, or <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/blog/The-Great-AI-Squeeze\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AI turning heel</a>. No matter the moniker, former stalwart high-margin, high-ARR tech plays have come under attack by AI’s deflationary vigilantes. More than a handful of top holdings in the iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF (IGV) are relegated to mid-teens P/E multiples. With valuations being halved, bottom-pickers in the institutional world may be licking their chops amid this “sell first, ask questions later” environment. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-dangerous-and-upbeat-backdrop-at-the-same-time-nbsp\">A Dangerous and Upbeat Backdrop At the Same Time? </h3>\n<p>But what changes this landscape? Well, <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/blog/Earnings-Hold-the-Line-as-Retailers-get-Ready-to-Report-Amid-Major-Sector-Rotation-and-Tech-Fallout\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fundamental earnings</a> and economic data could reorient narratives and price action. Within the former category, Walmart’s (WMT) earnings report tomorrow morning, February 18, offers a consumer glimpse, but be on the lookout for AI nuggets.  </p>\n<p>You see, the now-trillion-dollar market cap company is not merely a big-box retailer—it’s an AI and automation juggernaut. John Furner succeeded former CEO Doug McMillon this month, and he may look to make a splash. What would send ripples more than insights into AI and cost-cutting efforts? We’ll be watching. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-data-deck-nbsp\">The Data Deck </h3>\n<p>And then there’s the latter category—macro data. According to our partners at Econoday, FOMC Minutes hit the tape this afternoon. The Fed is probably on hold for the duration of Chair Powell’s chairmanship, but a final rate cut before June shouldn’t be ruled out—at least according to the bond market. The 2-year Treasury yield dipped to cycle lows (back to August–September 2022) this week, suggesting that sluggish growth may pose a greater risk than hot inflation. That may sound strange (given where the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model has been running), but bond-market action shouldn’t be dismissed. </p>\n<p>We’ll know more by Friday. Our economic calendar notes that a data onslaught lies ahead. Markets will absorb the first look at U.S. Q4 GDP. Expectations call for a 3.0% quarter-on-quarter annualized real growth rate, which would be a material deceleration from Q3 2025’s 4.4% scorching pace. To be clear, trade data and even gold exports continue throwing off normalized GDP figures. So, don’t be surprised if traders overlook an out-of-line headline number. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-another-inflation-test-albeit-dated-nbsp\">Another Inflation Test (Albeit Dated) </h3>\n<p>What may matter more is the inflation side of the Q4 report. The October through December Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) update will be our clearest inflation view yet (the January PCE inflation data announcement date remains TBA). With December CPI and PPI in hand, the Street sees a potentially warm year-end print.  </p>\n<p>Going forward, many economists expect a gradual easing in the inflation rate once “Liberation Day” is lapped—YoY comps turn friendlier for the inflation doves. We’ve already heard from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Chicago Fed President Austen Goolsbee suggesting that rate cuts could be in the works if inflation cooperates. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-business-amp-consumer-touchpoints-nbsp\">Business &amp; Consumer Touchpoints </h3>\n<p>There will be a lot to unpack at 8:30 a.m. ET before the bell on Friday, but the action continues later in the morning. At 9:45 a.m. come S&amp;P Global Flash PMIs. With a February read, we’ll see if the latest manufacturing survey results match the surprisingly upbeat responses from the January Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing PMI. Unlike the ISM’s version, S&amp;P Global PMIs have been above 50 for some time. Better vibes among business owners and corporate managers could portend an improved labor market later in the year. </p>\n<p>Finally, consumer sentiment rounds out the morning of economic data, both hard and soft. This will be the second and final update to February’s University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers. The initial report was sharply more upbeat than expected. A sanguine survey set would lend further credence to the notion of the “vibe-pression” turning a corner. The “K-shaped” economy appears full steam ahead, though. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-bottom-line-nbsp\">The Bottom Line </h3>\n<p>It’s a short week for traders and portfolio managers, but a long one for those dissecting macro data points. FOMC Minutes hits before a slew of mid-tier economic updates on Thursday. Friday morning could be the big reveal, with growth and inflation numbers followed by bellwether business and consumer surveys. Through it all, corporate earnings keep rolling in, along with a very busy <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/blog/2026-Themes-Emerge-Leading-Into-a-Busy-Q1-Second-Half-Investor-Conference-Season\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">conference-speaking circuit</a>.​</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"td-post-content tagdiv-type\">\n<!-- image -->\n<!-- content -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Software’s DeepSeek AI moment, Dow 50k, a yo-yo dollar, and “sell America” are market narratives</li>\n<li>Price action, corporate profits, and perhaps even jobs data buck bearish viewpoints</li>\n<li>Investor conferences through quarter-end offer color on macro risks and opportunities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Is artificial intelligence (AI) eating the software world? That might be <em>the</em> industry-specific question investors, analysts, and executives will toss around in the months ahead.</p>\n<p>The first week of February was the China DeepSeek AI moment for software-as-a-service companies. Hundreds of billions of dollars of market cap were shed from the likes of Salesforce (CRM), Intuit (INTU), ServiceNow (NOW), Adobe (ADBE), and others. Deep red hit the space just as the AI hyperscalers announced capex numbers well above Street estimates. </p><!-- /126710690/ims/SeeItMarket/In_text_1 -->\n\n<p>Push will come to shove in the weeks ahead as tech executives take questions at key investor conferences over the back half of the first quarter.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-energy-and-materials-take-the-lead\">Energy and Materials Take the Lead</h3>\n<p>But there’s more to the market’s story than just tech. In fact, Information Technology is near the bottom of the S&amp;P 500 YTD sector performance pack. Leading the current leg of the bull market are resource stocks. Energy and Materials, both up by more than 15% in 2026, have outperformed thanks to rising oil and metals prices, a weaker dollar, and the rotation trade. </p>\n<p>Interestingly, oil and gas companies are apparently doing more with less—profits and stock prices in the oil patch are up even with historically low WTI and Brent values. CERAWeek is the standout Energy conference to keep tabs on toward the end of March.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dow-50-000-challenges-the-bear-case\">Dow 50,000 Challenges the Bear Case</h3>\n<p>Bigger picture, the “sell America” narrative has carried over from last year. Perhaps this storyline needs to be rebranded as “buy ex-USA.” Indeed, International equities have soared just six weeks into 2026. At the same time, with the Dow crossing 50,000 for the first time and the S&amp;P 500 near its record high, it’s difficult to put much stock in a bearish USA theme. </p>\n<p>What’s more, Treasury yields have dipped from a few weeks ago, while U.S. corporate bonds trade close to a multi-decade low yield spread. The dollar, meanwhile, has not been able to get off the mat. The greenback took a spill in late January when President Trump intimated that he would be fine if the dollar declined from its current level.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-high-stakes-q-amp-a-season-for-executives\">High-Stakes Q&amp;A Season for Executives</h3>\n<p>Equity markets and bonds point to a benign backdrop, but CEOs and CFOs face tough choices ahead. The jobs situation is delicate, a strong January payrolls report notwithstanding. Corporate layoff announcements are elevated. And all it takes is one Truth Social post to rejigger an industry. </p>\n<p>Upcoming conferences could feature pointed questions for executive teams about their stances on economic and even cultural issues—topics corporate leaders often want to deflect. The stakes are high, drama fills the room, and tough choices must be made.

Worries over tax cuts and their impact on Japan’s fiscal situation continued a macro trend ongoing for the past year-plus. </p>\n<p>All eyes will be on the upcoming Bank of Japan monetary policy meeting, ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s January 28 interest-rate decision. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-energy-atop-the-early-year-sector-leaderboard-high-macro-volatility\">Energy Atop the Early-Year Sector Leaderboard, High Macro Volatility</h3>\n<p>For investors, 10 of the 11 <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/blog/Did-the-Banks-Just-Set-the-Stage\">S&amp;P 500 sectors</a> traded in the red yesterday morning. The lone bright spot? Energy.  </p>\n<p>The oil &amp; gas space often offers diversification benefits to global portfolio managers when macro jitters take center stage. Shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM), the world’s most valuable publicly traded energy company, tagged a record high above $131 for the first time. It has been remarkable how resilient large energy firms have been, given depressed oil prices. </p>\n<p>Indeed, both WTI and Brent crude have felt the brunt of a global oil glut. President Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” mindset and OPEC’s unsuccessful attempts to stabilize the supply-demand balance have kept oil bears in charge. Though prices spiked earlier this month when the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro (it feels like ages ago at this point), prices quickly fell back down. American households probably aren’t complaining, as AAA reports that the average cost of a gallon of regular unleaded is near five-year lows at $2.82. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-don-t-forget-about-natural-gas-old-man-winter-tightens-his-grip-nbsp\">Don’t Forget about Natural Gas: Old Man Winter Tightens His Grip </h3>\n<p>Stable oil prices contrast what’s happening in the natural gas markets. The February 2026 contract of U.S. Henry Hub gas jumped nearly 30% on Tuesday. Forecasts for bone-chilling cold over the final week of January spooked markets, and this weekend’s wintry blast could rival what transpired in Texas four years ago, just as power grids grapple with rising prices and pressure from policymakers. Impacts are likely from the Lone Star State to the Mid-Atlantic.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-earnings-events-add-drama-and-investor-interest-bkr-stands-out-nbsp\">Earnings Events Add Drama and Investor Interest, BKR Stands Out </h3>\n<p>So, there’s no shortage of drama at home and abroad, as well as across oil and natural gas markets, for energy executives to weigh. Near-term risks and long-term opportunities are aplenty at the moment. That will make the upcoming round of energy-sector Q4 reports all the more interesting. Additionally, our team uncovered an outlier company that will report off schedule this coming Sunday night. </p>\n<p>What is that firm? Baker Hughes (BKR). Shares of the $41 billion market-cap oil and gas equipment and services company hover near record highs ahead of its unusual weekend earnings event. There hasn’t been significant news lately—we have to go back to last summer, when BKR acquired Chart Industries in a $13.6 billion M&amp;A move.  </p>\n<p>Market pricing also suggests that the January 25 Q4 report might not include many fireworks. According to data from Option Research &amp; Technology Services, the stock is expected to move just 4.8% (near its long-term average earnings-related straddle of 4.9%). Shares dipped 3.3% following the October Q3 report.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>We also dug into the corporate event calendar. BKR’s quarterly conference call takes place Monday morning next week, but a quiet stretch then ensues—no major volatility catalysts until its April Q1 report. Nevertheless, be on guard for potential one-time items to be included in Sunday’s release. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-listen-up-nbsp\">Listen Up! </h3>\n<p>Beyond Baker Hughes, and after Halliburton (HAL) reported this morning, SLB Corp (SLB), formerly known as Schlumberger, serves up numbers Friday before the bell. The heavy hitters—XOM and Chevron (CVX)—report next Friday, January 30. Investors will listen intently to what CEOs Darren Woods and Mike Wirth have to say about the volatile state of the global energy market, particularly regarding Venezuela.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-opportunities-in-south-america\">Opportunities in South America?</h3>\n<p>Much has been made of the country’s oil reserves, which are likely materially lower than what the Maduro and former Chávez regimes have claimed. Moreover, while resource-rich, Venezuelan oil is notoriously sour and dense, more like tar than domestic light sweet crude. </p>\n<p>In short, establishing a further U.S. presence there will take years, so don’t expect any concrete developments to be unveiled next Friday morning. Still, Chevron’s existing Venezuela assets could be optimized to extract more “black gold” in the quarters ahead. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-bulls-gaining-steam-nbsp\">Bulls Gaining Steam </h3>\n<p>As for price action, XOM and CVX are up almost 9% so far in 2026, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by more than eight percentage points. Momentum is solid, and income investors may be drawn to those stocks’ dividend yields (3.2% for XOM and 4.1% for CVX). </p>\n<p>Elsewhere, the <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/blog/The-Q1-Investor-Conference-Calendar-What-Matters-and-Why\">energy conference tour</a> heats up in March. Three notable events take place toward the end of Q1:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>March 2: Jefferies Flagship Power, Utilities, Clean Energy &amp; Energy Conference</li>\n<li>March 16: Piper Sandler 26th Annual Energy Conference</li>\n<li>March 23: CERA Week</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-bottom-line\">The Bottom Line</h3>\n<p>The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) leads among the 11 S&amp;P 500 sector funds. Up more than 6% on the year, shares of oil &amp; gas companies have offered decent diversification amid a very busy January on the macro front. The coming days will bring company-specific story updates, including an unusual Sunday-night earnings event. Next week’s XOM and CVX Q4 reports will be particularly revealing, given early-year geopolitical developments.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sources:</em></strong></p>\n<p>1 BKR, ORATS, January 21, 2026,  https://dashboard.orats.com/analyzer/earnings?ticker=BKR</p>\n</div>",

Not much to write home about, yeah? </p>\n<p>Indeed, it has been a hectic beginning to 2026. Amid so many macro curveballs and noise stemming from the White House, it has also been busy at the corporate level.</p><!-- /126710690/ims/SeeItMarket/In_text_1 -->\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-conference-season-roundup\">Conference Season Roundup</h3>\n<p>CEOs are not only tiptoeing around presidential comments and social media posts, but they are also presenting strategy updates and industry outlooks at <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/blog/The-Q1-Investor-Conference-Calendar-What-Matters-and-Why\">major corporate conferences</a> this week and throughout the month.</p>\n<p>CES was reinvigorating for consumer tech last week, and right now we have data out from the National Retail Federation’s Retail’s Big Show happening in New York City, the ICR 29th Annual Conference in Orlando, and perhaps the most widely followed gathering of all—the JP Morgan 44th Annual Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-earnings-season-enters-the-chat\">Earnings Season Enters the Chat</h3>\n<p>Amid the slide decks and fireside chats, Q4 earnings reports are hitting left and right. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and The Bank of New York Mellon (BK) posted results this past Tuesday, followed by Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup earlier today. </p>\n<p>Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) serve up revenue and profit figures on Thursday morning. The season broadens out to other cyclical sectors next week before big tech and AI snag the spotlight later in January.</p>\n<p>Get the full lowdown in our <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/blog/q4-2025-earnings-preview\">Q4 earnings season preview</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Hello Data, My Old Friend</strong></p>\n<p>Rounding out the triad of volatility catalysts this week? Economic data. </p>\n<p>Traders are back in the swing of things following the longest U.S. government shutdown in history—the December jobs report printed last Friday, CPI hit this past Tuesday, PPI and Retail Sales were released this morning, while manufacturing and housing data arrive Friday. With a chunk of domestic macro data in the bag, investors have a clearer view of the backdrop as we head into the heart of the reporting season.</p>\n<p>According to our <a href=\"https://www.wallstreethorizon.com/economic-calendar\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Economic Calendar</a>, the New York Empire Manufacturing Index will be published tomorrow morning. This one often flies under the radar, but it may be worth putting under the microscope. It’s a January survey data point, providing a timely vibes check on the real economy in the Northeast region. Paired with the Philly Fed Business Outlook, released at the same time, market participants will get a pulse on optimism (or lack thereof) amid a soft labor environment and ongoing inflation concerns.</p>\n<p>Going forward, business tax breaks could buoy corner-office sentiment, while record-high tax refund checks hitting consumers’ accounts starting next month just might improve households’ feelings on the economy… so long as jobs don’t fall off a cliff.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-labor-market-stalemate-continues\">The Labor Market Stalemate Continues</h3>\n<p>Speaking of the employment situation, Initial Jobless Claims come at the usual time on Thursday, also before the bell. The “no-hire, no-fire” labor market presses on, so we expect the number of first-time applications for unemployment benefits to remain low. Continuing Claims, always published an extra week in arrears, could still be noisy from the holidays.</p>\n<p>As it stands, the December nonfarm payrolls report was sort of a choose-your-own-adventure. The headline 50,000 jobs gain was below Street estimates, but the unemployment rate dropped 16 basis points to 4.375% from November. The bears can point to steep downward revisions to October–November payrolls, while the bulls hang their hats on broader labor data (including private-sector reports), possibly suggesting the softening employment trend is at or near its trough. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-fed-wait-and-see-nbsp\">The Fed: Wait and See </h3>\n<p>What does it all mean for investors? Combine the December job numbers, inflation updates, and Retail Sales gain, and we get a recipe for the Fed to possibly stay on hold through Powell’s term as Fed chief (May 15). The Treasury market sees about two quarter-point rate cuts from now to year-end, and there will undoubtedly be added pressure on whoever the new chair is to curry enough favor among the 11 other FOMC voting members for a June cut.  </p>\n<p>The January 28 Fed interest rate decision will presumably come with extra fireworks, too. After Powell’s unprecedented direct video response to the federal subpoena last Sunday night, he will no doubt be probed about his thoughts and plans in light of renewed attacks from the White House. To be clear, President Trump denied knowledge of the Department of Justice’s inquiry. Through it all, both stock and bond volatility gauges are subdued. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-markets-shaking-it-all-off-nbsp\">Markets Shaking It All Off </h3>\n<p>In fact, markets have taken earnings, data, and policy intrigue in stride since the summer. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now near 50,000, the S&amp;P 500® is a stone’s throw from 7,000, and international indices press to record highs. The bond market seems to buy into the “TACO Trade” for the moment, but precious metals’ torrid rally underscores that all may not be well regarding fiscal and monetary matters.</p>\n<p>For now, focusing on actual data and CEO commentary might be the best approach.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-bottom-line\">The Bottom Line</h3>\n<p>The macro setting is being set for 2026. Official economic reports have rolled in as scheduled after a Q4 data vacuum. At the same time, a decent start to the earnings season reminds investors that companies can still deliver strong profit growth despite theatrics playing out in Washington, DC. Keep both the data deck and earnings calendar on your radar in the weeks ahead.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Will Crude Oil Supply Keep Price In Check?",
            "description": "<div class=\"td-post-content tagdiv-type\">\n<!-- image -->\n<!-- content -->\n<p>The price of oil is pretty much near a five-year low, in a world where <em>everything</em> costs much more than it used to.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, our cars don’t run on gold.</p><!-- /126710690/ims/SeeItMarket/In_text_1 -->\n\n<p>Before delving into the Canadian energy space and the developments in Venezuela, here’s a brief synopsis from our reading, research, and thinking on oil.</p>\n<p>First, there’s too much oil in the world as we move into 2026, with both supply and demand sharing the blame. Supply has increased thanks largely to a few mega projects ramping up (e.g., the facilities in Guyana’s Stabroek Block); U.S. production holding up even with less drilling; and, obviously, OPEC removing previous production cuts.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, demand growth has been flat and is much more complex as the relationship between economic growth and oil demand has softened. The rising share of EVs and hybrids is having a gradual impact on gasoline demand, perhaps magnified somewhat by the hybrid work-from-home evolution that has simply reduced miles driven. China, historically a driver of oil demand, has also seen flat demand over the past few years. This is partly due to increased EVs, but their real estate crisis has likely been more impactful. Construction activity is a heavy user of oil.</p>\n<p>On the positive side, other emerging markets are seeing rising demand, most notably India and Indonesia. Air travel is expanding, and while planes are more fuel efficient, this is a positive demand. Petrochemicals as feedstocks are also becoming the most impactful demand factor.</p>\n<p>Add this all up, plus a dozen factors not listed, and we have too much oil. The world knows this, the market knows this, the forward energy curve knows this, and hence oil is trading where it was five years ago.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-so-what-happens-next\">So what happens next?</h2>\n<p>We’re contrarian by nature, so when everyone is saying the same thing, we become interested. Currently, oil has a record number of speculative shorts or bearish bets. Often at extremes, this is a very good contrarian indicator.</p>\n<p>Near-term bounce potential aside, what about that surplus?</p>\n\n<p>On the demand side, there are a few factors that may prove the broader consensus wrong. The EV/hybrid rising adoption trend will continue, but it may be moderating somewhat based on subsidy reductions and fewer announcements from auto manufacturers. And while work-from-home trends are sticky, the gradual trend is<br/>pointing toward more days in the office.</p>\n<p>The bigger lift may come from developing economies. China’s real estate crisis is not over, but it’s starting to improve. And the economic momentum across the broader developing economies appears strong. All this may help firm up the demand side of the equation. We would add the caveat that if an economic slowdown manifests, which isn’t really in anyone’s forecast, all bets are off. That’s always a risk though.</p>\n<p>Supply is a bit more encouraging as well. There have been very few large projects started in the past number of years, and this may start to help on the supply side. Add to this the fact that U.S. production growth optimism is falling, and drilled uncompleted wells (DUCs) are at historical lows as the extended period of lowish oil prices has reduced drilling activity.</p>\n<p>Based on the first chart, the surplus is already set to moderate somewhat in 2026 from the second half of 2025 (green bars are smaller).<strong> If a few of the above variations develop, perhaps the market is a little too bearish on oil.</strong></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Venezuela situation</h2>\n<p>We could write multiple editions of Ethos on everything that is still unknown about this evolving situation. On the surface, Venezuela still has huge reserves of heavy oil, which is primarily what we have in Canada, so it’s a direct competitor as a key feedstock for U.S. refiners. And before Venezuela gradually nationalized its energy assets a few decades ago, it produced three million barrels per day. Today, that figure sits at less than one million, with most exports going to China before last week’s events. As Venezuela’s exports fell, Canada and Mexico filled the void.</p>\n\n<p>Will U.S. energy giants jump back in with investments, given their previous experiences? Some are still owed billions from Venezuela for seized assets. The structure of the fields and the status of infrastructure and port facilities are big variables in any capex required to start improving production. Companies remember past experiences and what can happen when new leadership takes hold, whether in Venezuela or in the U.S. Even the ways in which the Venezuelan government evolves in the near term are a big unknown.</p>\n<p>Huge reserves with low cash costs are attractive. But there are likely additional costs from importing diluent, upgrading, transportation inefficiencies, and a history of theft. Bloomberg New Energy estimates break-even costs just under $40/bbl, roughly the same as in-situ oil sands. The timing of the production ramp is also pretty wide: most are clustering around two to five years.</p>\n<p>Increasing production from Venezuela would put pressure on differentials, a negative for Canadian energy names. It’s worth noting that this production may start coming online when the world needs more oil, assuming the global surplus fades. If two million barrels of production hit the market today … yikes. If it happens in 2027–2029, it likely won’t be as bad.</p>\n<p>At the very least, this should encourage policymakers in Canada to push harder for infrastructure to help reach new markets for our energy resources. We don’t think it is a coincidence that Prime Minister Mark Carney is visiting China shortly. Once Venezuelan oil shipments were curtailed a few weeks ago, China began quoting more Canadian oil for import.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>We believe it’s a bit premature to take oil headlines at face value and make broad-based assumptions or guesses. Venezuelan developments add a smidge more risk, but at this point, we wouldn’t overreact and would view equity weakness as an opportunity. But we could see some weakness from a few factors:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Global energy demand is seasonally weak during Q1; this may exacerbate talk around the size of the current global surplus.</li>\n<li>The Venezuelan situation may embolden the U.S. administration to be ‘extra prickly’ during the U.S.-Mexico-Canda Agreement (USMCA) renewal negotiations, which could weigh on equities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the meantime, we believe in patiently and comfortably holding pre-existing positions, clipping dividends, and hoping the market overreacts.</p>\n</div>",
