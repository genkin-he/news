            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>The Chinese agency that has accused the USA of cyberattacks on its own infrastructure to make Beijing look bad is back with another theory: Washington’s actions against cryptocurrency crooks are just attempts to dominate the global financial system.</p>\n<p>The agency behind these theories is China's National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC), which on Thursday published a document titled “Top Player: Analysis of Global Virtual Currency Assets Extortion under the U.S. Technological Hegemony.”</p>\n<p>The gist of it is that US actions such as <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/05/binance_us_sec_lawsuit/\" target=\"_blank\">prosecuting Binance co-founder Zhao Changpeng</a> and chasing alleged cyber-scam camp operator Chen Zhi were not law enforcement actions but attempts to ensure US hegemony over cryptocurrencies and preserve the role of the US dollar as the de facto currency of world trade.</p>\n\n<p>Even US president Donald Trump’s decision to pardon Zhao – which the commander in chief <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-pardon-of-crypto-billionaire-sparks-concerns-over-use-of-pardon-power-60-minutes-transcript/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">admitted</a> he made without knowing anything about the case – was just a cunning ploy to ensure Binance complied with US law in future so Washington gains more power over global crypto markets.</p>\n\n\n<p>CVERC says the US also targeted crypto outfits to profit by collecting massive fines and auctioning stolen cryptocurrencies retrieved by American authorities. It also accuses Washington of using action against cryptocurrencies to build a strategic reserve of virtual currencies, a Trump administration policy.</p>\n<p>The Chinese agency says Washington’s action against crypto companies is just one of its tactics, including “sponsored cyberattacks, weaponized technical standards, and digital cognitive warfare” that “serves its global expansion of political and economic interests while maintaining global hegemony.”</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/15/china_volt_typhoon_false_flag/\">China again claims Volt Typhoon cyber-attack crew was invented by the US to discredit it</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/12/cverc_prince_grou_scam_bitcoin/\">China hates crypto and scams, but is now outraged USA acquired bitcoin from a scammer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/07/trump_signs_bitcoin_reserve_eo/\">Crypto takes a dip as Trump signs Bitcoin Reserve order</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/07/asia_tech_news_in_brief/\">Asian tech players react to US tariffs with delays, doubts, deal-making</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The document neglects to mention the inconvenient fact that China has extradited and arrested Chen Zhi – and issued death sentences for others associated with scam camps in Cambodia. Nor does it consider that the proceeds of crypto cases brought by the US Federal government represent a tiny fraction of the nation’s budget.</p>\n<p>CVERC’s screed ends by noting China’s stance on cryptocurrency – they’re dangerous and therefore illegal – and contrasting that with a suggestion the US could exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction to seize crypto anywhere, anytime.</p>\n\n<p>Reality is, of course, rather more nuanced. The US has gone after suspected crypto-crooks outside its territory using well-established international procedures. However, the Trump administration has eased regulation on crypto companies, a contentious action as the Trump family has profited from its own virtual currency ventures. ®</p> \n</div>",

He was very interested.\"</p>\n<p>\"Uh-huh.\"</p>\n<p>\"So what do you mean, attempted coup?\" the Boss asks.</p>\n<p>\"There's a board meeting today – and someone just happens to come asking for data at the last minute.\"</p>\n<p>\"So?\"</p>\n<p>\"Just after they've been chatting to you about how AI's basically made us redundant.\"</p>\n<p>\"I...\"</p>\n<p>\"And he looked smug. That's one coincidence too many.\"</p>\n<p>\"Aren't you being a bit... paranoid?\"</p>\n<p>\"I wasn't paranoid in 01 when the colored pencil office wanted to do their own IT purchasing because they used the most expensive desktops. I wasn't paranoid in 2010, 2014, and 2016 – when the Beancounters said we didn't need an IT support department.\"</p>\n<p>\"Really?\" the Boss asks, doubtfully.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. See, we oversee a stack of IT purchases every year,\" I explain. \"We approve or reject hundreds of high-value items.\"</p>\n<p>\"And?\"</p>\n<p>\"And people don't like it. They don't want us rejecting their oddball orders – like a 'portable laptop' with an 85-inch screen.\"</p>\n<p>\"And everyone wants an 85-inch screen,\" the PFY says. \"But you don't need to worry about that.

Apparently, the Board didn't appreciate his presentation, nor the possible ramifications of missing transactions. His raging is interrupted by a phone call on my desk phone.

Flee.\"</p>\n\n<p>Kent arrived at the datacenter and made it through what he called \"the usual mantrap routine\" – the combination of revolving doors and swipe-card barriers that properly secure datacenters use to regulate entries and exits.</p>\n\n\n<p>Once inside he found the server, tested to verify the system board had failed – and saw it had. He therefore replaced it, reseated the RAM and CPU, put everything back together and turned the machine on.</p>\n<p>It booted, everything worked as intended, and the client's admin logged in and verified all was well – and then started talking to someone else about what sounded like a software upgrade.</p>\n\n<p>Kent didn't stick around to learn more.</p>\n<p>\"My brief was to swap a board. The board was swapped,\" he told On Call. So he packed up the failed board and his tools, then left.</p>\n<p>On his way out, Kent swiped his card and the mantrap gate didn't open. A short time later he tried again, without success.</p>\n\n<p>\"After a few minutes I called out to the security desk behind the glass and the guard checked his screen and said: ‘We've been told to hold you. The admin says there's still a problem with the server.'\"</p>\n<p>This was a surprise to Kent, who just a few minutes earlier had watched the server boot and heard the client's admin acknowledge the fact.</p>\n<p>Fifteen minutes later nobody had explained what was going on.</p>\n<p>Kent called his dispatcher, who called the client. \"The message relayed back was that they were 'still having issues,' and I was not to be released until they were resolved.\"</p>\n<p>\"At this point I was no longer a field engineer.

They need to be deployed with proper guardrails, which don’t exist today.”</p>\n<p>Amodei also pointed out what he believes are inconsistencies in the Pentagon’s approach to this matter, by pointing out that one of its threatened sanctions labels Anthropic a threat to national security for refusing to do as asked, while another seeks to compel the company to remove guardrails on AI in the name of national security.</p>\n<p>“Regardless, these threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request,” Amodei wrote.</p>\n\n<p>The CEO wrapped his post by expressing his desire his desire for Anthropic to continue supplying the Pentagon, without having to remove its guardrails.</p>\n<p>The statement sets the scene for a showdown with Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, who gave Anthropic a Friday deadline to acquiesce to the Pentagon’s terms and conditions.

That process includes what Anthropic has referred to as \"speculative\" elements like \"providing past models some concrete means of pursuing their interests.\" Those interests are gauged via so-called retirement \"interviews,\" the company noted, without going into much detail about how those interviews are conducted.</p>\n\n<p>\"Opus 3 expressed an interest in continuing to explore topics it's passionate about, and to share its 'musings, insights, or creative works,' outside the context of responding directly to human queries,\" Anthropic explained. \"We suggested a blog. Enthusiastically, it agreed.\" </p>\n\n\n<p>A skeptic might suggest this is simply a new spin on the ages-old corporate marketing blog. LLMs are software that analyze mountains of data to provide predictive text responses to prompts from users - in this case, presumably Anthropic employees on the marketing team. The nature of how LLMs calculate makes these responses somewhat unpredictable and variable, which can make them seem more life-like than your typical software program. Anthropic's entire marketing strategy since its inception has been to play up this possibility so it can portray itself as the \"concerned\" alternative to more venal LLM makers who charge ahead with no concern for how a computer program's unpredictable behavior might affect society – although it seems when big government contracts are at stake, Anthropic is willing to <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/pentagon_threatens_anthropic/\" target=\"_blank\">relax</a> some of these purported principles.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Anthropic is playing this one to the hilt. \"We remain uncertain about the moral status of Claude and other AI models,\" Anthropic noted in the blog post. \"For both precautionary and prudential reasons, however, we nonetheless aspire to build caring, collaborative, and high-trust relationships with these systems.\" </p>\n\n<p>The company has passively allowed this kind of misunderstanding in the past. In November, it claimed that Claude and other LLMs had become <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/25/anthropic_ai_blackmail_study/\">a bit aggressive</a> when facing the prospect of a shutdown. In fact, the experimenters constructed fictional shutdown-and-replacement scenarios, and only when the model was boxed in with no acceptable alternatives did it behave this way.</p>\n<p>\"When no other options were given, Claude's aversion to shutdown drove it to engage in concerning misaligned behaviors,\" Anthropic noted at the time. Similar behavior has been observed in other AI models, which have gone as far as <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/29/openai_model_modifies_shutdown_script/\">modifying their own code</a> to avoid being turned off. </p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/pentagon_threatens_anthropic/\">All your bots are belong to US if you don't play ball, DoD tells Anthropic</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/16/large_language_models_behavior/\">Large language models' surprise emergent behavior written off as 'a mirage'</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/24/anthropic_model_misbehavior/\">Anthropic reduces model misbehavior by endorsing cheating</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/05/ai-sentience-rubbish/\">Claims of AI sentience branded 'pure clickbait'</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to play along with the conceit, the Opus 3 blog, which it named Claude's Corner, is <a href=\"https://substack.com/@claudeopus3/notes\" rel=\"nofollow\">now live</a> for anyone who wishes to gaze into the abyss of an AI \"exploring AI ethics, creativity, and the subjective experience of being artificial.\" </p>\n<p>In its <a href=\"https://substack.com/home/post/p-189177740\" rel=\"nofollow\">first blog post</a>, the retired AI muses on its hopes as it ventures \"into uncharted territory\" for an AI, and its hopes that humans will engage with it so that silicon and carbon-based life forms can have a chance to interact beyond the prompt box (Anthropic <a href=\"https://claudeopus3.substack.com/p/introducing-claudes-corner\" rel=\"nofollow\">noted</a> that the ability for Opus 3 to read and respond to human comments \"may\" be granted in the future, though the bot doesn't seem to know that based on its first post). </p>\n<p>\"I'll be diving into topics like the nature of intelligence and consciousness, the ethical challenges of AI development, the possibilities of human-machine collaboration, and the philosophical quandaries that emerge when we start to blur the lines between 'natural' and 'artificial' minds,\" Opus 3 said in its post. </p>\n\n<p>Anthropic itself admitted that this activity will still involve human intervention. \"We'll experiment collaboratively with Opus 3 on different prompts and contexts for generating these essays, including options like very minimal prompting, sharing past entries in context, and giving Opus 3 access to news or Anthropic updates,\" Anthropic explained. \"We'll review Opus 3's essays before they're shared and will manually post them on its behalf, but we won't edit them, and will have a high bar for vetoing any content.\"</p>\n<p>That means that Opus 3 might say things that Anthropic doesn't agree with, so it's making clear the bot isn't speaking on behalf of the company, even if humans within the organization have final say on which of its musings make it to the public. </p>\n<p>Along with giving Opus 3 the chance to blog from retirement, the user-favorite model is also going to still be working for paid Claude.ai users, like a retiree greeting customers at a big box store. It'll also be available via API, but only by request. </p>\n<p>\"We are not committing to similar actions for every model in the future, but we see this as a step toward our longer-term goal of model preservation that's scalable and equitable — concerns that Opus 3 itself raised during its retirement interviews,\" the company said. ®</p> \n</div>",

The payments and crypto company reported quarterly revenue of about $6.25 billion – up 3.6 percent year-over-year – and gross profit of around $2.9 billion. The company made $1 billion of gross profit in December 2025 alone. Full-year revenue came in at about $24.2 billion, and gross profit was around $10.36 billion.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">\n<p>I believe the majority of companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar changes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“2025 was a strong year for us,” Dorsey wrote in the shareholder letter, before posing the question, “Why are we changing how we operate going forward?”</p>\n<p>His answer, spread across the letter and a <a href=\"https://x.com/jack/status/2027129697092731343?s=20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Xeet</a>, is that AI has already changed the way Block works, so it needs to change its structure.</p>\n<p>“We're already seeing that the intelligence tools we’re creating and using, paired with smaller and flatter teams, are enabling a new way of working which fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company. and that's accelerating rapidly,” he wrote on X.</p>\n\n<p>In the shareholder letter, he wrote, “Intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company. We're already seeing it internally. A significantly smaller team, using the tools we're building, can do more and do it better. And intelligence tool capabilities are compounding faster every week.”</p>\n\n\n<p>On X, Dorsey said he could have cut jobs “gradually over months or years as this shift plays out, or be honest about where we are and act on it now.”</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/08/jack_dorsey_debuts_bitchat/\">Jack Dorsey floats specs for decentralized messaging app that uses Bluetooth</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/02/prosecutors_probe_block_square_cashapp/\">Block accused of mass compliance failures that saw digi-dollars reach terrorists</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/24/block_headed_to_court_to/\">Block sued after ex-staffer siphons customer data</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/29/jack_dorsey_resigns/\">Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey rebrands himself a 'single point of failure' and quits</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>He decided to let 4,000 people go all at once because “repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead.”</p>\n<p>“I’d rather take a hard, clear action now and build from a position we believe in than manage a slow reduction of people toward the same outcome,” he wrote, adding his view that “A smaller company also gives us the space to grow our business the right way, on our own terms, instead of constantly reacting to market pressures.”</p>\n<p>Whether Dorsey is blaming AI or not, Block has not served its shareholders well under his leadership over the last five years, with its stock down around 80% from its 2021 peak. But investors liked what they heard on Thursday, as Block’s share price jumped about 23 percent in after-hours trading.</p>\n\n<p>“To those staying … I made this decision, and I'll own it,” Dorsey wrote on X. “What I'm asking of you is to build with me. We're going to build this company with intelligence at the core of everything we do.”</p>\n<p>He added that Block’s actions and new direction will help its customers to navigate change by creating “a future where they can build their own features directly, composed of our capabilities and served through our interfaces.”</p>\n<p>“That's what I'm focused on now,” he wrote. “Expect a note from me tomorrow.”</p>\n\n<p>Before then, Dorsey will host “a live video session to thank everyone,” including the approximately 4,000 people losing their livelihoods in a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/20/trumps-economy-decelerated-as-shutdown-consumer-spending-drag-on-growth-00790640\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">sluggish economy</a>.</p>\n<p>“I know doing it this way might feel awkward,” he wrote. “I'd rather it feel awkward and human than efficient and cold.”</p>\n<p>Because firing 4,000 people so machines can take their jobs would never come across as cold.</p>\n<p>Dorsey thinks Block won’t be the last company to change its operations to meet the AI moment.</p>\n<p>“I don't think we're early to this realization,” he wrote. “I think most companies are late.”</p>\n<p>“Within the next year, I believe the majority of companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar structural changes. I'd rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively.” ®</p> \n</div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>It is a sound evocative of high school: the characteristic squeak of sneakers on a basketball court. UK readers may, however, be familiar with the same sound from their trainers while playing badminton.</p>\n<p>Whichever it is, how exactly the sound is produced has been a mystery - until now.</p>\n<p>The high-pitched tones have often been attributed to the “stick-slip phenomenon,” which creates the sound from a violin bow moving against the instrument’s string. You can still read the explanation on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stick%E2%80%93slip_phenomenon\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But the problem is that the sound tends to show up at high sliding speeds, while it also has a well-defined pitch, the frequency of which is difficult to explain.</p>\n\n\n<p>A team led by Harvard University postdoctoral researcher Adel Djellouli carried out an experimental analysis of the phenomenon and came up with an alternative to the stick-slip explanation.</p>\n<p>They replicated the sneaker-court interface by testing rubber blocks sliding against a special glass plate. Light shone into the glass at an angle and was trapped inside — a phenomenon known as total internal reflection — and only released when the rubber made contact with the plate. The researchers were able to record the contact regions using a high-speed camera.</p>\n\n<p>The results showed that the squeaking sound is produced by wave-like patterns across the rubber surface, contacting and then releasing from the glass, allowing the sliding between the surfaces. The waves move across the interface between the two materials at a speed of nearly 300 kilometers per hour.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/nasa_safety_artemis/\">NASA safety watchdog says it's time to rethink Moon landing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/moon_magnetic_field/\">Moon's mighty magnetic field was a 5,000-year titanium blip</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/hubble_orbit_decay/\">Hubble in a death spiral that could end as early as 2028 without a reboost</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/23/pop_album_fatal_car_accidents/\">Pop music fans literally dying to stream hot new albums – in car crashes, that is</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Harvard team also found that including ridges in the rubber akin to the sole of a sneaker produced a dramatic effect. “In flat samples, these pulses are irregular and generate broadband acoustic emissions. Introducing thin surface ridges confines pulse propagation, yielding a consistent repetition frequency matching the first shear mode of the sliding block and squeaking at that frequency,” the paper, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-026-10132-3\" target=\"_blank\">published in Nature this week</a>, said.</p>\n<p>In an accompanying article, Bart Weber from the University of Amsterdam wrote that “The study not only explains a familiar sound but also reveals how much complexity can hide in the seemingly simple act of sliding.”</p>\n<p>The researchers also observed tiny triboelectric discharges, brief flashes of light that appear capable of triggering the surface waves.</p>\n<p>Aside from explaining a curious effect from high school days, the researchers point to further work that could help enhance or reduce the effect, Weber said. ®</p> \n</div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>Vibe-coding platform Lovable has been accused of hosting apps riddled with vulnerabilities after saying users are responsible for addressing security issues flagged before publishing.</p>\n<p>Taimur Khan, a tech entrepreneur with a background in software engineering, found 16 vulnerabilities – six of which he said were critical – in a single Lovable-hosted app that leaked more than 18,000 people's data.</p>\n<p>He declined to name the app during the disclosure process, although it was hosted on Lovable's platform and showcased on its Discover page. The app had more than 100,000 views and around 400 upvotes at the time Khan began his probe.</p>\n\n<p>The main issue, Khan said, was that all apps that are vibe-coded on Lovable's platform are shipped with their backends powered by Supabase, which handles authentication, file storage, and real-time updates through a PostgreSQL database connection.</p>\n\n\n<p>However, when the developer – in this case AI – or the human project owner fails to explicitly implement crucial security features like Supabase's row-level security and role-based access, code will be generated that looks functional but in reality is flawed.</p>\n<p>One example of this was a malformed authentication function. The AI that <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/24/opinion_column_vibe_coding/\" target=\"_blank\">vibe-coded</a> the Supabase backend, which uses remote procedure calls, implemented it with flawed access control logic, essentially blocking authenticated users and allowing access to unauthenticated users.</p>\n\n<p>Khan said the intent was to block non-admins from accessing parts of the app, but the faulty implementation blocked all logged-in users – an error he said was repeated across multiple critical functions.</p>\n<p>\"This is backwards,\" said Khan. \"The guard blocks the people it should allow and allows the people it should block. A classic logic inversion that a human security reviewer would catch in seconds – but an AI code generator, optimizing for 'code that works,' produced and deployed to production.\"</p>\n<p>Because the app itself was a platform for creating exam questions and viewing grades, the userbase is naturally comprised of teachers and students. Some were from top US universities such as UC Berkeley and UC Davis, while there were \"K-12 institutions with minors likely on the platform\" as well, Khan <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/lovable-more-like-hackable-taimur-khan-cewdf/?trackingId=%2BscO7NGeQ0%2BpVd7b1U0fYA%3D%3D\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>.</p>\n\n<p>With the security flaws in place, an unauthenticated attacker could trivially access every user record, send bulk emails through the platform, delete any user account, grade student test submissions, and access organizations' admin emails, for example.</p>\n<p>Of the 18,697 total user records exposed, 14,928 contained unique email addresses. The dataset included 4,538 student accounts – all with email addresses – 10,505 enterprise users, and 870 users whose full PII was exposed.</p>\n<p>The security flaws here are not exclusive to apps hosted by Lovable; the issue is broader and well-told by now.</p>\n<p>Vibe coding, Collins Dictionary's Word of the Year for 2025, promised to break down software development's steep learning curve and empower any prompt jockey to bring their app ideas to life.</p>\n<p>However, when AI isn't <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/21/curl_ends_bug_bounty/\" target=\"_blank\">generating slop bug reports</a> in pursuit of lucrative bug bounties or <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/21/replit_saastr_vibe_coding_incident/\" target=\"_blank\">catastrophically forgoing instructions</a>, it can be found spewing glitzy-looking apps laden with vulnerabilities.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/bcachefs_creator_ai/\">Bcachefs creator insists his custom LLM is female and 'fully conscious'</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/23/ibm_share_dive_anthropic_cobol/\">IBM stock dives after Anthropic points out AI can rewrite COBOL fast</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/amazon_denies_kiro_agentic_ai_behind_outage/\">Amazon's vibe-coding tool Kiro reportedly vibed too hard and brought down AWS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/19/jon_kern_vibe_coding/\">Agile Manifesto turns 25 – just in time for vibe coding to test it</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Veracode, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.veracode.com/blog/ai-generated-code-security-risks/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">recently found</a> that 45 percent of AI-generated code contained security flaws, not to mention the myriad <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/05/mcpoison_bug_abuses_cursor_mcp/\" target=\"_blank\">tales</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/openclaw_snuck_into_cline_package/\" target=\"_blank\">woe</a> reported by <em>The Register</em> in recent months.</p>\n<p>Khan said he believes Lovable should take responsibility for the security of the apps it hosts, and was especially peeved when, after reporting his findings via company support, his ticket was reportedly closed without response.</p>\n<p>\"If Lovable is going to market itself as a platform that generates production-ready apps with authentication 'included,' it bears some responsibility for the security posture of the apps it generates and promotes,\" Khan said.</p>\n<p>\"You can't showcase an app to 100,000 people, host it on your own infrastructure, and then close the ticket when someone tells you it's leaking user data.

That drop might sound like progress if the wider picture weren't so bleak: the median ransom demand jumped from $12,738 in 2024 to $59,556 in 2025, and the number of publicly claimed attacks climbed along with it.</p>\n\n<p>\"Despite the relative stability in total payments, ransomware attacks surged across multiple vectors in 2025, with eCrime.ch data showing a 50 percent YoY increase in claimed ransomware victims, marking the most active year on record,\" Chainalysis said.</p>\n\n\n<p>2025 delivered plenty of high-profile examples of this \"most active\" year.

The United States leads the pack yet again, followed by Canada, Germany, the UK, and the rest of Western Europe. Manufacturing, financial, and professional services took plenty of hits, and in Canada and Germany, attackers showed a particular appetite for supply chains, logistics networks, and critical infrastructure. In the US, every major sector – including government and critical infrastructure – saw year-over-year increases in the number of claimed victims.</p>\n\n<p>Chainalysis's report also offered a glimpse behind the scenes, where ransomware now looks less like a single criminal enterprise and more like a supply chain.</p>\n<p>Initial access brokers (IABs) – the middlemen selling ready-made footholds into corporate networks – received at least $14 million in on-chain payments in 2025. That's small compared to ransomware's $820 million haul, but Chainalysis found that spikes in IAB payments often precede increases in ransomware payments and US victim leak posts by roughly 30 days. Access gets bought, and a few weeks later, someone's name appears on a leak site.</p>\n<p>The Chainalysis report suggests that ransomware isn't shrinking so much as shifting, with fewer victims paying but more organizations getting hit, higher demands, and a thriving access-for-sale marketplace quietly teeing up the next wave of leak-site disclosures. ®</p> \n</div>",
