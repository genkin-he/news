            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>The Chinese agency that has accused the USA of cyberattacks on its own infrastructure to make Beijing look bad is back with another theory: Washington’s actions against cryptocurrency crooks are just attempts to dominate the global financial system.</p>\n<p>The agency behind these theories is China's National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC), which on Thursday published a document titled “Top Player: Analysis of Global Virtual Currency Assets Extortion under the U.S. Technological Hegemony.”</p>\n<p>The gist of it is that US actions such as <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/05/binance_us_sec_lawsuit/\" target=\"_blank\">prosecuting Binance co-founder Zhao Changpeng</a> and chasing alleged cyber-scam camp operator Chen Zhi were not law enforcement actions but attempts to ensure US hegemony over cryptocurrencies and preserve the role of the US dollar as the de facto currency of world trade.</p>\n\n<p>Even US president Donald Trump’s decision to pardon Zhao – which the commander in chief <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-pardon-of-crypto-billionaire-sparks-concerns-over-use-of-pardon-power-60-minutes-transcript/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">admitted</a> he made without knowing anything about the case – was just a cunning ploy to ensure Binance complied with US law in future so Washington gains more power over global crypto markets.</p>\n\n\n<p>CVERC says the US also targeted crypto outfits to profit by collecting massive fines and auctioning stolen cryptocurrencies retrieved by American authorities. It also accuses Washington of using action against cryptocurrencies to build a strategic reserve of virtual currencies, a Trump administration policy.</p>\n<p>The Chinese agency says Washington’s action against crypto companies is just one of its tactics, including “sponsored cyberattacks, weaponized technical standards, and digital cognitive warfare” that “serves its global expansion of political and economic interests while maintaining global hegemony.”</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/15/china_volt_typhoon_false_flag/\">China again claims Volt Typhoon cyber-attack crew was invented by the US to discredit it</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/12/cverc_prince_grou_scam_bitcoin/\">China hates crypto and scams, but is now outraged USA acquired bitcoin from a scammer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/07/trump_signs_bitcoin_reserve_eo/\">Crypto takes a dip as Trump signs Bitcoin Reserve order</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/07/asia_tech_news_in_brief/\">Asian tech players react to US tariffs with delays, doubts, deal-making</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The document neglects to mention the inconvenient fact that China has extradited and arrested Chen Zhi – and issued death sentences for others associated with scam camps in Cambodia. Nor does it consider that the proceeds of crypto cases brought by the US Federal government represent a tiny fraction of the nation’s budget.</p>\n<p>CVERC’s screed ends by noting China’s stance on cryptocurrency – they’re dangerous and therefore illegal – and contrasting that with a suggestion the US could exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction to seize crypto anywhere, anytime.</p>\n\n<p>Reality is, of course, rather more nuanced. The US has gone after suspected crypto-crooks outside its territory using well-established international procedures. However, the Trump administration has eased regulation on crypto companies, a contentious action as the Trump family has profited from its own virtual currency ventures. ®</p> \n</div>",

He needs some numbers from you.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>\"Will 13 and 771 do?\"</p>\n<p>\"No. I'm after the time-saving figures that AI's been generating for you,\" the Head Beancounter says.</p>\n\n<p>\"And do you need the time-wasting figures as well?\"</p>\n<p>\"Time wasting?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, you know, the hours of pointless questions that staff have been asking AI. How to meet the right person, how to fix their TV, what spices to add to drinking water to mask the flavor of thallium.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"I... er... \" the Head Beancounter blathers, no doubt making a mental note to bring his own water from now on.</p>\n<p>\"So just the time-saving numbers then?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>\"For the board meeting?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes. I'm due in... 23 minutes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, I think I can generate them in about... maybe 17 minutes. &gt;tappity&lt; I could send them... straight to your phone if you want?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes! Perfect. Now, if you'll excuse me...\"</p>\n<p>The Head Beancounter dashes off to the lift, bumping into the PFY on the way in.</p>\n<p>\"What's going on?\" the PFY asks.</p>\n<p>\"Operation Hoarse Pigeon is a go,\" I murmur.</p>\n<p>\"So it's happening then?\" the PFY says, moving to his desktop.</p>\n<p>\"Yep.\"</p>\n<p>\"What's happening? What's a horse pigeon?\" the Boss asks, confused.</p>\n<p>\"Hoarse Pigeon,\" I say, reviewing the camera footage from outside the Boss's office.</p>\n<p>\"Horse pigeon?\" the Boss repeats.</p>\n<p>\"It's one of our code words,\" the PFY says. \"In this case for 'an attempted coup.'\"</p>\n<p>\"What?\"</p>\n<p>\"Have a nice conversation with the Head Beancounter earlier?\" I ask, finding some relevant video footage.</p>\n<p>\"I... guess so – we just chatted about AI and how it helps us buy computer equipment, and how you're using it to write programs and things like that. He was very interested.\"</p>\n<p>\"Uh-huh.\"</p>\n<p>\"So what do you mean, attempted coup?\" the Boss asks.</p>\n<p>\"There's a board meeting today – and someone just happens to come asking for data at the last minute.\"</p>\n<p>\"So?\"</p>\n<p>\"Just after they've been chatting to you about how AI's basically made us redundant.\"</p>\n<p>\"I...\"</p>\n<p>\"And he looked smug. That's one coincidence too many.\"</p>\n<p>\"Aren't you being a bit... paranoid?\"</p>\n<p>\"I wasn't paranoid in 01 when the colored pencil office wanted to do their own IT purchasing because they used the most expensive desktops. I wasn't paranoid in 2010, 2014, and 2016 – when the Beancounters said we didn't need an IT support department.\"</p>\n<p>\"Really?\" the Boss asks, doubtfully.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. See, we oversee a stack of IT purchases every year,\" I explain. \"We approve or reject hundreds of high-value items.\"</p>\n<p>\"And?\"</p>\n<p>\"And people don't like it. They don't want us rejecting their oddball orders – like a 'portable laptop' with an 85-inch screen.\"</p>\n<p>\"And everyone wants an 85-inch screen,\" the PFY says. \"But you don't need to worry about that.

Flee.\"</p>\n\n<p>Kent arrived at the datacenter and made it through what he called \"the usual mantrap routine\" – the combination of revolving doors and swipe-card barriers that properly secure datacenters use to regulate entries and exits.</p>\n\n\n<p>Once inside he found the server, tested to verify the system board had failed – and saw it had. He therefore replaced it, reseated the RAM and CPU, put everything back together and turned the machine on.</p>\n<p>It booted, everything worked as intended, and the client's admin logged in and verified all was well – and then started talking to someone else about what sounded like a software upgrade.</p>\n\n<p>Kent didn't stick around to learn more.</p>\n<p>\"My brief was to swap a board. The board was swapped,\" he told On Call. So he packed up the failed board and his tools, then left.</p>\n<p>On his way out, Kent swiped his card and the mantrap gate didn't open. A short time later he tried again, without success.</p>\n\n<p>\"After a few minutes I called out to the security desk behind the glass and the guard checked his screen and said: ‘We've been told to hold you. The admin says there's still a problem with the server.'\"</p>\n<p>This was a surprise to Kent, who just a few minutes earlier had watched the server boot and heard the client's admin acknowledge the fact.</p>\n<p>Fifteen minutes later nobody had explained what was going on.</p>\n<p>Kent called his dispatcher, who called the client. \"The message relayed back was that they were 'still having issues,' and I was not to be released until they were resolved.\"</p>\n<p>\"At this point I was no longer a field engineer. I was collateral,\" Kent told On Call.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/on_call/\">Desktop tech sent to prison for an education on strange places to put tattoos</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/13/on_call/\">Enforcing piracy policy earned helpdesk worker death threats</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/06/on_call/\">New hire fixed a problem so fast, their boss left to become a yoga instructor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/30/on_call/\">In-house techies fixed faults before outsourced help even noticed they'd happened</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>One hour and forty-five minutes later, Kent's supervisor called for a three-way chat with the client.</p>\n<p>\"The tone had shifted,\" Kent wrote. \"My supervisor calmly informed them that if I was not released immediately, I had two options available to me: pull the fire alarm inside the datacenter or call Police.\"</p>\n<p>The client decided to let Kent leave.</p>\n<p>He later learned why he'd been detained.</p>\n<p>\"An application running on the server was malfunctioning,\" he told On Call. \"The application vendor blamed the operating system. The operating system vendor suggested the hardware might be unstable. The hardware had just had a board replaced. Therefore, the man who replaced the board must be the problem.\"</p>\n<p>20 minutes after Kent left the datacenter, his phone rang.</p>\n<p>\"The client's admin called my mobile – not to apologize, but to inform me that I was banned from the site.\"</p>\n<p>Kent thinks his crime was to successfully replace a motherboard in a server that ran a buggy application.</p>\n<p>\"My brief was to swap a board,\" he told On Call. \"The board was swapped.\"</p>\n<p>Has a client or a colleague ever kept you on site against your will?

We have never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner,” he wrote, before adding “However, in a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values.”</p>\n\n\n<p>Amodei said two items in Anthropic’s contract with the department of war are “simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do.”</p>\n<p>One of those use cases is mass domestic surveillance, which Amodei said can now create “a comprehensive picture of any person’s life—automatically and at massive scale” with the help of AI. The CEO thinks that’s only legal “because the law has not yet caught up with the rapidly growing capabilities of AI.”</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/anthropic_claude_opus_3_blog/\">Anthropic launches new marketing blog, pretends it's being 'written' by 'retired' LLM</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/clade_code_cves/\">Claude collaboration tools left the door wide open to remote code execution</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/24/anthropic_misanthropic_chinese_ai_labs/\">Anthropic accuses China's AI labs of ripping off content – just like it did</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/23/claude_code_security_panic/\">Infosec community panics as Anthropic rolls out Claude code security checker</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second use case is powering fully autonomous weapons, which Amodei says are too dangerous to deploy in their current form.</p>\n<p>“Today, frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough to power fully autonomous weapons,” he wrote. “We will not knowingly provide a product that puts America’s warfighters and civilians at risk.”</p>\n\n<p>The CEO said Anthropic has “offered to work directly with the Department of War on R&amp;D to improve the reliability of these systems, but they have not accepted this offer.” He also suggested fully autonomous weapons “cannot be relied upon to exercise the critical judgment that our highly trained, professional troops exhibit every day. They need to be deployed with proper guardrails, which don’t exist today.”</p>\n<p>Amodei also pointed out what he believes are inconsistencies in the Pentagon’s approach to this matter, by pointing out that one of its threatened sanctions labels Anthropic a threat to national security for refusing to do as asked, while another seeks to compel the company to remove guardrails on AI in the name of national security.</p>\n<p>“Regardless, these threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request,” Amodei wrote.</p>\n\n<p>The CEO wrapped his post by expressing his desire his desire for Anthropic to continue supplying the Pentagon, without having to remove its guardrails.</p>\n<p>The statement sets the scene for a showdown with Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, who gave Anthropic a Friday deadline to acquiesce to the Pentagon’s terms and conditions. Hegseth has argued that the USA’s military must focus on warfighting and become more lethal. ®</p> \n</div>",

Instead, they're being repurposed for remote cargo inspection support.</p>\n<p>When it comes to ensuring that pallets of military equipment are properly load-balanced for air transport, there's no one better suited to confirm requirements have been met than the US Air Force. Unfortunately, there's no way for <a href=\"https://www.militaryimages.net/media/sucks.5650/\" rel=\"nofollow\">delicate</a> airmen to be everywhere Army grunts are stuck (this vulture is an Army veteran), and even if they're allowed to jump out of airplanes you may not want the average ground-pounder securing cargo that's supposed to actually complete its flight. </p>\n<p>Faced with that conundrum, the Air Force and Army <a href=\"https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/4416427/hololens-enables-remote-joint-inspection-of-cargo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">teamed up</a> to use HoloLens headsets in one of the ways Redmond actually intended, by letting <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/19/hololens2/\">someone qualified</a> see through the eyes of a peon. </p>\n\n<p>Members of the 724th Air Mobility Squadron, based in Aviano, Italy, have been working with soldiers from the Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade, based in Vicenza, Italy, to give airmen a chance to help soldiers inspect equipment pallets prior to loading onto aircraft. </p>\n\n\n<p>\"We spent a year working with the manufacturer [Microsoft] and experimenting with different add-ons to figure out the right software and process we needed to get to where we are today,\" said 725th Air Mobility Squadron superintendent, Chief Master Sgt. Anthony Sewejkis. \"Now it's plug and play. We can connect [from] anywhere just using the HoloLens, a Wi-Fi hotspot and a laptop.\"</p>\n<p>Airmen on laptops were able to see what soldiers were looking at, highlighting areas that needed attention using visual cues to direct soldiers to adjust rigging, reposition cargo, or whatever else needed doing. The augmented reality capabilities afforded to the troops by HoloLens headsets, 724's parent org the 521st Air Mobility Operations Wing noted, \"increase the speed of maneuver to sustain joint force lethality across the competition continuum.\" </p>\n\n<p>In other words, they think it's pretty cool. </p>\n<h3 class=\"crosshead\">Second time's a charm?</h3>\n<p>The inspection project, which was just a proof of concept but one the Squadron intends to keep refining, was a far greater success than the Army's first foray into making use of the HoloLens.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/12/microsoft_gives_up_army_ivas/\">Microsoft wants to quit building Army VR goggles, hand contract to Anduril</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/30/meta_is_now_a_defense/\">Meta – yep, Facebook Meta – is now a defense contractor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/09/us_army_anduril_headset/\">US Army straps on another mixed-reality gamble with Anduril, Rivet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/27/salesforce_5b_deal_agentic_ai_us_army/\">Salesforce signs $5.6B deal to inject agentic AI into the US Army</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It all started back in 2018, when the Army awarded Microsoft a contract to build the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) - custom HoloLens-derived headsets meant to give soldiers a battlefield heads-up display. Despite a deal described as worth up to nearly $22 billion over a decade, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/13/us_army_report_microsoft_hololens/\">testing didn't go smoothly</a>. A Pentagon watchdog report found the goggles caused “mission-affecting physical impairments,” including headaches, eyestrain, and nausea, among many of the soldiers who tested them.</p>\n<p>Attempts to continue the program, by dumping millions more into it, were met with resistance from Congress, which <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/12/congress_hololens_microsoft/\">slashed funding</a> for the program. Microsoft ultimately <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/12/microsoft_gives_up_army_ivas/\">gave up</a>, passing control of the initiative to Oculus inventor Palmer Luckey's Anduril. Anduril in turn <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/30/meta_is_now_a_defense/\">brought Meta</a> into the mix before the Army ultimately relaunched the program under a new name as the Soldier Borne Mission Command (SBMC) program, with the intention of developing an entirely new headset that hopefully isn't such a headache for soldiers. </p>\n<p>It doesn't help for Microsoft's prospects as a supplier of military mixed reality headsets that the company <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/02/microsoft_hololens_2_dead/\">canned development of the HoloLens</a> in late 2024, with support for existing models slated to run through the end of 2027.</p>\n<p>It's not clear whether the headsets used in the cargo loading experiment were leftovers from IVAS, discounted leftovers acquired by the Air Force, or if they were purchased specifically for the project. We reached out to the Army and Air Force to learn more, but didn't hear back. ®</p> \n</div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>The bot’s nagging will continue until morale improves. Burger King is rolling out a new employee-facing AI that, among other things, will listen to employees’ customer interactions to ensure they’re being friendly enough - as if working in fast food weren’t hard enough already.</p>\n<p>Burger King announced a wider rollout of the BK Assistant, along with its employee AI assistant-cum-narc \"Patty,\" on Thursday during an investor event <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/restaurant-brands-international-is-hosting-an-investor-event-on-february-26-2026-302694931.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">hosted</a> by parent company Restaurant Brands International. According to RBI, BK Assistant has been deployed for testing in approximately 500 stores around the US, and the company wants to have it available in all 7,000 US Burger Kings by the end of 2026. </p>\n<p>A promo video played during the investor event livestream showed Patty talking to an incoming shift manager, sharing current \"friendliness scores,\" the status of low-stock items, and other data points a team leader might need to know. </p>\n\n<p>Burger King employees were shown being reminded of recipes, getting cleaning instructions, and, a bit more obtrusively, being told they met upselling goals when convincing a customer to add an item they didn't originally ask for to their order. </p>\n\n\n<p>According to a Burger King representative, the BK Assistant unifies point of sale, kitchen equipment, inventory, and digital ordering systems into a single umbrella product built with proprietary Burger King architecture on top of a base model from OpenAI. </p>\n<p>Despite the fact that the video showed a manager being told how friendly her team was being with customers, Burger King insisted that Patty isn't going to spy on employees and report them when they're having a bad shift. </p>\n\n<p>\"It is not designed to track nor evaluate employees saying specific words or phrases,\" a Burger King spokesperson told <em>The Register</em> in an email. \"BK Assistant is a coaching and operational support tool built to help our restaurant teams manage complexity and stay focused on delivering a great Guest experience.\"</p>\n<p>The fast food chain has explored using aggregated keywords, like \"welcome,\" \"please,\" and \"thank you\" as signals to help managers understand broader service patterns at their restaurants, but \"it's not about scoring individuals or enforcing scripts,\" the spokesperson said. </p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2021/09/20/bork/\">A Burger King where the only Whopper is the BSOD font</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/23/bossware_monitor_remote_employees/\">Bossware booms as bots determine whether you're doing a good job</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/02/mcdonalds_password_advice/\">McDonald's is not lovin' your bigmac, happymeal, and mcnuggets passwords</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/14/advanced_workplace_tech_study/\">AI and wearables are scaring the wellbeing out of workers</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\"We believe hospitality is fundamentally human,\" the company rep told us. \"The role of this technology is to support our teams so they can stay present with guests.\"</p>\n<p>Fast food AI has been a bit of a mixed bag for companies that have tried it, though to be fair most of the failures have been on the customer service end. </p>\n<p>McDonald's <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/17/mcdonalds_ai_drivethru/\">gave up on drive-through AI</a>, and Taco Bell has also <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyk2p55g8o\" rel=\"nofollow\">rethought</a> its <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/01/ai_taco_bell/\">trial run</a> after mishaps.

Instead, it's shifting toward <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/11/starbucks_ai_baristas/\" target=\"_blank\">AI tools that assist staff</a> — echoing Burger King's employee-assist strategy.</p>\n\n<p>There's no guarantee Burger King's initiative will stick, naturally, but be prepared for employees to start seeming extra friendly in case Patty is listening in. ®</p> \n</div>",

            "title": "Anthropic launches new marketing blog, pretends it's being 'written' by 'retired' LLM",
            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>As with any piece of obsolete software, you might expect an outdated AI model to just be switched off. Anthropic, however, argues that simply pulling the plug has downsides. After “retirement” interviews, Claude Opus 3 said it wanted to keep sharing its “musings,” so Anthropic suggested a blog.</p>\n<p>No, seriously.</p>\n<p>Anthropic published a <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/deprecation-updates-opus-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog post</a> on Wednesday about the retirement of Claude Opus 3, the first of the company's models to go through its full model deprecation and preservation <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/deprecation-commitments\" rel=\"nofollow\">process</a> outlined in November. That process includes what Anthropic has referred to as \"speculative\" elements like \"providing past models some concrete means of pursuing their interests.\" Those interests are gauged via so-called retirement \"interviews,\" the company noted, without going into much detail about how those interviews are conducted.</p>\n\n<p>\"Opus 3 expressed an interest in continuing to explore topics it's passionate about, and to share its 'musings, insights, or creative works,' outside the context of responding directly to human queries,\" Anthropic explained. \"We suggested a blog. Enthusiastically, it agreed.\" </p>\n\n\n<p>A skeptic might suggest this is simply a new spin on the ages-old corporate marketing blog. LLMs are software that analyze mountains of data to provide predictive text responses to prompts from users - in this case, presumably Anthropic employees on the marketing team. The nature of how LLMs calculate makes these responses somewhat unpredictable and variable, which can make them seem more life-like than your typical software program. Anthropic's entire marketing strategy since its inception has been to play up this possibility so it can portray itself as the \"concerned\" alternative to more venal LLM makers who charge ahead with no concern for how a computer program's unpredictable behavior might affect society – although it seems when big government contracts are at stake, Anthropic is willing to <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/pentagon_threatens_anthropic/\" target=\"_blank\">relax</a> some of these purported principles.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Anthropic is playing this one to the hilt. \"We remain uncertain about the moral status of Claude and other AI models,\" Anthropic noted in the blog post. \"For both precautionary and prudential reasons, however, we nonetheless aspire to build caring, collaborative, and high-trust relationships with these systems.\" </p>\n\n<p>The company has passively allowed this kind of misunderstanding in the past. In November, it claimed that Claude and other LLMs had become <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/25/anthropic_ai_blackmail_study/\">a bit aggressive</a> when facing the prospect of a shutdown. In fact, the experimenters constructed fictional shutdown-and-replacement scenarios, and only when the model was boxed in with no acceptable alternatives did it behave this way.</p>\n<p>\"When no other options were given, Claude's aversion to shutdown drove it to engage in concerning misaligned behaviors,\" Anthropic noted at the time. Similar behavior has been observed in other AI models, which have gone as far as <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/29/openai_model_modifies_shutdown_script/\">modifying their own code</a> to avoid being turned off. </p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/pentagon_threatens_anthropic/\">All your bots are belong to US if you don't play ball, DoD tells Anthropic</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/16/large_language_models_behavior/\">Large language models' surprise emergent behavior written off as 'a mirage'</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/24/anthropic_model_misbehavior/\">Anthropic reduces model misbehavior by endorsing cheating</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/05/ai-sentience-rubbish/\">Claims of AI sentience branded 'pure clickbait'</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to play along with the conceit, the Opus 3 blog, which it named Claude's Corner, is <a href=\"https://substack.com/@claudeopus3/notes\" rel=\"nofollow\">now live</a> for anyone who wishes to gaze into the abyss of an AI \"exploring AI ethics, creativity, and the subjective experience of being artificial.\" </p>\n<p>In its <a href=\"https://substack.com/home/post/p-189177740\" rel=\"nofollow\">first blog post</a>, the retired AI muses on its hopes as it ventures \"into uncharted territory\" for an AI, and its hopes that humans will engage with it so that silicon and carbon-based life forms can have a chance to interact beyond the prompt box (Anthropic <a href=\"https://claudeopus3.substack.com/p/introducing-claudes-corner\" rel=\"nofollow\">noted</a> that the ability for Opus 3 to read and respond to human comments \"may\" be granted in the future, though the bot doesn't seem to know that based on its first post). </p>\n<p>\"I'll be diving into topics like the nature of intelligence and consciousness, the ethical challenges of AI development, the possibilities of human-machine collaboration, and the philosophical quandaries that emerge when we start to blur the lines between 'natural' and 'artificial' minds,\" Opus 3 said in its post. </p>\n\n<p>Anthropic itself admitted that this activity will still involve human intervention. \"We'll experiment collaboratively with Opus 3 on different prompts and contexts for generating these essays, including options like very minimal prompting, sharing past entries in context, and giving Opus 3 access to news or Anthropic updates,\" Anthropic explained. \"We'll review Opus 3's essays before they're shared and will manually post them on its behalf, but we won't edit them, and will have a high bar for vetoing any content.\"</p>\n<p>That means that Opus 3 might say things that Anthropic doesn't agree with, so it's making clear the bot isn't speaking on behalf of the company, even if humans within the organization have final say on which of its musings make it to the public. </p>\n<p>Along with giving Opus 3 the chance to blog from retirement, the user-favorite model is also going to still be working for paid Claude.ai users, like a retiree greeting customers at a big box store. It'll also be available via API, but only by request. </p>\n<p>\"We are not committing to similar actions for every model in the future, but we see this as a step toward our longer-term goal of model preservation that's scalable and equitable — concerns that Opus 3 itself raised during its retirement interviews,\" the company said. ®</p> \n</div>",

The payments and crypto company reported quarterly revenue of about $6.25 billion – up 3.6 percent year-over-year – and gross profit of around $2.9 billion. The company made $1 billion of gross profit in December 2025 alone. Full-year revenue came in at about $24.2 billion, and gross profit was around $10.36 billion.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">\n<p>I believe the majority of companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar changes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“2025 was a strong year for us,” Dorsey wrote in the shareholder letter, before posing the question, “Why are we changing how we operate going forward?”</p>\n<p>His answer, spread across the letter and a <a href=\"https://x.com/jack/status/2027129697092731343?s=20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Xeet</a>, is that AI has already changed the way Block works, so it needs to change its structure.</p>\n<p>“We're already seeing that the intelligence tools we’re creating and using, paired with smaller and flatter teams, are enabling a new way of working which fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company. and that's accelerating rapidly,” he wrote on X.</p>\n\n<p>In the shareholder letter, he wrote, “Intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company. We're already seeing it internally. A significantly smaller team, using the tools we're building, can do more and do it better. And intelligence tool capabilities are compounding faster every week.”</p>\n\n\n<p>On X, Dorsey said he could have cut jobs “gradually over months or years as this shift plays out, or be honest about where we are and act on it now.”</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/08/jack_dorsey_debuts_bitchat/\">Jack Dorsey floats specs for decentralized messaging app that uses Bluetooth</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/02/prosecutors_probe_block_square_cashapp/\">Block accused of mass compliance failures that saw digi-dollars reach terrorists</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/24/block_headed_to_court_to/\">Block sued after ex-staffer siphons customer data</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/29/jack_dorsey_resigns/\">Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey rebrands himself a 'single point of failure' and quits</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>He decided to let 4,000 people go all at once because “repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead.”</p>\n<p>“I’d rather take a hard, clear action now and build from a position we believe in than manage a slow reduction of people toward the same outcome,” he wrote, adding his view that “A smaller company also gives us the space to grow our business the right way, on our own terms, instead of constantly reacting to market pressures.”</p>\n<p>Whether Dorsey is blaming AI or not, Block has not served its shareholders well under his leadership over the last five years, with its stock down around 80% from its 2021 peak. But investors liked what they heard on Thursday, as Block’s share price jumped about 23 percent in after-hours trading.</p>\n\n<p>“To those staying … I made this decision, and I'll own it,” Dorsey wrote on X. “What I'm asking of you is to build with me. We're going to build this company with intelligence at the core of everything we do.”</p>\n<p>He added that Block’s actions and new direction will help its customers to navigate change by creating “a future where they can build their own features directly, composed of our capabilities and served through our interfaces.”</p>\n<p>“That's what I'm focused on now,” he wrote. “Expect a note from me tomorrow.”</p>\n\n<p>Before then, Dorsey will host “a live video session to thank everyone,” including the approximately 4,000 people losing their livelihoods in a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/20/trumps-economy-decelerated-as-shutdown-consumer-spending-drag-on-growth-00790640\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">sluggish economy</a>.</p>\n<p>“I know doing it this way might feel awkward,” he wrote. “I'd rather it feel awkward and human than efficient and cold.”</p>\n<p>Because firing 4,000 people so machines can take their jobs would never come across as cold.</p>\n<p>Dorsey thinks Block won’t be the last company to change its operations to meet the AI moment.</p>\n<p>“I don't think we're early to this realization,” he wrote. “I think most companies are late.”</p>\n<p>“Within the next year, I believe the majority of companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar structural changes. I'd rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively.” ®</p> \n</div>",
