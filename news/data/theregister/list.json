            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>The Chinese agency that has accused the USA of cyberattacks on its own infrastructure to make Beijing look bad is back with another theory: Washington’s actions against cryptocurrency crooks are just attempts to dominate the global financial system.</p>\n<p>The agency behind these theories is China's National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC), which on Thursday published a document titled “Top Player: Analysis of Global Virtual Currency Assets Extortion under the U.S. Technological Hegemony.”</p>\n<p>The gist of it is that US actions such as <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/05/binance_us_sec_lawsuit/\" target=\"_blank\">prosecuting Binance co-founder Zhao Changpeng</a> and chasing alleged cyber-scam camp operator Chen Zhi were not law enforcement actions but attempts to ensure US hegemony over cryptocurrencies and preserve the role of the US dollar as the de facto currency of world trade.</p>\n\n<p>Even US president Donald Trump’s decision to pardon Zhao – which the commander in chief <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-pardon-of-crypto-billionaire-sparks-concerns-over-use-of-pardon-power-60-minutes-transcript/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">admitted</a> he made without knowing anything about the case – was just a cunning ploy to ensure Binance complied with US law in future so Washington gains more power over global crypto markets.</p>\n\n\n<p>CVERC says the US also targeted crypto outfits to profit by collecting massive fines and auctioning stolen cryptocurrencies retrieved by American authorities. It also accuses Washington of using action against cryptocurrencies to build a strategic reserve of virtual currencies, a Trump administration policy.</p>\n<p>The Chinese agency says Washington’s action against crypto companies is just one of its tactics, including “sponsored cyberattacks, weaponized technical standards, and digital cognitive warfare” that “serves its global expansion of political and economic interests while maintaining global hegemony.”</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/15/china_volt_typhoon_false_flag/\">China again claims Volt Typhoon cyber-attack crew was invented by the US to discredit it</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/12/cverc_prince_grou_scam_bitcoin/\">China hates crypto and scams, but is now outraged USA acquired bitcoin from a scammer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/07/trump_signs_bitcoin_reserve_eo/\">Crypto takes a dip as Trump signs Bitcoin Reserve order</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/07/asia_tech_news_in_brief/\">Asian tech players react to US tariffs with delays, doubts, deal-making</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The document neglects to mention the inconvenient fact that China has extradited and arrested Chen Zhi – and issued death sentences for others associated with scam camps in Cambodia. Nor does it consider that the proceeds of crypto cases brought by the US Federal government represent a tiny fraction of the nation’s budget.</p>\n<p>CVERC’s screed ends by noting China’s stance on cryptocurrency – they’re dangerous and therefore illegal – and contrasting that with a suggestion the US could exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction to seize crypto anywhere, anytime.</p>\n\n<p>Reality is, of course, rather more nuanced. The US has gone after suspected crypto-crooks outside its territory using well-established international procedures. However, the Trump administration has eased regulation on crypto companies, a contentious action as the Trump family has profited from its own virtual currency ventures. ®</p> \n</div>",

He needs some numbers from you.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>\"Will 13 and 771 do?\"</p>\n<p>\"No. I'm after the time-saving figures that AI's been generating for you,\" the Head Beancounter says.</p>\n\n<p>\"And do you need the time-wasting figures as well?\"</p>\n<p>\"Time wasting?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, you know, the hours of pointless questions that staff have been asking AI. How to meet the right person, how to fix their TV, what spices to add to drinking water to mask the flavor of thallium.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"I... er... \" the Head Beancounter blathers, no doubt making a mental note to bring his own water from now on.</p>\n<p>\"So just the time-saving numbers then?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>\"For the board meeting?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes. I'm due in... 23 minutes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, I think I can generate them in about... maybe 17 minutes. &gt;tappity&lt; I could send them... straight to your phone if you want?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes! Perfect. Now, if you'll excuse me...\"</p>\n<p>The Head Beancounter dashes off to the lift, bumping into the PFY on the way in.</p>\n<p>\"What's going on?\" the PFY asks.</p>\n<p>\"Operation Hoarse Pigeon is a go,\" I murmur.</p>\n<p>\"So it's happening then?\" the PFY says, moving to his desktop.</p>\n<p>\"Yep.\"</p>\n<p>\"What's happening? What's a horse pigeon?\" the Boss asks, confused.</p>\n<p>\"Hoarse Pigeon,\" I say, reviewing the camera footage from outside the Boss's office.</p>\n<p>\"Horse pigeon?\" the Boss repeats.</p>\n<p>\"It's one of our code words,\" the PFY says. \"In this case for 'an attempted coup.'\"</p>\n<p>\"What?\"</p>\n<p>\"Have a nice conversation with the Head Beancounter earlier?\" I ask, finding some relevant video footage.</p>\n<p>\"I... guess so – we just chatted about AI and how it helps us buy computer equipment, and how you're using it to write programs and things like that. He was very interested.\"</p>\n<p>\"Uh-huh.\"</p>\n<p>\"So what do you mean, attempted coup?\" the Boss asks.</p>\n<p>\"There's a board meeting today – and someone just happens to come asking for data at the last minute.\"</p>\n<p>\"So?\"</p>\n<p>\"Just after they've been chatting to you about how AI's basically made us redundant.\"</p>\n<p>\"I...\"</p>\n<p>\"And he looked smug. That's one coincidence too many.\"</p>\n<p>\"Aren't you being a bit... paranoid?\"</p>\n<p>\"I wasn't paranoid in 01 when the colored pencil office wanted to do their own IT purchasing because they used the most expensive desktops. I wasn't paranoid in 2010, 2014, and 2016 – when the Beancounters said we didn't need an IT support department.\"</p>\n<p>\"Really?\" the Boss asks, doubtfully.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. See, we oversee a stack of IT purchases every year,\" I explain. \"We approve or reject hundreds of high-value items.\"</p>\n<p>\"And?\"</p>\n<p>\"And people don't like it. They don't want us rejecting their oddball orders – like a 'portable laptop' with an 85-inch screen.\"</p>\n<p>\"And everyone wants an 85-inch screen,\" the PFY says. \"But you don't need to worry about that.

Flee.\"</p>\n\n<p>Kent arrived at the datacenter and made it through what he called \"the usual mantrap routine\" – the combination of revolving doors and swipe-card barriers that properly secure datacenters use to regulate entries and exits.</p>\n\n\n<p>Once inside he found the server, tested to verify the system board had failed – and saw it had. He therefore replaced it, reseated the RAM and CPU, put everything back together and turned the machine on.</p>\n<p>It booted, everything worked as intended, and the client's admin logged in and verified all was well – and then started talking to someone else about what sounded like a software upgrade.</p>\n\n<p>Kent didn't stick around to learn more.</p>\n<p>\"My brief was to swap a board. The board was swapped,\" he told On Call. So he packed up the failed board and his tools, then left.</p>\n<p>On his way out, Kent swiped his card and the mantrap gate didn't open. A short time later he tried again, without success.</p>\n\n<p>\"After a few minutes I called out to the security desk behind the glass and the guard checked his screen and said: ‘We've been told to hold you. The admin says there's still a problem with the server.'\"</p>\n<p>This was a surprise to Kent, who just a few minutes earlier had watched the server boot and heard the client's admin acknowledge the fact.</p>\n<p>Fifteen minutes later nobody had explained what was going on.</p>\n<p>Kent called his dispatcher, who called the client. \"The message relayed back was that they were 'still having issues,' and I was not to be released until they were resolved.\"</p>\n<p>\"At this point I was no longer a field engineer. I was collateral,\" Kent told On Call.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/on_call/\">Desktop tech sent to prison for an education on strange places to put tattoos</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/13/on_call/\">Enforcing piracy policy earned helpdesk worker death threats</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/06/on_call/\">New hire fixed a problem so fast, their boss left to become a yoga instructor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/30/on_call/\">In-house techies fixed faults before outsourced help even noticed they'd happened</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>One hour and forty-five minutes later, Kent's supervisor called for a three-way chat with the client.</p>\n<p>\"The tone had shifted,\" Kent wrote. \"My supervisor calmly informed them that if I was not released immediately, I had two options available to me: pull the fire alarm inside the datacenter or call Police.\"</p>\n<p>The client decided to let Kent leave.</p>\n<p>He later learned why he'd been detained.</p>\n<p>\"An application running on the server was malfunctioning,\" he told On Call. \"The application vendor blamed the operating system. The operating system vendor suggested the hardware might be unstable. The hardware had just had a board replaced. Therefore, the man who replaced the board must be the problem.\"</p>\n<p>20 minutes after Kent left the datacenter, his phone rang.</p>\n<p>\"The client's admin called my mobile – not to apologize, but to inform me that I was banned from the site.\"</p>\n<p>Kent thinks his crime was to successfully replace a motherboard in a server that ran a buggy application.</p>\n<p>\"My brief was to swap a board,\" he told On Call. \"The board was swapped.\"</p>\n<p>Has a client or a colleague ever kept you on site against your will?

We have never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner,” he wrote, before adding “However, in a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values.”</p>\n\n\n<p>Amodei said two items in Anthropic’s contract with the department of war are “simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do.”</p>\n<p>One of those use cases is mass domestic surveillance, which Amodei said can now create “a comprehensive picture of any person’s life—automatically and at massive scale” with the help of AI. The CEO thinks that’s only legal “because the law has not yet caught up with the rapidly growing capabilities of AI.”</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/anthropic_claude_opus_3_blog/\">Anthropic launches new marketing blog, pretends it's being 'written' by 'retired' LLM</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/clade_code_cves/\">Claude collaboration tools left the door wide open to remote code execution</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/24/anthropic_misanthropic_chinese_ai_labs/\">Anthropic accuses China's AI labs of ripping off content – just like it did</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/23/claude_code_security_panic/\">Infosec community panics as Anthropic rolls out Claude code security checker</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second use case is powering fully autonomous weapons, which Amodei says are too dangerous to deploy in their current form.</p>\n<p>“Today, frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough to power fully autonomous weapons,” he wrote. “We will not knowingly provide a product that puts America’s warfighters and civilians at risk.”</p>\n\n<p>The CEO said Anthropic has “offered to work directly with the Department of War on R&amp;D to improve the reliability of these systems, but they have not accepted this offer.” He also suggested fully autonomous weapons “cannot be relied upon to exercise the critical judgment that our highly trained, professional troops exhibit every day. They need to be deployed with proper guardrails, which don’t exist today.”</p>\n<p>Amodei also pointed out what he believes are inconsistencies in the Pentagon’s approach to this matter, by pointing out that one of its threatened sanctions labels Anthropic a threat to national security for refusing to do as asked, while another seeks to compel the company to remove guardrails on AI in the name of national security.</p>\n<p>“Regardless, these threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request,” Amodei wrote.</p>\n\n<p>The CEO wrapped his post by expressing his desire his desire for Anthropic to continue supplying the Pentagon, without having to remove its guardrails.</p>\n<p>The statement sets the scene for a showdown with Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, who gave Anthropic a Friday deadline to acquiesce to the Pentagon’s terms and conditions. Hegseth has argued that the USA’s military must focus on warfighting and become more lethal. ®</p> \n</div>",

Instead, they're being repurposed for remote cargo inspection support.</p>\n<p>When it comes to ensuring that pallets of military equipment are properly load-balanced for air transport, there's no one better suited to confirm requirements have been met than the US Air Force. Unfortunately, there's no way for <a href=\"https://www.militaryimages.net/media/sucks.5650/\" rel=\"nofollow\">delicate</a> airmen to be everywhere Army grunts are stuck (this vulture is an Army veteran), and even if they're allowed to jump out of airplanes you may not want the average ground-pounder securing cargo that's supposed to actually complete its flight. </p>\n<p>Faced with that conundrum, the Air Force and Army <a href=\"https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/4416427/hololens-enables-remote-joint-inspection-of-cargo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">teamed up</a> to use HoloLens headsets in one of the ways Redmond actually intended, by letting <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/19/hololens2/\">someone qualified</a> see through the eyes of a peon. </p>\n\n<p>Members of the 724th Air Mobility Squadron, based in Aviano, Italy, have been working with soldiers from the Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade, based in Vicenza, Italy, to give airmen a chance to help soldiers inspect equipment pallets prior to loading onto aircraft. </p>\n\n\n<p>\"We spent a year working with the manufacturer [Microsoft] and experimenting with different add-ons to figure out the right software and process we needed to get to where we are today,\" said 725th Air Mobility Squadron superintendent, Chief Master Sgt. Anthony Sewejkis. \"Now it's plug and play. We can connect [from] anywhere just using the HoloLens, a Wi-Fi hotspot and a laptop.\"</p>\n<p>Airmen on laptops were able to see what soldiers were looking at, highlighting areas that needed attention using visual cues to direct soldiers to adjust rigging, reposition cargo, or whatever else needed doing. The augmented reality capabilities afforded to the troops by HoloLens headsets, 724's parent org the 521st Air Mobility Operations Wing noted, \"increase the speed of maneuver to sustain joint force lethality across the competition continuum.\" </p>\n\n<p>In other words, they think it's pretty cool. </p>\n<h3 class=\"crosshead\">Second time's a charm?</h3>\n<p>The inspection project, which was just a proof of concept but one the Squadron intends to keep refining, was a far greater success than the Army's first foray into making use of the HoloLens.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/12/microsoft_gives_up_army_ivas/\">Microsoft wants to quit building Army VR goggles, hand contract to Anduril</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/30/meta_is_now_a_defense/\">Meta – yep, Facebook Meta – is now a defense contractor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/09/us_army_anduril_headset/\">US Army straps on another mixed-reality gamble with Anduril, Rivet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/27/salesforce_5b_deal_agentic_ai_us_army/\">Salesforce signs $5.6B deal to inject agentic AI into the US Army</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It all started back in 2018, when the Army awarded Microsoft a contract to build the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) - custom HoloLens-derived headsets meant to give soldiers a battlefield heads-up display. Despite a deal described as worth up to nearly $22 billion over a decade, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/13/us_army_report_microsoft_hololens/\">testing didn't go smoothly</a>. A Pentagon watchdog report found the goggles caused “mission-affecting physical impairments,” including headaches, eyestrain, and nausea, among many of the soldiers who tested them.</p>\n<p>Attempts to continue the program, by dumping millions more into it, were met with resistance from Congress, which <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/12/congress_hololens_microsoft/\">slashed funding</a> for the program. Microsoft ultimately <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/12/microsoft_gives_up_army_ivas/\">gave up</a>, passing control of the initiative to Oculus inventor Palmer Luckey's Anduril. Anduril in turn <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/30/meta_is_now_a_defense/\">brought Meta</a> into the mix before the Army ultimately relaunched the program under a new name as the Soldier Borne Mission Command (SBMC) program, with the intention of developing an entirely new headset that hopefully isn't such a headache for soldiers. </p>\n<p>It doesn't help for Microsoft's prospects as a supplier of military mixed reality headsets that the company <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/02/microsoft_hololens_2_dead/\">canned development of the HoloLens</a> in late 2024, with support for existing models slated to run through the end of 2027.</p>\n<p>It's not clear whether the headsets used in the cargo loading experiment were leftovers from IVAS, discounted leftovers acquired by the Air Force, or if they were purchased specifically for the project. We reached out to the Army and Air Force to learn more, but didn't hear back. ®</p> \n</div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>It is a sound evocative of high school: the characteristic squeak of sneakers on a basketball court. UK readers may, however, be familiar with the same sound from their trainers while playing badminton.</p>\n<p>Whichever it is, how exactly the sound is produced has been a mystery - until now.</p>\n<p>The high-pitched tones have often been attributed to the “stick-slip phenomenon,” which creates the sound from a violin bow moving against the instrument’s string. You can still read the explanation on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stick%E2%80%93slip_phenomenon\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But the problem is that the sound tends to show up at high sliding speeds, while it also has a well-defined pitch, the frequency of which is difficult to explain.</p>\n\n\n<p>A team led by Harvard University postdoctoral researcher Adel Djellouli carried out an experimental analysis of the phenomenon and came up with an alternative to the stick-slip explanation.</p>\n<p>They replicated the sneaker-court interface by testing rubber blocks sliding against a special glass plate. Light shone into the glass at an angle and was trapped inside — a phenomenon known as total internal reflection — and only released when the rubber made contact with the plate. The researchers were able to record the contact regions using a high-speed camera.</p>\n\n<p>The results showed that the squeaking sound is produced by wave-like patterns across the rubber surface, contacting and then releasing from the glass, allowing the sliding between the surfaces. The waves move across the interface between the two materials at a speed of nearly 300 kilometers per hour.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/nasa_safety_artemis/\">NASA safety watchdog says it's time to rethink Moon landing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/moon_magnetic_field/\">Moon's mighty magnetic field was a 5,000-year titanium blip</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/hubble_orbit_decay/\">Hubble in a death spiral that could end as early as 2028 without a reboost</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/23/pop_album_fatal_car_accidents/\">Pop music fans literally dying to stream hot new albums – in car crashes, that is</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Harvard team also found that including ridges in the rubber akin to the sole of a sneaker produced a dramatic effect. “In flat samples, these pulses are irregular and generate broadband acoustic emissions. Introducing thin surface ridges confines pulse propagation, yielding a consistent repetition frequency matching the first shear mode of the sliding block and squeaking at that frequency,” the paper, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-026-10132-3\" target=\"_blank\">published in Nature this week</a>, said.</p>\n<p>In an accompanying article, Bart Weber from the University of Amsterdam wrote that “The study not only explains a familiar sound but also reveals how much complexity can hide in the seemingly simple act of sliding.”</p>\n<p>The researchers also observed tiny triboelectric discharges, brief flashes of light that appear capable of triggering the surface waves.</p>\n<p>Aside from explaining a curious effect from high school days, the researchers point to further work that could help enhance or reduce the effect, Weber said. ®</p> \n</div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>Vibe-coding platform Lovable has been accused of hosting apps riddled with vulnerabilities after saying users are responsible for addressing security issues flagged before publishing.</p>\n<p>Taimur Khan, a tech entrepreneur with a background in software engineering, found 16 vulnerabilities – six of which he said were critical – in a single Lovable-hosted app that leaked more than 18,000 people's data.</p>\n<p>He declined to name the app during the disclosure process, although it was hosted on Lovable's platform and showcased on its Discover page. The app had more than 100,000 views and around 400 upvotes at the time Khan began his probe.</p>\n\n<p>The main issue, Khan said, was that all apps that are vibe-coded on Lovable's platform are shipped with their backends powered by Supabase, which handles authentication, file storage, and real-time updates through a PostgreSQL database connection.</p>\n\n\n<p>However, when the developer – in this case AI – or the human project owner fails to explicitly implement crucial security features like Supabase's row-level security and role-based access, code will be generated that looks functional but in reality is flawed.</p>\n<p>One example of this was a malformed authentication function. The AI that <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/24/opinion_column_vibe_coding/\" target=\"_blank\">vibe-coded</a> the Supabase backend, which uses remote procedure calls, implemented it with flawed access control logic, essentially blocking authenticated users and allowing access to unauthenticated users.</p>\n\n<p>Khan said the intent was to block non-admins from accessing parts of the app, but the faulty implementation blocked all logged-in users – an error he said was repeated across multiple critical functions.</p>\n<p>\"This is backwards,\" said Khan. \"The guard blocks the people it should allow and allows the people it should block. A classic logic inversion that a human security reviewer would catch in seconds – but an AI code generator, optimizing for 'code that works,' produced and deployed to production.\"</p>\n<p>Because the app itself was a platform for creating exam questions and viewing grades, the userbase is naturally comprised of teachers and students. Some were from top US universities such as UC Berkeley and UC Davis, while there were \"K-12 institutions with minors likely on the platform\" as well, Khan <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/lovable-more-like-hackable-taimur-khan-cewdf/?trackingId=%2BscO7NGeQ0%2BpVd7b1U0fYA%3D%3D\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>.</p>\n\n<p>With the security flaws in place, an unauthenticated attacker could trivially access every user record, send bulk emails through the platform, delete any user account, grade student test submissions, and access organizations' admin emails, for example.</p>\n<p>Of the 18,697 total user records exposed, 14,928 contained unique email addresses. The dataset included 4,538 student accounts – all with email addresses – 10,505 enterprise users, and 870 users whose full PII was exposed.</p>\n<p>The security flaws here are not exclusive to apps hosted by Lovable; the issue is broader and well-told by now.</p>\n<p>Vibe coding, Collins Dictionary's Word of the Year for 2025, promised to break down software development's steep learning curve and empower any prompt jockey to bring their app ideas to life.</p>\n<p>However, when AI isn't <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/21/curl_ends_bug_bounty/\" target=\"_blank\">generating slop bug reports</a> in pursuit of lucrative bug bounties or <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/21/replit_saastr_vibe_coding_incident/\" target=\"_blank\">catastrophically forgoing instructions</a>, it can be found spewing glitzy-looking apps laden with vulnerabilities.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/bcachefs_creator_ai/\">Bcachefs creator insists his custom LLM is female and 'fully conscious'</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/23/ibm_share_dive_anthropic_cobol/\">IBM stock dives after Anthropic points out AI can rewrite COBOL fast</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/amazon_denies_kiro_agentic_ai_behind_outage/\">Amazon's vibe-coding tool Kiro reportedly vibed too hard and brought down AWS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/19/jon_kern_vibe_coding/\">Agile Manifesto turns 25 – just in time for vibe coding to test it</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Veracode, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.veracode.com/blog/ai-generated-code-security-risks/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">recently found</a> that 45 percent of AI-generated code contained security flaws, not to mention the myriad <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/05/mcpoison_bug_abuses_cursor_mcp/\" target=\"_blank\">tales</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/openclaw_snuck_into_cline_package/\" target=\"_blank\">woe</a> reported by <em>The Register</em> in recent months.</p>\n<p>Khan said he believes Lovable should take responsibility for the security of the apps it hosts, and was especially peeved when, after reporting his findings via company support, his ticket was reportedly closed without response.</p>\n<p>\"If Lovable is going to market itself as a platform that generates production-ready apps with authentication 'included,' it bears some responsibility for the security posture of the apps it generates and promotes,\" Khan said.</p>\n<p>\"You can't showcase an app to 100,000 people, host it on your own infrastructure, and then close the ticket when someone tells you it's leaking user data.

In this case, that implementation did not happen.</p>\n<p>\"This project also includes code not generated by Lovable and the vulnerable database is not hosted by Lovable. We have been in contact with the creator of the app, who is now addressing the issue.\" ®</p> \n</div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>Ransomware payments cratered in 2025, but it seems like the cybercrooks launching the attacks didn't get the memo.</p>\n<p>That's the headline from <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/crypto-ransomware-2026/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Chainalysis' 2026 Crypto Crime Report</a>, which shows total on-chain ransomware payments falling for a second straight year, even as victim counts and leak site pressure continue to climb.</p>\n<p>Ransomware gangs pulled in about $820 million in 2025, roughly 8 percent less than the year before, as the share of victims paying dropped to an all-time low of 28 percent. That drop might sound like progress if the wider picture weren't so bleak: the median ransom demand jumped from $12,738 in 2024 to $59,556 in 2025, and the number of publicly claimed attacks climbed along with it.</p>\n\n<p>\"Despite the relative stability in total payments, ransomware attacks surged across multiple vectors in 2025, with eCrime.ch data showing a 50 percent YoY increase in claimed ransomware victims, marking the most active year on record,\" Chainalysis said.</p>\n\n\n<p>2025 delivered plenty of high-profile examples of this \"most active\" year.

Smaller, opportunistic groups are behind a growing share of extortion attempts, even as the old guard – LockBit, BlackCat, and friends – have been raided, sanctioned, arrested, or simply popped back up under new logos. What's left is a crowded field of spin-offs and opportunists taking their chances, and plenty of these incidents never show up as a clean, traceable crypto payout on a blockchain explorer.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/27/odido_shinyhunters_leaks/\">Cops back Dutch telco Odido after second wave of ShinyHunters leaks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/former_l3harris_exec_jailed/\">Ex-L3Harris exec jailed 7 years for selling exploits to Russia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/wynn_resorts_shinyhunters/\">Wynn Resorts takes attacker's word for it that stolen staff data was deleted</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/24/north_koreas_lazarus_group_healthcare_medusa_ransomware/\">North Korea's Lazarus Group targets healthcare orgs with Medusa ransomware</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Security firm Emsisoft's 2025 ransomware data reinforces that picture. <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/08/ransomware_2025_emsisoft/\" target=\"_blank\">More than 8,000 organizations were publicly named on leak sites last year</a> – a sharp jump from previous years.</p>\n<p>Developed economies are still squarely in the crosshairs. The United States leads the pack yet again, followed by Canada, Germany, the UK, and the rest of Western Europe. Manufacturing, financial, and professional services took plenty of hits, and in Canada and Germany, attackers showed a particular appetite for supply chains, logistics networks, and critical infrastructure. In the US, every major sector – including government and critical infrastructure – saw year-over-year increases in the number of claimed victims.</p>\n\n<p>Chainalysis's report also offered a glimpse behind the scenes, where ransomware now looks less like a single criminal enterprise and more like a supply chain.</p>\n<p>Initial access brokers (IABs) – the middlemen selling ready-made footholds into corporate networks – received at least $14 million in on-chain payments in 2025. That's small compared to ransomware's $820 million haul, but Chainalysis found that spikes in IAB payments often precede increases in ransomware payments and US victim leak posts by roughly 30 days. Access gets bought, and a few weeks later, someone's name appears on a leak site.</p>\n<p>The Chainalysis report suggests that ransomware isn't shrinking so much as shifting, with fewer victims paying but more organizations getting hit, higher demands, and a thriving access-for-sale marketplace quietly teeing up the next wave of leak-site disclosures. ®</p> \n</div>",
