            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>ServiceNow claims it has created an AI agent that is currently solving 90 percent of the inbound IT tickets to the company's own employee help desk.</p>\n<p>ServiceNow said, in addition to using the Autonomous Workforce bot internally, select ServiceNow customers are testing it as well. The firm expects to have the product generally available by the second half of the year.</p>\n<p>The internal tickets include high volume issues such as password resets, account unlocks, software access requests, email issues, and VPN connectivity, handled end-to-end within defined permissions and escalation paths.</p>\n\n<p>“In our own environment, over 90% of targeted Level 1 volume is handled autonomously, with resolution rates above 99% for those categories and materially faster than human-only workflows,” a ServiceNow spokesperson told <em>The Register</em>.</p>\n\n\n<p>It accomplishes this by having the Autonomous Workforce operate on top of the live configuration management database (CMDB), active workflows, policy engines, approval chains, and real transaction history – all updated in real time every time a ticket closes, a workflow executes, or a policy changes, ServiceNow said.</p>\n<p>ServiceNow could use a win as Salesforce is targeting its enterprise ITSM customers with its own Agentforce IT Service product. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/salesforce_q4_2026/\" target=\"_blank\">boasted</a> of poaching five ServiceNow customers during the most recent quarter's earnings call.</p>\n\n<p>Another challenge for ServiceNow is how the Autonomous Workforce will adapt to customer environments. While ServiceNow says its internal documentation is backed with 20 years of experience, documentation inside real world help desks traditionally has been poor to non-existent.</p>\n<p>“The documentation problem is real, and frankly most vendors pretend it isn't. The reason ServiceNow can answer differently is the two decades of structured data that lives inside the platform itself,” according to group VP for AI products Nenshad Bardoliwalla. “This isn't a system that reads your Word docs and hopes for the best ... The pitch is ‘we're the control plane that aggregates signal from the tools you already have, and we fill the gaps with structured workflow logic built over two decades.’”</p>\n<p>Bardoliwalla said, the Autonomous Workforce uses historic ticket information as the knowledge base when answering questions. So far the system has been tested internally by ServiceNow employees feeding it tickets.</p>\n\n<p>ServiceNow broke those tickets down for <em>The Register</em> by type and subtype – which is how help desks organize and manage tickets - revealing that the Autonomous Workforce solved 90 percent of ticket types related to networking (46 percent), hardware (11 percent), and software (43 percent), as well as the following subtypes: enterprise app access, cloud authentication services (33 percent), collaboration tools issues (13 percent), VPN and network connectivity issues (7 percent), laptop and hardware performance issues (8 percent), and software installs and configuration (6 percent).</p>\n<p>“How does it know it got the right answer? Because the outcome is measurable inside the same platform,” Bardoliwalla said. “Did the ticket resolve? Did the workflow complete? Did the approval get the right sign-off? ServiceNow closes the loop in a way that a standalone LLM sitting on top of a SharePoint folder simply cannot.”</p>\n<p>Bardoliwalla said ServiceNow knows the device, the user, the identity, the access policies, and the historical incident patterns tied to a configuration item, but critically, he said, the Autonomous Workforce knows when it needs to stop and escalate a problem.</p>\n<p>“When the gap genuinely exists, the autonomous worker will know what it doesn't know,” he said. “This is actually a differentiator: a system that says ‘I can resolve 70% of this autonomously and here's exactly why I'm escalating the other 30%’ is more trustworthy than one that hallucinates an answer.”</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/14/servicenow_buys_pyramid_analytics_to/\">ServiceNow can't seem to keep its wallet closed, snaps up small AI analytics company</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/28/servicenow_ai_agents/\">ServiceNow boasts about years of sweat equity that went into making its AI agents smarter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/30/servicenow_outlines_coceo_structure/\">ServiceNow lays out possible co-CEO structure, but says no change imminent</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/25/servicenow_100m_ai_savings/\">ServiceNow eyes $100M in AI-powered headcount savings</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Forrester vice president and principal analyst Charles Betz said if ServiceNow has managed to achieve autonomous execution in the Level 1 help desk, that is a “milestone,” since for years AI in the help desk was used for deflection, recommendation, or faster routing.</p>\n<p>“End‑to‑end execution at scale is different; it does legitimize AI as operational infrastructure rather than just a productivity aid,” he said. “So yes, this returns real margin — but not simply by shrinking L1 headcount. The value shows up as faster resolution, fewer escalations, better utilization of skilled staff, and the ability to absorb growth without linear increases in labor. The limiting factor shifts from ‘Can the AI do it?’ to whether the organization has the data quality, workflows, and governance discipline to sustain that higher baseline.”</p>\n<p>He said it also opens the door to the <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/blogs/the-automation-paradox-strikes-again-lessons-from-woolworths-amazon-era-productivity-play\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">automation paradox</a>, which he said is similar to what Lisanne Bainbridge wrote about in her 1983 paper, <a href=\"https://ckrybus.com/static/papers/Bainbridge_1983_Automatica.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Ironies of Automation</a>. For the help desk, this means what used to be basic support becomes table stakes and “users surface higher‑order needs once the friction is removed.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a well‑known dynamic that kicks in once the low‑hanging fruit is harvested. Level 1 doesn’t disappear — the baseline rises,” Betz told <em>The Register</em>. “Routine, procedural issues get automated away, and what remains are harder, more ambiguous, more cross‑system problems. In systems terms, you get complexity creep rather than pure volume reduction.” ®</p> \n</div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>The bot’s nagging will continue until morale improves. Burger King is rolling out a new employee-facing AI that, among other things, will listen to employees’ customer interactions to ensure they’re being friendly enough - as if working in fast food weren’t hard enough already.</p>\n<p>Burger King announced a wider rollout of the BK Assistant, along with its employee AI assistant-cum-narc \"Patty,\" on Thursday during an investor event <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/restaurant-brands-international-is-hosting-an-investor-event-on-february-26-2026-302694931.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">hosted</a> by parent company Restaurant Brands International. According to RBI, BK Assistant has been deployed for testing in approximately 500 stores around the US, and the company wants to have it available in all 7,000 US Burger Kings by the end of 2026. </p>\n<p>A promo video played during the investor event livestream showed Patty talking to an incoming shift manager, sharing current \"friendliness scores,\" the status of low-stock items, and other data points a team leader might need to know. </p>\n\n<p>Burger King employees were shown being reminded of recipes, getting cleaning instructions, and, a bit more obtrusively, being told they met upselling goals when convincing a customer to add an item they didn't originally ask for to their order. </p>\n\n\n<p>According to a Burger King representative, the BK Assistant unifies point of sale, kitchen equipment, inventory, and digital ordering systems into a single umbrella product built with proprietary Burger King architecture on top of a base model from OpenAI. </p>\n<p>Despite the fact that the video showed a manager being told how friendly her team was being with customers, Burger King insisted that Patty isn't going to spy on employees and report them when they're having a bad shift. </p>\n\n<p>\"It is not designed to track nor evaluate employees saying specific words or phrases,\" a Burger King spokesperson told <em>The Register</em> in an email. \"BK Assistant is a coaching and operational support tool built to help our restaurant teams manage complexity and stay focused on delivering a great Guest experience.\"</p>\n<p>The fast food chain has explored using aggregated keywords, like \"welcome,\" \"please,\" and \"thank you\" as signals to help managers understand broader service patterns at their restaurants, but \"it's not about scoring individuals or enforcing scripts,\" the spokesperson said. </p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2021/09/20/bork/\">A Burger King where the only Whopper is the BSOD font</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/23/bossware_monitor_remote_employees/\">Bossware booms as bots determine whether you're doing a good job</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/02/mcdonalds_password_advice/\">McDonald's is not lovin' your bigmac, happymeal, and mcnuggets passwords</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/14/advanced_workplace_tech_study/\">AI and wearables are scaring the wellbeing out of workers</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\"We believe hospitality is fundamentally human,\" the company rep told us. \"The role of this technology is to support our teams so they can stay present with guests.\"</p>\n<p>Fast food AI has been a bit of a mixed bag for companies that have tried it, though to be fair most of the failures have been on the customer service end. </p>\n<p>McDonald's <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/17/mcdonalds_ai_drivethru/\">gave up on drive-through AI</a>, and Taco Bell has also <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyk2p55g8o\" rel=\"nofollow\">rethought</a> its <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/01/ai_taco_bell/\">trial run</a> after mishaps.

Instead, it's shifting toward <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/11/starbucks_ai_baristas/\" target=\"_blank\">AI tools that assist staff</a> — echoing Burger King's employee-assist strategy.</p>\n\n<p>There's no guarantee Burger King's initiative will stick, naturally, but be prepared for employees to start seeming extra friendly in case Patty is listening in. ®</p> \n</div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>Microsoft has found some friends to make desktop devices that boot into its Windows 365 cloud PCs.</p>\n<p>The software giant was previously the only vendor to make such machines, in the form of the Windows 365 Link machines it <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/19/microsoft_windows_365_link/\" target=\"_blank\">debuted</a> in 2024 and <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/03/windows_365_link/\" target=\"_blank\">delivered</a> the next year.</p>\n<p>Dell and ASUS have now joined the cloudy PC party.</p>\n\n<p>ASUS’s model is the NUC 16 for Windows 365. Readers may recall that “NUC” stands for Next Unit of Computing, a brand Intel coined for a range of PCs it and later <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/19/intel_asus_nuc_deal/\" target=\"_blank\">sold</a> to ASUS.</p>\n\n\n<p>After the Taiwanese company acquired NUCs, ASUS told <i>The Register</i> it <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/08/asus_nuc_year_one/\" target=\"_blank\">wanted</a> to take the machines into new markets.</p>\n<p>And now it has, and <a href=\"https://www.connect.asus.com/notify-me-ASUS-NUC-16-Windows-365\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">says</a> its machine offers “the latest Intel processor” without specifying a model, but promises DDR5 memory, Wi-Fi 6E, 2.5GbE LAN, Bluetooth 5.3, HDMI, USB Type-C, and USB Type-A ports will all be present in the 0.7-liter device and that it can support three displays.</p>\n\n<p>Dell’s device is the Pro Desktop for Windows 365. The company hasn't offered any specs beyond a promise it can drive three displays.</p>\n<p>Microsoft says tweaks to the minimalist “Cloud CPC” OS that runs on the machines will add support for pairing Bluetooth devices “during the out-of-box experience” and support for custom branding on the sign-in screen.</p>\n<p>The software giant suggests these devices as especially secure and manageable, because they don’t require users to store anything on the device or on-premises – apps and data are all in Azure. Of course the company says its own Intune tool makes conventional PCs easy to secure and manage, too. And to complicate matters further, Microsoft also offers tech that allows <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/24/windows_365_boot_preview/\" target=\"_blank\">vanilla PCs</a> to boot straight into a cloudy PC instead of starting up a local version of Windows, or <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/18/microsoft_cloud_apps_omnissa_update/?_gl=1*1lb1dmn*_ga*MTI0MjE1MDMxNS4xNzE5OTg5NTg5*_ga_JXW44Y23NM*czE3NzIxNTc2ODkkbzE5MzQkZzEkdDE3NzIxNzA0MTckajQxJGwwJGgw\" target=\"_blank\">streaming apps that don’t need a PC at all</a>.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/19/microsoft_virtual_pc_update/\">Microsoft reveals new cloudy AI PC that’s not a Copilot+ PC</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/24/omnissa_appvolumes_physical_extension/\">Omnissa brings VDI-style app packaging to physical PCs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/07/citrix_virtualisation_avoids_tariffs/\">Citrix finds new use for virtualization: Avoiding PC price hikes caused by tariffs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/06/google_acquires_cameyo_vdi_challenge/\">Google takes on virtual desktops with acquisition of app-streamer Cameyo</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Microsoft cares about this stuff because around ten percent of PCs used by businesses are virtual. Analyst firm Gartner thinks that number will double by 2027 because cloudy virtual PCs accessed through a thin client can be <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/14/gartner_daas_predictions/\" target=\"_blank\">cheaper to run than laptops</a>.</p>\n<p>Another factor that creates the possibility of winning more users for Windows 365 is Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware, which has seen the virtualization pioneer stop selling the kind of software bundles suited to running just desktop virtualization workloads. Some organizations therefore face a choice of signing up for VMware’s very capable but pricey Cloud Foundation private cloud bundle, or finding a new way to run virtual PCs.</p>\n\n<p>Buyers must wait until Q3 for the debut of the new devices from ASUS and Dell. Microsoft, meanwhile, continues to sell its own Windows 365 Link devices. ®</p> \n</div>",

            "title": "NASA safety watchdog says it's time to rethink Moon landing",
            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>The latest report from NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) raises questions about the mission objectives for Artemis III.</p>\n<p>Artemis III aims to land astronauts near the lunar South Pole, relying on SpaceX's Starship-derived Human Landing System (HLS) – a vehicle that has yet to achieve orbit, let alone venture anywhere near the Moon. It's an extraordinarily ambitious undertaking, and one the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/asap/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ASAP report</a> has formally classified as high risk.</p>\n<p>The problem is that there are an awful lot of firsts associated with the mission. It'll be the first to depend on SpaceX's HLS, the first to need multiple in-space refuelings (the report estimates 15), the first time a crew will use the HLS, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>ASAP's primary goal is to identify risks and mitigations. It says the solution here is to ease off from doing so much in one mission and consider a more stepwise approach, similar to the Apollo program.</p>\n\n\n<p>The first Apollo crew was launched into orbit with Apollo 7, followed by a mission around the Moon with Apollo 8. Apollo 9 checked out the Lunar Module in Earth orbit, and Apollo 10 did pretty much everything except land. The first lunar landing happened with Apollo 11. Each mission was predicated on the success of the previous.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/23/artemis_ii_launch_april_helium_issues/\">Artemis II headed back to the bay; helium issues force another delay</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/19/nasa_starliner_blame/\">NASA points fingers at Boeing and chaotic culture for Starliner debacle</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/16/nasa_has_mixed_results_from/\">NASA's fill-'er-up Moon rocket 'confidence' test sees mixed results</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/06/smartphones_nasa/\">Smartphones cleared for launch as NASA loosens the rulebook</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It makes sense from a technical perspective. However, elsewhere in the report is data that highlights other challenges faced by NASA, including resource constraints. It does not have the human resources it had during the Apollo era, when staffing exceeded 35,000 full-time employees. Today, that figure is dropping fast. According to the report, it neared 15,000 in 2025. The agency also has nowhere near the budget it had during the Apollo Moon missions, and so the desire to fit as much as possible into fewer missions is understandable, even if the report deems doing so in Artemis III \"a high risk.\"</p>\n<p>\"Rebalancing objectives is thus essential to the safe achievement of the national objective – returning the United States to the Moon,\" it says.</p>\n<p>The lengthy report also covers the <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/19/nasa_starliner_blame/\" target=\"_blank\">Starliner fiasco</a>, the aging ISS, and the obsolete spacesuits in which NASA expects astronauts to work outside the outpost,</p>\n\n<p>Highlighting the challenges facing the Artemis III mission, however, will amplify calls for the agency to reconsider its objectives.</p>\n<p>While there may be a political desire to return astronauts to the Moon within the current US administration, the report highlights the technical and resource realities that must also be considered. Better to rethink the objectives than try to cram too much into just one mission. ®</p> \n</div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>Vibe-coding platform Lovable has been accused of hosting apps riddled with vulnerabilities after saying users are responsible for addressing security issues flagged before publishing.</p>\n<p>Taimur Khan, a tech entrepreneur with a background in software engineering, found 16 vulnerabilities – six of which he said were critical – in a single Lovable-hosted app that leaked more than 18,000 people's data.</p>\n<p>He declined to name the app during the disclosure process, although it was hosted on Lovable's platform and showcased on its Discover page. The app had more than 100,000 views and around 400 upvotes at the time Khan began his probe.</p>\n\n<p>The main issue, Khan said, was that all apps that are vibe-coded on Lovable's platform are shipped with their backends powered by Supabase, which handles authentication, file storage, and real-time updates through a PostgreSQL database connection.</p>\n\n\n<p>However, when the developer – in this case AI – or the human project owner fails to explicitly implement crucial security features like Supabase's row-level security and role-based access, code will be generated that looks functional but in reality is flawed.</p>\n<p>One example of this was a malformed authentication function. The AI that <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/24/opinion_column_vibe_coding/\" target=\"_blank\">vibe-coded</a> the Supabase backend, which uses remote procedure calls, implemented it with flawed access control logic, essentially blocking authenticated users and allowing access to unauthenticated users.</p>\n\n<p>Khan said the intent was to block non-admins from accessing parts of the app, but the faulty implementation blocked all logged-in users – an error he said was repeated across multiple critical functions.</p>\n<p>\"This is backwards,\" said Khan. \"The guard blocks the people it should allow and allows the people it should block. A classic logic inversion that a human security reviewer would catch in seconds – but an AI code generator, optimizing for 'code that works,' produced and deployed to production.\"</p>\n<p>Because the app itself was a platform for creating exam questions and viewing grades, the userbase is naturally comprised of teachers and students. Some were from top US universities such as UC Berkeley and UC Davis, while there were \"K-12 institutions with minors likely on the platform\" as well, Khan <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/lovable-more-like-hackable-taimur-khan-cewdf/?trackingId=%2BscO7NGeQ0%2BpVd7b1U0fYA%3D%3D\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>.</p>\n\n<p>With the security flaws in place, an unauthenticated attacker could trivially access every user record, send bulk emails through the platform, delete any user account, grade student test submissions, and access organizations' admin emails, for example.</p>\n<p>Of the 18,697 total user records exposed, 14,928 contained unique email addresses. The dataset included 4,538 student accounts – all with email addresses – 10,505 enterprise users, and 870 users whose full PII was exposed.</p>\n<p>The security flaws here are not exclusive to apps hosted by Lovable; the issue is broader and well-told by now.</p>\n<p>Vibe coding, Collins Dictionary's Word of the Year for 2025, promised to break down software development's steep learning curve and empower any prompt jockey to bring their app ideas to life.</p>\n<p>However, when AI isn't <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/21/curl_ends_bug_bounty/\" target=\"_blank\">generating slop bug reports</a> in pursuit of lucrative bug bounties or <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/21/replit_saastr_vibe_coding_incident/\" target=\"_blank\">catastrophically forgoing instructions</a>, it can be found spewing glitzy-looking apps laden with vulnerabilities.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/bcachefs_creator_ai/\">Bcachefs creator insists his custom LLM is female and 'fully conscious'</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/23/ibm_share_dive_anthropic_cobol/\">IBM stock dives after Anthropic points out AI can rewrite COBOL fast</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/amazon_denies_kiro_agentic_ai_behind_outage/\">Amazon's vibe-coding tool Kiro reportedly vibed too hard and brought down AWS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/19/jon_kern_vibe_coding/\">Agile Manifesto turns 25 – just in time for vibe coding to test it</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Veracode, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.veracode.com/blog/ai-generated-code-security-risks/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">recently found</a> that 45 percent of AI-generated code contained security flaws, not to mention the myriad <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/05/mcpoison_bug_abuses_cursor_mcp/\" target=\"_blank\">tales</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/openclaw_snuck_into_cline_package/\" target=\"_blank\">woe</a> reported by <em>The Register</em> in recent months.</p>\n<p>Khan said he believes Lovable should take responsibility for the security of the apps it hosts, and was especially peeved when, after reporting his findings via company support, his ticket was reportedly closed without response.</p>\n<p>\"If Lovable is going to market itself as a platform that generates production-ready apps with authentication 'included,' it bears some responsibility for the security posture of the apps it generates and promotes,\" Khan said.</p>\n<p>\"You can't showcase an app to 100,000 people, host it on your own infrastructure, and then close the ticket when someone tells you it's leaking user data. At minimum, a basic security scan of showcased applications would have caught every critical finding in this report.\"</p>\n<p>Lovable told <em>The Register</em> that the company has contacted the owner of the app in question and takes \"any findings of this kind extremely seriously.\"</p>\n<p>Regarding the closed ticket, Lovable CISO Igor Andriushchenko said that the company only received \"a proper disclosure report\" on the evening of February 26 and acted on the findings \"within minutes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Any project built with Lovable includes a free security scan before publishing,\" Andriushchenko told <em>The Register</em>. \"This scan checks for vulnerabilities and, if found, provides recommendations on actions to take to resolve before publishing.</p>\n<p>\"Ultimately, it is at the discretion of the user to implement these recommendations. In this case, that implementation did not happen.</p>\n<p>\"This project also includes code not generated by Lovable and the vulnerable database is not hosted by Lovable. We have been in contact with the creator of the app, who is now addressing the issue.\" ®</p> \n</div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>The next wave of smartphones and PCs will have less memory and fewer capabilities, yet are likely to cost consumers 14 percent more as AI ambitions eat all available memory supplies, according to researchers at IDC.</p>\n<p>IDC said that the <a href=\"https://www.idc.com/resource-center/blog/higher-asps-lower-unit-volumes-how-the-memory-crisis-is-reshaping-the-pc-and-smartphone-outlook/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">worsening memory</a> market has caused its outlook to deteriorate just since December. The analysts are penciling in a decline in the PC market of 11.3 percent in 2026 – about 26 percent worse than they had guessed in December – and a decline in the smartphone market of 12.9 percent, which is more than double the 5.2 percent drop they predicted as a worst-case scenario just two months back.</p>\n<p>“This is perhaps the biggest challenge the industry has faced since its inception,” said Nabilia Popal, IDC’s senior research director global consumer devices, during a roundtable video discussion posted Thursday. “This is not just a temporary situation. This is going to result in a structural reset of the entire industry, in terms of size, in terms of competitive landscape, of the product mix and also on the price.”</p>\n\n<p>To mitigate the cost and the short supply, IDC expects consumers to hang on to devices longer, or turn to used and refurbished units. Device makers meanwhile are likely to downgrade memory on their least expensive devices, optimize features around using less memory, or in some cases turn to Chinese suppliers that they've avoided over geopolitical or technical concerns.</p>\n\n\n<p>“Any meaningful impact is expected to take some time,” Jeff Janukowicz, research vice president at IDC, said in a video posted Thursday. \"So ultimately, from our perspective we continue to see a challenging environment in 2026. That’s likely to push into 2027.”</p>\n<p>IDC is not alone in sounding the alarm. Researchers at <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/memory_price_hikes/\" target=\"_blank\">Gartner this week</a> also said some types of memory have doubled or quadrupled in price since last year, and Gartner believes DRAM and NAND flash used in PCs and phones is set for a further 130 percent rise by the end of 2026.</p>\n\n<p>Gartner is projecting a drop in PC shipments of more than 10 percent during 2026, and a decline of around 8 percent for smartphones, all due to the AI-driven memory shortage.</p>\n<p>In the PC market, IDC expects the shortages to begin in the second quarter as smaller vendors struggle to obtain supplies unit volumes will “fall off dramatically,” researchers wrote.</p>\n<p>During its earnings call on Thursday, Dell’s chief operating officer and vice chairman <a href=\"https://investors.delltechnologies.com/financial-information/quarterly-results\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Clarke</a> said DRAM prices over the last 6 months are up nearly 5.5x, at $2.39 a gigabit. Meanwhile the cost of NAND is $0.20 a gigabyte; that's up nearly 4x over the last 6 months. He said that analysts are predicting prices in Q2 to be 20% to 50% higher.</p>\n\n<p>In October, Dell reduced the price of PCs to win market share, then in January, the company increased the cost of PCs to adjust for higher memory prices. At the time, the OEM had tens of thousands of deals in the pipeline that had prices adjusted upwards, which immediately took pressure off Dell’s margins, Clarke said.</p>\n<p>“In PCs, we purposely delayed implementing that price move to stay in the hunt to take share and to drive growth, which will serve us for the long run,” Clarke said. “And then when we made the change on January 6, it wasn't 90 days later, it was that day we stabilized margins,” he said.</p>\n<p>During its earnings call this week, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/hp_inc_q1_2026/\" target=\"_blank\">HP revealed</a> that memory now accounts for 35 percent of the cost of materials it needs to build a PC, up from between 15 and 18 percent last quarter. The company expects to see memory prices increase 100 percent sequentially into the next quarter, according to HP CFO Karen Parkhill. The company said it has raised PC prices as a result.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/02/dram_prices_expected_to_double/\">DRAM prices expected to double in Q1 as AI ambitions push memory fabs to their limit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/14/dram_infrastructure_costs/\">Buy servers now or cry later: DRAM price spike threatens infrastructure budgets</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/micron_powerchip_fab_acquisition/\">Micron finds a way to make more DRAM with $1.8bn chip plant purchase</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/06/memory_firm_profits_up_as/\">Mem-ageddon: AI chip frenzy to wallop DRAM prices with 70% hike</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And earlier this month <a href=\"https://www.veracast.com/webcasts/lenovo/meetings/7X3Z9C.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Lenovo’s PC boss Luca Rossi</a> said that they will raise their average selling price for PCs in 2026, as the number of available PCs will likely drop.</p>\n<p>“At the moment, we are modeling a mid-single-digit decline for the units. But that decline will be offset by a higher ASP (average selling price) and likely a favorable product mix,” Rossi told investors on Feb. 12. “Hence, the value of the market will not decline. For Lenovo, we will continue to grow at premium to market.”</p>\n<p>Janukowicz said with the top four cloud service providers projected to spend $600 billion this year on AI build outs that require DRAM and NAND – some 70 percent more than last year – the cost of memory will likely not stabilize until 2027.</p>\n<p>“This is not necessarily a short disruption and it reflects a structurally tight environment.

            "title": "Amazon and Nvidia open their wallets to lock in OpenAI's business while SoftBank keeps the lights on",
            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>The headlines say OpenAI on Friday announced $110 billion in new investment from Amazon, Nvidia, and SoftBank at a $730 billion pre-money valuation, though terms and conditions apply.</p>\n<p>Both Amazon's $50 billion and Nvidia's $30 billion <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/scaling-ai-for-everyone/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">investments</a> are tied to massive customer commitments by OpenAI and its partners. </p>\n<p>Of Amazon's investment, $35 billion will only be paid out \"when certain conditions are met.\" From what we gather, those conditions include <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/amazon-partnership/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">renting</a> out two gigawatts worth of Amazon's Trainium AI accelerators and the deployment of OpenAI models and services in AWS. The cloud provider will also be the \"exclusive third-party cloud distribution provider for OpenAI Frontier.\"</p>\n\n<p>Announced earlier this month, Frontier is OpenAI's new <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-frontier/\" target=\"_blank\">agent builder</a> aimed at enterprise customers. Curiously, OpenAI was quick to emphasize that \"nothing about today's announcements in any way changes the terms of the Microsoft and OpenAI relationship,\" and that Azure remains the exclusive cloud provider of its stateless OpenAI APIs and first party products, like Frontier.</p>\n\n\n<p>Nvidia's $30 billion investment appears to have similar provisions. In a <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/scaling-ai-for-everyone/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> published on Friday, the AI flag bearer announced an expanded partnership with Nvidia that would see the deployment of three gigawatts of inference and two gigawatts of training capacity built on the GPU slinger's Vera Rubin systems. Announced at CES in January, the racks are expected to begin shipping in the second half of 2026.</p>\n<p>The economics of datacenters can be tricky to pin down as it varies by region, but at a power usage effectiveness of 1.1, a gigawatt is enough for about 3,600 Vera Rubin NVL72 systems, assuming 250 kW per rack. </p>\n\n<p>At an <a href=\"https://www.nextplatform.com/ai/2026/01/06/nvidias-vera-rubin-platform-obsoletes-current-ai-iron-six-months-ahead-of-launch/4092179\" target=\"_blank\">estimated</a> cost of $8.4 million each, that's roughly $30 billion per gigawatt. However, compute only accounts for about half the cost of standing up a modern AI datacenter. </p>\n<p>The land, shell, power, and plumbing costs make up the remainder. This puts the cost of building and deploying 5 gigawatts worth of Vera Rubin accelerators at more than $300 billion. OpenAI is unlikely to take this on itself. Instead, we expect CEO Sam Altman to broker purchase agreements through its hyperscaler and neocloud partners, as it has done with Oracle and Crusoe for its Stargate facility in Abilene, Texas.</p>\n<p>Amazon is one of those partners. While OpenAI may be playing up Trainium in today's disclosures, its <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/aws-and-openai-partnership/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">existing</a> $38 billion tie-up with Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/03/openai_inks_38b_deal_with_aws/\" target=\"_blank\">announced back in November</a>, was specific to Nvidia GB200 and GB300 systems. That contract has now been extended to $100 billion over the next eight years.</p>\n\n<p>Both Amazon's and Nvidia's investments are structured in such a way as to guarantee a return on every dollar invested in OpenAI. The funding is essentially a discount on compute infrastructure that doesn't dilute their revenues while driving up OpenAI's valuation.</p>\n<p>This kind of circular dealing has become commonplace amid the AI boom, and all the big boys are taking part. Back in October, Nvidia rival AMD <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/06/stargate_openai_amd/\" target=\"_blank\">issued</a> OpenAI a warrant for roughly 10 percent of its stock. To claim it, all Altman needs to do is deploy six gigawatts of the chip designer's Instinct accelerators. This week, AMD <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/24/amd_copypastes_openai_6gw_chipsforstock/\" target=\"_blank\">copied and pasted</a> that deal, extending the same offer to social media and would-be AI magnate Meta.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/burger_kings_new_ai/\">Burger King turns to AI to flame broil employees who aren't friendly enough</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/nvidia_q4_2026/\">Nvidia hasn't made a cent in China lately – and might not need to given $120B profit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/openai_asks_its_friends_to/\">OpenAI asks its friends to tell their friends about Frontier</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/23/sam_altman_ai_efficiency/\">Altman: You think AI is wasted energy?

Infamous spendthrift Masayoshi Son plans to <a href=\"https://group.softbank/en/news/press/20260227\" target=\"_blank\">invest</a> another $30 billion into the company to keep the lights on while Altman and crew continue their search for artificial general intelligence. SoftBank's contribution will be paid out in three tranches of $10 billion beginning in April and wrapping up in October.</p>\n<p>Even with annualized recurring revenue reportedly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-cfo-says-annualized-revenue-crosses-20-billion-2025-2026-01-19/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">exceeding</a> $20 billion and more than 50 million paying subscribers on the books, OpenAI is going to be reliant on outside funding for a while. The company isn't expected to achieve profitability until at least 2029. ®</p> \n</div>",
