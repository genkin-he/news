He needs some numbers from you.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>\"Will 13 and 771 do?\"</p>\n<p>\"No. I'm after the time-saving figures that AI's been generating for you,\" the Head Beancounter says.</p>\n\n<p>\"And do you need the time-wasting figures as well?\"</p>\n<p>\"Time wasting?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, you know, the hours of pointless questions that staff have been asking AI. How to meet the right person, how to fix their TV, what spices to add to drinking water to mask the flavor of thallium.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"I... er... \" the Head Beancounter blathers, no doubt making a mental note to bring his own water from now on.</p>\n<p>\"So just the time-saving numbers then?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>\"For the board meeting?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes.

Perfect. Now, if you'll excuse me...\"</p>\n<p>The Head Beancounter dashes off to the lift, bumping into the PFY on the way in.</p>\n<p>\"What's going on?\" the PFY asks.</p>\n<p>\"Operation Hoarse Pigeon is a go,\" I murmur.</p>\n<p>\"So it's happening then?\" the PFY says, moving to his desktop.</p>\n<p>\"Yep.\"</p>\n<p>\"What's happening? What's a horse pigeon?\" the Boss asks, confused.</p>\n<p>\"Hoarse Pigeon,\" I say, reviewing the camera footage from outside the Boss's office.</p>\n<p>\"Horse pigeon?\" the Boss repeats.</p>\n<p>\"It's one of our code words,\" the PFY says. \"In this case for 'an attempted coup.'\"</p>\n<p>\"What?\"</p>\n<p>\"Have a nice conversation with the Head Beancounter earlier?\" I ask, finding some relevant video footage.</p>\n<p>\"I... guess so – we just chatted about AI and how it helps us buy computer equipment, and how you're using it to write programs and things like that. He was very interested.\"</p>\n<p>\"Uh-huh.\"</p>\n<p>\"So what do you mean, attempted coup?\" the Boss asks.</p>\n<p>\"There's a board meeting today – and someone just happens to come asking for data at the last minute.\"</p>\n<p>\"So?\"</p>\n<p>\"Just after they've been chatting to you about how AI's basically made us redundant.\"</p>\n<p>\"I...\"</p>\n<p>\"And he looked smug. That's one coincidence too many.\"</p>\n<p>\"Aren't you being a bit... paranoid?\"</p>\n<p>\"I wasn't paranoid in 01 when the colored pencil office wanted to do their own IT purchasing because they used the most expensive desktops. I wasn't paranoid in 2010, 2014, and 2016 – when the Beancounters said we didn't need an IT support department.\"</p>\n<p>\"Really?\" the Boss asks, doubtfully.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. See, we oversee a stack of IT purchases every year,\" I explain. \"We approve or reject hundreds of high-value items.\"</p>\n<p>\"And?\"</p>\n<p>\"And people don't like it. They don't want us rejecting their oddball orders – like a 'portable laptop' with an 85-inch screen.\"</p>\n<p>\"And everyone wants an 85-inch screen,\" the PFY says. \"But you don't need to worry about that. What you should be worried about is that you'll be the first to go if the coup is successful.

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>Vibe-coding platform Lovable has been accused of hosting apps riddled with vulnerabilities after saying users are responsible for addressing security issues flagged before publishing.</p>\n<p>Taimur Khan, a tech entrepreneur with a background in software engineering, found 16 vulnerabilities – six of which he said were critical – in a single Lovable-hosted app that leaked more than 18,000 people's data.</p>\n<p>He declined to name the app during the disclosure process, although it was hosted on Lovable's platform and showcased on its Discover page. The app had more than 100,000 views and around 400 upvotes at the time Khan began his probe.</p>\n\n<p>The main issue, Khan said, was that all apps that are vibe-coded on Lovable's platform are shipped with their backends powered by Supabase, which handles authentication, file storage, and real-time updates through a PostgreSQL database connection.</p>\n\n\n<p>However, when the developer – in this case AI – or the human project owner fails to explicitly implement crucial security features like Supabase's row-level security and role-based access, code will be generated that looks functional but in reality is flawed.</p>\n<p>One example of this was a malformed authentication function. The AI that <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/24/opinion_column_vibe_coding/\" target=\"_blank\">vibe-coded</a> the Supabase backend, which uses remote procedure calls, implemented it with flawed access control logic, essentially blocking authenticated users and allowing access to unauthenticated users.</p>\n\n<p>Khan said the intent was to block non-admins from accessing parts of the app, but the faulty implementation blocked all logged-in users – an error he said was repeated across multiple critical functions.</p>\n<p>\"This is backwards,\" said Khan. \"The guard blocks the people it should allow and allows the people it should block. A classic logic inversion that a human security reviewer would catch in seconds – but an AI code generator, optimizing for 'code that works,' produced and deployed to production.\"</p>\n<p>Because the app itself was a platform for creating exam questions and viewing grades, the userbase is naturally comprised of teachers and students. Some were from top US universities such as UC Berkeley and UC Davis, while there were \"K-12 institutions with minors likely on the platform\" as well, Khan <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/lovable-more-like-hackable-taimur-khan-cewdf/?trackingId=%2BscO7NGeQ0%2BpVd7b1U0fYA%3D%3D\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>.</p>\n\n<p>With the security flaws in place, an unauthenticated attacker could trivially access every user record, send bulk emails through the platform, delete any user account, grade student test submissions, and access organizations' admin emails, for example.</p>\n<p>Of the 18,697 total user records exposed, 14,928 contained unique email addresses. The dataset included 4,538 student accounts – all with email addresses – 10,505 enterprise users, and 870 users whose full PII was exposed.</p>\n<p>The security flaws here are not exclusive to apps hosted by Lovable; the issue is broader and well-told by now.</p>\n<p>Vibe coding, Collins Dictionary's Word of the Year for 2025, promised to break down software development's steep learning curve and empower any prompt jockey to bring their app ideas to life.</p>\n<p>However, when AI isn't <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/21/curl_ends_bug_bounty/\" target=\"_blank\">generating slop bug reports</a> in pursuit of lucrative bug bounties or <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/21/replit_saastr_vibe_coding_incident/\" target=\"_blank\">catastrophically forgoing instructions</a>, it can be found spewing glitzy-looking apps laden with vulnerabilities.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/bcachefs_creator_ai/\">Bcachefs creator insists his custom LLM is female and 'fully conscious'</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/23/ibm_share_dive_anthropic_cobol/\">IBM stock dives after Anthropic points out AI can rewrite COBOL fast</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/amazon_denies_kiro_agentic_ai_behind_outage/\">Amazon's vibe-coding tool Kiro reportedly vibed too hard and brought down AWS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/19/jon_kern_vibe_coding/\">Agile Manifesto turns 25 – just in time for vibe coding to test it</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Veracode, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.veracode.com/blog/ai-generated-code-security-risks/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">recently found</a> that 45 percent of AI-generated code contained security flaws, not to mention the myriad <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/05/mcpoison_bug_abuses_cursor_mcp/\" target=\"_blank\">tales</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/openclaw_snuck_into_cline_package/\" target=\"_blank\">woe</a> reported by <em>The Register</em> in recent months.</p>\n<p>Khan said he believes Lovable should take responsibility for the security of the apps it hosts, and was especially peeved when, after reporting his findings via company support, his ticket was reportedly closed without response.</p>\n<p>\"If Lovable is going to market itself as a platform that generates production-ready apps with authentication 'included,' it bears some responsibility for the security posture of the apps it generates and promotes,\" Khan said.</p>\n<p>\"You can't showcase an app to 100,000 people, host it on your own infrastructure, and then close the ticket when someone tells you it's leaking user data. At minimum, a basic security scan of showcased applications would have caught every critical finding in this report.\"</p>\n<p>Lovable told <em>The Register</em> that the company has contacted the owner of the app in question and takes \"any findings of this kind extremely seriously.\"</p>\n<p>Regarding the closed ticket, Lovable CISO Igor Andriushchenko said that the company only received \"a proper disclosure report\" on the evening of February 26 and acted on the findings \"within minutes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Any project built with Lovable includes a free security scan before publishing,\" Andriushchenko told <em>The Register</em>. \"This scan checks for vulnerabilities and, if found, provides recommendations on actions to take to resolve before publishing.</p>\n<p>\"Ultimately, it is at the discretion of the user to implement these recommendations. In this case, that implementation did not happen.</p>\n<p>\"This project also includes code not generated by Lovable and the vulnerable database is not hosted by Lovable. We have been in contact with the creator of the app, who is now addressing the issue.\" ®</p> \n</div>",

Flee.\"</p>\n\n<p>Kent arrived at the datacenter and made it through what he called \"the usual mantrap routine\" – the combination of revolving doors and swipe-card barriers that properly secure datacenters use to regulate entries and exits.</p>\n\n\n<p>Once inside he found the server, tested to verify the system board had failed – and saw it had. He therefore replaced it, reseated the RAM and CPU, put everything back together and turned the machine on.</p>\n<p>It booted, everything worked as intended, and the client's admin logged in and verified all was well – and then started talking to someone else about what sounded like a software upgrade.</p>\n\n<p>Kent didn't stick around to learn more.</p>\n<p>\"My brief was to swap a board. The board was swapped,\" he told On Call. So he packed up the failed board and his tools, then left.</p>\n<p>On his way out, Kent swiped his card and the mantrap gate didn't open. A short time later he tried again, without success.</p>\n\n<p>\"After a few minutes I called out to the security desk behind the glass and the guard checked his screen and said: ‘We've been told to hold you. The admin says there's still a problem with the server.'\"</p>\n<p>This was a surprise to Kent, who just a few minutes earlier had watched the server boot and heard the client's admin acknowledge the fact.</p>\n<p>Fifteen minutes later nobody had explained what was going on.</p>\n<p>Kent called his dispatcher, who called the client. \"The message relayed back was that they were 'still having issues,' and I was not to be released until they were resolved.\"</p>\n<p>\"At this point I was no longer a field engineer.

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p><span class=\"label\">exclusive</span> Current-day LLMs are prediction engines and, as such, they can only find the most likely solution to problems, which is not necessarily the correct one. Though popular models have mostly become better at math, even top performer Gemini 3 Flash would receive a C if assessed with a letter grade.</p>\n<p>Researchers affiliated with Omni Calculator, a maker of online calculators for specific applications, have subjected a new set of AI models to the company's ORCA Benchmark, which consists of 500 practical math questions.</p>\n<p>In their initial evaluation last November, OpenAI's ChatGPT-5, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5, xAI's Grok 4, and DeepSeek's DeepSeek V3.2 (alpha) all did poorly, <a href=\"https://forums.theregister.com/forum/all/2025/11/17/ai_bad_math_orca/\" rel=\"nofollow\">scoring 63 percent or less</a> on math problems.</p>\n\n<p>The latest set of contestants consists of ChatGPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Flash, Grok 4.1, and DeepSeek V3.2 (stable release). Sonnet 4.5 didn't get re-evaluated as it hadn't changed and its successor had not been released during the testing period.</p>\n\n\n<p>For this second round of testing – provided to <em>The Register</em> prior to publication – all the models showed improvement except for Grok-4.1, which regressed.</p>\n<p>Gemini 3.1 Flash saw its accuracy hit 72.8 percent, a gain of 9.8 percentage points from its predecessor. DeepSeek V3.2 reached 55.2 percent, a gain of 3.2 percentage points from its alpha version. ChatGPT 5.2 achieved 54.0 percent accuracy, up 4.6 percentage points. And Grok 4.1 slipped to 60.2 percent, a loss of 2.6 percentage points.</p>\n\n<p>\"A calculator is predictable,\" said Dawid Siuda, researcher at ORCA, in a statement. \"Ask it the same question today or next year, and the answer stays the same. AI doesn't work that way. These systems are predicting the next likely word based on patterns. Mathematically, it's possible for a model to get a question right today and wrong tomorrow.\"</p>\n<p>The researchers attempted to assess the variability of model responses with a metric dubbed \"instability\" – a measure of how often models changed their answers when asked the same question twice.</p>\n\n<p>Gemini 3 Flash proved the most consistent, shifting only 46.1 percent for incorrect responses. ChatGPT, the researchers report, changed its answer 65.2 percent of the time. And DeepSeek V3.2 changed its answer for 68.8 percent of errors.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/clade_code_cves/\">Claude collaboration tools left the door wide open to remote code execution</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/veracode_security_ai/\">Rapid AI-driven development makes security unattainable, warns Veracode</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/copilot_pane_edge_outlook/\">Microsoft to auto-launch Copilot in Edge whenever you click a link from Outlook</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/llms_killed_privacy_star/\">LLMs killed the privacy star, we can't rewind, we've gone too far</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/reports/omni-research-on-calculation-in-ai-benchmark#how-we-put-ais-to-the-test\" rel=\"nofollow\">ORCA researchers</a> note that model performance improvements over time differ across domains. DeepSeek, they say, saw its performance on Biology &amp; Chemistry questions go from 10.5 percent accuracy to 43.9 percent. And Gemini 3 Flash reached Math &amp; Conversions accuracy of 93.2 percent, up from 83 percent. Grok 4.1 meanwhile lost 9 percentage points for its accuracy answering Health &amp; Sports problems and lost 5.3 percentage points for Biology &amp; Chemistry. </p>\n<p>The researchers speculate that recent updates to Grok may have prioritized other capabilities than quantitative reasoning.</p>\n<p>Noting that calculation errors now account for 39.8 percent of all mistakes, up from 33.4 percent, and that rounding errors slipped to 25.8 percent, down from 34.7 percent, the ORCA group conclude that AI models are getting better at making the math look right through formatting, while still struggling with arithmetic.</p>\n<p>\"AI models are essentially prediction engines rather than logic engines,\" Siuda told <em>The Register</em> in an email. \"Because they work on probability, they are basically guessing the next most likely number or word based on patterns they have seen before. It is like a student who memorizes every answer in a math book but never actually learns how to add.\"</p>\n\n<p>Siuda said we knew that about models previously and that hasn't changed.</p>\n<p>\"They might get the right answer most of the time, but the second you give them a unique or tricky problem, or multi-step task, they stumble because they are not truly calculating anything,\" he said. \"It's probably impossible to close this gap completely with the current technology, but if we merge LLMs with function calling well enough, it may be possible to solve.\"</p>\n<p>Function calling – farming out arithmetic to a deterministic source – is one way around the poor math handling of models. </p>\n<p>\"Major AI companies like Google and OpenAI are already doing this by having the AI call a function to do the actual calculation,\" explained Siuda. \"The real headache happens with long, messy problems. The AI has to keep track of every little result at each stage, and it usually gets overwhelmed or confused.\"</p>\n<p>Another possible avenue for improvement might be teaching models to verify responses through formal proofs. As noted in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09833-y\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nature</a> last November, Google's DeepMind has developed an approach that scored a silver medal result on the International Mathematical Olympiad through reinforcement learning based on proofs developed with the <a href=\"https://lean-lang.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lean</a> programming language and proof assistant.</p>\n<p>But for the time being, trust no AI. ®</p> \n</div>",

It works across Windows 10 and 11, with an Android module reportedly in development.</p>\n<p>Steaelite's operator interface runs entirely in the browser, and the RAT starts stealing victims' data even before the criminals open the dashboard. </p>\n\n<p>\"When a new victim connects, Steaelite automatically harvests browser-stored passwords, session cookies, and application tokens before the operator issues any commands,\" according to the AI-based security shop. \"Data theft begins at the moment of connection.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>The dashboard includes a primary toolbar plus two additional sections, with the primary toolbar alone including modules for remote code execution, file management, live streaming, webcam and microphone access, process management, clipboard monitoring, password recovery, installed program enumeration, location tracking, arbitrary file execution, URL opening, DDoS attacks, and VB.NET payload compilation. </p>\n<p>If a criminal is seeking more - like locking up victims' files and extorting them for cryptocurrency - an \"advanced tools\" panel includes capabilities for ransomware deployment, hidden RDP, Windows Defender disabling and exclusion management, and persistence installation.</p>\n\n<p>Plus, a third \"developer tools\" panel adds keylogging, client-to-victim chat, file searching, USB spreading, a bot-killing feature that removes competing malware, message box delivery, wallpaper modification, UAC bypass, and a clipper that swaps cryptocurrency wallet addresses during copy-paste operations. </p>\n<p>The clipper can silently transfer the victims' cryptocurrency to the attacker - without the victim ever knowing - by monitoring the clipboard for wallet addresses and replacing them with an attacker-controlled address before the paste completes.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/27/ransomware_chainalysis/\">Ransomware payments cratered in 2025, but attacks surged to record highs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/shinyhunters_wynn_resorts/\">ShinyHunters demands $1.5M not to leak Vegas casino and resort chain data</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/19/rmm_rat_trustconnect/\">Crims create fake remote management vendor that actually sells a RAT</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/27/odido_shinyhunters_leaks/\">Cops back Dutch telco Odido after second wave of ShinyHunters leaks</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\"The listing has been bumped consistently across multiple forum threads with 87 messages at the time of writing, and a promotional video demonstrating the tool's capabilities has been published on YouTube, a common distribution tactic for commercial remote access trojans looking to reach buyers outside of traditional forum ecosystems,\" BlackFog wrote.</p>\n<p>In addition to being an all-in-one RAT, this new malware makes it even easier for would-be criminals to pull off double extortion attacks - where the crooks first steal data, then encrypt victims' systems, and <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/27/odido_shinyhunters_leaks/\" target=\"_blank\">threaten to leak the stolen files</a> if the victim refuses to <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/shinyhunters_wynn_resorts/\" target=\"_blank\">pay a ransom</a>.</p>\n<p>\"Previously, double extortion required malware for initial access and exfiltration, then a separate ransomware payload for encryption, often involving coordination between initial access brokers and ransomware affiliates,\" BlackFog's team wrote. \"Steaelite puts both in the same interface, and the automated credential harvesting means data theft fires before the operator even interacts with the dashboard.\"</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, once the Android version goes live - and assuming it works as planned - a single Steaelite license could cover corporate Windows computers as well as the mobile devices employees use for authentication and messaging, the researchers note. ®</p> \n</div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>The Chinese agency that has accused the USA of cyberattacks on its own infrastructure to make Beijing look bad is back with another theory: Washington’s actions against cryptocurrency crooks are just attempts to dominate the global financial system.</p>\n<p>The agency behind these theories is China's National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC), which on Thursday published a document titled “Top Player: Analysis of Global Virtual Currency Assets Extortion under the U.S. Technological Hegemony.”</p>\n<p>The gist of it is that US actions such as <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/05/binance_us_sec_lawsuit/\" target=\"_blank\">prosecuting Binance co-founder Zhao Changpeng</a> and chasing alleged cyber-scam camp operator Chen Zhi were not law enforcement actions but attempts to ensure US hegemony over cryptocurrencies and preserve the role of the US dollar as the de facto currency of world trade.</p>\n\n<p>Even US president Donald Trump’s decision to pardon Zhao – which the commander in chief <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-pardon-of-crypto-billionaire-sparks-concerns-over-use-of-pardon-power-60-minutes-transcript/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">admitted</a> he made without knowing anything about the case – was just a cunning ploy to ensure Binance complied with US law in future so Washington gains more power over global crypto markets.</p>\n\n\n<p>CVERC says the US also targeted crypto outfits to profit by collecting massive fines and auctioning stolen cryptocurrencies retrieved by American authorities. It also accuses Washington of using action against cryptocurrencies to build a strategic reserve of virtual currencies, a Trump administration policy.</p>\n<p>The Chinese agency says Washington’s action against crypto companies is just one of its tactics, including “sponsored cyberattacks, weaponized technical standards, and digital cognitive warfare” that “serves its global expansion of political and economic interests while maintaining global hegemony.”</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/15/china_volt_typhoon_false_flag/\">China again claims Volt Typhoon cyber-attack crew was invented by the US to discredit it</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/12/cverc_prince_grou_scam_bitcoin/\">China hates crypto and scams, but is now outraged USA acquired bitcoin from a scammer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/07/trump_signs_bitcoin_reserve_eo/\">Crypto takes a dip as Trump signs Bitcoin Reserve order</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/07/asia_tech_news_in_brief/\">Asian tech players react to US tariffs with delays, doubts, deal-making</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The document neglects to mention the inconvenient fact that China has extradited and arrested Chen Zhi – and issued death sentences for others associated with scam camps in Cambodia. Nor does it consider that the proceeds of crypto cases brought by the US Federal government represent a tiny fraction of the nation’s budget.</p>\n<p>CVERC’s screed ends by noting China’s stance on cryptocurrency – they’re dangerous and therefore illegal – and contrasting that with a suggestion the US could exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction to seize crypto anywhere, anytime.</p>\n\n<p>Reality is, of course, rather more nuanced. The US has gone after suspected crypto-crooks outside its territory using well-established international procedures. However, the Trump administration has eased regulation on crypto companies, a contentious action as the Trump family has profited from its own virtual currency ventures. ®</p> \n</div>",

            "title": "Amazon and Nvidia open their wallets to lock in OpenAI's business while SoftBank keeps the lights on",
            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>The headlines say OpenAI on Friday announced $110 billion in new investment from Amazon, Nvidia, and SoftBank at a $730 billion pre-money valuation, though terms and conditions apply.</p>\n<p>Both Amazon's $50 billion and Nvidia's $30 billion <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/scaling-ai-for-everyone/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">investments</a> are tied to massive customer commitments by OpenAI and its partners. </p>\n<p>Of Amazon's investment, $35 billion will only be paid out \"when certain conditions are met.\" From what we gather, those conditions include <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/amazon-partnership/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">renting</a> out two gigawatts worth of Amazon's Trainium AI accelerators and the deployment of OpenAI models and services in AWS. The cloud provider will also be the \"exclusive third-party cloud distribution provider for OpenAI Frontier.\"</p>\n\n<p>Announced earlier this month, Frontier is OpenAI's new <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-frontier/\" target=\"_blank\">agent builder</a> aimed at enterprise customers. Curiously, OpenAI was quick to emphasize that \"nothing about today's announcements in any way changes the terms of the Microsoft and OpenAI relationship,\" and that Azure remains the exclusive cloud provider of its stateless OpenAI APIs and first party products, like Frontier.</p>\n\n\n<p>Nvidia's $30 billion investment appears to have similar provisions. In a <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/scaling-ai-for-everyone/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> published on Friday, the AI flag bearer announced an expanded partnership with Nvidia that would see the deployment of three gigawatts of inference and two gigawatts of training capacity built on the GPU slinger's Vera Rubin systems. Announced at CES in January, the racks are expected to begin shipping in the second half of 2026.</p>\n<p>The economics of datacenters can be tricky to pin down as it varies by region, but at a power usage effectiveness of 1.1, a gigawatt is enough for about 3,600 Vera Rubin NVL72 systems, assuming 250 kW per rack. </p>\n\n<p>At an <a href=\"https://www.nextplatform.com/ai/2026/01/06/nvidias-vera-rubin-platform-obsoletes-current-ai-iron-six-months-ahead-of-launch/4092179\" target=\"_blank\">estimated</a> cost of $8.4 million each, that's roughly $30 billion per gigawatt. However, compute only accounts for about half the cost of standing up a modern AI datacenter. </p>\n<p>The land, shell, power, and plumbing costs make up the remainder. This puts the cost of building and deploying 5 gigawatts worth of Vera Rubin accelerators at more than $300 billion. OpenAI is unlikely to take this on itself. Instead, we expect CEO Sam Altman to broker purchase agreements through its hyperscaler and neocloud partners, as it has done with Oracle and Crusoe for its Stargate facility in Abilene, Texas.</p>\n<p>Amazon is one of those partners. While OpenAI may be playing up Trainium in today's disclosures, its <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/aws-and-openai-partnership/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">existing</a> $38 billion tie-up with Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/03/openai_inks_38b_deal_with_aws/\" target=\"_blank\">announced back in November</a>, was specific to Nvidia GB200 and GB300 systems. That contract has now been extended to $100 billion over the next eight years.</p>\n\n<p>Both Amazon's and Nvidia's investments are structured in such a way as to guarantee a return on every dollar invested in OpenAI. The funding is essentially a discount on compute infrastructure that doesn't dilute their revenues while driving up OpenAI's valuation.</p>\n<p>This kind of circular dealing has become commonplace amid the AI boom, and all the big boys are taking part. Back in October, Nvidia rival AMD <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/06/stargate_openai_amd/\" target=\"_blank\">issued</a> OpenAI a warrant for roughly 10 percent of its stock. To claim it, all Altman needs to do is deploy six gigawatts of the chip designer's Instinct accelerators. This week, AMD <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/24/amd_copypastes_openai_6gw_chipsforstock/\" target=\"_blank\">copied and pasted</a> that deal, extending the same offer to social media and would-be AI magnate Meta.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/burger_kings_new_ai/\">Burger King turns to AI to flame broil employees who aren't friendly enough</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/nvidia_q4_2026/\">Nvidia hasn't made a cent in China lately – and might not need to given $120B profit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/openai_asks_its_friends_to/\">OpenAI asks its friends to tell their friends about Frontier</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/23/sam_altman_ai_efficiency/\">Altman: You think AI is wasted energy? Try raising 100 billion humans</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>While Nvidia and Amazon are clearly engaged in financial engineering, the same doesn't appear to be the case for SoftBank. Infamous spendthrift Masayoshi Son plans to <a href=\"https://group.softbank/en/news/press/20260227\" target=\"_blank\">invest</a> another $30 billion into the company to keep the lights on while Altman and crew continue their search for artificial general intelligence. SoftBank's contribution will be paid out in three tranches of $10 billion beginning in April and wrapping up in October.</p>\n<p>Even with annualized recurring revenue reportedly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-cfo-says-annualized-revenue-crosses-20-billion-2025-2026-01-19/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">exceeding</a> $20 billion and more than 50 million paying subscribers on the books, OpenAI is going to be reliant on outside funding for a while.

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>Digital intruders with possible links to North Korea have been infecting US education and healthcare sectors with a never-before-seen backdoor since at least December, according to security researchers.</p>\n<p>\"We observed that the attacker had infected several educational institutions, including a university that is connected to several other institutions, indicating a potential wider attack surface,\" Cisco Talos researcher Chetan Raghuprasad told <em>The Register</em>. \"Additionally, one of the affected entities was a healthcare facility, specifically for elderly care. </p>\n<p>\"Based on the nature of the victimology in the current intrusions, the actor likely has a motive for financial gain,\" Raghuprasad added.</p>\n\n<p>Talos <a href=\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/new-dohdoor-malware-campaign/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">spotted the ongoing campaign</a>, attributed to a group it tracks as UAT-10027, and says \"with low confidence\" that it's a North Korean crew based on similarities to Lazarus Group and other Pyongyang-backed gangs.</p>\n\n\n<p>The attackers likely gain initial access via social engineering and phishing, we're told, and the multi-stage infection ultimately delivers a new backdoor, Dohdoor, which shares similar technical characteristics to Lazarus Group's <a href=\"https://s2w.inc/en/resource/detail/941\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lazarloader</a> malware.</p>\n<p>After gaining access - potentially through a phishing email - the intruders execute a PowerShell downloader that runs a Windows batch script dropper from a remote staging server. The batch script then orchestrates a dynamic-link library (DLL) sideloading technique to execute a malicious Windows DLL named \"propsys.dll\" or \"batmeter.dll.\"</p>\n<h3 class=\"crosshead\">Brand new Dohdoor</h3>\n<p>The DLL, which Talos calls \"Dohdoor,\" operates as a loader, and it downloads, decrypts, and executes malicious payloads within legitimate Windows processes. This gives the intruders backdoor access to the victim's environment so it can download the next payload - a Cobalt Strike Beacon - into the machine's memory.</p>\n<p>UAT-10027 uses several stealthy techniques to help it avoid detection, including setting up command-and-control (C2) domains using Cloudflare infrastructure and using a technique called DNS-over-HTTPS to resolve the C2 server IP address. This helps the attackers bypass DNS security tools by ensuring all outbound traffic from compromised machines looks like legitimate HTTPS traffic to a trusted IP address.</p>\n\n<p>Dohoor also uses a technique called process hollowing to inject the payload into a legitimate Windows binary, allowing the malware to run without being detected.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Talos observed the new backdoor using an endpoint detection and response (EDR) bypass technique to bypass endpoint security tools that monitor Windows API calls. The backdoor does this by by unhooking system calls through user mode hooks in ntdll.dll.</p>\n<p>\"The NTDLL unhooking technique used to bypass EDR monitoring by identifying and restoring system call stubs aligns with features found in earlier Lazarloader variants,\" Talos' researchers Alex Karkins and Chetan Raghuprasad said in a Thursday report.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/24/north_koreas_lazarus_group_healthcare_medusa_ransomware/\">North Korea's Lazarus Group targets healthcare orgs with Medusa ransomware</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/09/pyongyangs_cyberspies_are_turning_qr/\">QR codes a powerful new phishing weapon in hands of Pyongyang cyberspies</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/18/amazon_blocked_fake_dprk_workers/\">Amazon blocked 1,800 suspected North Korean scammers seeking jobs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/01/ai_security_startup_ceo_posts/\">AI security startup CEO posts a job.

But addressing the problem with intelligent integration that links power, cooling, thermal management, workload scheduling, and AI-enabled forecasting could turn it into an advantage.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/14/x_energy_smr_fuel/\">Amazon-backed X-Energy gets green light for mini reactor fuel production</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/17/smr_investment/\">All aglow about DCs, investors launch $300M at microreactor startup</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/27/arm_riscv_hpc/\">HPC won't be an x86 monoculture forever – and it's starting to show</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/26/the_exascale_offensive/\">The exascale offensive: America's race to rule AI HPC</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\"We envision a future where datacenters are national assets: adaptive, efficient, and strengthening the nation's grid while fueling discovery and advancing America's leadership in AI,\" enthused Robert Wagner, ORNL associate laboratory director for energy science and technology.</p>\n<p>Notable names in the AI datacenter arena, including chipmakers Nvidia and AMD, welcomed the move.</p>\n<p>\"For decades, national labs like ORNL have relied on close collaboration with the computing industry to advance high-performance computing, and the next generation of AI is redefining requirements at the intersection of compute, power, and the grid.

Announced in October, Discovery is set to be a successor to Frontier, the world's first exascale system, while Lux is an AI cluster intended to advance machine learning. NGDCI will focus on the technologies required to operate these systems reliably while accelerating scientific breakthroughs, ORNL says. ®</p> \n</div>",
