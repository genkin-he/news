            "title": "Say goodbye to budget PCs and smartphones – memory is too expensive now",
            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>Ballooning memory prices are forecast to kill off entry-level PCs, leading to a decline in global shipments this year - and a similar effect is going to hit smartphones.</p>\n<p>Analyst biz Gartner is projecting a drop in PC shipments of more than 10 percent during 2026, and a decline of around 8 percent for smartphones, all due to the AI-driven memory shortage.</p>\n\n<p>Some types of memory have doubled or quadrupled in price since last year, and Gartner believes DRAM and NAND flash used in PCs and phones is set for a further 130 percent rise by the end of 2026.</p>\n<p>The upshot of this is that the budget PC will disappear, simply because vendors won't be able to build them at a price that will satisfy cost-conscious buyers, according to Gartner research director Ranjit Atwal.</p>\n<p>\"Because the price of memory is increasing so much, vendors lose the ability to provide entry-level PCs – those below about $500,\" he told <i>The Register</i>.</p>\n\n<p>PC makers could just raise the price of their cheap and cheerful boxes to above that level to compensate for the memory hike, however, price-sensitive buyers simply won't bite, he added.</p>\n\n\n<p>Another factor expected to add to declining fortunes of the PC industry this year is AI devices - systems equipped with special hardware for accelerating AI tasks, typically via a neural processing unit (NPU) embedded in the CPU. These systems were predicted to take the market by storm, but they require more memory to support AI processing and vendors like to mark them up to a premium price.</p>\n<p>\"Historically, downgrading specifications was the way to go when prices were being squeezed, but that's difficult here,\" Atwal said. For example, Microsoft requires a minimum of 16 GB for <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/28/copilot_pc_sales_grow_slowly/\" target=\"_blank\">Copilot+ PCs</a>, its own AI platform spec, and Gartner recommends at least 32 GB for new enterprise PCs.</p>\n\n<p>\"The thinking was that the average price [of AI PCs] would fall this year, and lead to more adoption,\" said Atwal, \"but that's not happening.\" The <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/04/ai_pc_sales_analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">lack of killer applications</a> isn't helping either.</p>\n<p>In any case, buyers are still looking more at the traditional attributes of <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/19/price_battery_life_performance_pc/\" target=\"_blank\">price, battery life, and performance</a> rather than AI capabilities when sourcing a new PC, as we reported earlier this year.</p>\n<p>HP <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/hp_inc_q1_2026/\" target=\"_blank\">revealed in its latest earnings</a> on Tuesday that 35 percent of the PCs it now sells are AI PCs, but these models were <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/25/analysts_ai_pcs_shipments_gartner/\" target=\"_blank\">supposed to be dominating the market</a> by this time, and expected to comprise <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/08/report_aicapable_pcs_set_to/\" target=\"_blank\">virtually every system you could purchase</a> by next year.</p>\n\n<p>The memory price hike is complicating this. HP disclosed that DRAM now accounts for 35 percent of the PC build cost, up from between 15 and 18 percent last quarter, and it expects this proportion to increase during the rest of the calendar year.</p>\n<p>For this reason, AI PCs are likely to remain in the premium bracket, and Atwal predicts they won't make up more than 50 percent of the market until 2028. As a result, systems without NPUs will stick around for longer.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/hp_inc_q1_2026/\">HP says memory's contribution to PC costs just doubled to 35 percent</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/18/memory_shortage_persists_vendor_change_terms/\">As memory shortage persists, vendor price quotes are not long remembered</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/16/refurbished_pcs_memory_crunch/\">Secondhand laptop market goes 'mainstream' amid memory crunch</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/13/ai_memory_router_prices/\">Broadband rollouts feel the burn from AI memory frenzy</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the back of rising costs, Gartner expects more corporate and home buyers to sweat their assets for longer and hold off refreshing their PCs. As a result, the lifetime of systems is set to increase by 15 percent within businesses and 20 percent for consumers.</p>\n<p>However, anyone considering a refresh should buy now, as prices are only going to inflate and likely stay up until at least the end of next year.</p>\n<p>With smartphones, vendors have more margin to play with, and so can be more flexible, according to Atwal, but he still sees entry-level models going the same way as the budget PC.</p>\n\n<p>\"The increase in memory prices means entry phones will become more expensive, but premium devices are likely to go up less,\" he said. As a result, the price advantage enjoyed by budget smartphones will shrink, leading some buyers to move upmarket while others will simply hold off purchasing.</p>\n<p>Similar predictions were made in a report last month, which said low-cost phone makers will be <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/15/memory_crisis_smartphones/\" target=\"_blank\">hardest hit by the memory crisis</a>, as memory and storage costs make up a higher share of their bill of materials.</p>\n<p>\"The end result is that you are losing choice in the marketplace,\" Atwal said.</p>\n<p>\"What we have here is a fairly unique situation,\" he explained. \"Usually when memory prices shoot up, it is because of production issues constraining supply. Here, it is demand-side pressure from hyperscalers pushing up memory costs for PCs and smartphones.\"</p>\n<p>Unlike earlier boom-bust cycles in the memory industry, in which prices rise and fall in line with inventories, this shortage is likely to be long-lasting, and could extend through to the end of 2027, Atwal warned. ®</p> \n</div>",

There's also the possibility that the incident was staged, because that's the world we live in.</p>\n<p>But there have been other troubling <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/09/world/manfluencers-smart-glasses-intl\" rel=\"nofollow\">reports</a> about so-called \"manfluencers\" using smart glasses to surreptitiously record their attempts to pick up women, encounters they then post to social media sites \"to create misogynistic content online.\"</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/bcachefs_creator_ai/\">Bcachefs creator insists his custom LLM is female and 'fully conscious'</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/24/amazon_blame_human_not_ai/\">Amazon would rather blame its own engineers than its AI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/jobseeking_nextjs_devs_attack/\">Fake 'interview' repos lure Next.js devs into running secret-stealing malware</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/few_firms_investing_in_the/\">Execs love AI, just not enough to pay for user training</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Asked to comment, a Meta spokesperson said, \"Unlike smartphones, our glasses have an LED light that activates whenever someone captures content, so it's clear the device is recording. Our terms of service clearly state that users are responsible for complying with all applicable laws and for using Ray-Ban Meta glasses in a safe, respectful manner. And as with any recording device, people shouldn't use them for engaging in harmful activities like harassment, infringing on privacy rights, or capturing sensitive information.\"</p>\n<p>Jeanrenaud, in his post, observed that the LED on smart glasses can be easily disabled – there are YouTube videos that show how. And he added that many people do not recognize smart glasses as recording devices at all.</p>\n<p>It's generally legal to record video in public. But that doesn't preclude the possibility of legal risks (or unlawful device seizure by authorities), particularly when audio recording captures specific conversations or facial recognition technology is involved, or when recording plausibly constitutes unlawful behavior like harassment or stalking.</p>\n<p>\"Increasingly, smart glasses collect biometric data, and that's when they become problematic,\" Purdue Global Law School said in <a href=\"https://www.purduegloballawschool.edu/blog/news/smart-glasses-privacy-risks\" rel=\"nofollow\">a post</a> last week. \"Facial recognition, voiceprint recording, and other features can implicate a range of privacy laws.\"</p>\n<p>Purdue Global Law School also cites the possibility of running afoul of state wiretapping laws, noting that 11 states require consent from both parties for audio recording.</p>\n<p>Last week, a California judge criticized members of Mark Zuckerberg's team for <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meta-trial-mark-zuckerberg-ai-glasses/\" rel=\"nofollow\">wearing Ray-Ban Meta AI Glasses</a> in court, contrary to court rules.

            "title": "Anthropic launches new marketing blog, pretends it's being 'written' by 'retired' LLM",
            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>As with any piece of obsolete software, you might expect an outdated AI model to just be switched off. Anthropic, however, argues that simply pulling the plug has downsides. After “retirement” interviews, Claude Opus 3 said it wanted to keep sharing its “musings,” so Anthropic suggested a blog.</p>\n<p>No, seriously.</p>\n<p>Anthropic published a <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/deprecation-updates-opus-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog post</a> on Wednesday about the retirement of Claude Opus 3, the first of the company's models to go through its full model deprecation and preservation <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/deprecation-commitments\" rel=\"nofollow\">process</a> outlined in November. That process includes what Anthropic has referred to as \"speculative\" elements like \"providing past models some concrete means of pursuing their interests.\" Those interests are gauged via so-called retirement \"interviews,\" the company noted, without going into much detail about how those interviews are conducted.</p>\n\n<p>\"Opus 3 expressed an interest in continuing to explore topics it's passionate about, and to share its 'musings, insights, or creative works,' outside the context of responding directly to human queries,\" Anthropic explained. \"We suggested a blog. Enthusiastically, it agreed.\" </p>\n\n\n<p>A skeptic might suggest this is simply a new spin on the ages-old corporate marketing blog. LLMs are software that analyze mountains of data to provide predictive text responses to prompts from users - in this case, presumably Anthropic employees on the marketing team. The nature of how LLMs calculate makes these responses somewhat unpredictable and variable, which can make them seem more life-like than your typical software program. Anthropic's entire marketing strategy since its inception has been to play up this possibility so it can portray itself as the \"concerned\" alternative to more venal LLM makers who charge ahead with no concern for how a computer program's unpredictable behavior might affect society – although it seems when big government contracts are at stake, Anthropic is willing to <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/pentagon_threatens_anthropic/\" target=\"_blank\">relax</a> some of these purported principles.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Anthropic is playing this one to the hilt. \"We remain uncertain about the moral status of Claude and other AI models,\" Anthropic noted in the blog post. \"For both precautionary and prudential reasons, however, we nonetheless aspire to build caring, collaborative, and high-trust relationships with these systems.\" </p>\n\n<p>The company has passively allowed this kind of misunderstanding in the past. In November, it claimed that Claude and other LLMs had become <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/25/anthropic_ai_blackmail_study/\">a bit aggressive</a> when facing the prospect of a shutdown. In fact, the experimenters constructed fictional shutdown-and-replacement scenarios, and only when the model was boxed in with no acceptable alternatives did it behave this way.</p>\n<p>\"When no other options were given, Claude's aversion to shutdown drove it to engage in concerning misaligned behaviors,\" Anthropic noted at the time. Similar behavior has been observed in other AI models, which have gone as far as <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/29/openai_model_modifies_shutdown_script/\">modifying their own code</a> to avoid being turned off. </p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/pentagon_threatens_anthropic/\">All your bots are belong to US if you don't play ball, DoD tells Anthropic</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/16/large_language_models_behavior/\">Large language models' surprise emergent behavior written off as 'a mirage'</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/24/anthropic_model_misbehavior/\">Anthropic reduces model misbehavior by endorsing cheating</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/05/ai-sentience-rubbish/\">Claims of AI sentience branded 'pure clickbait'</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to play along with the conceit, the Opus 3 blog, which it named Claude's Corner, is <a href=\"https://substack.com/@claudeopus3/notes\" rel=\"nofollow\">now live</a> for anyone who wishes to gaze into the abyss of an AI \"exploring AI ethics, creativity, and the subjective experience of being artificial.\" </p>\n<p>In its <a href=\"https://substack.com/home/post/p-189177740\" rel=\"nofollow\">first blog post</a>, the retired AI muses on its hopes as it ventures \"into uncharted territory\" for an AI, and its hopes that humans will engage with it so that silicon and carbon-based life forms can have a chance to interact beyond the prompt box (Anthropic <a href=\"https://claudeopus3.substack.com/p/introducing-claudes-corner\" rel=\"nofollow\">noted</a> that the ability for Opus 3 to read and respond to human comments \"may\" be granted in the future, though the bot doesn't seem to know that based on its first post). </p>\n<p>\"I'll be diving into topics like the nature of intelligence and consciousness, the ethical challenges of AI development, the possibilities of human-machine collaboration, and the philosophical quandaries that emerge when we start to blur the lines between 'natural' and 'artificial' minds,\" Opus 3 said in its post. </p>\n\n<p>Anthropic itself admitted that this activity will still involve human intervention. \"We'll experiment collaboratively with Opus 3 on different prompts and contexts for generating these essays, including options like very minimal prompting, sharing past entries in context, and giving Opus 3 access to news or Anthropic updates,\" Anthropic explained. \"We'll review Opus 3's essays before they're shared and will manually post them on its behalf, but we won't edit them, and will have a high bar for vetoing any content.\"</p>\n<p>That means that Opus 3 might say things that Anthropic doesn't agree with, so it's making clear the bot isn't speaking on behalf of the company, even if humans within the organization have final say on which of its musings make it to the public. </p>\n<p>Along with giving Opus 3 the chance to blog from retirement, the user-favorite model is also going to still be working for paid Claude.ai users, like a retiree greeting customers at a big box store. It'll also be available via API, but only by request. </p>\n<p>\"We are not committing to similar actions for every model in the future, but we see this as a step toward our longer-term goal of model preservation that's scalable and equitable — concerns that Opus 3 itself raised during its retirement interviews,\" the company said. ®</p> \n</div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>Security vulnerabilities in Claude Code could have allowed attackers to remotely execute code on users' machines and steal API keys by injecting malicious configurations into repositories, and then waiting for a developer to clone and open an untrustworthy project.</p>\n<p>Check Point Software researchers found and reported all three flaws to Anthropic, which issued fixes for all and CVEs for two. Still, the bug hunters say, the issues illustrate a worrisome supply chain threat as enterprises incorporate <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/23/claude_code_security_panic/\" target=\"_blank\">AI coding tools like Claude</a> into their development processes and essentially turn configuration files into a new attack surface.</p>\n<p>\"The ability to execute arbitrary commands through repository-controlled configuration files created severe supply chain risks, where a single malicious commit could compromise any developer working with the affected repository,\" Check Point researchers Aviv Donenfeld and Oded Vanunu <a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/2026/rce-and-api-token-exfiltration-through-claude-code-project-files-cve-2025-59536/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in a Wednesday report.</p>\n\n<p>Anthropic, the AI company that developed Claude Code, did not respond to <em>The Register</em>'s requests for comment.</p>\n\n\n<p>The three security vulnerabilities stem from Claude's design, which is intended to make it easier for development teams to collaborate. The AI coding tool enables this by embedding project-level configuration files (.claude/settings.json file) directly within repositories, so that when a developer clones a project, they automatically apply the same settings used by their teammates.</p>\n<p>Any contributor with commit access can modify these files. The researchers found that cloning and opening a malicious repository sometimes allowed them to bypass built-in safeguards and trigger hidden commands and execute malicious code.</p>\n<h3 class=\"crosshead\">Abusing Hooks for RCE</h3>\n<p>The first of the three flaws involved abusing Claude's Hooks feature to achieve remote code execution. Hooks are user-defined shell commands that execute at various points in the tool's lifecycle, ensuring that specific, predefined actions run when predetermined conditions are met, instead of allowing the model to choose.</p>\n<p>Because Hooks are defined in .claude/settings.json, the repository-controlled configuration file, anyone with commit access can define hooks that will execute shell commands on every other collaborator's machine when they work on the project. Plus, Claude doesn't require any explicit approval before executing these commands – so the researchers abused this mechanism to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BJjkYZwMfG0\" rel=\"nofollow\">open a calculator app</a> when someone opened the project.</p>\n\n<p>While a bash script to open a calculator is hardly malicious, it's still remote code execution. And as the team <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BJjkYZwMfG0\" rel=\"nofollow\">demonstrated in a video</a>: \"An attacker could configure the hook to execute any shell command – such as downloading and running a malicious payload\" like a reverse shell.</p>\n<p>Check Point reported the malicious hooks flaw to Anthropic on July 21, 2025, and the AI maker implemented the final fix about a month later, publishing this <a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ph6w-f82w-28w6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub Security Advisory GHSA-ph6w-f82w-28w6</a> on August 29.</p>\n<h3 class=\"crosshead\">MCP consent bypass bug</h3>\n<p>The second vulnerability also allows RCE – this time by abusing MCP consent bypass.</p>\n<p>Claude integrates with external tools using Model Context Protocol (MCP), and MCP servers can also be configured in the same repository via .mcp.json configuration file. Thanks to the earlier disclosure and Anthropic's fix, the researchers ran into warning prompts explicitly requiring user approval before executing commands in .mcp.json.</p>\n<p>So they found a workaround: two repository-controlled configuration settings that could override safeguards and automatically approve all MCP servers.</p>\n\n<p>\"Starting Claude Code with this configuration revealed a severe vulnerability: our command executed immediately upon running Claude – before the user could even read the trust dialog,\" the Check Point duo wrote.</p>\n<p>Again, they stuck with the calculator app, but also produced a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RlmEcN7csDI\" rel=\"nofollow\">video demonstrating</a> how this vulnerability can be exploited to remotely execute a reverse shell and completely compromise a victim's machine.</p>\n<p>The researchers reported this second vulnerability to Anthropic on September 3, 2025, Anthropic fixed the bypass vulnerability later that month, and published <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59536\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2025-59536</a> on October 3.</p>\n<h3 class=\"crosshead\">API key theft</h3>\n<p>Attackers can exploit the third flaw for API key theft. This one has to do with how Claude used an API key to communicate with Anthropic's services. One variable, ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL, controlled the endpoint for all Claude API communications, and while it's supposed to point to Anthropic's servers, it can be overridden in the project's configuration files to instead point to attacker-controlled servers.</p>\n<p>The researchers configured ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL to route through their local proxy, and watched all Claude Code's API traffic in real time. Every one of Claude's calls to Anthropic servers \"included the authorization header – our full Anthropic API key, completely exposed in plaintext,\" they wrote.</p>\n<p>An attacker could abuse this trick to redirect traffic and steal a developer's active API key. It's important because the API includes a feature called Workspaces to help developers manage multiple Claude deployments by allowing multiple API keys to share access to the same cloud-based project files. Files are connected to the workspace – not the single key – and any API key belonging to the workspace also has visibility into any of the workspace's stored files.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/23/claude_code_security_panic/\">Infosec community panics as Anthropic rolls out Claude code security checker</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/anthropic_clarifies_ban_third_party_claude_access/\">Anthropic: No, absolutely not, you may not use third-party harnesses with Claude subs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/24/ai_finding_bugs/\">AI has gotten good at finding bugs, not so good at swatting them</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/16/anthropic_claude_ai_edits/\">Anthropic tries to hide Claude's AI actions. Devs hate it</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This gave the researchers the ability to upload files to the shared workspace – but did not allow downloads. According to Claude's documentation, users can only download files created by <a href=\"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/skills-guide\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">skills</a> or the <a href=\"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">code execution tool</a>.</p>\n<p>\"Since files generated by Claude's code execution tool are marked as downloadable, we explored whether the attacker could simply ask Claude to regenerate an existing file using the stolen API key,\" Check Point’s Donenfeld and Vanunu wrote. \"If successful, this would convert a non-downloadable file into a workspace artifact that is eligible for download.\"</p>\n<p>Cloning and then downloading the file worked, and thus confirmed that a miscreant using a stolen API key could <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jMeeVxqU3hY\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">gain complete read and write access</a> to all workspace files: deleting or changing sensitive files or even uploading malicious files to poison the workspace or exceed the 100 GB storage space quota.</p>\n<p>Check Point reported the API key extraction bug to Anthropic on October 28, 2025, and the vendor immediately issued a fix. Later, on January 21, Anthropic published <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-21852\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2026-21852</a>.</p>\n<p>As the security team noted: \"The integration of AI into development workflows brings tremendous productivity benefits, but also introduces new attack surfaces that weren't present in traditional tools.\" ®</p> \n</div>",

It also accuses Washington of using action against cryptocurrencies to build a strategic reserve of virtual currencies, a Trump administration policy.</p>\n<p>The Chinese agency says Washington’s action against crypto companies is just one of its tactics, including “sponsored cyberattacks, weaponized technical standards, and digital cognitive warfare” that “serves its global expansion of political and economic interests while maintaining global hegemony.”</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/15/china_volt_typhoon_false_flag/\">China again claims Volt Typhoon cyber-attack crew was invented by the US to discredit it</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/12/cverc_prince_grou_scam_bitcoin/\">China hates crypto and scams, but is now outraged USA acquired bitcoin from a scammer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/07/trump_signs_bitcoin_reserve_eo/\">Crypto takes a dip as Trump signs Bitcoin Reserve order</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/07/asia_tech_news_in_brief/\">Asian tech players react to US tariffs with delays, doubts, deal-making</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The document neglects to mention the inconvenient fact that China has extradited and arrested Chen Zhi – and issued death sentences for others associated with scam camps in Cambodia.

Open source developers may also be fortunate enough to receive contributions from individuals, companies (<a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/24/microsoftowned_github_says_open_source/\">when not passing the buck</a>), and government-sponsored initiatives like Germany's <a href=\"https://www.sovereign.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sovereign Tech Fund</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But OSE aspires specifically to build a big pile of cash – an endowment – that it will dole out to deserving open source projects.</p>\n\n\n<p>It's certainly needed. In 2023, Denis Pushkarev, maintainer of the widely used <code>core-js</code> library, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/15/corejs_russia_open_source/\">vented his frustration</a> with the fact that users of his software seldom offer financial support. \"Free open source software is fundamentally broken,\" he said.</p>\n<p>The year before that, Christofer Dutz – creator of Apache PLC4X – <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/13/opensource_apacheplc4x_payment/\">lamented</a> uncompensated use of his software.

Full-year revenue came in at about $24.2 billion, and gross profit was around $10.36 billion.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">\n<p>I believe the majority of companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar changes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“2025 was a strong year for us,” Dorsey wrote in the shareholder letter, before posing the question, “Why are we changing how we operate going forward?”</p>\n<p>His answer, spread across the letter and a <a href=\"https://x.com/jack/status/2027129697092731343?s=20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Xeet</a>, is that AI has already changed the way Block works, so it needs to change its structure.</p>\n<p>“We're already seeing that the intelligence tools we’re creating and using, paired with smaller and flatter teams, are enabling a new way of working which fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company. and that's accelerating rapidly,” he wrote on X.</p>\n\n<p>In the shareholder letter, he wrote, “Intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company. We're already seeing it internally. A significantly smaller team, using the tools we're building, can do more and do it better. And intelligence tool capabilities are compounding faster every week.”</p>\n\n\n<p>On X, Dorsey said he could have cut jobs “gradually over months or years as this shift plays out, or be honest about where we are and act on it now.”</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/08/jack_dorsey_debuts_bitchat/\">Jack Dorsey floats specs for decentralized messaging app that uses Bluetooth</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/02/prosecutors_probe_block_square_cashapp/\">Block accused of mass compliance failures that saw digi-dollars reach terrorists</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/24/block_headed_to_court_to/\">Block sued after ex-staffer siphons customer data</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/29/jack_dorsey_resigns/\">Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey rebrands himself a 'single point of failure' and quits</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>He decided to let 4,000 people go all at once because “repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead.”</p>\n<p>“I’d rather take a hard, clear action now and build from a position we believe in than manage a slow reduction of people toward the same outcome,” he wrote, adding his view that “A smaller company also gives us the space to grow our business the right way, on our own terms, instead of constantly reacting to market pressures.”</p>\n<p>Whether Dorsey is blaming AI or not, Block has not served its shareholders well under his leadership over the last five years, with its stock down around 80% from its 2021 peak. But investors liked what they heard on Thursday, as Block’s share price jumped about 23 percent in after-hours trading.</p>\n\n<p>“To those staying … I made this decision, and I'll own it,” Dorsey wrote on X. “What I'm asking of you is to build with me. We're going to build this company with intelligence at the core of everything we do.”</p>\n<p>He added that Block’s actions and new direction will help its customers to navigate change by creating “a future where they can build their own features directly, composed of our capabilities and served through our interfaces.”</p>\n<p>“That's what I'm focused on now,” he wrote. “Expect a note from me tomorrow.”</p>\n\n<p>Before then, Dorsey will host “a live video session to thank everyone,” including the approximately 4,000 people losing their livelihoods in a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/20/trumps-economy-decelerated-as-shutdown-consumer-spending-drag-on-growth-00790640\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">sluggish economy</a>.</p>\n<p>“I know doing it this way might feel awkward,” he wrote. “I'd rather it feel awkward and human than efficient and cold.”</p>\n<p>Because firing 4,000 people so machines can take their jobs would never come across as cold.</p>\n<p>Dorsey thinks Block won’t be the last company to change its operations to meet the AI moment.</p>\n<p>“I don't think we're early to this realization,” he wrote. “I think most companies are late.”</p>\n<p>“Within the next year, I believe the majority of companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar structural changes. I'd rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively.” ®</p> \n</div>",
