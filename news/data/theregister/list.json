            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>ServiceNow claims it has created an AI agent that is currently solving 90 percent of the inbound IT tickets to the company's own employee help desk.</p>\n<p>ServiceNow said, in addition to using the Autonomous Workforce bot internally, select ServiceNow customers are testing it as well. The firm expects to have the product generally available by the second half of the year.</p>\n<p>The internal tickets include high volume issues such as password resets, account unlocks, software access requests, email issues, and VPN connectivity, handled end-to-end within defined permissions and escalation paths.</p>\n\n<p>“In our own environment, over 90% of targeted Level 1 volume is handled autonomously, with resolution rates above 99% for those categories and materially faster than human-only workflows,” a ServiceNow spokesperson told <em>The Register</em>.</p>\n\n\n<p>It accomplishes this by having the Autonomous Workforce operate on top of the live configuration management database (CMDB), active workflows, policy engines, approval chains, and real transaction history – all updated in real time every time a ticket closes, a workflow executes, or a policy changes, ServiceNow said.</p>\n<p>ServiceNow could use a win as Salesforce is targeting its enterprise ITSM customers with its own Agentforce IT Service product. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/salesforce_q4_2026/\" target=\"_blank\">boasted</a> of poaching five ServiceNow customers during the most recent quarter's earnings call.</p>\n\n<p>Another challenge for ServiceNow is how the Autonomous Workforce will adapt to customer environments. While ServiceNow says its internal documentation is backed with 20 years of experience, documentation inside real world help desks traditionally has been poor to non-existent.</p>\n<p>“The documentation problem is real, and frankly most vendors pretend it isn't. The reason ServiceNow can answer differently is the two decades of structured data that lives inside the platform itself,” according to group VP for AI products Nenshad Bardoliwalla. “This isn't a system that reads your Word docs and hopes for the best ... The pitch is ‘we're the control plane that aggregates signal from the tools you already have, and we fill the gaps with structured workflow logic built over two decades.’”</p>\n<p>Bardoliwalla said, the Autonomous Workforce uses historic ticket information as the knowledge base when answering questions. So far the system has been tested internally by ServiceNow employees feeding it tickets.</p>\n\n<p>ServiceNow broke those tickets down for <em>The Register</em> by type and subtype – which is how help desks organize and manage tickets - revealing that the Autonomous Workforce solved 90 percent of ticket types related to networking (46 percent), hardware (11 percent), and software (43 percent), as well as the following subtypes: enterprise app access, cloud authentication services (33 percent), collaboration tools issues (13 percent), VPN and network connectivity issues (7 percent), laptop and hardware performance issues (8 percent), and software installs and configuration (6 percent).</p>\n<p>“How does it know it got the right answer? Because the outcome is measurable inside the same platform,” Bardoliwalla said. “Did the ticket resolve? Did the workflow complete? Did the approval get the right sign-off? ServiceNow closes the loop in a way that a standalone LLM sitting on top of a SharePoint folder simply cannot.”</p>\n<p>Bardoliwalla said ServiceNow knows the device, the user, the identity, the access policies, and the historical incident patterns tied to a configuration item, but critically, he said, the Autonomous Workforce knows when it needs to stop and escalate a problem.</p>\n<p>“When the gap genuinely exists, the autonomous worker will know what it doesn't know,” he said. “This is actually a differentiator: a system that says ‘I can resolve 70% of this autonomously and here's exactly why I'm escalating the other 30%’ is more trustworthy than one that hallucinates an answer.”</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/14/servicenow_buys_pyramid_analytics_to/\">ServiceNow can't seem to keep its wallet closed, snaps up small AI analytics company</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/28/servicenow_ai_agents/\">ServiceNow boasts about years of sweat equity that went into making its AI agents smarter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/30/servicenow_outlines_coceo_structure/\">ServiceNow lays out possible co-CEO structure, but says no change imminent</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/25/servicenow_100m_ai_savings/\">ServiceNow eyes $100M in AI-powered headcount savings</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Forrester vice president and principal analyst Charles Betz said if ServiceNow has managed to achieve autonomous execution in the Level 1 help desk, that is a “milestone,” since for years AI in the help desk was used for deflection, recommendation, or faster routing.</p>\n<p>“End‑to‑end execution at scale is different; it does legitimize AI as operational infrastructure rather than just a productivity aid,” he said. “So yes, this returns real margin — but not simply by shrinking L1 headcount. The value shows up as faster resolution, fewer escalations, better utilization of skilled staff, and the ability to absorb growth without linear increases in labor. The limiting factor shifts from ‘Can the AI do it?’ to whether the organization has the data quality, workflows, and governance discipline to sustain that higher baseline.”</p>\n<p>He said it also opens the door to the <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/blogs/the-automation-paradox-strikes-again-lessons-from-woolworths-amazon-era-productivity-play\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">automation paradox</a>, which he said is similar to what Lisanne Bainbridge wrote about in her 1983 paper, <a href=\"https://ckrybus.com/static/papers/Bainbridge_1983_Automatica.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Ironies of Automation</a>. For the help desk, this means what used to be basic support becomes table stakes and “users surface higher‑order needs once the friction is removed.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a well‑known dynamic that kicks in once the low‑hanging fruit is harvested. Level 1 doesn’t disappear — the baseline rises,” Betz told <em>The Register</em>. “Routine, procedural issues get automated away, and what remains are harder, more ambiguous, more cross‑system problems. In systems terms, you get complexity creep rather than pure volume reduction.” ®</p> \n</div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>The bot’s nagging will continue until morale improves. Burger King is rolling out a new employee-facing AI that, among other things, will listen to employees’ customer interactions to ensure they’re being friendly enough - as if working in fast food weren’t hard enough already.</p>\n<p>Burger King announced a wider rollout of the BK Assistant, along with its employee AI assistant-cum-narc \"Patty,\" on Thursday during an investor event <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/restaurant-brands-international-is-hosting-an-investor-event-on-february-26-2026-302694931.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">hosted</a> by parent company Restaurant Brands International. According to RBI, BK Assistant has been deployed for testing in approximately 500 stores around the US, and the company wants to have it available in all 7,000 US Burger Kings by the end of 2026. </p>\n<p>A promo video played during the investor event livestream showed Patty talking to an incoming shift manager, sharing current \"friendliness scores,\" the status of low-stock items, and other data points a team leader might need to know. </p>\n\n<p>Burger King employees were shown being reminded of recipes, getting cleaning instructions, and, a bit more obtrusively, being told they met upselling goals when convincing a customer to add an item they didn't originally ask for to their order. </p>\n\n\n<p>According to a Burger King representative, the BK Assistant unifies point of sale, kitchen equipment, inventory, and digital ordering systems into a single umbrella product built with proprietary Burger King architecture on top of a base model from OpenAI. </p>\n<p>Despite the fact that the video showed a manager being told how friendly her team was being with customers, Burger King insisted that Patty isn't going to spy on employees and report them when they're having a bad shift. </p>\n\n<p>\"It is not designed to track nor evaluate employees saying specific words or phrases,\" a Burger King spokesperson told <em>The Register</em> in an email. \"BK Assistant is a coaching and operational support tool built to help our restaurant teams manage complexity and stay focused on delivering a great Guest experience.\"</p>\n<p>The fast food chain has explored using aggregated keywords, like \"welcome,\" \"please,\" and \"thank you\" as signals to help managers understand broader service patterns at their restaurants, but \"it's not about scoring individuals or enforcing scripts,\" the spokesperson said. </p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2021/09/20/bork/\">A Burger King where the only Whopper is the BSOD font</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/23/bossware_monitor_remote_employees/\">Bossware booms as bots determine whether you're doing a good job</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/02/mcdonalds_password_advice/\">McDonald's is not lovin' your bigmac, happymeal, and mcnuggets passwords</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/14/advanced_workplace_tech_study/\">AI and wearables are scaring the wellbeing out of workers</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\"We believe hospitality is fundamentally human,\" the company rep told us. \"The role of this technology is to support our teams so they can stay present with guests.\"</p>\n<p>Fast food AI has been a bit of a mixed bag for companies that have tried it, though to be fair most of the failures have been on the customer service end. </p>\n<p>McDonald's <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/17/mcdonalds_ai_drivethru/\">gave up on drive-through AI</a>, and Taco Bell has also <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyk2p55g8o\" rel=\"nofollow\">rethought</a> its <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/01/ai_taco_bell/\">trial run</a> after mishaps.

Instead, it's shifting toward <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/11/starbucks_ai_baristas/\" target=\"_blank\">AI tools that assist staff</a> — echoing Burger King's employee-assist strategy.</p>\n\n<p>There's no guarantee Burger King's initiative will stick, naturally, but be prepared for employees to start seeming extra friendly in case Patty is listening in. ®</p> \n</div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>Microsoft has found some friends to make desktop devices that boot into its Windows 365 cloud PCs.</p>\n<p>The software giant was previously the only vendor to make such machines, in the form of the Windows 365 Link machines it <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/19/microsoft_windows_365_link/\" target=\"_blank\">debuted</a> in 2024 and <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/03/windows_365_link/\" target=\"_blank\">delivered</a> the next year.</p>\n<p>Dell and ASUS have now joined the cloudy PC party.</p>\n\n<p>ASUS’s model is the NUC 16 for Windows 365. Readers may recall that “NUC” stands for Next Unit of Computing, a brand Intel coined for a range of PCs it and later <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/19/intel_asus_nuc_deal/\" target=\"_blank\">sold</a> to ASUS.</p>\n\n\n<p>After the Taiwanese company acquired NUCs, ASUS told <i>The Register</i> it <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/08/asus_nuc_year_one/\" target=\"_blank\">wanted</a> to take the machines into new markets.</p>\n<p>And now it has, and <a href=\"https://www.connect.asus.com/notify-me-ASUS-NUC-16-Windows-365\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">says</a> its machine offers “the latest Intel processor” without specifying a model, but promises DDR5 memory, Wi-Fi 6E, 2.5GbE LAN, Bluetooth 5.3, HDMI, USB Type-C, and USB Type-A ports will all be present in the 0.7-liter device and that it can support three displays.</p>\n\n<p>Dell’s device is the Pro Desktop for Windows 365. The company hasn't offered any specs beyond a promise it can drive three displays.</p>\n<p>Microsoft says tweaks to the minimalist “Cloud CPC” OS that runs on the machines will add support for pairing Bluetooth devices “during the out-of-box experience” and support for custom branding on the sign-in screen.</p>\n<p>The software giant suggests these devices as especially secure and manageable, because they don’t require users to store anything on the device or on-premises – apps and data are all in Azure. Of course the company says its own Intune tool makes conventional PCs easy to secure and manage, too. And to complicate matters further, Microsoft also offers tech that allows <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/24/windows_365_boot_preview/\" target=\"_blank\">vanilla PCs</a> to boot straight into a cloudy PC instead of starting up a local version of Windows, or <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/18/microsoft_cloud_apps_omnissa_update/?_gl=1*1lb1dmn*_ga*MTI0MjE1MDMxNS4xNzE5OTg5NTg5*_ga_JXW44Y23NM*czE3NzIxNTc2ODkkbzE5MzQkZzEkdDE3NzIxNzA0MTckajQxJGwwJGgw\" target=\"_blank\">streaming apps that don’t need a PC at all</a>.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/19/microsoft_virtual_pc_update/\">Microsoft reveals new cloudy AI PC that’s not a Copilot+ PC</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/24/omnissa_appvolumes_physical_extension/\">Omnissa brings VDI-style app packaging to physical PCs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/07/citrix_virtualisation_avoids_tariffs/\">Citrix finds new use for virtualization: Avoiding PC price hikes caused by tariffs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/06/google_acquires_cameyo_vdi_challenge/\">Google takes on virtual desktops with acquisition of app-streamer Cameyo</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Microsoft cares about this stuff because around ten percent of PCs used by businesses are virtual. Analyst firm Gartner thinks that number will double by 2027 because cloudy virtual PCs accessed through a thin client can be <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/14/gartner_daas_predictions/\" target=\"_blank\">cheaper to run than laptops</a>.</p>\n<p>Another factor that creates the possibility of winning more users for Windows 365 is Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware, which has seen the virtualization pioneer stop selling the kind of software bundles suited to running just desktop virtualization workloads. Some organizations therefore face a choice of signing up for VMware’s very capable but pricey Cloud Foundation private cloud bundle, or finding a new way to run virtual PCs.</p>\n\n<p>Buyers must wait until Q3 for the debut of the new devices from ASUS and Dell. Microsoft, meanwhile, continues to sell its own Windows 365 Link devices. ®</p> \n</div>",

            "title": "NASA safety watchdog says it's time to rethink Moon landing",
            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>The latest report from NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) raises questions about the mission objectives for Artemis III.</p>\n<p>Artemis III aims to land astronauts near the lunar South Pole, relying on SpaceX's Starship-derived Human Landing System (HLS) – a vehicle that has yet to achieve orbit, let alone venture anywhere near the Moon. It's an extraordinarily ambitious undertaking, and one the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/asap/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ASAP report</a> has formally classified as high risk.</p>\n<p>The problem is that there are an awful lot of firsts associated with the mission. It'll be the first to depend on SpaceX's HLS, the first to need multiple in-space refuelings (the report estimates 15), the first time a crew will use the HLS, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>ASAP's primary goal is to identify risks and mitigations. It says the solution here is to ease off from doing so much in one mission and consider a more stepwise approach, similar to the Apollo program.</p>\n\n\n<p>The first Apollo crew was launched into orbit with Apollo 7, followed by a mission around the Moon with Apollo 8. Apollo 9 checked out the Lunar Module in Earth orbit, and Apollo 10 did pretty much everything except land. The first lunar landing happened with Apollo 11. Each mission was predicated on the success of the previous.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/23/artemis_ii_launch_april_helium_issues/\">Artemis II headed back to the bay; helium issues force another delay</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/19/nasa_starliner_blame/\">NASA points fingers at Boeing and chaotic culture for Starliner debacle</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/16/nasa_has_mixed_results_from/\">NASA's fill-'er-up Moon rocket 'confidence' test sees mixed results</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/06/smartphones_nasa/\">Smartphones cleared for launch as NASA loosens the rulebook</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It makes sense from a technical perspective. However, elsewhere in the report is data that highlights other challenges faced by NASA, including resource constraints. It does not have the human resources it had during the Apollo era, when staffing exceeded 35,000 full-time employees. Today, that figure is dropping fast. According to the report, it neared 15,000 in 2025. The agency also has nowhere near the budget it had during the Apollo Moon missions, and so the desire to fit as much as possible into fewer missions is understandable, even if the report deems doing so in Artemis III \"a high risk.\"</p>\n<p>\"Rebalancing objectives is thus essential to the safe achievement of the national objective – returning the United States to the Moon,\" it says.</p>\n<p>The lengthy report also covers the <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/19/nasa_starliner_blame/\" target=\"_blank\">Starliner fiasco</a>, the aging ISS, and the obsolete spacesuits in which NASA expects astronauts to work outside the outpost,</p>\n\n<p>Highlighting the challenges facing the Artemis III mission, however, will amplify calls for the agency to reconsider its objectives.</p>\n<p>While there may be a political desire to return astronauts to the Moon within the current US administration, the report highlights the technical and resource realities that must also be considered. Better to rethink the objectives than try to cram too much into just one mission. ®</p> \n</div>",

Meanwhile, security remains an afterthought.</p>\n<p>\"There's clearly more of a sense across the board than there was last year that we need the 20 critical controls for AI,\" Braun said, pointing to the Center for Internet Security's (CIS) <a href=\"https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/v8\" target=\"_blank\">Critical Security Controls</a> as an example of what this would look like. \"We need an industry-wide, accepted definition like what CIS has been doing, and I don't see any real movement toward that yet.\"</p>\n<h3 class=\"crosshead\">Combatting cybercrime</h3>\n<p>This year's cybercrime theme, \"Hackers don cape and mask,\" emerged after listening to accounts of DEF CON researchers performing feats such as taking down Russian dark web marketplace Solaris and its affiliated hacker collective, Killnet, and unveiling the real-world identity of phishing scammer Darcula, who is responsible for hundreds of thousands of people losing millions of dollars.</p>\n<p>\"These guys are taking down ransomware groups, and dealing with criminals in prison, and hacking the Russian firewall - it's just fascinating,\" Braun said.</p>\n<p>Global governments' effort to fight ransomware and other types of cybercrime isn't working, according to the Almanack. \"To properly fight back, policymakers need to unleash the full potential of programs like the FBIs Confidential Human Source (CHS) program, so we can leverage skilled white hat hackers as force multipliers to woefully outnumbered government authorities,\" it reads.</p>\n<h3 class=\"crosshead\">Down with despots</h3>\n<p>The third theme, \"down with despots,\" didn't come together until the end of the Almanack-writing process, as Braun saw examples of civil society methods to protect data, communications, and culture against censorship, surveilliance, and other kinds of oppression.</p>\n<p>This included hacker LambdaCalculus's off-grid mesh network, <a href=\"https://schedule.hope.net/hope16/speaker/XXHPGL/\" target=\"_blank\">PirateBox</a>, along with Jason Vogt and Josh Reiter's proposal of setting up mesh networks in Taiwan to help civilians fight a future Chinese invasion.</p>\n<p>Another talk by Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online (SUCHO) co-founder Quinn Dombrowski detailed his group's effort to save Ukrainian cultural websites – libraries, archives, museums, and community organizations – before Russia’s invasion. It ultimately helped preserve more than 1,500 websites.</p>\n<p>\"This is all about preserving freedom and democracy from authoritarians that are oppressing the vulnerable populations around the world, whether they be Ukrainians, potentially the Taiwanes,e Uyghurs, or migrants for that matter,\" Braun said.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/10/def_con_hackers_water_security/\">DEF CON hackers plug security holes in US water systems amid tsunami of threats</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/12/def_con_franklin_project_hopes_hackers/\">DEF CON Franklin project enlists hackers to harden critical infrastructure</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2018/08/13/DEF%20CON_election_vote_hacking/\">US voting systems: Full of holes, loaded with pop music, and 'hacked' by an 11-year-old</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/11/ai_security_offense_defense/\">Red teams are safe from robots for now, as AI makes better shield than spear</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>To combat authoritarianism, the Almanack proposes building a Digital Arsenal of Democracy, comprised of technologies like mesh networks, digital archives, PirateBox, and DNA data storage to help oppressed communities to preserve their history and culture.

            "title": "Open source devs consider making hogs pay for every Git pull",
            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p><span class=\"label\">Opinion</span> I'm at the <a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lf-member-summit/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Linux Foundation Members Summit</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sonatype.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Sonatype</a>'s CTO Brian Fox introduced me to a new open source problem. I wouldn't have thought that was possible, but here I am.</p>\n<p>Fox, who also oversees <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Maven</a>, a popular Java build tool, explained that its repository site is at risk of being overwhelmed by constant Git pulls. The team has dug into this and found that 82 percent of the demand comes from less than 1 percent of IPs. Digging deeper, they discovered that many companies are using open source repositories as if they were content delivery networks (CDNs). So, for example, a single company might download the same code hundreds of thousands of times in a day, and the next day, and the next. This is unsustainable.</p>\n<p>So Maven and other open source repositories are considering introducing a tiered payment system. Lone developers and small groups will still be able to download the code for free, but the hogs will have to pay for every download. In other words, open source software is still free as in speech, but you can forget about being \"free as in beer\" going forward.</p>\n\n<p>How bad is it? Fox revealed that last year, major repositories handled 10 trillion downloads. That's double Google's annual search queries if you're counting from home and they're doing it on a shoestring. Fox described this as a \"tragedy of the commons,\" where the assumption of \"free and infinite\" resources leads to structural waste amplified by CI/CD pipelines, security scanners, and AI-driven code generation.</p>\n\n\n<p>Companies may think that they can rely on \"free and infinite\" infrastructure, when in reality the costs of bandwidth, storage, staffing, and compliance are accelerating.</p>\n<p>Fox shared data showing 82 percent of Maven Central's consumption comes from less than 1 percent of worldwide IPs, with 80 percent of traffic from the big three hyperscalers. Making it even more troublesome, \"IP addresses don't represent people. They're not even organizations anymore. They're ephemeral. They're kind of like weather,\" Fox explained in an interview, noting challenges from containers, NAT proxies, and cloud egress IPs. In one case, a department store's team of 60 developers generated more traffic than global cable modem users worldwide due to misconfigured React Native builds bypassing their Nexus repository manager.</p>\n\n<p>He detailed extreme examples, such as large organizations downloading the same 10,000 components a million times each month. \"That's ridiculous,\" Fox said. Throttling efforts led to \"brownouts\" via 429 errors, but patterns mutated, forcing a \"Whack-a-Mole\" game, especially since most consumption is headless and unnoticed.</p>\n<p>Registries are also burdened by commercial use, with companies publishing closed source components or massive SDKs as free CDNs. Fox noted that top publishers release gigabyte-scale artifacts daily, unlike in typical open source projects. </p>\n<p>In September 2025, the <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/23/openssf_open_source_infrastructure/\" target=\"_blank\">registries issued an open letter via OpenSSF calling for \"tiered access models\"</a> to keep it free for hobbyists and open source while mandating contributions from high-volume users. \"This is the important part, that it has to become mandatory, not optional, \" Fox emphasized. Open source charity is not a sustainable model.</p>\n\n<p>Businesses have been treating open source repositories as free, infinite infrastructure. That's nonsense. The reality is that the costs of bandwidth, storage, staffing, and compliance are ever-growing. In particular, as the letter stated, <a href=\"https://openssf.org/blog/2025/09/23/open-infrastructure-is-not-free-a-joint-statement-on-sustainable-stewardship/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">\"Commercial-scale use without commercial-scale support is unsustainable</a>.\" Open source foundations can't keep up with the demand for fast dependency resolution, signed packages, zero downtime, and rapid response to supply chain attacks – not to mention looming regulatory requirements such as the <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/04/infosec_in_brief/\" target=\"_blank\">EU's Cyber Resilience Act</a>.</p>\n<p>Fox anticipates the registries will start rolling out next quarter: \"We did the Open Letter way back in October... different ecosystems have figured out models that they think are going to work.\" In a pleasant surprise, reactions have been positive. Throttled organizations were \"surprised and apologetic,\" mistaking issues for malice rather than \"ignorance, unawareness.\"</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/27/open_source_endowment/\">New endowment hopes to raise a big pile of money for open source projects</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/veracode_security_ai/\">Rapid AI-driven development makes security unattainable, warns Veracode</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/cloudflare_nextjs_api_ai/\">Cloudflare experiment ports most of Next.js API 'in one week' with AI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/24/google_android_developer_verification_plan/\">Rogue devs of sideloaded Android apps beg for freedom from Google's verification regime</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As the saying goes, never attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity. Or, as Michael Winser, a co-founder of <a href=\"https://alpha-omega.dev/about/about-alpha-omega/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Alpha-Omega</a>, a Linux Foundation project to help secure the open source supply chain, said at FOSDEM: \"If you're not caching, you're a goddamn idiot.\" Amen, brother!</p>\n<p>With AI-driven repository usage exploding, Fox urged checking bills, using caching proxies, and avoiding per-commit tests. He seeks endorsements: \"We need you to help step up... so that when we go out to the rest of the wild world... you need to pay to keep doing what you've been doing.\"</p>\n<p>But, wait, there's more! Besides simply being overwhelmed by constant download demands, Winser said, \"<a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/16/open_source_registries_fund_security/\" target=\"_blank\">People conflate open source software and open source infrastructure.</a>.\" Yes, open source software is free, but the cost of registries to host all open source applications and libraries keeps increasing with greater usage.</p>\n<p>It's not just bandwidth and storage. Winser also pointed out that the repositories \"don't have enough money to spend on the very security features that we all desperately need to stop being a bunch of idiots and installing fu when it's malware.\"</p>\n<p>To quote Robert A. Heinlein: \"There's no such thing as a free lunch.\" The bill has come due for our misuse of the open source commons. ®</p> \n</div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>A new remote access trojan (RAT) being sold on cybercrime networks enables double extortion attacks on Windows machines by bundling ransomware and data theft, along with credential and cryptocurrency stealers, live surveillance, and a whole host of other illicit capabilities, all controllable from a centralized dashboard.</p>\n<p>BlackFog researchers first spotted the malware, <a href=\"https://www.blackfog.com/steaelite-rat-double-extortion-from-single-panel/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">called Steaelite</a> and touted as \"fully undetectable\" and the \"best Windows RAT,\" in November 2025. It works across Windows 10 and 11, with an Android module reportedly in development.</p>\n<p>Steaelite's operator interface runs entirely in the browser, and the RAT starts stealing victims' data even before the criminals open the dashboard. </p>\n\n<p>\"When a new victim connects, Steaelite automatically harvests browser-stored passwords, session cookies, and application tokens before the operator issues any commands,\" according to the AI-based security shop. \"Data theft begins at the moment of connection.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>The dashboard includes a primary toolbar plus two additional sections, with the primary toolbar alone including modules for remote code execution, file management, live streaming, webcam and microphone access, process management, clipboard monitoring, password recovery, installed program enumeration, location tracking, arbitrary file execution, URL opening, DDoS attacks, and VB.NET payload compilation. </p>\n<p>If a criminal is seeking more - like locking up victims' files and extorting them for cryptocurrency - an \"advanced tools\" panel includes capabilities for ransomware deployment, hidden RDP, Windows Defender disabling and exclusion management, and persistence installation.</p>\n\n<p>Plus, a third \"developer tools\" panel adds keylogging, client-to-victim chat, file searching, USB spreading, a bot-killing feature that removes competing malware, message box delivery, wallpaper modification, UAC bypass, and a clipper that swaps cryptocurrency wallet addresses during copy-paste operations. </p>\n<p>The clipper can silently transfer the victims' cryptocurrency to the attacker - without the victim ever knowing - by monitoring the clipboard for wallet addresses and replacing them with an attacker-controlled address before the paste completes.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/27/ransomware_chainalysis/\">Ransomware payments cratered in 2025, but attacks surged to record highs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/shinyhunters_wynn_resorts/\">ShinyHunters demands $1.5M not to leak Vegas casino and resort chain data</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/19/rmm_rat_trustconnect/\">Crims create fake remote management vendor that actually sells a RAT</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/27/odido_shinyhunters_leaks/\">Cops back Dutch telco Odido after second wave of ShinyHunters leaks</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\"The listing has been bumped consistently across multiple forum threads with 87 messages at the time of writing, and a promotional video demonstrating the tool's capabilities has been published on YouTube, a common distribution tactic for commercial remote access trojans looking to reach buyers outside of traditional forum ecosystems,\" BlackFog wrote.</p>\n<p>In addition to being an all-in-one RAT, this new malware makes it even easier for would-be criminals to pull off double extortion attacks - where the crooks first steal data, then encrypt victims' systems, and <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/27/odido_shinyhunters_leaks/\" target=\"_blank\">threaten to leak the stolen files</a> if the victim refuses to <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/shinyhunters_wynn_resorts/\" target=\"_blank\">pay a ransom</a>.</p>\n<p>\"Previously, double extortion required malware for initial access and exfiltration, then a separate ransomware payload for encryption, often involving coordination between initial access brokers and ransomware affiliates,\" BlackFog's team wrote. \"Steaelite puts both in the same interface, and the automated credential harvesting means data theft fires before the operator even interacts with the dashboard.\"</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, once the Android version goes live - and assuming it works as planned - a single Steaelite license could cover corporate Windows computers as well as the mobile devices employees use for authentication and messaging, the researchers note. ®</p> \n</div>",

            "title": "PCs and phones to get more boring and expensive in 2026 thanks to memory drought",
            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>The next wave of smartphones and PCs will have less memory and fewer capabilities, yet are likely to cost consumers 14 percent more as AI ambitions eat all available memory supplies, according to researchers at IDC.</p>\n<p>IDC said that the <a href=\"https://www.idc.com/resource-center/blog/higher-asps-lower-unit-volumes-how-the-memory-crisis-is-reshaping-the-pc-and-smartphone-outlook/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">worsening memory</a> market has caused its outlook to deteriorate just since December. The analysts are penciling in a decline in the PC market of 11.3 percent in 2026 – about 26 percent worse than they had guessed in December – and a decline in the smartphone market of 12.9 percent, which is more than double the 5.2 percent drop they predicted as a worst-case scenario just two months back.</p>\n<p>“This is perhaps the biggest challenge the industry has faced since its inception,” said Nabilia Popal, IDC’s senior research director global consumer devices, during a roundtable video discussion posted Thursday. “This is not just a temporary situation. This is going to result in a structural reset of the entire industry, in terms of size, in terms of competitive landscape, of the product mix and also on the price.”</p>\n\n<p>To mitigate the cost and the short supply, IDC expects consumers to hang on to devices longer, or turn to used and refurbished units. Device makers meanwhile are likely to downgrade memory on their least expensive devices, optimize features around using less memory, or in some cases turn to Chinese suppliers that they've avoided over geopolitical or technical concerns.</p>\n\n\n<p>“Any meaningful impact is expected to take some time,” Jeff Janukowicz, research vice president at IDC, said in a video posted Thursday. \"So ultimately, from our perspective we continue to see a challenging environment in 2026. That’s likely to push into 2027.”</p>\n<p>IDC is not alone in sounding the alarm. Researchers at <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/memory_price_hikes/\" target=\"_blank\">Gartner this week</a> also said some types of memory have doubled or quadrupled in price since last year, and Gartner believes DRAM and NAND flash used in PCs and phones is set for a further 130 percent rise by the end of 2026.</p>\n\n<p>Gartner is projecting a drop in PC shipments of more than 10 percent during 2026, and a decline of around 8 percent for smartphones, all due to the AI-driven memory shortage.</p>\n<p>In the PC market, IDC expects the shortages to begin in the second quarter as smaller vendors struggle to obtain supplies unit volumes will “fall off dramatically,” researchers wrote.</p>\n<p>During its earnings call on Thursday, Dell’s chief operating officer and vice chairman <a href=\"https://investors.delltechnologies.com/financial-information/quarterly-results\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Clarke</a> said DRAM prices over the last 6 months are up nearly 5.5x, at $2.39 a gigabit. Meanwhile the cost of NAND is $0.20 a gigabyte; that's up nearly 4x over the last 6 months. He said that analysts are predicting prices in Q2 to be 20% to 50% higher.</p>\n\n<p>In October, Dell reduced the price of PCs to win market share, then in January, the company increased the cost of PCs to adjust for higher memory prices. At the time, the OEM had tens of thousands of deals in the pipeline that had prices adjusted upwards, which immediately took pressure off Dell’s margins, Clarke said.</p>\n<p>“In PCs, we purposely delayed implementing that price move to stay in the hunt to take share and to drive growth, which will serve us for the long run,” Clarke said. “And then when we made the change on January 6, it wasn't 90 days later, it was that day we stabilized margins,” he said.</p>\n<p>During its earnings call this week, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/hp_inc_q1_2026/\" target=\"_blank\">HP revealed</a> that memory now accounts for 35 percent of the cost of materials it needs to build a PC, up from between 15 and 18 percent last quarter. The company expects to see memory prices increase 100 percent sequentially into the next quarter, according to HP CFO Karen Parkhill. The company said it has raised PC prices as a result.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/02/dram_prices_expected_to_double/\">DRAM prices expected to double in Q1 as AI ambitions push memory fabs to their limit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/14/dram_infrastructure_costs/\">Buy servers now or cry later: DRAM price spike threatens infrastructure budgets</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/micron_powerchip_fab_acquisition/\">Micron finds a way to make more DRAM with $1.8bn chip plant purchase</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/06/memory_firm_profits_up_as/\">Mem-ageddon: AI chip frenzy to wallop DRAM prices with 70% hike</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And earlier this month <a href=\"https://www.veracast.com/webcasts/lenovo/meetings/7X3Z9C.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Lenovo’s PC boss Luca Rossi</a> said that they will raise their average selling price for PCs in 2026, as the number of available PCs will likely drop.</p>\n<p>“At the moment, we are modeling a mid-single-digit decline for the units. But that decline will be offset by a higher ASP (average selling price) and likely a favorable product mix,” Rossi told investors on Feb. 12. “Hence, the value of the market will not decline. For Lenovo, we will continue to grow at premium to market.”</p>\n<p>Janukowicz said with the top four cloud service providers projected to spend $600 billion this year on AI build outs that require DRAM and NAND – some 70 percent more than last year – the cost of memory will likely not stabilize until 2027.</p>\n<p>“This is not necessarily a short disruption and it reflects a structurally tight environment.

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>The headlines say OpenAI on Friday announced $110 billion in new investment from Amazon, Nvidia, and SoftBank at a $730 billion pre-money valuation, though terms and conditions apply.</p>\n<p>Both Amazon's $50 billion and Nvidia's $30 billion <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/scaling-ai-for-everyone/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">investments</a> are tied to massive customer commitments by OpenAI and its partners. </p>\n<p>Of Amazon's investment, $35 billion will only be paid out \"when certain conditions are met.\" From what we gather, those conditions include <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/amazon-partnership/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">renting</a> out two gigawatts worth of Amazon's Trainium AI accelerators and the deployment of OpenAI models and services in AWS. The cloud provider will also be the \"exclusive third-party cloud distribution provider for OpenAI Frontier.\"</p>\n\n<p>Announced earlier this month, Frontier is OpenAI's new <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-frontier/\" target=\"_blank\">agent builder</a> aimed at enterprise customers. Curiously, OpenAI was quick to emphasize that \"nothing about today's announcements in any way changes the terms of the Microsoft and OpenAI relationship,\" and that Azure remains the exclusive cloud provider of its stateless OpenAI APIs and first party products, like Frontier.</p>\n\n\n<p>Nvidia's $30 billion investment appears to have similar provisions. In a <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/scaling-ai-for-everyone/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> published on Friday, the AI flag bearer announced an expanded partnership with Nvidia that would see the deployment of three gigawatts of inference and two gigawatts of training capacity built on the GPU slinger's Vera Rubin systems. Announced at CES in January, the racks are expected to begin shipping in the second half of 2026.</p>\n<p>The economics of datacenters can be tricky to pin down as it varies by region, but at a power usage effectiveness of 1.1, a gigawatt is enough for about 3,600 Vera Rubin NVL72 systems, assuming 250 kW per rack. </p>\n\n<p>At an <a href=\"https://www.nextplatform.com/ai/2026/01/06/nvidias-vera-rubin-platform-obsoletes-current-ai-iron-six-months-ahead-of-launch/4092179\" target=\"_blank\">estimated</a> cost of $8.4 million each, that's roughly $30 billion per gigawatt. However, compute only accounts for about half the cost of standing up a modern AI datacenter. </p>\n<p>The land, shell, power, and plumbing costs make up the remainder. This puts the cost of building and deploying 5 gigawatts worth of Vera Rubin accelerators at more than $300 billion. OpenAI is unlikely to take this on itself. Instead, we expect CEO Sam Altman to broker purchase agreements through its hyperscaler and neocloud partners, as it has done with Oracle and Crusoe for its Stargate facility in Abilene, Texas.</p>\n<p>Amazon is one of those partners. While OpenAI may be playing up Trainium in today's disclosures, its <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/aws-and-openai-partnership/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">existing</a> $38 billion tie-up with Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/03/openai_inks_38b_deal_with_aws/\" target=\"_blank\">announced back in November</a>, was specific to Nvidia GB200 and GB300 systems. That contract has now been extended to $100 billion over the next eight years.</p>\n\n<p>Both Amazon's and Nvidia's investments are structured in such a way as to guarantee a return on every dollar invested in OpenAI. The funding is essentially a discount on compute infrastructure that doesn't dilute their revenues while driving up OpenAI's valuation.</p>\n<p>This kind of circular dealing has become commonplace amid the AI boom, and all the big boys are taking part. Back in October, Nvidia rival AMD <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/06/stargate_openai_amd/\" target=\"_blank\">issued</a> OpenAI a warrant for roughly 10 percent of its stock. To claim it, all Altman needs to do is deploy six gigawatts of the chip designer's Instinct accelerators. This week, AMD <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/24/amd_copypastes_openai_6gw_chipsforstock/\" target=\"_blank\">copied and pasted</a> that deal, extending the same offer to social media and would-be AI magnate Meta.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/burger_kings_new_ai/\">Burger King turns to AI to flame broil employees who aren't friendly enough</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/nvidia_q4_2026/\">Nvidia hasn't made a cent in China lately – and might not need to given $120B profit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/openai_asks_its_friends_to/\">OpenAI asks its friends to tell their friends about Frontier</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/23/sam_altman_ai_efficiency/\">Altman: You think AI is wasted energy? Try raising 100 billion humans</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>While Nvidia and Amazon are clearly engaged in financial engineering, the same doesn't appear to be the case for SoftBank. Infamous spendthrift Masayoshi Son plans to <a href=\"https://group.softbank/en/news/press/20260227\" target=\"_blank\">invest</a> another $30 billion into the company to keep the lights on while Altman and crew continue their search for artificial general intelligence. SoftBank's contribution will be paid out in three tranches of $10 billion beginning in April and wrapping up in October.</p>\n<p>Even with annualized recurring revenue reportedly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-cfo-says-annualized-revenue-crosses-20-billion-2025-2026-01-19/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">exceeding</a> $20 billion and more than 50 million paying subscribers on the books, OpenAI is going to be reliant on outside funding for a while. The company isn't expected to achieve profitability until at least 2029. ®</p> \n</div>",
