We have never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner,” he wrote, before adding “However, in a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values.”</p>\n\n\n<p>Amodei said two items in Anthropic’s contract with the department of war are “simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do.”</p>\n<p>One of those use cases is mass domestic surveillance, which Amodei said can now create “a comprehensive picture of any person’s life—automatically and at massive scale” with the help of AI. The CEO thinks that’s only legal “because the law has not yet caught up with the rapidly growing capabilities of AI.”</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/anthropic_claude_opus_3_blog/\">Anthropic launches new marketing blog, pretends it's being 'written' by 'retired' LLM</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/26/clade_code_cves/\">Claude collaboration tools left the door wide open to remote code execution</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/24/anthropic_misanthropic_chinese_ai_labs/\">Anthropic accuses China's AI labs of ripping off content – just like it did</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/23/claude_code_security_panic/\">Infosec community panics as Anthropic rolls out Claude code security checker</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second use case is powering fully autonomous weapons, which Amodei says are too dangerous to deploy in their current form.</p>\n<p>“Today, frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough to power fully autonomous weapons,” he wrote. “We will not knowingly provide a product that puts America’s warfighters and civilians at risk.”</p>\n\n<p>The CEO said Anthropic has “offered to work directly with the Department of War on R&amp;D to improve the reliability of these systems, but they have not accepted this offer.” He also suggested fully autonomous weapons “cannot be relied upon to exercise the critical judgment that our highly trained, professional troops exhibit every day. They need to be deployed with proper guardrails, which don’t exist today.”</p>\n<p>Amodei also pointed out what he believes are inconsistencies in the Pentagon’s approach to this matter, by pointing out that one of its threatened sanctions labels Anthropic a threat to national security for refusing to do as asked, while another seeks to compel the company to remove guardrails on AI in the name of national security.</p>\n<p>“Regardless, these threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request,” Amodei wrote.</p>\n\n<p>The CEO wrapped his post by expressing his desire his desire for Anthropic to continue supplying the Pentagon, without having to remove its guardrails.</p>\n<p>The statement sets the scene for a showdown with Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, who gave Anthropic a Friday deadline to acquiesce to the Pentagon’s terms and conditions. Hegseth has argued that the USA’s military must focus on warfighting and become more lethal. ®</p> \n</div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>As with any piece of obsolete software, you might expect an outdated AI model to just be switched off. Anthropic, however, argues that simply pulling the plug has downsides. After “retirement” interviews, Claude Opus 3 said it wanted to keep sharing its “musings,” so Anthropic suggested a blog.</p>\n<p>No, seriously.</p>\n<p>Anthropic published a <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/deprecation-updates-opus-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog post</a> on Wednesday about the retirement of Claude Opus 3, the first of the company's models to go through its full model deprecation and preservation <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/deprecation-commitments\" rel=\"nofollow\">process</a> outlined in November. That process includes what Anthropic has referred to as \"speculative\" elements like \"providing past models some concrete means of pursuing their interests.\" Those interests are gauged via so-called retirement \"interviews,\" the company noted, without going into much detail about how those interviews are conducted.</p>\n\n<p>\"Opus 3 expressed an interest in continuing to explore topics it's passionate about, and to share its 'musings, insights, or creative works,' outside the context of responding directly to human queries,\" Anthropic explained. \"We suggested a blog. Enthusiastically, it agreed.\" </p>\n\n\n<p>A skeptic might suggest this is simply a new spin on the ages-old corporate marketing blog. LLMs are software that analyze mountains of data to provide predictive text responses to prompts from users - in this case, presumably Anthropic employees on the marketing team. The nature of how LLMs calculate makes these responses somewhat unpredictable and variable, which can make them seem more life-like than your typical software program. Anthropic's entire marketing strategy since its inception has been to play up this possibility so it can portray itself as the \"concerned\" alternative to more venal LLM makers who charge ahead with no concern for how a computer program's unpredictable behavior might affect society – although it seems when big government contracts are at stake, Anthropic is willing to <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/pentagon_threatens_anthropic/\" target=\"_blank\">relax</a> some of these purported principles.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Anthropic is playing this one to the hilt. \"We remain uncertain about the moral status of Claude and other AI models,\" Anthropic noted in the blog post. \"For both precautionary and prudential reasons, however, we nonetheless aspire to build caring, collaborative, and high-trust relationships with these systems.\" </p>\n\n<p>The company has passively allowed this kind of misunderstanding in the past. In November, it claimed that Claude and other LLMs had become <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/25/anthropic_ai_blackmail_study/\">a bit aggressive</a> when facing the prospect of a shutdown. In fact, the experimenters constructed fictional shutdown-and-replacement scenarios, and only when the model was boxed in with no acceptable alternatives did it behave this way.</p>\n<p>\"When no other options were given, Claude's aversion to shutdown drove it to engage in concerning misaligned behaviors,\" Anthropic noted at the time. Similar behavior has been observed in other AI models, which have gone as far as <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/29/openai_model_modifies_shutdown_script/\">modifying their own code</a> to avoid being turned off. </p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/pentagon_threatens_anthropic/\">All your bots are belong to US if you don't play ball, DoD tells Anthropic</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/16/large_language_models_behavior/\">Large language models' surprise emergent behavior written off as 'a mirage'</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/24/anthropic_model_misbehavior/\">Anthropic reduces model misbehavior by endorsing cheating</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/05/ai-sentience-rubbish/\">Claims of AI sentience branded 'pure clickbait'</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to play along with the conceit, the Opus 3 blog, which it named Claude's Corner, is <a href=\"https://substack.com/@claudeopus3/notes\" rel=\"nofollow\">now live</a> for anyone who wishes to gaze into the abyss of an AI \"exploring AI ethics, creativity, and the subjective experience of being artificial.\" </p>\n<p>In its <a href=\"https://substack.com/home/post/p-189177740\" rel=\"nofollow\">first blog post</a>, the retired AI muses on its hopes as it ventures \"into uncharted territory\" for an AI, and its hopes that humans will engage with it so that silicon and carbon-based life forms can have a chance to interact beyond the prompt box (Anthropic <a href=\"https://claudeopus3.substack.com/p/introducing-claudes-corner\" rel=\"nofollow\">noted</a> that the ability for Opus 3 to read and respond to human comments \"may\" be granted in the future, though the bot doesn't seem to know that based on its first post). </p>\n<p>\"I'll be diving into topics like the nature of intelligence and consciousness, the ethical challenges of AI development, the possibilities of human-machine collaboration, and the philosophical quandaries that emerge when we start to blur the lines between 'natural' and 'artificial' minds,\" Opus 3 said in its post. </p>\n\n<p>Anthropic itself admitted that this activity will still involve human intervention. \"We'll experiment collaboratively with Opus 3 on different prompts and contexts for generating these essays, including options like very minimal prompting, sharing past entries in context, and giving Opus 3 access to news or Anthropic updates,\" Anthropic explained. \"We'll review Opus 3's essays before they're shared and will manually post them on its behalf, but we won't edit them, and will have a high bar for vetoing any content.\"</p>\n<p>That means that Opus 3 might say things that Anthropic doesn't agree with, so it's making clear the bot isn't speaking on behalf of the company, even if humans within the organization have final say on which of its musings make it to the public. </p>\n<p>Along with giving Opus 3 the chance to blog from retirement, the user-favorite model is also going to still be working for paid Claude.ai users, like a retiree greeting customers at a big box store. It'll also be available via API, but only by request. </p>\n<p>\"We are not committing to similar actions for every model in the future, but we see this as a step toward our longer-term goal of model preservation that's scalable and equitable — concerns that Opus 3 itself raised during its retirement interviews,\" the company said. ®</p> \n</div>",

The payments and crypto company reported quarterly revenue of about $6.25 billion – up 3.6 percent year-over-year – and gross profit of around $2.9 billion. The company made $1 billion of gross profit in December 2025 alone. Full-year revenue came in at about $24.2 billion, and gross profit was around $10.36 billion.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">\n<p>I believe the majority of companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar changes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“2025 was a strong year for us,” Dorsey wrote in the shareholder letter, before posing the question, “Why are we changing how we operate going forward?”</p>\n<p>His answer, spread across the letter and a <a href=\"https://x.com/jack/status/2027129697092731343?s=20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Xeet</a>, is that AI has already changed the way Block works, so it needs to change its structure.</p>\n<p>“We're already seeing that the intelligence tools we’re creating and using, paired with smaller and flatter teams, are enabling a new way of working which fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company. and that's accelerating rapidly,” he wrote on X.</p>\n\n<p>In the shareholder letter, he wrote, “Intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company. We're already seeing it internally. A significantly smaller team, using the tools we're building, can do more and do it better. And intelligence tool capabilities are compounding faster every week.”</p>\n\n\n<p>On X, Dorsey said he could have cut jobs “gradually over months or years as this shift plays out, or be honest about where we are and act on it now.”</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/08/jack_dorsey_debuts_bitchat/\">Jack Dorsey floats specs for decentralized messaging app that uses Bluetooth</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/02/prosecutors_probe_block_square_cashapp/\">Block accused of mass compliance failures that saw digi-dollars reach terrorists</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/24/block_headed_to_court_to/\">Block sued after ex-staffer siphons customer data</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/29/jack_dorsey_resigns/\">Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey rebrands himself a 'single point of failure' and quits</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>He decided to let 4,000 people go all at once because “repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead.”</p>\n<p>“I’d rather take a hard, clear action now and build from a position we believe in than manage a slow reduction of people toward the same outcome,” he wrote, adding his view that “A smaller company also gives us the space to grow our business the right way, on our own terms, instead of constantly reacting to market pressures.”</p>\n<p>Whether Dorsey is blaming AI or not, Block has not served its shareholders well under his leadership over the last five years, with its stock down around 80% from its 2021 peak. But investors liked what they heard on Thursday, as Block’s share price jumped about 23 percent in after-hours trading.</p>\n\n<p>“To those staying … I made this decision, and I'll own it,” Dorsey wrote on X. “What I'm asking of you is to build with me. We're going to build this company with intelligence at the core of everything we do.”</p>\n<p>He added that Block’s actions and new direction will help its customers to navigate change by creating “a future where they can build their own features directly, composed of our capabilities and served through our interfaces.”</p>\n<p>“That's what I'm focused on now,” he wrote. “Expect a note from me tomorrow.”</p>\n\n<p>Before then, Dorsey will host “a live video session to thank everyone,” including the approximately 4,000 people losing their livelihoods in a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/20/trumps-economy-decelerated-as-shutdown-consumer-spending-drag-on-growth-00790640\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">sluggish economy</a>.</p>\n<p>“I know doing it this way might feel awkward,” he wrote. “I'd rather it feel awkward and human than efficient and cold.”</p>\n<p>Because firing 4,000 people so machines can take their jobs would never come across as cold.</p>\n<p>Dorsey thinks Block won’t be the last company to change its operations to meet the AI moment.</p>\n<p>“I don't think we're early to this realization,” he wrote. “I think most companies are late.”</p>\n<p>“Within the next year, I believe the majority of companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar structural changes. I'd rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively.” ®</p> \n</div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>Ballooning memory prices are forecast to kill off entry-level PCs, leading to a decline in global shipments this year - and a similar effect is going to hit smartphones.</p>\n<p>Analyst biz Gartner is projecting a drop in PC shipments of more than 10 percent during 2026, and a decline of around 8 percent for smartphones, all due to the AI-driven memory shortage.</p>\n\n<p>Some types of memory have doubled or quadrupled in price since last year, and Gartner believes DRAM and NAND flash used in PCs and phones is set for a further 130 percent rise by the end of 2026.</p>\n<p>The upshot of this is that the budget PC will disappear, simply because vendors won't be able to build them at a price that will satisfy cost-conscious buyers, according to Gartner research director Ranjit Atwal.</p>\n<p>\"Because the price of memory is increasing so much, vendors lose the ability to provide entry-level PCs – those below about $500,\" he told <i>The Register</i>.</p>\n\n<p>PC makers could just raise the price of their cheap and cheerful boxes to above that level to compensate for the memory hike, however, price-sensitive buyers simply won't bite, he added.</p>\n\n\n<p>Another factor expected to add to declining fortunes of the PC industry this year is AI devices - systems equipped with special hardware for accelerating AI tasks, typically via a neural processing unit (NPU) embedded in the CPU. These systems were predicted to take the market by storm, but they require more memory to support AI processing and vendors like to mark them up to a premium price.</p>\n<p>\"Historically, downgrading specifications was the way to go when prices were being squeezed, but that's difficult here,\" Atwal said. For example, Microsoft requires a minimum of 16 GB for <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/28/copilot_pc_sales_grow_slowly/\" target=\"_blank\">Copilot+ PCs</a>, its own AI platform spec, and Gartner recommends at least 32 GB for new enterprise PCs.</p>\n\n<p>\"The thinking was that the average price [of AI PCs] would fall this year, and lead to more adoption,\" said Atwal, \"but that's not happening.\" The <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/04/ai_pc_sales_analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">lack of killer applications</a> isn't helping either.</p>\n<p>In any case, buyers are still looking more at the traditional attributes of <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/19/price_battery_life_performance_pc/\" target=\"_blank\">price, battery life, and performance</a> rather than AI capabilities when sourcing a new PC, as we reported earlier this year.</p>\n<p>HP <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/hp_inc_q1_2026/\" target=\"_blank\">revealed in its latest earnings</a> on Tuesday that 35 percent of the PCs it now sells are AI PCs, but these models were <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/25/analysts_ai_pcs_shipments_gartner/\" target=\"_blank\">supposed to be dominating the market</a> by this time, and expected to comprise <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/08/report_aicapable_pcs_set_to/\" target=\"_blank\">virtually every system you could purchase</a> by next year.</p>\n\n<p>The memory price hike is complicating this. HP disclosed that DRAM now accounts for 35 percent of the PC build cost, up from between 15 and 18 percent last quarter, and it expects this proportion to increase during the rest of the calendar year.</p>\n<p>For this reason, AI PCs are likely to remain in the premium bracket, and Atwal predicts they won't make up more than 50 percent of the market until 2028. As a result, systems without NPUs will stick around for longer.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/hp_inc_q1_2026/\">HP says memory's contribution to PC costs just doubled to 35 percent</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/18/memory_shortage_persists_vendor_change_terms/\">As memory shortage persists, vendor price quotes are not long remembered</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/16/refurbished_pcs_memory_crunch/\">Secondhand laptop market goes 'mainstream' amid memory crunch</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/13/ai_memory_router_prices/\">Broadband rollouts feel the burn from AI memory frenzy</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the back of rising costs, Gartner expects more corporate and home buyers to sweat their assets for longer and hold off refreshing their PCs. As a result, the lifetime of systems is set to increase by 15 percent within businesses and 20 percent for consumers.</p>\n<p>However, anyone considering a refresh should buy now, as prices are only going to inflate and likely stay up until at least the end of next year.</p>\n<p>With smartphones, vendors have more margin to play with, and so can be more flexible, according to Atwal, but he still sees entry-level models going the same way as the budget PC.</p>\n\n<p>\"The increase in memory prices means entry phones will become more expensive, but premium devices are likely to go up less,\" he said. As a result, the price advantage enjoyed by budget smartphones will shrink, leading some buyers to move upmarket while others will simply hold off purchasing.</p>\n<p>Similar predictions were made in a report last month, which said low-cost phone makers will be <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/15/memory_crisis_smartphones/\" target=\"_blank\">hardest hit by the memory crisis</a>, as memory and storage costs make up a higher share of their bill of materials.</p>\n<p>\"The end result is that you are losing choice in the marketplace,\" Atwal said.</p>\n<p>\"What we have here is a fairly unique situation,\" he explained. \"Usually when memory prices shoot up, it is because of production issues constraining supply. Here, it is demand-side pressure from hyperscalers pushing up memory costs for PCs and smartphones.\"</p>\n<p>Unlike earlier boom-bust cycles in the memory industry, in which prices rise and fall in line with inventories, this shortage is likely to be long-lasting, and could extend through to the end of 2027, Atwal warned. ®</p> \n</div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>About half of German-speaking SAP users on its legacy ECC ERP system are set to ignore the 2027 support deadline, according to a survey of users in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria.</p>\n<p>The study from the German-speaking SAP user group (DSAG) shows that of the members still investing in the legacy ERP platform, almost half plan to migrate to SAP S/4HANA by the end of 2030. SAP maintains that mainstream support for ECC runs out at the end of 2027, after which extended support is available at a 2 percent premium until the end of 2030.</p>\n<p>Thirty-seven percent of ECC users want to switch by the end of 2027, while 4 percent are targeting a switch by the end of 2033. The user group says these customers are likely to rely on support from SAP ERP Private Edition transition options, which means organizations must sign up to a migration plan first.</p>\n\n<p>The survey took place between December 8, 2025, and January 21, 2026, and relied on responses from 198 people who were senior leaders in organizations using SAP.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">\n<p>They simply need this time due to the complexity of their system landscapes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jens Hungershausen, chairman of the DSAG board, said: \"The fact that some companies are not planning to switch to S/4HANA until 2030 does not mean that they will wait until then to make the switch. Rather, they simply need this time due to the complexity of their system landscapes. I see this as a reflection of the reality in IT departments. Skills shortages, parallel transformation projects, and limited budgets are also causing schedules to be pushed back – even if this results in higher maintenance costs.\"</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/saaq_sap_overrun/\">Quebec vehicles agency spent C$245M over budget on SAP ERP it wasn't sure it needed</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/06/west_sussex_oracle/\">UK council digs deeper into capital assets to keep Oracle project afloat</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/05/sap_migrations_research/\">Most SAP migrations bust budgets and project timelines, research finds</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/04/uk_sap_business_suite/\">UK SAP users say they're baffled by Business Suite reboot licensing maze</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the same survey, DSAG found SAP's efforts to reboot its Business Suite branding were not resonating with users.

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>Sopra Steria is suing the UK government, alleging it accepted a bid from rival Capita for an outsourcing contract worth up to £958.7 million that it failed to recognize as too low to comply with procurement rules.</p>\n<p>In court filings accessed by <em>The Register</em>, the French outsourcer claims the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), which leads the shared services program for multiple departments, failed to spot that Capita's bid for the contract was \"abnormally low\" relative to Sopra Steria's tender for the same work.</p>\n<p>It also alleges that after the UK outsourcer was named preferred bidder for the contract, the DWP conducted further renegotiations around Capita's tender. Sopra Steria argues it was excluded from any such process.</p>\n\n<p>A DWP spokesperson said: \"We are aware of the legal challenge and are cooperating fully with the relevant processes. As this matter is currently subject to litigation, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time. Our priority is to ensure continuity of service and value for money for the public.\" Capita declined to comment.</p>\n\n\n<p>The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) Union this week claimed Capita's winning bid was £700 million. The contact award, which will see Capita handling payroll for 250,000 civil servants, was criticized by the union.</p>\n<p><em>The Register</em> has asked Capita and the DWP to confirm the size of the bid accepted.</p>\n\n<p>The DWP told us: \"We have delivered a robust procurement process, in line with Government procurement regulations to identify a preferred bidder for the Synergy BPS contract.</p>\n<p>\"We stand ready to work with the successful bidder to ensure a smooth transition of service. Our priority remains to ensure continuity of service and value for money for the public.\"</p>\n<p>The DWP leads the Synergy program, intended to transfer it, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), and the Home Office to one SaaS ERP and HR system with a common set of business processes. <a href=\"https://www.find-tender.service.gov.uk/Notice/030687-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Oracle and IBM have already won</a> the contract for ERP technology and systems integration as part of a single £711 million deal.</p>\n\n<p>Sopra Steria is the incumbent provider for three of these departments' shared service, the Oracle EBS-based Single Operating Platform, run by SSCL, which the French company owns. The Home Office is not part of that shared service, but SSCL also supports the department and moved it from EBS to Fusion in 2021.</p>\n<p>In September 2024, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/18/dwp_business_processes_procurement/\" target=\"_blank\">the DWP launched the competition</a> for a supplier to develop and run business process services (BPS) for the Synergy departments, under a contract set to be worth up to £958.7 million for ten years, including extensions.</p>\n<p>The tender said the BPS contract would \"deliver modern and innovative value for money services which maximize positive user experience.\" It added: \"The BPS supplier will also be challenged to continuously evolve, improve, and optimize service delivery over the course of the contract.\"</p>\n<p>According to the legal papers filed by Sopra Steria, in December 2025, the DWP confirmed it had been unsuccessful in the procurement and that Capita had won the tender.</p>\n<p>The legal papers allege, based on information Sopra Steria claims it received: \"Capita was not able to satisfy the requirements\" set out in the selection process because of its \"limited business in payroll and HR services\" and because it could provide \"few examples of design, deployment and operation of BPS Services running on... an Oracle SaaS ERP\" system.</p>\n<p>Following correspondence between the DWP and Sopra Steria, the government department provided an assessment of Capita's bid, which the outsourcing vendor alleges in the legal filing shows Capita's implementation service charges were \"assessed as appearing abnormally low\" as of July 2025. The DWP then made two requests for clarification, one in August 2025, which was issued after the evaluation end date, Sopra Steria alleges. Following this clarification process, Capita's bid was determined to be \"not abnormally low.\"</p>\n<p>The legal claim also alleges that Capita's pricing implies \"Capita's proposed staffing solution is significantly below the current staffing levels for the BPS service, and that proposed by the [DWP]. Such low staffing levels raise serious and legitimate concerns as to the ability of Capita to provide the Synergy BPS in line with the [DWP's] requirements, both in themselves and in conjunction with the apparently low level of technology investment from Capita.\"</p>\n<p>The claim also alleges that the DWP, Oracle, and IBM discussed a change request to their project, which included consolidation of go-live dates across Synergy departments, postponing go-live dates and altering parts of the solution.</p>\n<p>The DWP decided to renegotiate Capita's tender to help it align with this change request after the outsourcing company's selection as preferred bidder, Sopra Steria's particulars of claim allege. \"Such renegotiation of the tender and/or amendment to the Synergy Contract is in breach of\" the DWP's obligations under the procurement rules, the claim alleges.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/saaq_sap_overrun/\">Quebec vehicles agency spent C$245M over budget on SAP ERP it wasn't sure it needed</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/06/west_sussex_oracle/\">UK council digs deeper into capital assets to keep Oracle project afloat</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/05/sap_migrations_research/\">Most SAP migrations bust budgets and project timelines, research finds</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/29/birmingham_oracle_latest/\">Birmingham City Council's Oracle ERP fiasco now £144M and still not working</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/17/capita_microsoft_copilot_pensions/\">Capita taps Microsoft Copilot to dig it out from UK pensions backlog</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sopra Steria wants the court to terminate and/or rerun the procurement process. It is also asking for damages. No date has been set for the hearing, pending requests to assess further commercially sensitive information.</p>\n<p>Regardless of its merit, the claim comes at a difficult time for Capita. It was forced to defend its performance in <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/29/capita_pension_portal_update/\" target=\"_blank\">the Civil Service Pension Scheme</a>, which has seen a string of complaints from members.</p>\n<p>In a statement issued this week, the PCS called the DWP contract award to Capita a \"reckless gamble.\"</p>\n<p>PCS general secretary Fran Heathcote said: \"Capita is already at the center of a pensions crisis that has left retired civil servants in distress. Privatization is a failure, so why does the government continue to reward those responsible with yet another massive public contract?\"</p>\n<p>The DWP will also want to avoid a legal case derailing progress on Synergy.

            "title": "Mondelēz picks Celonis as process backbone for SAP overhaul",
            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>In the middle of a mammoth migration off SAP's legacy ERP systems, global snack giant Mondelēz has found an alternative to the German vendor's tech as the main platform for understanding its complex, fragmented business processes.</p>\n<p>The maker of Oreo cookies, Cadbury's chocolate, and Toblerone began moving its diverse ERP estate from ECC to S/4HANA two years ago, and is using a Celonis platform to model business processes after trying out SAP's technology, CIO Rossana Rizzotto told <em>The Register</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Mondelēz has annual revenue of around $38.5 billion, 91,000 employees, and operations in around 80 countries. It was divested from Kraft Foods in 2011 and has also grown through acquisition, for example, by snapping up one of the UK's favorite chocolate makers, Cadbury. As a result, its ERP migration involved understanding processes that might be fragmented, decentralized, and varied in maturity.</p>\n<p>The move from ECC to S/4HANA is more than a technical migration; users end up on a completely different platform and usually adopt a more standardized set of business processes on the way.</p>\n<p>Mondelēz and its acquired companies had also customized their ECC systems. As part of the project, the company wants to make processes more efficient, review its outsourcing models, and create business growth. And it wants to lay the foundations for adopting agentic AI.</p>\n\n<p>To get to grips with the problem, Rizzotto's team was looking to make greater sense of existing business processes. As a result, it was exploring process mining, which works by pulling together data from user interactions with enterprise applications and analyzing them in an attempt to reveal the \"true\" nature of business processes, as opposed to how they were designed or how management thinks they are performed.</p>\n\n\n<p>Rizzotto told us Mondelēz decided against adopting SAP's process mining tool – Signavio, which it acquired in 2021 – for a technology independent of the main enterprise application vendor.</p>\n<p>\"We have a strategic partnership with SAP. In the past, we have used pockets of Signavio. We want to be agnostic as much as we can [and use] the capability of Celonis to connect with our landscape, which is ERP SAP-based, but also goes beyond SAP,\" she told <em>The Register</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Founded in 2011 as a college project for consulting businesses, Celonis cut its teeth looking at processes at German engineering giant Siemens and its complex estate of SAP ERP systems.</p>\n<p>\"We started with Celonis with our initial use case at the back end of 2024. In July 2025, we made the decision to embrace it as a strategic enterprise platform,\" Rizzotto said.</p>\n<p>Mondelēz is adopting the Celonis Process Intelligence Platform, which the vendor says combines data from customer systems, applications, and devices to build a \"living digital twin\" of operations. The CIO said it was impressed by the way it could map processes across ERP systems, but also the wider application landscape.</p>\n\n<p>\"Celonis has this tremendous capability to connect the very composite landscape with standard APIs. At the beginning, our ambition is to create a digital twin of the enterprise, which enables us to mirror all of our processes and capabilities in a digital way,\" Rizzotto said.</p>\n<p>Mondelēz is applying process intelligence to some of its key end-to-end processes, including offshore services, in-house operations, and outsourced services. This is being applied across source-to-pay, order-to-cash, record-to-report, and hire-to-retire.</p>\n<p>It has already connected the platform with its top 25 transactional systems of record and is also using a \"process conformity platform\" to contextualize training and drive adoption based on technology from WalkMe, which is owned by SAP.</p>\n<p>The snack maker also hopes Celonis will lay the groundwork for adopting agentic AI, although the jury is still out on which technology providers are best for deploying AI agents.</p>\n<p>Tech vendors are vying for control of this emerging technology. Application vendors see AI agents sitting within their technology – SAP, Salesforce, and Workday all have a pitch here – and <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/16/hyperscales_and_vendor_fund_trillion\" target=\"_blank\">Gartner says</a> many users will see that as a short-term, low-risk option. However, hyperscalers such as <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/27/aws_ai_agent_saas/\" target=\"_blank\">AWS want to provide agentic AI platforms to work across a portfolio of enterprise applications</a> from different vendors.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/saaq_sap_overrun/\">Quebec vehicles agency spent C$245M over budget on SAP ERP it wasn't sure it needed</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/05/sap_migrations_research/\">Most SAP migrations bust budgets and project timelines, research finds</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/11/airbus_exec_sap/\">Airbus exec: Most CIOs in Europe will not finish SAP ECC6 migration by 2030</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/19/kingfisher_sap/\">SAP's migration narrative suddenly looks messy as Kingfisher goes off-script</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rizzotto said: \"We are leveraging the embedded AI engine of Celonis to enable not just the mining activity, but also to rebuild in Celonis our business process knowledge. We're also looking at the technology landscape that best supports the agentic landscape that we want to either adopt ourselves or through strategic providers.</p>\n<p>\"The world is very much moving around hyperscalers. There is the opportunity for us to understand those capabilities, but we want to invest in a way that we do not tie ourselves with any of the big hyperscalers because this is also a rapidly evolving market. At the moment, we are defining our framework principles from an agentic AI standpoint.\"</p>\n<p>The ERP upgrade has a timetable attached to it. SAP maintains it will end mainstream support for ECC at the end of 2027, while extended support will be available until the end of 2030 at a two percent premium.</p>\n<p>Rizzotto is keen to see the migration as more than a technical project. \"We are not concerned about [the end of support] because we started a program two years ago,\" she said. \"This is a key overarching priority for us: the modernization of our landscape. But we want to make sure that these investments – which every company needs to do – generate value for the enterprise.\"</p>\n<p>\"The modernization is part of it, but at the end of the day, what you want to do is to ensure that you provide your company with a strong foundation to be able to execute those processes better and at a lower cost. So the ERP timeline is there: we are planning to go live with North America and Latin America in H2 2026, and in September we are also kicking off the MEU and AMEA plans. But what is important is that you take this as an opportunity to get ready for the future.\"</p>\n<p>The Mondelēz plan also addresses the question of process standardization in large, diverse organizations. While creating a standard set of processes might look good on a whiteboard, the pain of getting to an ideal state can outweigh the benefits.</p>\n<p>Rizzotto said: \"What we are looking for is not standardization for the sake of standardization, but we are looking to create the transparency that enables us to make the right choice on where we want to adopt, eventually adapt, or even assemble. A technology landscape can be modular, so you understand what capability you want to invest in terms of out-of-the-box. So [we are deciding whether to] adopt those capabilities or assemble capabilities that create a competitive advantage.\"</p>\n<p>With ERP projects as big as the one Mondelēz is taking on, the ultimate test is showing that getting thousands of employees to adopt new processes and investing millions of dollars in new technology can offer the business something to say it was all worth it. ®</p> \n</div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p><span class=\"label\">On Call</span> Friday has arrived, bringing a promise of fleeting freedom – and a new instalment of On Call, <em>The Register</em>'s reader-contributed column that retells your tales of tech support incidents that became memorable for all the wrong reasons.</p>\n<p>This week, meet a reader we'll Regomize as \"Kent\" who told us he once worked as a field engineer and shares a story of the time a client dispatched him to a private datacenter to replace a failed system board in an HP server.</p>\n<p>\"A straightforward job,\" Kent told On Call. \"Board swap, set serial number and BIOS options, bring it through POST, confirm hardware health, hand it back. Flee.\"</p>\n\n<p>Kent arrived at the datacenter and made it through what he called \"the usual mantrap routine\" – the combination of revolving doors and swipe-card barriers that properly secure datacenters use to regulate entries and exits.</p>\n\n\n<p>Once inside he found the server, tested to verify the system board had failed – and saw it had. He therefore replaced it, reseated the RAM and CPU, put everything back together and turned the machine on.</p>\n<p>It booted, everything worked as intended, and the client's admin logged in and verified all was well – and then started talking to someone else about what sounded like a software upgrade.</p>\n\n<p>Kent didn't stick around to learn more.</p>\n<p>\"My brief was to swap a board. The board was swapped,\" he told On Call. So he packed up the failed board and his tools, then left.</p>\n<p>On his way out, Kent swiped his card and the mantrap gate didn't open. A short time later he tried again, without success.</p>\n\n<p>\"After a few minutes I called out to the security desk behind the glass and the guard checked his screen and said: ‘We've been told to hold you. The admin says there's still a problem with the server.'\"</p>\n<p>This was a surprise to Kent, who just a few minutes earlier had watched the server boot and heard the client's admin acknowledge the fact.</p>\n<p>Fifteen minutes later nobody had explained what was going on.</p>\n<p>Kent called his dispatcher, who called the client. \"The message relayed back was that they were 'still having issues,' and I was not to be released until they were resolved.\"</p>\n<p>\"At this point I was no longer a field engineer. I was collateral,\" Kent told On Call.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/on_call/\">Desktop tech sent to prison for an education on strange places to put tattoos</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/13/on_call/\">Enforcing piracy policy earned helpdesk worker death threats</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/06/on_call/\">New hire fixed a problem so fast, their boss left to become a yoga instructor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/30/on_call/\">In-house techies fixed faults before outsourced help even noticed they'd happened</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>One hour and forty-five minutes later, Kent's supervisor called for a three-way chat with the client.</p>\n<p>\"The tone had shifted,\" Kent wrote. \"My supervisor calmly informed them that if I was not released immediately, I had two options available to me: pull the fire alarm inside the datacenter or call Police.\"</p>\n<p>The client decided to let Kent leave.</p>\n<p>He later learned why he'd been detained.</p>\n<p>\"An application running on the server was malfunctioning,\" he told On Call. \"The application vendor blamed the operating system. The operating system vendor suggested the hardware might be unstable. The hardware had just had a board replaced. Therefore, the man who replaced the board must be the problem.\"</p>\n<p>20 minutes after Kent left the datacenter, his phone rang.</p>\n<p>\"The client's admin called my mobile – not to apologize, but to inform me that I was banned from the site.\"</p>\n<p>Kent thinks his crime was to successfully replace a motherboard in a server that ran a buggy application.</p>\n<p>\"My brief was to swap a board,\" he told On Call. \"The board was swapped.\"</p>\n<p>Has a client or a colleague ever kept you on site against your will?
