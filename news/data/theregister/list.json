            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>Is it OK to say \"slop\" again? Microsoft boss Satya Nadella took to the stage on the London leg of the company's AI tour and said the words that many an IT pro has uttered when faced with a Copilot rollout: \"Nobody wants anything that is sloppy in terms of AI creation.\"</p>\n<p>No, they do not. Nadella was talking about AI assistants, agentic AI, augmenting work, and ensuring that the next person in the data chain understands how the output was produced. However, the CEO of Microsoft dropping the word \"sloppy\" following his <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/02/microsoft_ceo_satya_nadella_calls/\" target=\"_blank\">well-publicized request</a> that we all move on from denigrating the output of AI is certainly an eyebrow-raiser.</p>\n<p>Microsoft's AI tour – aside from some awkward scalability issues at London's Excel (if you saw the queue for the badge collection, you'll know what we mean) – was unsurprisingly all about the company's ambitions for AI. Copilot featured large, and so did the \"infinite set of minds\" (Nadella's words) afforded by AI-powered agents. But the elephant in the keynote auditorium – almost omnipresent on the screens but not directly addressed – was the fact AI output cannot be trusted.</p>\n\n<p>For every whizzbang demonstration showing AI tools collating data in Excel, or creating and executing test plans for websites, there was a message warning that the output of AI tools can't be entirely trusted, and needs human verification.</p>\n<p>Even a command-line demonstration had the warning: \"Copilot uses AI. Check for mistakes.\"</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/05/microsoft_appoints_quality_chief/\">Satya Nadella decides Microsoft needs an engineering quality czar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/21/nadella_ai_sovereignty_wef/\">Microsoft CEO: AI sovereignty isn't where it runs, it's who controls it</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/02/microsoft_ceo_satya_nadella_calls/\">Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella becomes AI influencer, asks us all to move beyond slop</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/22/microsoft_nadella_pay/\">AI bubble inflates Microsoft CEO pay to $96.5M</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In a conference heavy on the joys of AI, the on-screen warnings and reminders highlight that AI is far from infallible.</p>\n<p>Although the conference leaned heavily into UK AI use cases – including a doctor describing time savings in patient interactions and the oft-cited <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/03/uk_government_study_ai_time_savings/\" target=\"_blank\">26-minute statistic</a> for civil servants – Microsoft avoided mentioning West Midlands Police's Copilot mishap, in which the tool <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/24/west_midlands_police_copilot/\" target=\"_blank\">hallucinated a football match</a>. The force's Chief Constable, Craig Guildford, later took early retirement.</p>\n\n<p>But as the keynote screens made clear, AI output cannot be trusted, and \"nobody wants anything that is sloppy.\" That's especially true when making policing decisions or calculating the capacity of a conference center. ®</p> \n</div>",

            "title": "Cloudflare experiment ports most of Next.js API 'in one week' with AI",
            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>A Cloudflare engineer says he has implemented 94 percent of the Next.js API by directing Anthropic's Claude, spending about $1,100 on tokens.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the experimental project was not to show off AI coding, but to address an issue with Next.js, the popular React-based framework sponsored by Vercel.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/vinext/\" target=\"_blank\">According</a> to Cloudflare engineering director Steve Faulkner, the Next.js tooling is \"entirely bespoke... If you want to deploy it to Cloudflare, Netlify, or AWS Lambda, you have to take that build output and reshape it into something the target platform can actually run.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Next.js team is addressing this following numerous complaints that deploying the framework with full features on platforms other than Vercel is too difficult, with a feature in progress called deployment adapters.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"Vercel will use the same adapter API as every other partner,\" the company <a href=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/77740\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> when introducing the planned feature last year.</p>\n<p>Faulkner said these adapters, which remain an \"early effort,\" are insufficient because the framework still uses a bespoke toolchain based on Turbopack, the Vercel-sponsored bundling tool. Another issue is that during development it is hard to use platform-specific APIs such as Cloudflare's KV data storage because the development runtime does not support them without workarounds.</p>\n\n<p>A project called <a href=\"https://opennext.js.org\" target=\"_blank\">OpenNext</a>, sponsored by SST (Serverless Stack from Anomaly Innovations), Cloudflare, and Netlify, already exists to convert Next.js build output for running outside Vercel. Faulkner said the OpenNext approach proved to be a \"difficult and fragile process\" thanks to unpredictable changes between Next.js versions.</p>\n<p>As a new experiment, Cloudflare created <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/vinext\" target=\"_blank\">Vinext</a>, open source and available on GitHub, using the Vite build tool in place of Turbopack. Almost all the code was written by AI, Faulkner said, starting with a plan.</p>\n<p>\"I spent a couple of hours going back and forth with Claude in OpenCode to define the architecture: what to build, in what order, which abstractions to use.\" OpenCode is an open source AI coding agent. He then asked the AI to implement the Next.js API piece by piece, using the existing Next.js test suite to identify issues before merging the code.</p>\n\n<p>Faulkner said that although AI wrote the code, the human element was critical and he \"had to course-correct regularly.\"</p>\n<p>The result comes with a bunch of warnings. No human has reviewed the code or the README states, and the project is under heavy development.</p>\n<p>Another snag is that the only current deployment target is Cloudflare Workers. Faulkner promises that not much of Vinext is Cloudflare-specific, that a proof of concept already runs on Vercel, and that other deployment targets are planned.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/25/bcachefs_creator_ai/\">Bcachefs creator insists his custom LLM is female and 'fully conscious'</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/23/ibm_share_dive_anthropic_cobol/\">IBM stock dives after Anthropic points out AI can rewrite COBOL fast</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/23/microsoft_ai_entry_level_russinovich_hanselman/\">Microsoft execs worry AI will eat entry level coding jobs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/amazon_denies_kiro_agentic_ai_behind_outage/\">Amazon's vibe-coding tool Kiro reportedly vibed too hard and brought down AWS</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Last month, Cloudflare posted about another AI coding project, implementing a Matrix server on its Workers platform, but ran into criticism. Matrix project lead Matthew Hodgson <a href=\"https://matrix.org/blog/2026/01/28/matrix-on-cloudflare-workers/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> \"the post severely overclaimed the scope of the project... the code doesn't yet constitute a functional Matrix server, let alone a production-grade one which you should consider deploying.\"</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Vinext appears to have more promise, with a build time up to 4.4 times faster than Next.js 16 with Turbopack, and a client bundle size that is around 56 percent smaller.</p>\n<p>According to Faulkner, the project is a particularly good fit for AI because it has an extensive test suite from which he ported tests directly. The project used Vite's existing plugin for React Server Components, a key feature of Next.js. Further, the popularity of Next.js means that a large amount of documentation, code, and discussion around the framework is out there for AI crawlers to find.</p>\n<p>This experiment may have repercussions. The notion of using AI to code a reimplementation of a widely used API could be attractive in other scenarios where lock-in exists.</p>\n<p>Another aspect is a rethinking of how code is architected. According to Faulkner, most software abstractions exist to assist human understanding, to reduce the complexity of the code. AI has the potential to remove intermediate frameworks because \"it can hold the whole system in context.\" A further implication is the creation of software projects that no human can understand – which is a problem given the non-deterministic nature of generative AI and its capacity for hallucination.</p>\n<p>The project also tends to bear out the case made in a <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/from_agile_to_ai_anniversary/\" target=\"_blank\">recent workshop</a> for test-driven development as ideal for AI coding.®</p> \n</div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>A newly released plot of the Hubble Space Telescope's altitude shows just how quickly the observatory has descended in recent years.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/planet4589.bsky.social/post/3mfnzjhkvhc27\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on Bluesky by astronomer Jonathan McDowell is a stark reminder that Hubble is heading back to Earth, possibly sooner than previously thought, as its orbit decays.</p>\n<p>Hubble was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990, carried in the payload bay of Space Shuttle Discovery. While it remains capable of pointing its instruments and has returned breathtaking imagery over more than three decades in orbit, it cannot raise its altitude.</p>\n\n<p>The observatory was serviced by a succession of Space Shuttle crews over the years, and engineers worked around hardware failures as the observatory aged. However, no amount of ground-based cleverness will stop the spacecraft from eventually re-entering the atmosphere.</p>\n\n\n<p>The plot from McDowell makes the orbital decay clear. From an initial altitude of more than 600 km, Hubble is now well below 500 km. The more rapid descent in recent years is at least partly due to increased solar activity, which has caused Earth's atmosphere to expand, but it also highlights the need for a reboost in the next few years before the telescope becomes unrecoverable.</p>\n<p>NASA is attempting to <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/12/nasa_swift_reboost/\" target=\"_blank\">rescue</a> the Swift observatory and has paused most science operations after the 21-year-old spacecraft's altitude dropped below 400 km, in order to buy extra time for a reboost mission later this year.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/07/nasa_test_stand_demolition/\">Historic NASA test towers face their final countdown</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/13/nasa_mulls_sending_a_rescue/\">NASA mulls sending a rescue rocket to boost Swift observatory's orbit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/28/nasa_voluntary_exits/\">NASA faces brain drain as thousands exit under voluntary resignation scheme</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/21/hubble_astronaut_budget_fears/\">NASA veteran warns Hubble faces death by a hundred cuts</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Jared Isaacman, now NASA Administrator, mooted boosting Hubble in <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/30/nasa_spacex_hubble_dragon/\" target=\"_blank\">2022</a>, but was ultimately rejected. Unlike Swift, Hubble was designed to be captured and serviced in space, and the last Space Shuttle servicing mission left an adapter attached to the vehicle for a future visiting spacecraft.</p>\n<p>In 2025, Dr John Grunsfeld, former astronaut and retired associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/21/hubble_astronaut_budget_fears/\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> <i>The Register</i> that Hubble faced death by a thousand cuts, decaying orbit notwithstanding. Its budget has been relatively flat for years, which means, accounting for inflation, \"we're already down about 30 percent in funding for Hubble.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"They're just trying to whittle away at it,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Hubble transitioned to a single-gyro mode in 2024. It has six of the devices, which are used to point the telescope, but three have failed, and a fourth is showing signs of degradation. The plan was to eke out a few more years of operational life from a spacecraft that had outlived all initial expectations.</p>\n<p>However, without a reboost, the telescope could re-enter the atmosphere as early as 2028, according to McDowell's analysis. His plot suggests it is already on that trajectory. ®</p> \n</div>",

Scientists also considered the theory that the relatively small size of the Moon's core – around one-seventh of its radius – means it cannot create a strong field.</p>\n\n<p>New research from Oxford's Department of Earth Sciences shows they are both right... kind of.</p>\n\n\n<p>Led by associate professor Claire Nichols, the team analyzed the composition of a type of lunar rock known as the Mare basalts and found a new correlation between their titanium content and levels of magnetism.</p>\n<p>Looking at the collected lunar samples, they found those with a strong magnetic field also contained large amounts of titanium, but those with less than 6 percent titanium were all associated with a weak magnetic field.</p>\n\n<p>The study argues that the formation of high-titanium rocks and a strong lunar magnetic field were the result of titanium-rich material melting deep inside the Moon, which created a strong magnetic field, but only for about 5,000 years.</p>\n<p>\"Our new study suggests that the Apollo samples are biased to extremely rare events that lasted a few thousand years – but up to now, these have been interpreted as representing 0.5 billion years of lunar history.

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>The British government will expand the use of AI in courts in England and Wales as part of plans to make them work faster, justice minister David Lammy has told a Microsoft AI event.</p>\n<p>Lammy, who is also deputy prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/we-are-calling-time-on-the-justice-system-of-the-past\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> the technology will be used to support processes including transcribing speech, summarizing judgments, and scheduling cases.</p>\n<p>\"We are of course already using AI to unleash the potential of our staff, including through Microsoft's AI assistant, Copilot, of which the Ministry of Justice has been one of the fastest growing users across government,\" he told the Microsoft AI tour event at Excel London on 24 February.</p>\n\n<p>Lammy said that courts and tribunals are testing technology already used by the Probation Service to transcribe meetings between offenders and officers, which he claimed has saved more than 25,000 hours because officers no longer need to type up notes.</p>\n\n\n<p>He added that some immigration and asylum judges are using AI to help write notes and remarks while legal advisers and district judges in magistrates' courts are piloting its use in transcription and summarizing judgments. HM Courts and Tribunals Service will introduce an AI-assisted listing tool to support case scheduling while the system's Justice AI Unit will get more than £12 million extra funding in the next financial year.</p>\n<p>In his speech, Lammy described the Ontario Court of Justice in Toronto as \"digital by design, purposefully paperless,\" saying he \"felt less like a visitor from another country and more like one from another time catching a glimpse of what could be.\"</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/24/hmcts_court_system_bug/\">UK justice minister pressed as court system bug raises fears of hidden case files</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/24/uk_courts_13_billion_case/\">UK courts' £1.3B case management platform hit with failures</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/21/hmcts_probate_wills_search/\">Users complain of missing data in UK wills search service</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/09/court_scolds_ai_entrepreneur_avatar_testify/\">AI entrepreneur sent avatar to argue in court – and the judge shut it down fast</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Ontario court has also experienced problems with AI. Last year, one of its judges ordered a criminal defense lawyer to refile submissions that included a made-up case and other unrelated ones. Justice Joseph Kenkel described the errors as \"<a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/artificial-intelligence-legal-research-problems-1.7550358\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">numerous and substantial</a>,\" adding that generative AI should not be used for legal research for such documents.</p>\n<p>Lammy's plans to speed up courts and reduce the backlog of cases also involve funding for more court sessions, the use of \"blitz courts\" that bundle similar cases together, and physical upgrades to courts and tribunals. Some of the ideas, including greater use of AI and more video appearances, came from a <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/05/uk_courts_cloud/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">review by Sir Brian Leveson published earlier this month</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The justice minister also wants to halve the number of jury trials by removing defendants' rights to choose these for offences with sentences of less than three years. This expansion of judge-only trials is opposed by many backbench Labour MPs and the government may struggle to get a bill enabling it through Parliament. ®</p> \n</div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>AMD has struck another chips’n’stock deal, this time with software-defined datacenter player Nutanix.</p>\n<p>The deal means AMD will acquire $150 million worth of Nutanix stock and also fund up to $100 million of joint engineering work and go-to-market efforts for a new “full-stack AI infrastructure platform” that will use Nutanix’s stack to allow agentic and inferencing applications to run in the many on-prem, cloudy, and edge environments it supports.</p>\n<p>Nutanix currently supports only Nvidia GPUs. This new deal means it will support AMD accelerators, too, making this a bet by AMD that Nutanix can generate more demand for its hardware.</p>\n\n<p>“Our goal is to provide customer choice,” Nutanix CEO Rajiv Ramaswami told <i>The Register</i>. “Nvidia has been the market leader and AMD is the other big platform company.”</p>\n\n\n<p>Ramaswami said agentic AI adoption is still at a “very early stage” within enterprises, but said Nutanix hopes to speed things up a bit by tuning its stack so it can host this class of applications wherever customers want to run them.</p>\n<p>Nutanix revealed its new ties to AMD after first announcing its Q2 results, which saw revenue grow ten percent year-over-year to reach $723 million. The company has long preferred to use annual recurring revenue as its top-line indicator, to demonstrate the strength of its subscription business, and that grew 16 percent to $2.36 billion.</p>\n\n<p>Ramaswami said the company signed 1,000 new customers in the quarter, and that most intend to migrate away from VMware.</p>\n<p>“We see a lot of that happening now,” he said. “People do not necessarily see Broadcom as a long-term partner.”</p>\n<p>IBM used its <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/29/ibm_q4_2025/\" target=\"_blank\">earnings announcement</a> to rrveal that Red Hat has signed $500 million worth of deals for its virtualization portfolio in the last two years. Ramaswami said Nutanix believes Red Hat is definitely a competitor, but that as its virtualization platform relies on Kubernetes that makes migrations more complex than moving from VMware to Nutanix.</p>\n\n<p>“We have not seen many successful migrations from VMware to Red Hat,” he said.</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/16/cisco_nfvis_for_uc_hypervisor/\">Cisco set to release home-brew hypervisor as a VMware alternative</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/17/nested_virtualization_aws_ec2/\">AWS adds nested virtualization option for handful of EC2 instances</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/13/lenovo_fx_multi_hypervisor_hci/\">Lenovo has a hunch you’re about to try quitting VMware</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/15/nutanix_sovereign_cloud/\">Nutanix takes another swipe at VMware with sovereign cloud push</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ramaswami offered investors a new take on component shortages by saying the availability of CPUs, not memory, has been Nutanix’s biggest concern.</p>\n<p>“This is driving higher prices and lengthening lead times for servers,” he told investors. “Thus far, longer lead times largely driven by lack of CPU availability have been a significantly bigger challenge for us than pricing.”</p>\n<p>Memory shortages are now starting to bite.</p>\n<p>“Through the latter half of Q2, we began to see that the challenging supply environment for CPUs, memory, storage and other components is delaying our customers' ability to procure servers from our hardware partners in order to run our software,” the CEO said. “We did not see this as a meaningful driver of our results in our fiscal Q1 … later in Q2, we did start to see it become more pronounced to a greater extent than anticipated, and expect it to continue through the rest of the fiscal year.”</p>\n<p>That’s a problem for Nutanix because the company can’t recognize some revenue for software sales until customers’ hardware arrives. The company therefore reduced its revenue guidance for the full year from between $2.82 and $2.86 billion to between $2.80 and $2.84 billion.</p>\n<p>Investors clearly liked something about either Nutanix’s results or AMD tie-up, because they sent the company’s shares up by almost 20 percent in after-hours trading. ®</p> \n</div>",

            "title": "Salesforce CEO 'SaaSquatch' Benioff says his company will monster the SaaSpocalypse",
            "description": "<div id=\"body\">\n<p>Even by the somewhat offbeat standards of the Salesforce Ohana, the CRM giant just delivered a strange earnings announcement.</p>\n<p>Speaking on the company’s Q4 earnings call, CEO Marc Benioff boasted that his company is a mythical Sasquatch, aka “Bigfoot,” set to tuck into a buffet of juicy customers waiting to buy agentic AI.</p>\n<p>“If there is a SaaSpocalypse, I think it might be eaten by the SaaSquatch because there are a lot of companies using a lot of SaaS because SaaS just got a lot better with agents as a service,” he said, referring to the theory that sinking values for SaaS companies reflect the fact that AI has damaged their business models.</p>\n\n<p>Which is a rather odd metaphor as the Sasquatch myth suggests the creature is reclusive and nocturnal, rather than rapacious.</p>\n\n\n<p>Benioff also crowed about winning 180 customers for his new Agentforce IT Service, which analysts see as the <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/05/salesforce_agentforce_vs_servicenow/\" target=\"_blank\">biggest threat</a> yet to ServiceNow’s ITSM dominance in the enterprise.</p>\n<p>“We just launched Salesforce ITSM in October and in just a few months [chief revenue officer] Miguel [Milano] has won over 180 customers, but I especially love five customers who got to leave the purgatory of ServiceNow like SunRun, Cornerstone, Cool Systems and there are others too that we’re not allowed to mention, but I might mention them anyway, who are leaving ServiceNow for the new Salesforce IT services,” Benioff said.</p>\n\n<p>But then, before the CFO Robin Washington was allowed to run through the numbers for the quarter and the year, Benioff broke from the usual earnings call format by chatting with Wyndham Hotels CEO Geoffrey Ballotti, bantering about mango sorbet with SharkNinja CEO Mark Barrocas, and telling the handful of analysts on the line about the drinks he shared at home Tuesday night with his neighbor Workday CEO Aneel Bhusri, who he said was very impressed with Slackbot.</p>\n<p>“He couldn’t believe everything that was happening between our two companies,” Benioff said.</p>\n<p>Despite the banter, news of a 5.8-percent increase in quarterly dividend to 44 cents, and a promise to repurchase $50 billion in stock, Salesforce stock slipped 5.6 percent in afterhours trading.</p>\n\n<p>Analyst Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley said Salesforce’s current remaining performance obligations came in at $35.1 billion, which was “disappointing” to analysts who expected a “little bit of a beat” in the measure of unrecognized revenue.</p>\n<p>“I think that’s stoking some concerns with investors. Can Salesforce do both? Can we grow a big Agentforce business and sustain the growth and momentum in the broader Salesforce portfolio? Can we bring along the entirety of the business?” Weiss asked. “And what gives you confidence in that acceleration in the back half of the year.”</p>\n<p>Salesforce guidance from a year ago bet that revenue would land between $40.5 and $40.9 billion for growth of seven to eight percent. Full year revenue came in at $41.5 billion, about $600 million over the upper range of its growth guidance. However that over achievement was undercut by Salesforce’s acquisition of Informatica which contributed $399 million to that total, meaning organic revenue growth was actually around $200 million. Revenue for the year’s final quarter landed at $11.2 billion, a twelve percent year-over-year jump.</p>\n<p>Benioff told Weiss he was “proud” of the numbers they put up.</p>\n<p>“This fiscal year is far better than I expected it at the beginning of the year,” Benioff said. “In the third and fourth quarter Miguel’s numbers far exceeded my expectations and to your point Agentforce is also exceeding our expectations. Could we sell more? Could we renew more? Can we do more? Can we do this? Can we do all these various things? We absolutely can, but we’re grateful for what we’ve been able to achieve so far.”</p>\n<ul class=\"listinks\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/09/heroku_freeze/\">Salesforce puts Heroku out to PaaSture</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/27/salesforce_5b_deal_agentic_ai_us_army/\">Salesforce signs $5.6B deal to inject agentic AI into the US Army</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/24/salesforce_chatgpt/\">Salesforce’s ChatGPT integration is really about stopping customers from leaking their own data</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/05/salesforce_agentforce_vs_servicenow/\">Salesforce has come up with the most credible threat yet to ServiceNow, and Benioff is crowing about it</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Benioff said Salesforce is underlevered and after achieving $15 billion in free cash flow last year – and expecting to make $16.5 billion in free cash this year – plans share buybacks to ensure it uses cash correctly.</p>\n<p>“We’re not using debt effectively. I think now is the opportunity to take some of that stock back out of the market and these are great prices. I’m sure you would agree with that and we want to use our capital correctly and I think debt is a great way to do that and I think our stock is a great price and I want [company president] Robin [Washington] to buy as much of it as she possibly can.”</p>\n<p>The company laid off <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/salesforce-cuts-less-than-1000-jobs-business-insider-reports-2026-02-10/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">1,000 employees</a> earlier this month, and Benioff stoked widespread employee outrage in a meeting by making a joke about <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/marc-benioff-ice-jokes-outrage-pivotal-time-salesforce-2026-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">US Immigration and Customs</a> Enforcement Agents tracking workers.</p>\n<h3 class=\"crosshead\">Token metrics</h3>\n<p>The company also debuted new metrics called Agent Work Units (AWUs) developed by Salesforce chief marketing officer Patrick Stokes to measure the productivity of its AI agents. Salesforce already tracks the tokens it uses – 19 trillion since it started counting – and token use by its customers, but wanted to measure tokens used to perform work.</p>\n<p>“So what we did is we said: ‘What if we could look at those work units relative to the tokens?’ and we said: ‘Oh there’s a relationship between the two.’ We can start to see a ratio of tokens being consumed and work coming out and that ratio starts to become very interesting,” Stokes said.</p>\n<p>Specifically, they measure discrete tasks executed by AI agents in production across the Salesforce platform, including Agentforce and Slack, according to the fine print. AWUs represent the conversion of generative AI capabilities into measurable business outputs, such as resolving customer cases, updating records or triggering automated workflows.</p>\n<p>They can also measure this per customer to show how much work agents are performing. ®</p> \n</div>",
