      "title": "Seven & I Takeover Proposal Tests Japan\u2019s Commitment to M&A",
      "description": "<div><p>A proposed takeover of Seven & i Holdings Co. that could result in the sale of one of Japan\u2019s strongest brands marks the first big test of the country\u2019s evolving investor-friendly stance.</p><p>Canadian retailer Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc.\u2019s proposal to buy the operator of 7-Eleven convenience stores follows the introduction last year of government guidelines on mergers and acquisitions instructing companies to seriously consider takeover offers. After years of activist investors pushing for change and unconsummated attempts from abroad to buy big companies, the deal is being  at home and abroad.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an important litmus test for Japan,\u201d said , a portfolio manager at Indus Capital Partners who holds a position in Seven & i. \u201cIt will be looked at globally by investors and strategic buyers as to the appeal and ease of doing mergers and acquisitions in Japan.\u201d</p><p>The new M&A guideline from the economy ministry isn\u2019t binding, but its impact has already been seen in a handful of domestic deals with multiple competitive bidders. This will be the first major one involving a foreign firm\u2019s proposal.</p><p>A potential obstruction for the takeover is that the Japanese government can  the deal or ask for changes in the terms, because of the fact that Seven & i is on a list of companies considered important for national security. That means officials will keep a close eye on foreign investors seeking any deal. </p><p>Seven & i shares have climbed about 14% since Couche-Tard\u2019s proposal became public. A potential deal could be worth more than \u00a55.25 trillion ($36 billion), based on the retailer\u2019s current market value, which would be the  of a Japanese company.</p><p>Japan\u2019s greater openness to corporate dealmaking is the latest step in a years-long effort to improve corporate governance that\u2019s coincided with a burst of investor interest in the country, including from . It\u2019s become the world\u2019s  activist market in past years, driven by perceptions that shares are undervalued, companies are badly-managed and more recently, that a weakening yen would boost earnings.</p><p>Although many activists tend to focus on smaller companies with straightforward requests to raise dividends or boost buybacks, a handful of larger, well-known global firms had also been targeted with more ambitious demands for change \u2014 the most high-profile of which has been Seven & i itself.</p><p>The retailer, which has more than 21,000 stores in Japan, has been embroiled in a multiyear spat with San Francisco-based ValueAct Capital Management LP, which has publicly demanded the company spin off the 7-Eleven convenience store brand, sell non-core businesses and replace top management \u2014 with mixed success. Back in 2015, the company had contended with \u2019s Third Point LLC.</p><p>Couche-Tard\u2019s bid essentially rode the coattails of activist investors this time, some say. </p><p>\u201cValueAct\u2019s very public campaign effectively instigated the bid because it so clearly framed Seven & i\u2019s shortcomings and undervaluation, and highlighted its potential,\u201d said , a broker at CLSA in London.</p><p>Regardless what happens with the takeover proposal, analysts expect the company to make further moves to boost Seven & i\u2019s share price, UBS analysts led by wrote in a note on Aug. 21.</p><p>Ironically, Seven & i Chief Executive Officer  was appointed in 2016 with the help of a pressure campaign from Third Point, which held a stake in the firm at the time. Isaka  after weeks of boardroom drama and the resignation of his predecessor after an unsuccessful plot to oust him from the line of succession. </p><p>Couche-Tard\u2019s proposal for the 7-Eleven operator may also serve as a reminder to to other Japanese companies that they need to improve their business to global standards or risk losing control.</p><p>\u201cThis is a very big wake-up call because it\u2019s an extremely big company, it\u2019s a household name,\u201d Smith at Indus Capital said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that there\u2019s no better defense than a high stock price. That is the best defense you can have against an activist or against a strategic buyer.\u201d </p></div>",

Chalmers has sought the backing of the opposition to pass the bills in order to avoid dealing with minority parties that might seek more radical changes.</p><p>The opposition has demanded that all current board members be transferred to the monetary policy committee to avoid giving Chalmers the opportunity to make a lot of new appointments.

The ball is now in the shadow treasurer\u2019s court.</p><p>The opposition will take its time and work through the detail of Chalmers\u2019 proposal, Shadow Treasurer  said in response.</p><p>\u201cIt is clear from the correspondence received yesterday that the treasurer has realized his previous positions were untenable,\u201d Taylor said in a statement. \u201cDespite long delays, it is promising to see movement, but we will take the time to ensure issues are resolved with due diligence.\u201d</p><p>Under the new structure, interest-rate decision will be made by the monetary policy committee, with the RBA\u2019s post-meeting statement likely to contain unattributed votes, as recommended by an  of the central bank last year.</p><p>The RBA review was commissioned by the Labor government after its election in May 2022 and is one of Chalmers\u2019 signature reforms. </p></div>",
