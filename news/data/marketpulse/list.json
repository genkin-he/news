Although the index retreated slightly from its intraday peak of 59,332.43, it still managed a record closing high of 58,753.39.</p><p data-block-key=\"ea1ih\">This 0.3% gain contributed to an impressive 16.4% climb for the year so far, while the broader Topix index outperformed with a 1% increase. The rally was largely underpinned by a shift in investor sentiment regarding artificial intelligence, as previous fears of industry disruption gave way to optimism.</p><p data-block-key=\"4po7u\">Software and IT services emerged as the session's primary drivers. Shift, a software testing firm, led the charge with a massive 14.4% jump, its strongest performance since mid-2024. Other major tech players followed suit, with NEC Corp and Fujitsu recording gains of 9.4% and 6%, respectively.</p><p data-block-key=\"2tpb9\">This strength in software helped offset a pullback in the semiconductor sector, where heavyweights like Advantest and Tokyo Electron shed around 2% each, acting as the primary weights on the Nikkei after markets digested Nvidia's recent results.</p><p data-block-key=\"656i2\">Outside of technology, the banking sector saw significant upward momentum following hawkish comments from Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda. In a newspaper interview, Ueda hinted at the possibility of an early interest rate hike, sending shares of major lenders like Mizuho Financial Group and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group up by 5.1% and 3.3%.</p><p data-block-key=\"f2q6j\">This financial strength provided a necessary cushion against losses in other sectors, such as electronic components and retail, where Taiyo Yuden and Takashimaya each saw declines of over 4%.</p><p data-block-key=\"36uu8\">The regional landscape remained more subdued compared to Japan's record-breaking run. While Tokyo celebrated new highs, neighboring markets struggled to find footing; Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 0.76%, and China’s CSI300 blue-chip index eased by 0.2%.</p><p data-block-key=\"a65ke\">These mixed results across Asia highlight a divergence between Japan's momentum-driven market and the more cautious sentiment prevailing in Chinese and Hong Kong equities.</p></div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"ad-slot\" id=\"ad-slot-container-oJUPJ\"></div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"post__body__block__title\">\nEuropean Session - European shares cautious\n</h2>\n<div class=\"[&amp;_a]:text-font\" style=\"--link-colour: \">\n<div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"k2luo\">European markets showed little movement on Thursday morning as the STOXX 600 hovered near record highs at 633.34 points.</p><p data-block-key=\"b27i6\">Market participants are currently balancing a wave of corporate financial reports against the broader implications of Nvidia’s latest revenue forecasts. While the US chip giant’s strong outlook provided a backdrop of stability, its shares saw a relatively subdued 1.1% gain in Frankfurt, reflecting a cautious \"wait-and-see\" approach regarding the long-term profitability of massive AI investments.</p><p data-block-key=\"4l0ts\">The technology sector remained a focal point of volatility and mixed performance across the continent.</p><p data-block-key=\"483r\">Schneider Electric saw its shares climb 3% following core earnings that exceeded expectations, fueled primarily by the surging demand for data center infrastructure.</p><p data-block-key=\"nie5\">Conversely, the Belgian chemicals firm Syensqo suffered a dramatic 22.6% collapse, leading to a temporary trading halt after the company failed to meet fourth-quarter earnings targets.</p><p data-block-key=\"ffafd\">In London, the London Stock Exchange Group managed to defy broader market skepticism, gaining 3.6% after announcing a new share buyback program. This move comes as the group navigates pressure from activist investors and ongoing concerns that advancements in artificial intelligence could disrupt its traditional business model.</p><p data-block-key=\"fkclh\">Overall, the day's activity highlights a market increasingly sensitive to how individual companies are either capitalizing on or being threatened by the rapid evolution of AI.</p><p data-block-key=\"9i3mm\">On the FX front, the Japanese yen showed signs of recovery during Thursday’s Asian trading session, strengthening 0.3% against the US dollar to reach 155.87.</p><p data-block-key=\"7i1if\">This rebound follows a period of notable weakness where the currency hit two-week lows, sparked by the Japanese government’s appointment of two pro-stimulus academics to the central bank’s board.</p><p data-block-key=\"7pkqk\">However, the yen managed to steady itself as subsequent comments from Bank of Japan officials provided much-needed support, helping the currency claw back some of its recent losses.</p><p data-block-key=\"6datj\">In the broader currency market, the US dollar index remained relatively flat at 97.585 as traders navigated a landscape of political and legal uncertainty. Markets are closely watching for President Donald Trump’s response to a recent Supreme Court ruling that struck down his emergency tariffs, a move that has kept the greenback’s momentum in check.</p><p data-block-key=\"8itbp\">Despite the dollar's general stability, it slipped 0.3% against the offshore Chinese yuan, which hit a three-year high of 6.8324. This surge in the yuan persists due to seasonal settlement demand, even as China’s central bank signals a desire to moderate the currency's rapid appreciation.</p><p data-block-key=\"54adv\">European and Antipodean currencies experienced a day of range-bound trading with minimal volatility.</p><p data-block-key=\"ct1mu\">The euro saw a marginal gain of 0.1% to reach $1.1817, while the British pound held steady at $1.3555.</p><p data-block-key=\"6rff\">Similarly, the Australian dollar remained unchanged at $0.7126. The New Zealand dollar provided a brief moment of drama by dipping below the $0.60 threshold before staging a recovery to finish flat at $0.6003.</p><p data-block-key=\"be0v8\">The digital asset market faced a more difficult session, characterized by a general downward trend in major cryptocurrencies.</p><p data-block-key=\"6fn5l\">Bitcoin retreated 0.7%, trading at $68,478.38, while Ether saw a more significant decline, tumbling 2.0% to settle at $2,059.01.</p><p data-block-key=\"ee3ir\">This cooling off in the crypto space stands in contrast to the relatively stable, albeit cautious, environment seen in traditional fiat currency markets.</p><p data-block-key=\"6g48n\"><b>Currency Power Balance</b></p></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"card-content image\">\n<div class=\"flex justify-center\" x-data=\"{\n                 imgModal: false,\n                 imgModalSrc: '',\n                 imgModalDesc: '',\n                 initPanzoom() {\n                 if (this.imgModal) {\n                 setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n                 const imageElement = document.getElementById('pinch-to-zoom-img-4219');\n                 if (imageElement) {\n                 panzoom(imageElement, {\n                 maxZoom: 4.0,\n                 minZoom: 0.5,\n                 contain: 'outside',\n                 });\n                 }\n                 }, 100);\n                 }\n                 }\n                 }\" x-init=\"$watch('imgModal', value =&gt; initPanzoom())\">\n<template x-if=\"imgModal\">\n<div class=\"fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center w-full h-full p-2 overflow-hidden bg-white bg-opacity-75 dark:bg-black dark:bg-opacity-75\" x-on:click.away=\"imgModal = false\" x-show=\"imgModal\" x-transition:enter=\"transition ease-out duration-300\" x-transition:enter-end=\"opacity-100 transform scale-100\" x-transition:enter-start=\"opacity-0 transform scale-90\" x-transition:leave=\"transition ease-in duration-300\" x-transition:leave-end=\"opacity-0 transform scale-90\" x-transition:leave-start=\"opacity-100 transform scale-100\">\n<button class=\"absolute top-4 right-4 bg-white p-2 shadow-md outline-none focus:outline-none hover:cursor-pointer z-50\" false=\"\">\n<i aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"m-auto material-icons\">close</i>\n</button>\n<div class=\"relative flex items-center justify-center w-full h-full max-w-full max-h-full overflow-hidden\" false=\"\">\n<div class=\"p-2\" id=\"pinch-to-zoom-4219\">\n<img :alt=\"imgModalSrc\" :src=\"imgModalSrc\" class=\"max-w-[90vw] max-h-[90vh] w-auto h-auto object-contain select-none\" id=\"pinch-to-zoom-img-4219\"/>\n<p class=\"text-center text-black dark:text-white\">Source: OANDA Labs</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</template>\n<div class=\"card-content image relative group align--center p-4\">\n<figure>\n<a class=\"relative block m-auto cursor-pointer\" imgmodaldesc=\"\" imgmodalsrc=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-content.oanda.com/images/2026-02-26_09_02_25-Greenshot.original.png\" true=\"\">\n<picture>\n<source srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-content.oanda.com/images/2026-02-26_09_02_25-Greenshot.width-1400.format-webp.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n<img alt=\"2026-02-26 09_02_25-Greenshot\" class=\"block h-full m-auto\" height=\"722\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-content.oanda.com/images/2026-02-26_09_02_25-Greenshot.width-1400.png\" width=\"931\"/>\n</source></picture>\n</a>\n<div class=\"absolute right-2 top-4 flex items-center justify-center transition-opacity duration-300 text-black opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 pointer-events-none\">\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"zoom-icon material-icons text-gray-700 font-bold\"></div>\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"\">Source: OANDA Labs</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"[&amp;_a]:text-font\" style=\"--link-colour: \">\n<div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"k2luo\">Gold prices saw a modest uptick on Thursday as investors turned to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset.</p><p data-block-key=\"ddjp3\">This renewed interest was primarily driven by ongoing uncertainty surrounding US tariff policies and anticipation regarding the outcome of US-Iran talks scheduled for later in the day. Spot gold had climbed 0.4% to reach $5,190.01 per ounce, maintaining its strong momentum after hitting a three-week peak earlier in the week.</p><p data-block-key=\"fcseh\">The performance across the broader metals market was more varied. While spot gold gained ground, US gold futures for April delivery edged slightly lower, dropping 0.4% to $5,206.80.</p><p data-block-key=\"eplcc\">Silver experienced a more pronounced decline, with spot prices falling 1.4% to settle at $88.18 per ounce.</p><p data-block-key=\"84ujn\">In contrast, PGMs (platinum group metals) showed resilience; spot platinum rose by 0.9% to $2,308.11 per ounce, and palladium followed suit with a marginal 0.3% increase to $1,800.14.</p><p data-block-key=\"6302u\">Oil prices edged higher on Thursday as market participants weighed the possibility of a diplomatic resolution to the escalating tensions between the United States and Iran.</p><p data-block-key=\"m9b8\">Markets are closely monitoring a high-stakes third round of talks in Geneva, where US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are meeting with an Iranian delegation.</p><p data-block-key=\"e7g8p\">The primary concern remains whether these negotiations can avert a military conflict that would threaten global supply, particularly through the critical Strait of Hormuz. While Brent futures rose 0.3% to $71.06 per barrel and WTI futures increased 0.2% to $65.58, these gains were partially restrained by a significant build in US crude inventories.</p><p data-block-key=\"7quol\">The current market environment is defined by a delicate balance between geopolitical risk and ample supply.</p><p data-block-key=\"d4oin\">Earlier in the week, Brent prices hit their highest levels since last July as the US moved military assets into the Middle East to pressure Tehran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Given that Iran is the third-largest producer in OPEC, any extended disruption to its exports could tighten the global market significantly.</p><p data-block-key=\"462hh\">However, bearish data from the US Energy Information Administration has served as a counterbalance, reminding traders of a growing domestic surplus even as the threat of regional instability looms.</p><p data-block-key=\"1kiv2\"><b>Read More:</b></p><ul><li data-block-key=\"2gv2v\"><a href=\"https://www.marketpulse.com/markets/chart-alert-wti-crude-oil-bullish-flag-in-play-above-6415-as-us-iran-talk-looms/\"><b>Chart Alert: WTI crude oil bullish flag in play above $64.15 as US-Iran talk looms</b></a></li><li data-block-key=\"3sprb\"><a href=\"https://www.marketpulse.com/markets/eurusd-trapped-at-11800-as-euro-area-inflation-cools-significantly-what-next/\"><b>EUR/USD: Trapped at 1.1800 as Euro Area inflation cools significantly… what next?</b></a></li><li data-block-key=\"a4cg0\"><a href=\"https://www.marketpulse.com/markets/usdcad-flirts-with-key-confluence-level-can-bulls-keep-up-the-gains-beyond-the-13728-handle/\"><b>USD/CAD flirts with key confluence level.

Forecasters expect initial filings for unemployment benefits to show a modest increase to 216,000, while continuing claims are projected to edge slightly lower.</p><p data-block-key=\"couj5\">Given the incremental nature of these shifts, the data is not expected to trigger significant market volatility.</p><p data-block-key=\"9bf0l\">Looking at the broader currency landscape, the US dollar may see a period of stabilization throughout the day.</p><p data-block-key=\"b0j9u\">However, it is important to note that some downside risks persist for the greenback. The positive sentiment following Nvidia’s strong earnings report continues to bolster risk appetite, which could keep investors tilted toward growth-oriented assets and away from defensive, safe-haven currencies for a bit longer.</p></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"card-content image\">\n<div class=\"flex justify-center\" x-data=\"{\n                 imgModal: false,\n                 imgModalSrc: '',\n                 imgModalDesc: '',\n                 initPanzoom() {\n                 if (this.imgModal) {\n                 setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n                 const imageElement = document.getElementById('pinch-to-zoom-img-6139');\n                 if (imageElement) {\n                 panzoom(imageElement, {\n                 maxZoom: 4.0,\n                 minZoom: 0.5,\n                 contain: 'outside',\n                 });\n                 }\n                 }, 100);\n                 }\n                 }\n                 }\" x-init=\"$watch('imgModal', value =&gt; initPanzoom())\">\n<template x-if=\"imgModal\">\n<div class=\"fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center w-full h-full p-2 overflow-hidden bg-white bg-opacity-75 dark:bg-black dark:bg-opacity-75\" x-on:click.away=\"imgModal = false\" x-show=\"imgModal\" x-transition:enter=\"transition ease-out duration-300\" x-transition:enter-end=\"opacity-100 transform scale-100\" x-transition:enter-start=\"opacity-0 transform scale-90\" x-transition:leave=\"transition ease-in duration-300\" x-transition:leave-end=\"opacity-0 transform scale-90\" x-transition:leave-start=\"opacity-100 transform scale-100\">\n<button class=\"absolute top-4 right-4 bg-white p-2 shadow-md outline-none focus:outline-none hover:cursor-pointer z-50\" false=\"\">\n<i aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"m-auto material-icons\">close</i>\n</button>\n<div class=\"relative flex items-center justify-center w-full h-full max-w-full max-h-full overflow-hidden\" false=\"\">\n<div class=\"p-2\" id=\"pinch-to-zoom-6139\">\n<img :alt=\"imgModalSrc\" :src=\"imgModalSrc\" class=\"max-w-[90vw] max-h-[90vh] w-auto h-auto object-contain select-none\" id=\"pinch-to-zoom-img-6139\"/>\n<p class=\"text-center text-black dark:text-white\">For all market-moving economic releases and events, see the MarketPulse Economic Calendar.

Investors will scrutinize whether NVIDIA’s growth is becoming more broad-based, reaching \"sovereign AI\" (national governments) and smaller enterprises, which would mitigate the risk of a slowdown in mega-cap spending.</p><p data-block-key=\"26nc0\"><b>Gross Margin Trajectory</b></p><p data-block-key=\"54f1k\">Management has guided for an adjusted gross margin of approximately 75%. Investors will watch if the costs associated with the Blackwell ramp-up create \"transitory\" pressure on these margins. A structural dip below 75% could signal that the era of peak pricing power is beginning to normalize, potentially weighing on the stock’s premium valuation.</p><p data-block-key=\"2ebm4\"><b>The Geopolitical and Regulatory Landscape</b></p><p data-block-key=\"1vkoq\">Commentary regarding China remains a wildcard. NVIDIA has been navigating U.S. export restrictions by developing region-specific chips like the H20. Any updates on regulatory approvals for newer models or the recovery of market share in China will be closely monitored.</p></div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"post__body__block__title\">\nPotential implications for the NVIDIA share price\n</h2>\n<div class=\"[&amp;_a]:text-font\" style=\"--link-colour: \">\n<div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"nggfa\">Despite the fundamental strength, NVDA stock has been consolidating in a tight range between $170 and $195 for nearly six months. This \"sideways\" movement suggests a stalemate between bulls who see further AI expansion and bears who fear a cyclical peak.</p><p data-block-key=\"5mohq\"><b>The Bull Case:</b> If NVIDIA beats on the top and bottom lines and provides a robust Blackwell-driven outlook, it could break above the <b>$195–$200 resistance level</b>, potentially retesting all-time highs near $210. This would likely ignite a \"halo effect\" across the broader semiconductor sector (AMD, TSMC) and the S&amp;P 500.</p><p data-block-key=\"358vg\"><b>The Bear Case:</b> The \"bar keeps getting higher.\" If management provides conservative guidance or hints at supply chain constraints lasting through 2026, the stock could test support at <b>$170</b>.

However, the administration is pivoting to alternative legal tools.</i></li><li data-block-key=\"4l69f\"><i>US financial markets reacted positively to the tariff ruling but had to contend with a disappointing 1.4% GDP report and higher-than-expected inflation data (PCE price index up 0.4% MoM).</i></li><li data-block-key=\"2vrd1\"><i>A 5% weekly gain in oil prices, combined with persistent inflation data, has brought inflationary pressures back to the fore.</i></li><li data-block-key=\"1r9dt\"><i>The market's attention shifts to high-stakes corporate earnings especially Nvidia, as the bellwether for the AI boom and crucial economic data, including the Australian Monthly CPI and US Consumer Confidence.</i></li></ul><p data-block-key=\"vbfu\">When looking back at the week that was, there is no place better to start than the Supreme Court ruling in the United States.</p><p data-block-key=\"22gim\">In a significant legal blow to the administration, the US Supreme Court ruled on February 20, 2026, that President Trump exceeded his constitutional authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to bypass Congress and impose broad global tariffs.</p><p data-block-key=\"eorgl\">While the 6–3 decision effectively strikes down the legal justification for many of the administration's \"Liberation Day\" and fentanyl-related levies, it does not mean the end of trade restrictions.</p><p data-block-key=\"elltp\">The ruling specifically targets the use of emergency statutes for taxation, yet leaves intact several other tariffs such as those on steel, aluminum, and certain auto parts that are grounded in different legal frameworks like Section 232 or Section 301.</p><p data-block-key=\"3b3ep\">Consequently, while the court has dismantled the specific \"emergency\" scaffolding the President relied upon, the administration has already signaled it will pivot to alternative statutory tools to keep its wider trade agenda standing.</p><p data-block-key=\"dh7hd\"><b>What is the way forward?</b></p><p data-block-key=\"9nte\">The Supreme Court’s decision focused strictly on the boundaries of executive power rather than the merits of trade protectionism, meaning the administration's broader tariff objectives remain very much alive. While the previous legal justifications have been stripped away, they are being rapidly replaced by new statutory foundations, ushering in a volatile transition period for the global economy.</p><p data-block-key=\"3aadu\">Businesses now face a period of deep instability as they navigate the unlikely prospect of receiving full refunds for past duties and the high probability of \"replacement tariffs\" that will restore costs to their previous levels.</p><p data-block-key=\"kddc\">Ultimately, while the specific legal \"scaffolding\" has been dismantled, the administration is already rebuilding its trade barriers; regardless of the court's stance on the Constitution, the era of high tariffs appears far from over.</p></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"card-content image\">\n<div class=\"flex justify-center\" x-data=\"{\n                 imgModal: false,\n                 imgModalSrc: '',\n                 imgModalDesc: '',\n                 initPanzoom() {\n                 if (this.imgModal) {\n                 setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n                 const imageElement = document.getElementById('pinch-to-zoom-img-6379');\n                 if (imageElement) {\n                 panzoom(imageElement, {\n                 maxZoom: 4.0,\n                 minZoom: 0.5,\n                 contain: 'outside',\n                 });\n                 }\n                 }, 100);\n                 }\n                 }\n                 }\" x-init=\"$watch('imgModal', value =&gt; initPanzoom())\">\n<template x-if=\"imgModal\">\n<div class=\"fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center w-full h-full p-2 overflow-hidden bg-white bg-opacity-75 dark:bg-black dark:bg-opacity-75\" x-on:click.away=\"imgModal = false\" x-show=\"imgModal\" x-transition:enter=\"transition ease-out duration-300\" x-transition:enter-end=\"opacity-100 transform scale-100\" x-transition:enter-start=\"opacity-0 transform scale-90\" x-transition:leave=\"transition ease-in duration-300\" x-transition:leave-end=\"opacity-0 transform scale-90\" x-transition:leave-start=\"opacity-100 transform scale-100\">\n<button class=\"absolute top-4 right-4 bg-white p-2 shadow-md outline-none focus:outline-none hover:cursor-pointer z-50\" false=\"\">\n<i aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"m-auto material-icons\">close</i>\n</button>\n<div class=\"relative flex items-center justify-center w-full h-full max-w-full max-h-full overflow-hidden\" false=\"\">\n<div class=\"p-2\" id=\"pinch-to-zoom-6379\">\n<img :alt=\"imgModalSrc\" :src=\"imgModalSrc\" class=\"max-w-[90vw] max-h-[90vh] w-auto h-auto object-contain select-none\" id=\"pinch-to-zoom-img-6379\"/>\n<p class=\"text-center text-black dark:text-white\">Source: ING, Macrobond</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</template>\n<div class=\"card-content image relative group align--center p-4\">\n<figure>\n<a class=\"relative block m-auto cursor-pointer\" imgmodaldesc=\"\" imgmodalsrc=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-content.oanda.com/images/2026-02-20_23_41_04-TOPNEWS.original.png\" true=\"\">\n<picture>\n<source srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-content.oanda.com/images/2026-02-20_23_41_04-TOPNEWS.width-1400.format-webp.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n<img alt=\"2026-02-20 23_41_04-TOPNEWS\" class=\"block h-full m-auto\" height=\"598\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-content.oanda.com/images/2026-02-20_23_41_04-TOPNEWS.width-1400.png\" width=\"1006\"/>\n</source></picture>\n</a>\n<div class=\"absolute right-2 top-4 flex items-center justify-center transition-opacity duration-300 text-black opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 pointer-events-none\">\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"zoom-icon material-icons text-gray-700 font-bold\"></div>\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"\">Source: ING, Macrobond</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"ad-slot\" id=\"ad-slot-container-KDCjE\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"[&amp;_a]:text-font\" style=\"--link-colour: \">\n<div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"p5jrd\"><b>How did markets react?</b></p><p data-block-key=\"6o6r8\"><b>Read More:</b> <a href=\"https://www.marketpulse.com/markets/market-wrap-feb-20-2026/\"><b>Tariffs struck down, major volatility ahead? – North American session Market wrap for February 20</b></a></p><p data-block-key=\"1o2rv\">US financial markets reacted positively to the Supreme Court's decision on Friday with all three major indexes climbing immediately following the ruling and securing a winning week overall.</p><p data-block-key=\"ah1ec\">While investors were encouraged by the legal blow to the administration’s trade barriers, they also had to weigh a disappointing GDP report showing growth slowing to 1.4% alongside higher-than-expected inflation data.</p><p data-block-key=\"50rvg\">Treasury yields moved upward as the loss of tariff revenue sparked concerns over a widening fiscal deficit and increased bond supply.</p><p data-block-key=\"943dl\">Internationally, the optimism was even more pronounced; Europe’s STOXX 600 index surged to a new all-time high, and gold prices continued their ascent as a weakening dollar and persistent geopolitical uncertainty fueled demand for safe-haven assets.</p><p data-block-key=\"7uvvl\">The continued rise in Gold prices is a nod to the uncertainty which Friday's decision brings despite the optimism. In short, the decision in some ways brings more questions than answers.</p><p data-block-key=\"7c39c\"><b>Inflation back to the fore</b></p><p data-block-key=\"7jkl7\">The US PCE price index rose 0.4% month-over-month in December 2025, following a 0.2% increase in November, the most since February and above market expectations of 0.3%.</p><p data-block-key=\"em9r2\">This coupled with a 5% weekly gain for Oil prices has reignited fears of inflationary pressures returning which would complicate matters for the global economy.</p><p data-block-key=\"frb0p\">In December 2025, the European Central Bank projected that a 14% spike in oil prices would potentially add 0.5 percentage points to eurozone inflation over the long term, while shaving a modest 0.1 percentage points off annual growth.</p><p data-block-key=\"8v98n\">This outlook is particularly sensitive to Europe’s heavy reliance on imported energy, which often causes the Euro to weaken against the Dollar as fuel costs rise. Since those projections were made, oil prices have already climbed by that exact 14% margin, bringing the ECB’s cautionary scenario into reality.</p><p data-block-key=\"d694v\">Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the Federal Reserve expressed concern in its January 2026 meeting minutes about the persistent risk of inflation remaining above target, even suggesting that future interest rate hikes could be necessary.</p><p data-block-key=\"8hb72\">Despite these hawkish signals from central bankers, investors appear relatively unfazed, continuing to price in two rate cuts for the year, a sentiment supported by the fact that domestic gasoline prices remain near multi-year lows, providing a crucial psychological buffer for the markets.</p><p data-block-key=\"67npv\">If oil prices do continue to rise and the geopolitical situation in the Middle East continues to escalate, there may be real risks to the inflationary outlook moving forward.</p></div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"post__body__block__title\">\nThe Week Ahead\n</h2>\n<div class=\"[&amp;_a]:text-font\" style=\"--link-colour: \">\n<div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"p5jrd\">The week ahead sees the focus shift from macroeconomic policy debates to high-stakes corporate earnings and inflation data.</p><p data-block-key=\"5fd6b\"><b>The AI Litmus Test: Nvidia and Software Earnings</b></p><p data-block-key=\"1b9jm\">The primary catalyst for Wall Street will be Nvidia’s quarterly report. As the bellwether for the artificial intelligence boom, Nvidia’s results and guidance will determine if the massive valuations in the semiconductor sector remain justified.</p><p data-block-key=\"8m1uh\">Beyond hardware, the spotlight moves to the \"software layer\" of AI. Results from Salesforce, Snowflake, Intuit, Zoom, and Zscaler will be scrutinized to see if enterprise spending on AI software is finally translating into significant revenue growth. These reports follow a period of market stagnation caused by hawkish Fed signals and rising geopolitical tensions.</p><p data-block-key=\"dtcb4\"><b>Central Banks and the \"balancing act\" Dilemma</b></p><p data-block-key=\"6j24j\">Central banks face a difficult balancing act, often described as a choice between fighting persistent inflation and supporting slowing growth.</p><p data-block-key=\"bo9ah\"><b>United States:</b> On Wednesday, the CB Consumer Confidence index will be a vital indicator of whether high interest rates and inflation are finally breaking the American consumer’s resilience.</p><p data-block-key=\"ekeqp\"><b>Australia:</b> Wednesday also brings the Monthly CPI indicator. If inflation remains above the RBA’s target band, markets may price in a higher probability of a March rate hike.</p><p data-block-key=\"7bvhn\"><b>Japan:</b> The market will watch a speech by BoJ’s Takada on Thursday for hints regarding the timing of further policy normalization, alongside Friday's Industrial Production and Retail Sales data.</p><p data-block-key=\"988nj\"><b>Energy and Geopolitics</b></p><p data-block-key=\"8b3c3\">Rising oil prices (with Brent Crude seeing recent volatility) remain a wildcard. Tensions between the US and Iran have added a risk premium to energy markets, complicating the inflation outlook for central banks. Investors will monitor whether energy costs continue to climb, potentially forcing a \"higher for longer\" interest rate environment.</p><p data-block-key=\"cnq7u\"><b>Summary of Key Dates:</b></p><p data-block-key=\"vj65\"><b>Feb 24 (Tue):</b> US Factory Orders.</p><p data-block-key=\"6pegp\"><b>Feb 25 (Wed):</b> Nvidia Earnings; AU Monthly CPI; US Consumer Confidence.</p><p data-block-key=\"qjec\"><b>Feb 26 (Thu):</b> Salesforce &amp; Snowflake Earnings; BoJ Takada Speech.</p><p data-block-key=\"fejis\"><b>Feb 27 (Fri):</b> Japan Industrial Production; US Jobless Claims.</p><p data-block-key=\"3cur3\">Market Sentiment: Expect a \"show me the money\" attitude from investors.

This tech-driven retreat prompted investors to pivot toward safe-haven bonds.</p><p data-block-key=\"7riu5\">The downward trend originated on Wall Street, where the Nasdaq Composite fell 2% following a disappointing quarterly report from Cisco Systems. Cisco saw its shares plunge 12% erasing roughly $40 billion in market value after rising memory chip costs caused its adjusted gross margins to miss analyst expectations.</p><p data-block-key=\"279m\">The volatility quickly spread to other industry leaders, notably Apple, which experienced a 5% decline. This marked the stock's sharpest one-day drop since April of the previous year, a period defined by market anxiety over President Trump’s \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.</p><p data-block-key=\"6d3a2\">Consequently, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 1.1% on Friday, though it maintained a 3.7% gain for the week.</p><p data-block-key=\"1a8u6\">Similarly, Japan’s Nikkei shed 1.3% despite ending the week up nearly 5%.</p><p data-block-key=\"d0ec8\">The slump extended into Greater China, with Chinese blue chips falling 0.9% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index sliding 2.1%.</p><p data-block-key=\"8484s\">Amidst the broader market turbulence, a report from the Financial Times suggested a potential shift in trade policy. Citing internal sources, the publication noted that President Trump is considering a reduction in certain steel and aluminum tariffs, offering a potential counterbalance to the prevailing tech-sector gloom.</p><p data-block-key=\"5mlhu\"><b>Most Read:</b> <a href=\"https://www.marketpulse.com/markets/chart-alert-nikkei-225-bullish-acceleration-intact-towards-60000-in-the-first-step/\"><b>Chart alert: Nikkei 225 bullish acceleration intact towards 60,000 in the first step</b></a></p></div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"ad-slot\" id=\"ad-slot-container-cG68Y\"></div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"post__body__block__title\">\nSwiss inflation holds steady\n</h2>\n<div class=\"[&amp;_a]:text-font\" style=\"--link-colour: \">\n<div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"lu4t7\">Switzerland's annual inflation rate held steady in January at 0.1%, matching both December's figure and consensus forecasts.</p><p data-block-key=\"1if3\">The data revealed a continued deflationary trend across several sectors, with prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages, clothing, footwear, and household services all remaining in negative territory compared to the previous year. Transport costs saw the most significant contraction, dropping 2% year-on-year.</p><p data-block-key=\"dfblm\">Meanwhile, price increases moderated for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, while costs for education remained flat and the information and communication sector saw its growth stall entirely at 0%.</p><p data-block-key=\"etf3m\">Offsetting these declines were accelerating costs in other categories, most notably housing and energy, which rose to 0.8% from a previous 0.4%.</p><p data-block-key=\"q86\">Price growth also gained momentum in the recreation, culture, and miscellaneous goods sectors.</p><p data-block-key=\"4i60v\">Despite these internal shifts, core inflation which strips out the volatile effects of unprocessed food and energy remained consistent at 0.5% for the second consecutive month.</p><p data-block-key=\"1h7je\">On a month-to-month basis, the broader Consumer Price Index edged down 0.1%, a slight dip following a stagnant reading in December.</p></div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"post__body__block__title\">\nEuropean Session - European shares eye cautious open\n</h2>\n<div class=\"[&amp;_a]:text-font\" style=\"--link-colour: \">\n<div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"lu4t7\">European stock markets headed toward a tentative opening this Friday as a global sell-off in the technology sector raised fresh doubts about the long-term viability of massive AI investments.</p><p data-block-key=\"11eki\">These concerns regarding AI-driven disruption extended beyond tech, creating a drag on the logistics, financial, and commercial real estate sectors. Amidst this cautious atmosphere, investors turned their attention to a heavy macroeconomic calendar, which included German wholesale prices, Spanish inflation figures, and a suite of Eurozone data covering GDP, employment, and trade.</p><p data-block-key=\"a99vg\">Despite the underlying tension, premarket futures for the Euro Stoxx 50 and Stoxx 600 remained relatively flat, suggesting a neutral start for the broader indices.</p><p data-block-key=\"e1n7n\">The session was further complicated by a wave of corporate earnings, most notably from French beauty giant L'Oreal, which saw its shares tumble approximately 6% in early trading. This decline, marking the company's worst performance since at least October, followed fourth-quarter sales of 11.3 billion euros (roughly $13.4 billion) that narrowly missed analyst targets.</p><p data-block-key=\"edgmj\">The shortfall was primarily attributed to a stagnant recovery in North Asia, the global beauty industry’s second-largest market, where growth failed to meet expectations.</p><p data-block-key=\"a7906\">Adding to the pressure, Deutsche Bank Research suggested that L'Oreal’s earnings growth is likely to decelerate in the immediate future.</p><p data-block-key=\"3uq5e\">On the FX front, the Japanese yen was on track for its strongest weekly performance in nearly 15 months on Friday, capping a period of steady gains.</p><p data-block-key=\"fj530\">The currency’s resurgence became the primary focal point of the foreign exchange market, defying early predictions that a landslide victory for Sanae Takaichi would trigger a deepening sell-off. Instead, the clear electoral mandate appears to have eased concerns regarding fiscal stability and political gridlock, encouraging investors to unwind \"short\" bets against the yen.</p><p data-block-key=\"2iria\">By Friday, the yen was trading at 153.08 per dollar, and while it dipped slightly in the final session, it remained poised for a 2.7% weekly advance, its most significant climb since November 2024.</p><p data-block-key=\"8o9vf\">This strength was mirrored across other major pairs, with the yen set for a 2.3% weekly jump against the euro and a 2.7% rise against the British pound.</p><p data-block-key=\"aootl\">In the broader currency market, the euro and sterling saw modest declines, with the euro trading at $1.1863 and the pound easing to $1.3613.</p><p data-block-key=\"be2ff\">Meanwhile, the Australian dollar faced a 0.3% daily dip to $0.7072, though it remained on course for a weekly gain of nearly 0.9%. The Aussie’s recent resilience has been supported by a hawkish stance from the Reserve Bank of Australia, which recently implemented a rate hike to combat persistent inflation.</p><p data-block-key=\"1k60a\">Overall, the US dollar index stood slightly higher at 97.01 on Friday but was still tracking toward a 0.7% loss for the week as global investors pivoted toward the rebounding yen and other high-yielding assets.</p><p data-block-key=\"fmjpj\"><b>Currency Power Balance</b></p></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"card-content image\">\n<div class=\"flex justify-center\" x-data=\"{\n                 imgModal: false,\n                 imgModalSrc: '',\n                 imgModalDesc: '',\n                 initPanzoom() {\n                 if (this.imgModal) {\n                 setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n                 const imageElement = document.getElementById('pinch-to-zoom-img-2889');\n                 if (imageElement) {\n                 panzoom(imageElement, {\n                 maxZoom: 4.0,\n                 minZoom: 0.5,\n                 contain: 'outside',\n                 });\n                 }\n                 }, 100);\n                 }\n                 }\n                 }\" x-init=\"$watch('imgModal', value =&gt; initPanzoom())\">\n<template x-if=\"imgModal\">\n<div class=\"fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center w-full h-full p-2 overflow-hidden bg-white bg-opacity-75 dark:bg-black dark:bg-opacity-75\" x-on:click.away=\"imgModal = false\" x-show=\"imgModal\" x-transition:enter=\"transition ease-out duration-300\" x-transition:enter-end=\"opacity-100 transform scale-100\" x-transition:enter-start=\"opacity-0 transform scale-90\" x-transition:leave=\"transition ease-in duration-300\" x-transition:leave-end=\"opacity-0 transform scale-90\" x-transition:leave-start=\"opacity-100 transform scale-100\">\n<button class=\"absolute top-4 right-4 bg-white p-2 shadow-md outline-none focus:outline-none hover:cursor-pointer z-50\" false=\"\">\n<i aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"m-auto material-icons\">close</i>\n</button>\n<div class=\"relative flex items-center justify-center w-full h-full max-w-full max-h-full overflow-hidden\" false=\"\">\n<div class=\"p-2\" id=\"pinch-to-zoom-2889\">\n<img :alt=\"imgModalSrc\" :src=\"imgModalSrc\" class=\"max-w-[90vw] max-h-[90vh] w-auto h-auto object-contain select-none\" id=\"pinch-to-zoom-img-2889\"/>\n<p class=\"text-center text-black dark:text-white\">Source: OANDA Labs</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</template>\n<div class=\"card-content image relative group align--center p-4\">\n<figure>\n<a class=\"relative block m-auto cursor-pointer\" imgmodaldesc=\"\" imgmodalsrc=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-content.oanda.com/images/2026-02-13_09_14_09-.original.png\" true=\"\">\n<picture>\n<source srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-content.oanda.com/images/2026-02-13_09_14_09-.width-1400.format-webp.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n<img alt=\"2026-02-13 09_14_09-\" class=\"block h-full m-auto\" height=\"716\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-content.oanda.com/images/2026-02-13_09_14_09-.width-1400.png\" width=\"910\"/>\n</source></picture>\n</a>\n<div class=\"absolute right-2 top-4 flex items-center justify-center transition-opacity duration-300 text-black opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 pointer-events-none\">\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"material-icons text-gray-700 font-bold\">zoom_out_map</div>\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"\">Source: OANDA Labs</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"[&amp;_a]:text-font\" style=\"--link-colour: \">\n<div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"lu4t7\">Gold prices edged higher on Friday, mounting a recovery from a nearly one-week low as the market shifted its focus to impending US inflation data.</p><p data-block-key=\"dov4p\">This rebound follows a volatile week where a string of robust labor market reports pressured the Federal Reserve to reconsider the timing of potential interest rate cuts, cooling the enthusiasm for non-yielding assets.</p><p data-block-key=\"4ma3u\">Spot gold rose 0.6% to reach $4,949.99 per ounce, while US gold futures for April delivery climbed 0.4% to $4,968.0. Despite this intraday bounce, the metal remains down slightly for the week after a dramatic 3% plunge on Thursday, which saw prices crash through the psychological $5,000 support level amid a broader liquidation triggered by an equities rout.</p><p data-block-key=\"dtev7\">The recovery was mirrored across the precious metals complex, with silver leading the charge by gaining 1.5% to trade at $76.31 per ounce. While silver managed to claw back some of the staggering 11% loss it suffered during Thursday’s sell-off, it is still on track to finish the week over 2% lower.</p><p data-block-key=\"92nfa\">In the PGM sector, spot platinum increased by 0.9% to $2,018.44 per ounce and palladium surged 2.2% to $1,652.31.</p><p data-block-key=\"6t86c\">However, both metals are likely to end the week in negative territory as investors remain cautious, balancing long-term central bank demand against the immediate impact of a stronger US dollar and shifting interest rate expectations.</p><p data-block-key=\"dm2p6\">Oil prices continued their downward trend on Friday, positioning benchmarks for a second consecutive weekly loss as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East showed signs of easing.</p><p data-block-key=\"2jqfb\">Market anxiety regarding a potential conflict between the US and Iran which could have severely disrupted global supplies began to dissipate, pulling prices lower.</p><p data-block-key=\"5ajj1\">Brent crude futures edged down to $67.40 per barrel, following a significant 2.7% drop in the previous session, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell to $62.71.</p><p data-block-key=\"bnq3o\">For the week, Brent is on track for a 0.8% decline, with WTI trailing slightly further behind at a 1.1% loss.</p><p data-block-key=\"dt1l2\">In addition to shifting geopolitical risks, the market is adjusting to a significant influx of supply from South America. US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright reported on Thursday that American-controlled oil sales from Venezuela have already exceeded $1 billion since the capture of President Nicolás Maduro in January. Wright projected that these operations are set to generate an additional $5 billion over the coming months as the US rehabilitates Venezuela's energy infrastructure.</p><p data-block-key=\"dfs8l\">This surge in anticipated supply, combined with a recent International Energy Agency report forecasting weaker global demand, has created a bearish environment for crude as the trading week concludes.</p><p data-block-key=\"34bog\"><b>Read More:</b></p><ul><li data-block-key=\"cpt66\"><a href=\"https://www.marketpulse.com/markets/get-ready-for-cpi-us-inflation-preview/\"><b>Get ready for CPI – US Inflation Preview</b></a></li><li data-block-key=\"5lrnj\"><a href=\"https://www.marketpulse.com/news/breaking-news-uk-gdp-underwhelms-with-01-growth-in-q4-ftse-100-slips-gbpusd-advances/\"><b>Breaking News: UK GDP underwhelms with 0.1% growth in Q4, FTSE 100 slips &amp; GBP/USD advances</b></a></li><li data-block-key=\"6fd5t\"><a href=\"https://www.marketpulse.com/markets/chart-alert-gold-rally-faces-risk-of-exhaustion-below-5170/\"><b>Chart alert: Gold rally faces risk of exhaustion below $5,170</b></a></li></ul></div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"post__body__block__title\">\nEconomic Calendar and Final Thoughts\n</h2>\n<div class=\"[&amp;_a]:text-font\" style=\"--link-colour: \">\n<div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"lu4t7\">The day ahead is a quiet one in terms of EU and UK data with all high impact data already released.</p><p data-block-key=\"7bg48\">The US session looks set to be a bumpy one after yesterday's selloff with inflation data on deck.</p><p data-block-key=\"d98e6\">Today’s US inflation report is expected to have a more muted impact on the market compared to Wednesday's payroll data, as the Federal Reserve’s current stance prioritizes labor market health over price stability.</p><p data-block-key=\"7b2i4\">Consensus forecasts suggest a \"clean\" January print with headline and core CPI both rising 0.3% month-on-month and 2.5% annually. Such a result would likely validate the market’s recent hawkish shift in Fed expectations, reinforcing the view that the US dollar is currently undervalued in the short term.</p><p data-block-key=\"83ci4\">While this technical undervaluation suggests a potential upside for the greenback, recent price action indicates that investors are still eager to sell into any dollar rallies, making a sustained recovery difficult.</p><p data-block-key=\"129k7\">However, the dollar has found some support as a safe-haven asset during the recent volatility in the tech sector. This restoration of its protective status, combined with a patient Federal Reserve, suggests the dollar may remain resilient even if major rallies are capped by persistent bearish sentiment.</p></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"card-content image\">\n<div class=\"flex justify-center\" x-data=\"{\n                 imgModal: false,\n                 imgModalSrc: '',\n                 imgModalDesc: '',\n                 initPanzoom() {\n                 if (this.imgModal) {\n                 setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n                 const imageElement = document.getElementById('pinch-to-zoom-img-5368');\n                 if (imageElement) {\n                 panzoom(imageElement, {\n                 maxZoom: 4.0,\n                 minZoom: 0.5,\n                 contain: 'outside',\n                 });\n                 }\n                 }, 100);\n                 }\n                 }\n                 }\" x-init=\"$watch('imgModal', value =&gt; initPanzoom())\">\n<template x-if=\"imgModal\">\n<div class=\"fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center w-full h-full p-2 overflow-hidden bg-white bg-opacity-75 dark:bg-black dark:bg-opacity-75\" x-on:click.away=\"imgModal = false\" x-show=\"imgModal\" x-transition:enter=\"transition ease-out duration-300\" x-transition:enter-end=\"opacity-100 transform scale-100\" x-transition:enter-start=\"opacity-0 transform scale-90\" x-transition:leave=\"transition ease-in duration-300\" x-transition:leave-end=\"opacity-0 transform scale-90\" x-transition:leave-start=\"opacity-100 transform scale-100\">\n<button class=\"absolute top-4 right-4 bg-white p-2 shadow-md outline-none focus:outline-none hover:cursor-pointer z-50\" false=\"\">\n<i aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"m-auto material-icons\">close</i>\n</button>\n<div class=\"relative flex items-center justify-center w-full h-full max-w-full max-h-full overflow-hidden\" false=\"\">\n<div class=\"p-2\" id=\"pinch-to-zoom-5368\">\n<img :alt=\"imgModalSrc\" :src=\"imgModalSrc\" class=\"max-w-[90vw] max-h-[90vh] w-auto h-auto object-contain select-none\" id=\"pinch-to-zoom-img-5368\"/>\n<p class=\"text-center text-black dark:text-white\">For all market-moving economic releases and events, see the MarketPulse Economic Calendar.

Despite a strong earnings report from AI giant Nvidia, which beat expectations and provided a positive outlook, investors remained unimpressed.</p><p data-block-key=\"cic2q\">This lackluster reception contributed to a decline in Wall Street performance, which subsequently spilled over into Asian markets.</p><p data-block-key=\"3pcvh\">The regional impact was widespread but varied:</p><ul><li data-block-key=\"8itri\"><b>China and South Korea:</b> The CSI300 and Kospi both saw declines of 0.34% and 0.6%, respectively.</li><li data-block-key=\"3h5md\"><b>Japan:</b> The Nikkei managed a marginal gain of 0.22%, even as broader regional indices stayed flat.</li></ul><p data-block-key=\"40o6f\">The tepid reaction to Nvidia’s success indicates a \"priced-to-perfection\" environment. Even though the company's performance was objectively strong, the market appears unwilling to push valuations higher, reflecting a broader hesitation to chase stocks at their current elevated levels.</p></div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"ad-slot\" id=\"ad-slot-container-tr9BR\"></div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"post__body__block__title\">\nGerman import prices remain low\n</h2>\n<div class=\"[&amp;_a]:text-font\" style=\"--link-colour: \">\n<div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"epjdi\">Germany’s import prices saw a significant annual decline of <b>2.3%</b>, maintaining the same rate of decrease seen in December and marking the sharpest drop since early 2024.</p><p data-block-key=\"3vsk9\">This downward trend was largely driven by a massive <b>21.1%</b> plunge in energy costs, with crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products all seeing double-digit price cuts. Even when removing volatile energy from the equation, import prices still edged down by <b>0.1%</b>. Agricultural products also contributed to the decline, falling <b>6.5%</b> as the costs for raw cocoa, live pigs, and grains cooled significantly compared to the previous year.</p><p data-block-key=\"cslff\">While consumer goods including both durable and non-durable items became roughly <b>2.7%</b> cheaper to import, there was a notable spike in the cost of intermediate goods. These prices rose by <b>2.8%</b>, fueled primarily by a dramatic <b>65.2%</b> surge in the cost of precious metals and a <b>25.9%</b> increase in non-ferrous metals.</p><p data-block-key=\"ta75\">Interestingly, while the year-over-year numbers show a decline, the monthly data suggests a shift in momentum; import prices actually climbed <b>1.1%</b> in January alone, a much stronger rebound than the <b>0.6%</b> increase analysts had anticipated.</p></div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"post__body__block__title\">\nEuropean Session - European shares eye strong monthly close\n</h2>\n<div class=\"[&amp;_a]:text-font\" style=\"--link-colour: \">\n<div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"epjdi\">European equity markets remained steady on Friday, positioning the pan-European STOXX 600 for its eighth consecutive month of growth, the longest winning streak for the benchmark since the 2012–2013 period.</p><p data-block-key=\"3kk1h\">Despite persistent anxieties surrounding potential AI-driven business disruptions and the impact of new global tariffs enacted by US President Donald Trump, investor sentiment was bolstered by a string of resilient corporate earnings.</p><p data-block-key=\"4lg4v\">Early trading saw the STOXX 600 rise 0.1% to 634.16 points, hovering near record territory, with mining stocks spearheading the gains with a 1.7% jump.</p><p data-block-key=\"42u2o\">The market's upward momentum was largely supported by encouraging updates from major players like HSBC, Nestle, and Capgemini, which helped offset broader macroeconomic concerns. However, the session was not without its laggards:</p><ul><li data-block-key=\"bh3dl\"><b>Delivery Hero:</b> Shares tumbled 5.2% after the company’s annual gross merchandise value missed market estimates, highlighting the intense competition and economic hurdles within the food delivery sector.</li><li data-block-key=\"e0nlg\"><b>Banking Sector:</b> Financial stocks dipped over 0.4% as investors reacted to the insolvency of MFS, a UK mortgage-finance firm, and assessed the potential contagion or exposure risks across the industry.</li></ul><p data-block-key=\"1tlbd\">Overall, while sector-specific challenges like the MFS insolvency and tech-disruption fears remain on the radar, the prevailing trend in February has been one of cautious optimism fueled by strong corporate fundamentals.</p><p data-block-key=\"jcbs\">On the FX front, the US dollar is on track to secure its first monthly gain since October, bolstered by a flight to safety amid simmering geopolitical tensions.</p><p data-block-key=\"5nuup\">This resurgence comes as the Chinese yuan lost its upward momentum following government intervention to halt a prolonged currency rally. While the greenback found strength, the Australian dollar emerged as a standout performer, heading for its fourth consecutive monthly gain. The Aussie rose 0.12% to $0.7115, fueled by a robust economy and expectations that the central bank will pivot toward interest rate hikes, making it the top-performing G10 currency this year with a 6% year-to-date increase.</p><p data-block-key=\"7thcg\">In contrast, other major currencies faced a more complicated landscape:</p><p data-block-key=\"8c46f\"><b>The Japanese Yen:</b> Despite Governor Kazuo Ueda signaling a potential near-term rate hike, the yen remained weak due to domestic political instability. The dollar has capitalized on this, gaining nearly 0.9% against the yen in February to trade at 156.17.</p><p data-block-key=\"67o6h\"><b>The Euro and Sterling:</b> Both currencies are staring at monthly losses. The euro held steady near $1.18 but is down 0.4% for the month, while the British pound remained flat at $1.348, snapping a three-month winning streak with a 1.4% decline in February.</p><p data-block-key=\"ev838\">Overall, the final Friday of the month highlights a divergence in central bank outlooks, where domestic economic strength in Australia and geopolitical jitters globally are redefining currency hierarchies.</p><p data-block-key=\"27d6g\"><b>Currency Power Balance</b></p></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"card-content image\">\n<div class=\"flex justify-center\" x-data=\"{\n                 imgModal: false,\n                 imgModalSrc: '',\n                 imgModalDesc: '',\n                 initPanzoom() {\n                 if (this.imgModal) {\n                 setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n                 const imageElement = document.getElementById('pinch-to-zoom-img-4994');\n                 if (imageElement) {\n                 panzoom(imageElement, {\n                 maxZoom: 4.0,\n                 minZoom: 0.5,\n                 contain: 'outside',\n                 });\n                 }\n                 }, 100);\n                 }\n                 }\n                 }\" x-init=\"$watch('imgModal', value =&gt; initPanzoom())\">\n<template x-if=\"imgModal\">\n<div class=\"fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center w-full h-full p-2 overflow-hidden bg-white bg-opacity-75 dark:bg-black dark:bg-opacity-75\" x-on:click.away=\"imgModal = false\" x-show=\"imgModal\" x-transition:enter=\"transition ease-out duration-300\" x-transition:enter-end=\"opacity-100 transform scale-100\" x-transition:enter-start=\"opacity-0 transform scale-90\" x-transition:leave=\"transition ease-in duration-300\" x-transition:leave-end=\"opacity-0 transform scale-90\" x-transition:leave-start=\"opacity-100 transform scale-100\">\n<button class=\"absolute top-4 right-4 bg-white p-2 shadow-md outline-none focus:outline-none hover:cursor-pointer z-50\" false=\"\">\n<i aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"m-auto material-icons\">close</i>\n</button>\n<div class=\"relative flex items-center justify-center w-full h-full max-w-full max-h-full overflow-hidden\" false=\"\">\n<div class=\"p-2\" id=\"pinch-to-zoom-4994\">\n<img :alt=\"imgModalSrc\" :src=\"imgModalSrc\" class=\"max-w-[90vw] max-h-[90vh] w-auto h-auto object-contain select-none\" id=\"pinch-to-zoom-img-4994\"/>\n<p class=\"text-center text-black dark:text-white\">Source: OANDA Labs</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</template>\n<div class=\"card-content image relative group align--center p-4\">\n<figure>\n<a class=\"relative block m-auto cursor-pointer\" imgmodaldesc=\"\" imgmodalsrc=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-content.oanda.com/images/2026-02-27_10_50_23-Greenshot.original.png\" true=\"\">\n<picture>\n<source srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-content.oanda.com/images/2026-02-27_10_50_23-Greenshot.width-1400.format-webp.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n<img alt=\"2026-02-27 10_50_23-Greenshot\" class=\"block h-full m-auto\" height=\"721\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-content.oanda.com/images/2026-02-27_10_50_23-Greenshot.width-1400.png\" width=\"906\"/>\n</source></picture>\n</a>\n<div class=\"absolute right-2 top-4 flex items-center justify-center transition-opacity duration-300 text-black opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 pointer-events-none\">\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"zoom-icon material-icons text-gray-700 font-bold\"></div>\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"\">Source: OANDA Labs</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"[&amp;_a]:text-font\" style=\"--link-colour: \">\n<div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"epjdi\">Oil prices went up by about $1 as markets worried that the ongoing nuclear talks between the US and Iran might lead to problems with the world's oil supply.</p><p data-block-key=\"42rln\">Brent crude rose by 1.6% to reach $71.88 per barrel, while US oil (WTI) increased by 1.7% to $66.31.

Both French and Spanish inflation did come in higher than market expectations which surprisingly is a positive for the EU which had concerns around inflation falling below the 2% target of the ECB.</p><p data-block-key=\"63r0l\">Looking ahead to the US session, it also lacks any significant high impact data releases. The primary focus for the US economic calendar today is the release of January’s Producer Price Index (PPI) report.</p><p data-block-key=\"a38tk\">Both headline and core inflation figures are expected to rise by 0.3% month-on-month, which aligns perfectly with market consensus. Unless the data deviates significantly from these projections, I anticipate the release will be a \"non-event\" with minimal impact on market volatility.</p><p data-block-key=\"7dq1s\">While Federal Reserve officials John Williams and Neel Kashkari are scheduled to speak following yesterday's dovish remarks from Austan Goolsbee, investors are largely ignoring \"Fedspeak\" for now. This indifference stems from the fact that recent economic data simply does not justify a rate cut in the next two meetings.</p><p data-block-key=\"c5fcb\">There have been some warnings issued by China and other countries warning citizens to leave Iran and Israel respectively. Could this be a precursor for an attack by the US? Keep a close watch ahead of the market close today as any major escalation over the weekend could lead to huge gaps at the market open on Sunday evening.</p></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"card-content image\">\n<div class=\"flex justify-center\" x-data=\"{\n                 imgModal: false,\n                 imgModalSrc: '',\n                 imgModalDesc: '',\n                 initPanzoom() {\n                 if (this.imgModal) {\n                 setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n                 const imageElement = document.getElementById('pinch-to-zoom-img-4034');\n                 if (imageElement) {\n                 panzoom(imageElement, {\n                 maxZoom: 4.0,\n                 minZoom: 0.5,\n                 contain: 'outside',\n                 });\n                 }\n                 }, 100);\n                 }\n                 }\n                 }\" x-init=\"$watch('imgModal', value =&gt; initPanzoom())\">\n<template x-if=\"imgModal\">\n<div class=\"fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center w-full h-full p-2 overflow-hidden bg-white bg-opacity-75 dark:bg-black dark:bg-opacity-75\" x-on:click.away=\"imgModal = false\" x-show=\"imgModal\" x-transition:enter=\"transition ease-out duration-300\" x-transition:enter-end=\"opacity-100 transform scale-100\" x-transition:enter-start=\"opacity-0 transform scale-90\" x-transition:leave=\"transition ease-in duration-300\" x-transition:leave-end=\"opacity-0 transform scale-90\" x-transition:leave-start=\"opacity-100 transform scale-100\">\n<button class=\"absolute top-4 right-4 bg-white p-2 shadow-md outline-none focus:outline-none hover:cursor-pointer z-50\" false=\"\">\n<i aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"m-auto material-icons\">close</i>\n</button>\n<div class=\"relative flex items-center justify-center w-full h-full max-w-full max-h-full overflow-hidden\" false=\"\">\n<div class=\"p-2\" id=\"pinch-to-zoom-4034\">\n<img :alt=\"imgModalSrc\" :src=\"imgModalSrc\" class=\"max-w-[90vw] max-h-[90vh] w-auto h-auto object-contain select-none\" id=\"pinch-to-zoom-img-4034\"/>\n<p class=\"text-center text-black dark:text-white\">For all market-moving economic releases and events, see the MarketPulse Economic Calendar.

Traditionally viewed by some as \"digital gold,\" Bitcoin has recently behaved more like a high-risk asset. As tensions escalate, investors are retreating from volatile markets in favor of traditional safe havens like the US Dollar and physical gold.</p><p data-block-key=\"qmn9\">This \"risk-off\" sentiment has triggered liquidations across the board, affecting not just Bitcoin, but Ethereum and major altcoins like XRP.</p><p data-block-key=\"4ag09\"><b>Regulatory Stalls: The \"Clarity Act\"</b></p><p data-block-key=\"1e0g1\">Adding to the bearish momentum is the renewed stalling of the Clarity Act in Washington.</p><p data-block-key=\"700lo\">For months, the crypto industry has been banking on this legislative framework to provide the legal certainty needed for broader institutional adoption. The latest delays have deflated hopes for a near-term regulatory breakthrough, leading to a sense of exhaustion among traders who were expecting a \"regulatory tailwind\" to push prices toward new highs.</p><p data-block-key=\"eb6cp\"><b>Corporate Treasuries Under Fire</b></p><p data-block-key=\"bk2ce\">The downturn is putting immense pressure on corporate \"Bitcoin Treasuries.\"</p><p data-block-key=\"at85h\"><b>Strategy (MicroStrategy):</b> In a bold show of conviction, the company recently \"scooped up\" another 2,486 BTC at an average price of $67,710. This brings their total holdings to over 717,131 BTC. However, with the current market price dipping below their recent purchase levels, the firm reported substantial operating losses, reflecting the risks of the treasury model.</p><p data-block-key=\"7plqv\"><b>Metaplanet:</b> The Japan-based firm reported a staggering valuation decline of approximately $665 million (102.2 billion Yen) on its holdings, highlighting the volatility that public companies face when anchoring their balance sheets to digital assets.</p><p data-block-key=\"c14n2\">Add to this the growing calls from analysts from major banks which have cautioned that we are likely to \"see more pain\" before a sustainable recovery begins and the apprehension by market participants becomes partially explained.</p><p data-block-key=\"9d7ac\">There is also a rise in Bitcoin ETF redemption's and the recent rotation of capital into Artificial Intelligence (AI) sectors which are contributing to the current liquidity drain.</p></div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"post__body__block__title\">\nWhat does the technical picture tell us about Bitcoin's next potential move?\n</h2>\n<div class=\"[&amp;_a]:text-font\" style=\"--link-colour: \">\n<div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"1s4fe\">Looking at the chart below, price action toward the end of the trend illustrates a Symmetrical Triangle pattern being in play.</p><p data-block-key=\"1ulhq\"><b>Pattern Breakdown</b></p><p data-block-key=\"a7s1c\">In this specific Bitcoin (BTC/USD) chart, the pattern is formed by two converging trendlines:</p><p data-block-key=\"13vbg\"><b>The Lower Trendline:</b> A rising support line (black) connecting the higher lows since the major bounce near $60,000.</p><p data-block-key=\"2fn17\"><b>The Upper Trendline:</b> A descending resistance line (implied by the recent lower highs) that is squeezing the price into a narrow range.</p><p data-block-key=\"6j98t\"><b>Key Characteristics Observed:</b></p><p data-block-key=\"42d3j\"><b>Consolidation:</b> After the sharp drop from $90,000, the market is \"coiling,\" meaning volatility is decreasing as buyers and sellers reach a temporary equilibrium.</p><p data-block-key=\"2p44m\"><b>The Pivot Point:</b> The price has broken below the apex of the triangle and the 50-period SMA (blue line), which is acting as a dynamic pivot or support/resistance zone.</p><p data-block-key=\"acocb\"><b>The Breakout:</b> In technical analysis, a decisive close below this lower support line would confirm a bearish breakout, suggesting a move toward the next major support level at $65,000 or even $60,000.</p><p data-block-key=\"bbv8l\">If the bearish momentum continues and the price stays below the $68288 level, a move lower toward $60000 and potentially $56625 may be on the cards.</p><p data-block-key=\"b3d7e\"><b>Counter-Scenario:</b> Should this prove to be a \"fakeout\" and the price climbs back inside and breaks the upper resistance, the upside targets could be approximately $79971 (near the $80k mark). This would require a break of immediate resistance areas at $68288 and $70000 first.</p><p data-block-key=\"8rj1\"><b>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Four-Hour Chart, February 18, 2026</b></p></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"card-content image\">\n<div class=\"flex justify-center\" x-data=\"{\n                 imgModal: false,\n                 imgModalSrc: '',\n                 imgModalDesc: '',\n                 initPanzoom() {\n                 if (this.imgModal) {\n                 setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n                 const imageElement = document.getElementById('pinch-to-zoom-img-6883');\n                 if (imageElement) {\n                 panzoom(imageElement, {\n                 maxZoom: 4.0,\n                 minZoom: 0.5,\n                 contain: 'outside',\n                 });\n                 }\n                 }, 100);\n                 }\n                 }\n                 }\" x-init=\"$watch('imgModal', value =&gt; initPanzoom())\">\n<template x-if=\"imgModal\">\n<div class=\"fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center w-full h-full p-2 overflow-hidden bg-white bg-opacity-75 dark:bg-black dark:bg-opacity-75\" x-on:click.away=\"imgModal = false\" x-show=\"imgModal\" x-transition:enter=\"transition ease-out duration-300\" x-transition:enter-end=\"opacity-100 transform scale-100\" x-transition:enter-start=\"opacity-0 transform scale-90\" x-transition:leave=\"transition ease-in duration-300\" x-transition:leave-end=\"opacity-0 transform scale-90\" x-transition:leave-start=\"opacity-100 transform scale-100\">\n<button class=\"absolute top-4 right-4 bg-white p-2 shadow-md outline-none focus:outline-none hover:cursor-pointer z-50\" false=\"\">\n<i aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"m-auto material-icons\">close</i>\n</button>\n<div class=\"relative flex items-center justify-center w-full h-full max-w-full max-h-full overflow-hidden\" false=\"\">\n<div class=\"p-2\" id=\"pinch-to-zoom-6883\">\n<img :alt=\"imgModalSrc\" :src=\"imgModalSrc\" class=\"max-w-[90vw] max-h-[90vh] w-auto h-auto object-contain select-none\" id=\"pinch-to-zoom-img-6883\"/>\n<p class=\"text-center text-black dark:text-white\">Source: TradingView.com (click to enlarge)</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</template>\n<div class=\"card-content image relative group align--center p-4\">\n<figure>\n<a class=\"relative block m-auto cursor-pointer\" imgmodaldesc=\"\" imgmodalsrc=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-content.oanda.com/images/BTCUSD_2026-02-18_00-11-59.original.png\" true=\"\">\n<picture>\n<source srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-content.oanda.com/images/BTCUSD_2026-02-18_00-11-59.width-1400.format-webp.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n<img alt=\"BTCUSD_2026-02-18_00-11-59\" class=\"block h-full m-auto\" height=\"811\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-content.oanda.com/images/BTCUSD_2026-02-18_00-11-59.width-1400.png\" width=\"1400\"/>\n</source></picture>\n</a>\n<div class=\"absolute right-2 top-4 flex items-center justify-center transition-opacity duration-300 text-black opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 pointer-events-none\">\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"zoom-icon material-icons text-gray-700 font-bold\"></div>\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"\">Source: TradingView.com (click to enlarge)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"ad-slot\" id=\"ad-slot-container-mhGfC\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"[&amp;_a]:text-font\" style=\"--link-colour: \">\n<div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"1s4fe\">Follow Zain on Twitter/X for Additional Market News and Insights <a href=\"https://x.com/zvawda\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><i>@zvawda</i></a></p></div>\n</div>\n\n</div>",
