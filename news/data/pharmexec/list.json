Until now, we lacked options to help prevent a devastating recurrence and immunotherapy was only available for patients with advanced CSCC who were no longer candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation,” said Vishal A. Patel, M.D., associate professor of dermatology and of medicine (hematology/oncology) at the George Washington University School of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences and director of the Cutaneous Oncology Program at the GW Cancer Center. “Many patients who undergo surgical resection of their CSCC are later found, on full pathological evaluation, to be at high risk of recurrence. As the first and only immunotherapy approved in the adjuvant setting, Libtayo represents a practice-changing opportunity for this patient population, backed by compelling data showcasing its ability to significantly improve disease-free survival.”</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><h1 class=\"text-3xl pb-4 pt-2\">What is FDA’s approval based on?</h1><p class=\"pb-2\">Libtayo’s approval from FDA is based on data collected from the Phase III C-Post trial, which investigated adjuvant Libtayo compared to placebo in patients diagnosed with CSCC who are at high risk of recurrence after surgery and radiation.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1 </sup>Results from the study, showed Libtayo’s 68% reduction in risk of disease recurrence or death, compared to patients administered with placebo who have CSCC, and are at high risk of recurrence after surgery and radiation.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup></p><p class=\"pb-2\">Libtayo’s safety profile is consistent with the known safety profile for Libtayo monotherapy in advanced cancers, with the most common adverse reactions of a single agent in adjuvant CSCC at high risk of recurrence were rash, pruritus, and hypothyroidism.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup> Serious adverse reactions were reported in 18% of patients, including pneumonia 1.5%, rash 1.5%, diarrhea 1.5%, adrenal insufficiency 1%, and arrhythmia 1%, in the arm administered with the Libtayo treatment.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">“This approval provides patients with CSCC at high risk of disease recurrence following surgery and radiation a much-needed option, as Libtayo is the only immunotherapy to demonstrate efficacy in this setting,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., board co-chair, president and chief scientific officer of Regeneron. “Now with five FDA-approved indications, Libtayo is firmly established as a strong and versatile PD-1 inhibitor option for patients with a variety of cancers.”</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><h1 class=\"text-3xl pb-4 pt-2\">What is the impact of Libtayo’s approval?</h1><p class=\"pb-2\">“CSCC is one of the most common skin cancers in the world, with an estimated 1.8 million cases diagnosed each year in the U.S. alone. While it can often be treated successfully with surgery and radiation, many patients face serious risk of advanced disease recurrences,” said Samantha R. Guild, president, AIM at Skin Cancer Foundation. “This approval is wonderful news for people living with CSCC, and we commend Regeneron for its long-standing commitment to addressing needs in non-melanoma skin cancer through its pioneering research.”</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><h1 class=\"text-3xl pb-4 pt-2\">Sources</h1><ol class=\"my-2\"><li class=\"list-decimal ml-8\">Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc) Approved in the U.S. as First and Only Immunotherapy for Adjuvant Treatment of Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CSCC) with a High Risk of Recurrence After Surgery and Radiation <em>Regeneron Pharmaceuticals </em>October 8, 2025 <a href=\"https://investor.regeneron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/libtayor-cemiplimab-rwlc-approved-us-first-and-only\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://investor.regeneron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/libtayor-cemiplimab-rwlc-approved-us-first-and-only</a></li></ol><p class=\"pb-2\"></p></div>",

The experimental drug for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes is currently in Phase III clinical trials.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Ray uses the push and pull factors of MariTide to focus on the general decision-making processes around moving compounds forward in a commercial big pharma setting.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">MariTide is a bispecific antibody-peptide conjugate that acts on two hormone receptors simultaneously. As a GLP-1 receptor agonist, MariTide activates the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor, which promotes insulin release and suppresses appetite.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Also, simultaneously, as a GIP receptor antagonist, it blocks the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor, which may reduce fat storage.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">This dual mechanism provides a different approach compared to existing GLP-1 drugs, like Wegovy and Zepbound, which are GLP-1 receptor agonists but may also be GIP receptor agonists.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Raymond J.

EFX is the only treatment to show significant fibrosis regression in compensated cirrhosis patients in a phase II trial.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">EFX holds the potential to address the complex, multi-system disease state of all stages of MASH, while also improving risk factors linked to cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death among patients diagnosed with MASH.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup> Additionally, EFX is designed for subcutaneous dosing once a week, along with being engineered to mirror the biological activity profile of native FGF21.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup></p><p class=\"pb-2\">“Efruxifermin complements Novo Nordisk’s leading portfolio and is aligned with our commitment to building a competitive portfolio of treatment options across the stages of MASH. Within MASH, there remains a huge medical need for effective treatment options, especially in the later stages of the disease,” said Martin Lange, chief scientific officer and executive vice president of research &amp; development at Novo Nordisk. “Based on the data generated by Akero, we believe efruxifermin could be a first- and best-in-class treatment for mid- to late-stage MASH with the potential to reverse liver damage.

And other platforms will claim to have that same capability, but the ability for Simoa to routinely and reliably provide absolute quantitation of biomarker levels is critical, right? And that's been proven through case study after case study with our platform, the measures across cohorts remain consistent, independent of users or study sites, so they others will claim Ultra sensitivity, but truly, Simoa has that capacity and has the reliability and performance that's been unmatched, and that has been shown over and over throughout clinic, different case studies.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>PE: How is Quanterix approaching inclusivity and representation in the development and communication of biomarker-driven diagnostics?<br/></em><strong>Tetrault:</strong> Well, what's critical and important about biomarker diagnostics and with each trial that presents itself, is the ability to measure different cohorts independent of who performed the testing. Right? And so, when we bring up diversity in populations, populations inherently male, female, Hispanic, Black, Pacific Islander, white, everyone has a different measure in terms of their biomarker baselines, right? And it's understood that different biomarkers represent themselves differently in different cohorts. And it's important for some for these studies to be able to be performed with something that's ultra-sensitive and reliable, so independent of the population and independent of the person performing the study. It's critical that you understand that the data that's coming out is, in fact, accurate. So when we think about representation and applying the right metrics for the right populations, you want to be able to have reliable and consistent data, and that's truly what Simoa is able to provide.</p></div>",

Even if it’s a little bit, that’s still better than nothing.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>PE: What is the timeline for American patients to notice the impact on drug pricing?</em><br/><strong>Soliman:</strong> If you remember, the provision is specific to patients that are under Medicare. Elderly patients will see more of an impact. For people on commercial plans, the impact remains to be seen. But if you’re under a federally-funded program, you might see more of an impact.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">In America, 80% of people on drugs are on generics. We talk a lot about pharma pricing, but the majority of people who are on multiple medications are on generics. For those drugs, you’re not going to see much of a difference. It’s mostly for the branded drugs where you’ll see some savings.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>PE: How will US drug price negotiations impact global market dynamics?</em><br/><strong>Soliman:</strong> In the US, it’s going to put more scrutiny on how we price drugs, how the pricing models are developed, and how we determine if they’re fair. Today, in the United States, FDA doesn’t look at cost effectiveness as criteria. In Europe, they do. We may move towards more of an emphasis on looking at how we’re going to price drugs before we bring them to the market and commercialize them.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Pricing in comparison to other countries wasn’t something that people talked about in the media until the Trump administration brought it up. A lot of people knew it, and people would get their drugs from Canada or something like that. It wasn’t something that any administration had thought about in any formal way.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">From that perspective, the MFN executive order is a great idea, but the devil is in the details, such as which drugs are required to be in there.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>Pharmaceutical Executive: How is the pharma industry already reacting to the administration's efforts?</em><br/><strong>Soliman:</strong> We’ve seen a lot of pharma companies saying that they want to comply and work with the administration. Some have already committed to manufacture domestically. Long term, this could be good for the country. I agree with the administration that relying on foreign countries could be a national security threat.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">There’s been a lot of data published about some of the quality and safety concerns coming out of some of the plants in China. FDA has had a hard time auditing those plants. It’s a good thing for pharma companies to manufacture here long term. Will there potentially be an increase in cost? There could be.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">How much will get passed down to the patient? That remains to be seen. Overall, it’s a net positive because it means we don’t have as much reliance on these other countries.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">We know that generic drugs are often manufactured outside of the US and we often see that these drugs, unfortunately, can be compromised. There’s been a lot of issues.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>PE: How are the drug pricing negotiations impacting pharma's relationship with DC?</em><br/><strong>Soliman:</strong> Since the IRA, there’s been strain between DC and the pharma industry. During the Biden administration, his administration attempted to put a price cap on insulin and there was a lot of push back. A lot of the pharma companies left the trade organization PHARMA. Some went to the courts to fight.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">There’s some strain, and I think it is unfair to the pharma industry to put these kinds of limits and caps on what they’re doing. Making the pharma industry cap out costs could stifle innovation. The pharma industry has helped to cure major diseases, like polio. HIV used to be a death sentence, and now people can be kept alive.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>PE: How are other players in the healthcare industry reacting to drug pricing negotiations?</em><br/><strong>Soliman:</strong> The insurance companies and PBMs, they make money on rebates. The rebates are based on the drug’s price, and the higher the price, the higher the rebate. If the drug price is lower, they’ll make lower profit. For PBMS, they’re probably not that happy about it. We saw this a few years ago during Senate hearings. The Merck CEO talked about how PBMs were driving up costs and the system was set up in a way that made it difficult to keep prices lower.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">That’s something that must be explored.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>PE: How are updates to FDA's processes impacting medical affairs teams?</em><br/><strong>Soliman:</strong> One of the things with the Trump administration, is that by FDA speeding up approvals with priority vouchers, this is going to speed up launch times. Today, if you’re a field medical affairs organization, making sure that your team has the broad skill sets to deal with policy changes that are happening across the country is important. Medical affairs, more so than salespeople, are the major face in front of doctors.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">MSLs, on average, get about 40 minutes in front of a doctor, where a sales rep only gets about a minute.</p></div>",

Developers and healthcare organizations are being urged to prioritize trust, transparency, and clinical validation as AI moves deeper into patient care and drug development. The piece highlights that while AI can accelerate diagnostics, data analysis, and decision-making, it must be designed with ethical guardrails, explainability, and diverse training data to avoid bias. For pharmaceutical companies, successful AI integration will depend on embedding these systems into existing clinical and regulatory workflows, not just deploying stand-alone tools.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">In commercial innovation, Amgen has launched AmgenNow, a new direct-to-consumer digital platform aimed at enhancing patient access to the company’s medicines. The platform allows patients to learn about Amgen therapies, explore coverage options, and directly connect with support services—all within a single online ecosystem. The initiative marks a broader trend of major pharmaceutical firms engaging consumers more directly and building brand-driven digital ecosystems. Analysts say AmgenNow could help improve medication adherence and strengthen patient loyalty in an increasingly competitive therapeutic landscape.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">And finally, AstraZeneca has entered a multi-target strategic research collaboration with Algen to advance next-generation small-molecule and biologic therapies. The partnership combines AstraZeneca’s deep clinical development capabilities with Algen’s discovery expertise in multiple therapeutic areas. Financial terms include upfront payments and milestone-based incentives tied to research progress. This agreement underscores AstraZeneca’s ongoing commitment to external innovation and collaboration as key drivers of its long-term R&amp;D growth strategy.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Thanks for listening to <em>Pharmaceutical Executive</em> Daily.

class=\"pb-2\">FDA based its approval on results collected from two Phase III trials, Fibroneer-IPF and Fibroneer-ILD.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup> Jascayd’s efficiency was evaluated in both randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of adults with IPF.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup> The primary endpoint was the absolute change from baseline in Forced Vital Capacity, which is the maximum amount of air a person can forcefully exhale after taking the deepest possible breath.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup><strong> </strong>Results indicated that Participants administered with Jascayd had significantly reduced FVC decline when compared to participants treated with the placebo.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup><strong> </strong>Jascayd’s recommended dosage is 18 mg orally twice a day, administered 12 hours apart.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup><strong> </strong>Jascayd' dosage may be reduced for intolerability to 9 mg twice daily, except in patients who also are taking pirfenidone.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup></p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><h1 class=\"text-3xl pb-4 pt-2\">What were the results from the phase III Fibroneer-IPF trial?</h1><p class=\"pb-2\">During the trial, patients (Fibroneer-IPF, n=1177) were randomized and received Jascavd 9mg twice per day, 18mg twice per day, or placebo.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">2</sup> Trial data was pooled, and changes in FVC spanning 76 weeks, along with clinically relevant outcomes (acute exacerbations, respiratory hospitalization, and death) were analyzed, with analyses including the overall population and subgroups of patients through use of background therapy at baseline.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">2</sup></p><p class=\"pb-2\">Results of phase III trial portrayed a 43% reduced risk of death and was observed in patients who received 18mg of Jascavd.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">2</sup><strong> </strong>Additionally, patients administered with 18mg Jascavd without background therapy, displayed a reduction in the risk of death, by 59%. <sup class=\"text-inherit\">2</sup><strong> </strong>The reduction in risk of death was also seen in patients taking background nintedanib and saw a 41% reduction in the risk of death.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Trial results yielded the most common side effects associated with Jascayd, which includes the following:</p><ul class=\"my-2\"><li

pt-2\">Boehringer Ingelheim’s statement regarding the phase III Fibroneer-IPF trial</h1><p class=\"pb-2\">“For people living with pulmonary fibrosis, mortality remains unacceptably high, with every second person dying within 5 years of diagnosis,” said Shashank Deshpande, chairman of the board of managing directors and head of human pharma at Boehringer Ingelheim. “As the first Phase III trial program to demonstrate a nominally significant reduction in the risk of death in progressive pulmonary fibrosis, Fibroneer heralds a significant advance for this group of patients, who face a devastating diagnosis and very limited treatment options.”</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><h1 class=\"text-3xl pb-4 pt-2\">Sources</h1><ol class=\"my-2\"><li class=\"list-decimal ml-8\">FDA approves drug to

For many in the industry, this moment marks the end of a long regulatory journey. We should see it differently. This isn't a finish line. It's a starting gate.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Having spent 30 years transforming operations across healthcare, manufacturing, and energy, I've seen what happens when visibility improves but workflows don't. The gains are small and the frustration lingers because people stop trusting the tech when the experience hasn't actually changed.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">For the first time, we now have unit-level serialization across the drug supply chain. The shift from lot-level tracking to item-level visibility creates a foundation that the pharmacy has never had before. The compliance requirement is important, but it's what we build on top of it that will actually move the profession forward.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><h1 class=\"text-3xl pb-4 pt-2\">Serialization changes what's possible</h1><p class=\"pb-2\">Before DSCSA, drug tracking stopped at the lot. If a product was recalled, we could identify a general batch, but we often couldn't say exactly which units were on which shelves, in which hospitals, or inside which crash carts. Pharmacy teams scrambled to trace product movement. Documentation was inconsistent. Hours were lost. Risks increased.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">With serialization, every sellable unit has its own identity. That means we can know not just what drug it is, but where it went, when it was received, and what action was taken. If a recall is issued, we can trace the affected unit directly to its location and remove it quickly. This kind of precision recall has moved from theory to reality, provided the infrastructure around it is ready.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">That's where the real challenge lies. Compliance may be checked off, but if the data sits in disconnected systems, or if the workflows remain manual, we won't see the benefits serialization can offer. DSCSA gives us the data. It's up to us to use it well.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><h1 class=\"text-3xl pb-4 pt-2\">Compliance doesn't guarantee readiness</h1><p class=\"pb-2\">I walked into a hospital last month and watched them track inventory on paper. In 2025, drug transfers between sister hospitals still happen on handwritten forms, reconciliations are done with clipboards, and audit logs are managed with spreadsheets. This goes beyond inefficiency into dangerous territory, especially when processes rely on individual memory and siloed systems.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">In that kind of environment, serialization is limited. You may have the data, but you can't act on it with speed or confidence. What we need is better design, not more software. We need systems that talk to each other, interfaces that present the right information at the right moment, and alerts that trigger action rather than noise.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">You can't digitize dysfunction. If your workflows are broken, adding serial numbers just gives you broken workflows with better tracking. While some vendors spread uncertainty about DSCSA readiness, the real question isn't whether you're compliant but whether you're ready to compete in a serialized world.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><h1 class=\"text-3xl pb-4 pt-2\">Credit reconciliation is a clear example</h1><p class=\"pb-2\">Returns and credits are among the most frustrating areas of pharmacy operations. Retailers send back products, manufacturer policies vary widely, and documentation is incomplete. Disputes that drag on for 6-12 months could be resolved in days with proper serialization.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">If we can match a returned product to its serialized ID, we can confirm exactly what was shipped, when it was received, whether it qualifies for credit, and how to process it fairly. When the data is accurate and trusted by both sides, there's no need for negotiation. That transparency changes everything as guesswork becomes clarity and friction becomes resolution.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><h1 class=\"text-3xl pb-4 pt-2\">The real opportunity is intelligence</h1><p class=\"pb-2\">DSCSA provides a better dataset, but its full value will only be realized when we build systems that turn that data into intelligence.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Pharmacy teams should not have to chase down information during a crisis. They should be supported by systems that surface relevant details, alert them to issues before they escalate, and guide them through resolution. That means building decision support into everyday workflows, whether it's during intake, tray prep, inventory cycles, or product returns.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">People don't need AI magic. They need to see how the system reached its conclusion. Give them the alert, show them the supporting data, and let them verify it until they don't need to anymore. That's how trust is earned. The point is to remove the burden of tracking, reconciling, and verifying every single unit, letting clinicians focus on care. Serialization helps with that only if we build systems that use it properly.<br/></p><h1 class=\"text-3xl pb-4 pt-2\">What comes next is the real transformation</h1><p class=\"pb-2\">In pharmacy, we have a chance to get it right. We now have a data layer that tells us what we didn't know before. Now we need to connect it to the way people work. That means simplifying the process, removing unnecessary steps, and creating a system where compliance becomes a byproduct of doing the job well rather than another burden to manage.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">We're barely out of the blocks with the real race being to build intelligence on top of compliance. If we treat this as a victory lap instead of a warm-up, we'll miss the transformation pharmacy has needed for years.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">DSCSA gives us the data layer that pharmacies have needed for decades. Now we decide whether to use it to check a compliance box or to finally fix what's broken. The starting gun has fired. Time to run.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>Kim Fluchel is VP of supply chain &amp; compliance products at Inmar.</em></p></div>",

Safety results for this population remained consistent with clinical trials of Simponi in adults with UC.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Simponi is an anti-TNF biologic medicine targeting and blocking TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) protein developed by Johnson &amp; Johnson. The medication is also approved in Europe, Canada, Japan, and other countries for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis with the medicine methotrexate, adults with active psoriatic arthritis alone or with the medicine MTX, adults with active ankylosing spondylitis, and adults and children weighing at least 33 lbs. with moderately to severely active UC.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup></p><p class=\"pb-2\">Simponi is administered as a pre-filled syringe and can be self-administered for patients 12 years and older, following proper training by a healthcare provider.

            "description": "<div class=\"blockText_blockContent__TbCXh\"><div class=\"relative\"><div autoplay=\"\" class=\"brightcove-fluid\"></div></div><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>Pharmaceutical Executive: How will pharma companies react to the administration's efforts?</em><br/><strong>Dr. William Soliman:</strong> We’ve seen Pfizer doing a deal with Trump, and I think other companies will follow. If they can come to a compromise for even just some branded drugs, that’s a happy middle-ground. What they’re looking for in exchange for dropping prices is for the administration to push back the tariffs. That’s part of the Pfizer deal.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">I do think it will make a difference and pharma companies will concede, even if not fully to what Trump wants. Even if it’s a little bit, that’s still better than nothing.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>PE: What is the timeline for American patients to notice the impact on drug pricing?</em><br/><strong>Soliman:</strong> If you remember, the provision is specific to patients that are under Medicare. Elderly patients will see more of an impact. For people on commercial plans, the impact remains to be seen. But if you’re under a federally-funded program, you might see more of an impact.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">In America, 80% of people on drugs are on generics. We talk a lot about pharma pricing, but the majority of people who are on multiple medications are on generics. For those drugs, you’re not going to see much of a difference. It’s mostly for the branded drugs where you’ll see some savings.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>PE: How will US drug price negotiations impact global market dynamics?</em><br/><strong>Soliman:</strong> In the US, it’s going to put more scrutiny on how we price drugs, how the pricing models are developed, and how we determine if they’re fair. Today, in the United States, FDA doesn’t look at cost effectiveness as criteria. In Europe, they do. We may move towards more of an emphasis on looking at how we’re going to price drugs before we bring them to the market and commercialize them.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Pricing in comparison to other countries wasn’t something that people talked about in the media until the Trump administration brought it up. A lot of people knew it, and people would get their drugs from Canada or something like that. It wasn’t something that any administration had thought about in any formal way.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">From that perspective, the MFN executive order is a great idea, but the devil is in the details, such as which drugs are required to be in there.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>Pharmaceutical Executive: How is the pharma industry already reacting to the administration's efforts?</em><br/><strong>Soliman:</strong> We’ve seen a lot of pharma companies saying that they want to comply and work with the administration. Some have already committed to manufacture domestically. Long term, this could be good for the country. I agree with the administration that relying on foreign countries could be a national security threat.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">There’s been a lot of data published about some of the quality and safety concerns coming out of some of the plants in China. FDA has had a hard time auditing those plants. It’s a good thing for pharma companies to manufacture here long term. Will there potentially be an increase in cost? There could be.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">How much will get passed down to the patient? That remains to be seen. Overall, it’s a net positive because it means we don’t have as much reliance on these other countries.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">We know that generic drugs are often manufactured outside of the US and we often see that these drugs, unfortunately, can be compromised. There’s been a lot of issues.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>PE: How are the drug pricing negotiations impacting pharma's relationship with DC?</em><br/><strong>Soliman:</strong> Since the IRA, there’s been strain between DC and the pharma industry. During the Biden administration, his administration attempted to put a price cap on insulin and there was a lot of push back. A lot of the pharma companies left the trade organization PHARMA. Some went to the courts to fight.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">There’s some strain, and I think it is unfair to the pharma industry to put these kinds of limits and caps on what they’re doing. Making the pharma industry cap out costs could stifle innovation. The pharma industry has helped to cure major diseases, like polio. HIV used to be a death sentence, and now people can be kept alive.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>PE: How are other players in the healthcare industry reacting to drug pricing negotiations?</em><br/><strong>Soliman:</strong> The insurance companies and PBMs, they make money on rebates. The rebates are based on the drug’s price, and the higher the price, the higher the rebate. If the drug price is lower, they’ll make lower profit. For PBMS, they’re probably not that happy about it. We saw this a few years ago during Senate hearings. The Merck CEO talked about how PBMs were driving up costs and the system was set up in a way that made it difficult to keep prices lower.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">That’s something that must be explored.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>PE: How are updates to FDA's processes impacting medical affairs teams?</em><br/><strong>Soliman:</strong> One of the things with the Trump administration, is that by FDA speeding up approvals with priority vouchers, this is going to speed up launch times. Today, if you’re a field medical affairs organization, making sure that your team has the broad skill sets to deal with policy changes that are happening across the country is important. Medical affairs, more so than salespeople, are the major face in front of doctors.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">MSLs, on average, get about 40 minutes in front of a doctor, where a sales rep only gets about a minute.</p></div>",
