            "description": "<div class=\"w-full _blockContent_s7hzj_1\" id=\"block-content\"> <p class=\"\">Welcome to <em>Pharmaceutical Executive</em> Daily, your quick briefing on the top news shaping the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry.</p><p class=\"\">In today’s <em>Pharmaceutical Executive</em> Daily, we cover Novo Nordisk’s unsolicited proposal to acquire Metsera, renewed legal action against Tylenol’s manufacturer following statements from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and AbbVie’s stronger 2025 profit outlook driven by immunology demand.</p><p class=\"\">Novo Nordisk has submitted an unsolicited proposal to acquire Metsera, a privately held biotech focused on obesity and cardiometabolic disease. The offer follows Novo’s ongoing expansion strategy in the metabolic health space as it seeks to reinforce its dominance in GLP-1 and related therapeutic categories. While terms of the proposal were not disclosed, analysts say the move underscores Novo’s interest in integrating promising pipeline assets that complement its semaglutide portfolio. The approach also highlights intensifying competition with Eli Lilly, which has been actively building its own cardiometabolic pipeline through targeted acquisitions.</p><p class=\"\">In legal and public health news, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is facing renewed lawsuits alleging that acetaminophen use during pregnancy may be linked to autism and ADHD. The litigation follows public statements by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who claimed there is evidence supporting such a link—claims strongly refuted by the medical community and regulatory experts. Kenvue reiterated that extensive scientific reviews have found no causal connection between acetaminophen and neurodevelopmental disorders. Analysts warn that misinformation-driven litigation could have broader implications for consumer confidence and risk communication across the over-the-counter market.</p><p class=\"\">And in financial updates, AbbVie has raised its 2025 profit forecast, citing strong global demand for its immunology treatments, including Rinvoq and Skyrizi. The company reported higher-than-expected sales growth across both rheumatology and gastroenterology segments, offsetting continued erosion from Humira biosimilars. Executives said AbbVie’s diversified portfolio and sustained clinical expansion have positioned it for stable double-digit earnings growth through next year. Investors responded positively to the guidance revision, viewing it as a sign of resilience in AbbVie’s post-Humira strategy.</p><p class=\"\">Thanks for listening to <em>Pharmaceutical Executive</em> Daily.

Orforglipron could help health care providers expand treatment options for patients who prefer oral therapies without compromising clinical results.\"</p><p class=\"\">In the same press release, Lilly executive vice president and president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health Kenneth Custer, PhD, added, “The ATTAIN-2 results reinforce the potential for orforglipron, as a once-daily oral, to deliver meaningful weight loss and A1C reduction, consistent with similar landmark trials for injectable GLP-1s. With these positive data in hand, we are moving with urgency toward global regulatory submissions to potentially meet the needs of patients who are waiting.

In a statement issued at the time, Commissioner Makary explained, “Using a common-sense approach, the national priority review program will allow companies to submit the lion’s share of the drug application before a clinical trial is complete so that we can reduce inefficiencies. The ultimate goal is to bring more cures and meaningful treatments to the American public. As a surgical oncologist, we often made multidisciplinary decisions with a team of doctors on major life-and-death questions for patients, incorporating the latest medical studies in a 1-day tumor board-style discussion.

            "description": "<div class=\"w-full _blockContent_s7hzj_1\" id=\"block-content\"> <p class=\"\">As venture capital funding slows in traditional markets such as the United States and Europe, attention is turning eastward toward the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). At the Future Investment Initiative (FII) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, a high-level panel titled “<em>Is the GCC Becoming a New Strategic Anchor for the Global VC Ecosystem?</em>” explored how the region is evolving from capital provider to innovation powerhouse.</p><p class=\"\">Moderated by <em>CNBC</em> Arabia anchor Hussein Sayed, the discussion brought together some of the Gulf’s most influential venture and policy leaders: H.R.H. Prince Fahad bin Mansour AlSaud, president, Saudi G20 Startup20, G20YEA; chairman, Entrepreneurship Vision; Hussain Abdulla, partner at Golden Gate Ventures; Khaled AlKhattaf, CEO of the Saudi Investment Promotion Authority (SIPA); Dr. Bilal Baloch, partner at Shorooq Partners; and Noor Sweid, founder and managing partner of Global Ventures.</p><p class=\"\">The panel examined the forces reshaping the global flow of venture capital, from sovereign wealth participation and regulatory reform to family office evolution and the creation of new exit markets. Notably, Prince Fahad bin Mansour Al Saud said that Riyadh has emerged as “the capital of capital—where founders raise funds and global investors meet LPs.”</p><p class=\"\">Overall, the panel highlighted the Gulf’s development into one of the world’s dynamic innovation ecosystems worldwide.</p><h2 class=\"pb-4 pt-2 text-2xl\"><strong>1. Riyadh is redefining the starting point for global fundraising</strong></h2><p class=\"\">Panelists described Riyadh as “the capital of capital,” with founders and funds alike now beginning their fundraising journeys in the Gulf rather than in Menlo Park or London. The FII conference itself has become a magnet for investors from every continent, reflecting the GCC’s transition from a passive capital source to an active global investment origin.</p><p class=\"\">The region’s sovereign wealth funds—flush with liquidity from energy revenues—are now central conveners of venture deal flow.</p><h2 class=\"pb-4 pt-2 text-2xl\"><strong>2. Sovereign wealth and infrastructure have built the foundation for venture growth</strong></h2><p class=\"\">Speakers emphasized that the Gulf’s massive infrastructure and industrial investments over the past decade have created fertile ground for a modern innovation economy. Governments are layering digital and AI-driven strategies onto established energy, logistics, and transportation platforms, using venture capital to accelerate diversification.</p><p class=\"\">Public investment funds are not merely allocating money, they are architecting entire ecosystems designed to sustain innovation over decades.</p><h2 class=\"pb-4 pt-2 text-2xl\"><strong>3. Family offices are evolving into institutional-grade venture investors</strong></h2><p class=\"\">The Gulf’s long-standing merchant culture is re-emerging in a new form. Family-owned conglomerates that once focused on trade and real estate are now allocating capital to venture vehicles, leveraging their appetite for risk and local market insight.</p><p class=\"\">This generational shift from family-run enterprises to family-backed VCs is embedding entrepreneurship deeper into national economies and aligning private wealth with government diversification goals.</p><h2 class=\"pb-4 pt-2 text-2xl\"><strong>4. The next challenge: value creation and viable exits</strong></h2><p class=\"\">While capital is abundant, speakers cautioned that investment alone is insufficient. The region must focus on building companies with sustainable value and governance practices that meet global standards.</p><p class=\"\">Exit pathways remain the biggest gap: IPO liquidity is limited, and most successful exits today occur through mergers and acquisitions rather than public listings. Regulators across the GCC are responding with new capital-market frameworks, but panelists agreed that more regional investment banks, research houses, and advisory firms are needed to mature the exit environment.</p><h2 class=\"pb-4 pt-2 text-2xl\"><strong>5. The GCC’s venture model may leapfrog the traditional playbook</strong></h2><p class=\"\">Rather than replicating Silicon Valley’s high-risk, high-burn approach, Gulf investors are crafting a model that prizes sustainability, profitability, and long-term value creation. Discussions explored how tokenization and digital asset platforms could provide alternative liquidity routes for later-stage startups, allowing the region to leapfrog legacy equity-market structures.</p><p class=\"\">With sovereign vision strategies such as Saudi Vision 2030 driving coordinated entrepreneurship policy, the GCC is building not just companies but new financial architectures.</p><h2 class=\"pb-4 pt-2 text-2xl\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p class=\"\">With U.S. venture funding down more than 50% from its 2021 peak, the Gulf Cooperation Council is stepping into the global funding vacuum with patient capital, regulatory reform, and a strategic vision for innovation. Whether this momentum cements Riyadh, Dubai, and Doha as enduring anchors for global venture capital will depend on how effectively the region can translate abundant capital into scalable, sustainable value creation and credible exit markets.</p> </div>",

Clario is a leading provider of clinical trial technology and data solutions, specializing in imaging, cardiac safety, and eCOA platforms. The acquisition will expand Thermo Fisher’s digital clinical ecosystem and strengthen its position in end-to-end research services. Executives said the deal reflects growing demand for integrated trial data platforms capable of improving speed, compliance, and data quality across global studies. Analysts see the move as a strong signal that digital enablement and clinical technology remain core growth priorities for Thermo Fisher’s services division.</p><p class=\"\">In commercial innovation, Eli Lilly is partnering with Walmart Pharmacy to offer the first retail pickup option for its direct-to-consumer Zepbound program. The collaboration allows patients to order the GLP-1 therapy online through LillyDirect and retrieve prescriptions directly at Walmart locations nationwide. The initiative aims to improve access and convenience amid growing demand for obesity medications and ongoing supply constraints. Analysts say the partnership represents a new model for pharma-retail collaboration—blending digital prescription management with traditional pharmacy fulfillment to streamline the patient experience.</p><p class=\"\">And in regulatory updates, the FDA has released new draft guidance for biosimilar development, emphasizing the reduction of redundant clinical testing. The document encourages the use of advanced analytical data and real-world evidence to support biosimilarity claims, a move expected to accelerate approvals and lower costs for developers. Agency officials said the updated approach aligns with broader efforts to expand biosimilar competition and increase patient access to affordable biologics. Industry stakeholders welcomed the guidance, calling it a pragmatic step toward modernizing the evidentiary standards for biosimilar approval.</p><p class=\"\">Thanks for listening to <em>Pharmaceutical Executive</em> Daily.

Earlier this year,  that Tylenol, when taken by pregnant women, could increase the risk of autism.</p><h1 class=\"pb-4 pt-2 text-3xl\">Who is suing Tylenol's maker?</h1><p class=\"\">Since then, experts have weighed in and pushed back against the President’s claims. Meanwhile, foreign health agencies have refused to adjust their policies around recommending Tylenol to pregnant women.</p><p class=\"\">This week, two major events occurred.</p><p class=\"\">First, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit against Johnson &amp; Johnson and Kenvue.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup> According to his claims, both companies participated in deceptive marketing by not disclosing links to autism.</p><p class=\"\">Kenvue is the current manufacturer of Tylenol. The company was previously part of Johnson &amp; Johnson, which is why the larger pharmaceutical company is also named in the lawsuit.</p><p class=\"\">In a press release, Paxton stated, ““Big Pharma betrayed America by profiting off of pain and pushing pills regardless of the risks. These corporations lied for decades, knowingly endangering millions to line their pockets. Additionally, seeing that the day of reckoning was coming, Johnson &amp; Johnson attempted to escape responsibility by illegally offloading their liability onto a different company. By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again.”</p><p class=\"\">Paxton is also arguing that Johnson &amp; Johnson violated Texas’ Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act by transferring liabilities related to Tylenol to Kenvue to “shield their assets.”</p><p class=\"\">The Texas AG’s statement directly references the White House’s statement on Tylenol and its potential link to autism.</p><p class=\"\">However, later in the week, HHS Secretary Kennedy made public comments that seemed to take a less aggressive approach to the topic.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">2</sup></p><p class=\"\">During a press briefing to announce FDA’s new draft guidance for biosimilars, Kennedy took a question from a reporter regarding Tylenol. During his answer, Kennedy stated that there is not sufficient evidence to say that Tylenol causes autism.</p><p class=\"\">He continued to say that his view was that people simply should be cautious.</p><p class=\"\">These statements appear to conflict with Texas’ lawsuit against Kenvue and J&amp;J. It is unclear what, if any, impact Secretary Kennedy’s comments will have on the lawsuit.</p><p class=\"\">This latest chapter in the ongoing story likely won’t be the last. Since President Trump first made his comments, Kenvue has been actively working to fight the allegations. The company’s stock has dropped since rumors of the announcement first began to circulate, and the stock took a more significant plunge after the President’s comments.</p><p class=\"\">Kenvue issued the following statement after the President first made his comments, “Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy. Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives. High fevers and pain are widely recognized as potential risks to a pregnancy if left untreated.”</p><p class=\"\">At the time, FDA Commissioner Makary said in a statement, “The FDA is taking action to make parents and doctors aware of a considerable body of evidence about potential risks associated with acetaminophen. Even with this body of evidence, the choice still belongs with parents. The precautionary principle may lead many to avoid using acetaminophen during pregnancy, especially since most low-grade fevers don’t require treatment. It remains reasonable, however, for pregnant women to use acetaminophen in certain scenarios.”</p><p class=\"\"></p><h2 class=\"pb-4 pt-2 text-2xl\">Sources</h2><ol class=\"my-2\"><li class=\"ml-8 list-decimal\">Attor­ney Gen­er­al Pax­ton Sues Big Phar­ma Man­u­fac­tur­ers for Decep­tive­ly Mar­ket­ing Tylenol to Preg­nant Moth­ers Despite Known Dan­gers to Unborn Children. <em>Attorney General of Texas</em>.

Until now, we lacked options to help prevent a devastating recurrence and immunotherapy was only available for patients with advanced CSCC who were no longer candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation,” said Vishal A. Patel, M.D., associate professor of dermatology and of medicine (hematology/oncology) at the George Washington University School of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences and director of the Cutaneous Oncology Program at the GW Cancer Center. “Many patients who undergo surgical resection of their CSCC are later found, on full pathological evaluation, to be at high risk of recurrence. As the first and only immunotherapy approved in the adjuvant setting, Libtayo represents a practice-changing opportunity for this patient population, backed by compelling data showcasing its ability to significantly improve disease-free survival.”</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><h1 class=\"text-3xl pb-4 pt-2\">What is FDA’s approval based on?</h1><p class=\"pb-2\">Libtayo’s approval from FDA is based on data collected from the Phase III C-Post trial, which investigated adjuvant Libtayo compared to placebo in patients diagnosed with CSCC who are at high risk of recurrence after surgery and radiation.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1 </sup>Results from the study, showed Libtayo’s 68% reduction in risk of disease recurrence or death, compared to patients administered with placebo who have CSCC, and are at high risk of recurrence after surgery and radiation.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup></p><p class=\"pb-2\">Libtayo’s safety profile is consistent with the known safety profile for Libtayo monotherapy in advanced cancers, with the most common adverse reactions of a single agent in adjuvant CSCC at high risk of recurrence were rash, pruritus, and hypothyroidism.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup> Serious adverse reactions were reported in 18% of patients, including pneumonia 1.5%, rash 1.5%, diarrhea 1.5%, adrenal insufficiency 1%, and arrhythmia 1%, in the arm administered with the Libtayo treatment.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">“This approval provides patients with CSCC at high risk of disease recurrence following surgery and radiation a much-needed option, as Libtayo is the only immunotherapy to demonstrate efficacy in this setting,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., board co-chair, president and chief scientific officer of Regeneron. “Now with five FDA-approved indications, Libtayo is firmly established as a strong and versatile PD-1 inhibitor option for patients with a variety of cancers.”</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><h1 class=\"text-3xl pb-4 pt-2\">What is the impact of Libtayo’s approval?</h1><p class=\"pb-2\">“CSCC is one of the most common skin cancers in the world, with an estimated 1.8 million cases diagnosed each year in the U.S. alone. While it can often be treated successfully with surgery and radiation, many patients face serious risk of advanced disease recurrences,” said Samantha R. Guild, president, AIM at Skin Cancer Foundation. “This approval is wonderful news for people living with CSCC, and we commend Regeneron for its long-standing commitment to addressing needs in non-melanoma skin cancer through its pioneering research.”</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><h1 class=\"text-3xl pb-4 pt-2\">Sources</h1><ol class=\"my-2\"><li class=\"list-decimal ml-8\">Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc) Approved in the U.S. as First and Only Immunotherapy for Adjuvant Treatment of Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CSCC) with a High Risk of Recurrence After Surgery and Radiation <em>Regeneron Pharmaceuticals </em>October 8, 2025 <a href=\"https://investor.regeneron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/libtayor-cemiplimab-rwlc-approved-us-first-and-only\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://investor.regeneron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/libtayor-cemiplimab-rwlc-approved-us-first-and-only</a></li></ol><p class=\"pb-2\"></p></div>",
