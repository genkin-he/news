            "description": "<div class=\"w-full _blockContent_s7hzj_1\" id=\"block-content\"> <p class=\"\">As venture capital funding slows in traditional markets such as the United States and Europe, attention is turning eastward toward the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). At the Future Investment Initiative (FII) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, a high-level panel titled “<em>Is the GCC Becoming a New Strategic Anchor for the Global VC Ecosystem?</em>” explored how the region is evolving from capital provider to innovation powerhouse.</p><p class=\"\">Moderated by <em>CNBC</em> Arabia anchor Hussein Sayed, the discussion brought together some of the Gulf’s most influential venture and policy leaders: H.R.H. Prince Fahad bin Mansour AlSaud, president, Saudi G20 Startup20, G20YEA; chairman, Entrepreneurship Vision; Hussain Abdulla, partner at Golden Gate Ventures; Khaled AlKhattaf, CEO of the Saudi Investment Promotion Authority (SIPA); Dr. Bilal Baloch, partner at Shorooq Partners; and Noor Sweid, founder and managing partner of Global Ventures.</p><p class=\"\">The panel examined the forces reshaping the global flow of venture capital, from sovereign wealth participation and regulatory reform to family office evolution and the creation of new exit markets. Notably, Prince Fahad bin Mansour Al Saud said that Riyadh has emerged as “the capital of capital—where founders raise funds and global investors meet LPs.”</p><p class=\"\">Overall, the panel highlighted the Gulf’s development into one of the world’s dynamic innovation ecosystems worldwide.</p><h2 class=\"pb-4 pt-2 text-2xl\"><strong>1. Riyadh is redefining the starting point for global fundraising</strong></h2><p class=\"\">Panelists described Riyadh as “the capital of capital,” with founders and funds alike now beginning their fundraising journeys in the Gulf rather than in Menlo Park or London. The FII conference itself has become a magnet for investors from every continent, reflecting the GCC’s transition from a passive capital source to an active global investment origin.</p><p class=\"\">The region’s sovereign wealth funds—flush with liquidity from energy revenues—are now central conveners of venture deal flow.</p><h2 class=\"pb-4 pt-2 text-2xl\"><strong>2. Sovereign wealth and infrastructure have built the foundation for venture growth</strong></h2><p class=\"\">Speakers emphasized that the Gulf’s massive infrastructure and industrial investments over the past decade have created fertile ground for a modern innovation economy. Governments are layering digital and AI-driven strategies onto established energy, logistics, and transportation platforms, using venture capital to accelerate diversification.</p><p class=\"\">Public investment funds are not merely allocating money, they are architecting entire ecosystems designed to sustain innovation over decades.</p><h2 class=\"pb-4 pt-2 text-2xl\"><strong>3. Family offices are evolving into institutional-grade venture investors</strong></h2><p class=\"\">The Gulf’s long-standing merchant culture is re-emerging in a new form. Family-owned conglomerates that once focused on trade and real estate are now allocating capital to venture vehicles, leveraging their appetite for risk and local market insight.</p><p class=\"\">This generational shift from family-run enterprises to family-backed VCs is embedding entrepreneurship deeper into national economies and aligning private wealth with government diversification goals.</p><h2 class=\"pb-4 pt-2 text-2xl\"><strong>4. The next challenge: value creation and viable exits</strong></h2><p class=\"\">While capital is abundant, speakers cautioned that investment alone is insufficient. The region must focus on building companies with sustainable value and governance practices that meet global standards.</p><p class=\"\">Exit pathways remain the biggest gap: IPO liquidity is limited, and most successful exits today occur through mergers and acquisitions rather than public listings. Regulators across the GCC are responding with new capital-market frameworks, but panelists agreed that more regional investment banks, research houses, and advisory firms are needed to mature the exit environment.</p><h2 class=\"pb-4 pt-2 text-2xl\"><strong>5. The GCC’s venture model may leapfrog the traditional playbook</strong></h2><p class=\"\">Rather than replicating Silicon Valley’s high-risk, high-burn approach, Gulf investors are crafting a model that prizes sustainability, profitability, and long-term value creation. Discussions explored how tokenization and digital asset platforms could provide alternative liquidity routes for later-stage startups, allowing the region to leapfrog legacy equity-market structures.</p><p class=\"\">With sovereign vision strategies such as Saudi Vision 2030 driving coordinated entrepreneurship policy, the GCC is building not just companies but new financial architectures.</p><h2 class=\"pb-4 pt-2 text-2xl\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p class=\"\">With U.S. venture funding down more than 50% from its 2021 peak, the Gulf Cooperation Council is stepping into the global funding vacuum with patient capital, regulatory reform, and a strategic vision for innovation. Whether this momentum cements Riyadh, Dubai, and Doha as enduring anchors for global venture capital will depend on how effectively the region can translate abundant capital into scalable, sustainable value creation and credible exit markets.</p> </div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"w-full _blockContent_s7hzj_1\" id=\"block-content\"> <p class=\"\">Welcome to <em>Pharmaceutical Executive</em> Daily, your quick briefing on the top news shaping the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry.</p><p class=\"\">In today’s <em>Pharmaceutical Executive</em> Daily, we cover Thermo Fisher’s $8 billion agreement to acquire Clario Holdings, Eli Lilly’s partnership with Walmart to launch retail pickup for its direct-to-consumer Zepbound program, and the FDA’s new draft guidance aimed at streamlining biosimilar development.</p><p class=\"\">Thermo Fisher Scientific has announced a definitive agreement to acquire Clario Holdings for $8 billion, marking one of the year’s largest life sciences transactions. Clario is a leading provider of clinical trial technology and data solutions, specializing in imaging, cardiac safety, and eCOA platforms. The acquisition will expand Thermo Fisher’s digital clinical ecosystem and strengthen its position in end-to-end research services. Executives said the deal reflects growing demand for integrated trial data platforms capable of improving speed, compliance, and data quality across global studies. Analysts see the move as a strong signal that digital enablement and clinical technology remain core growth priorities for Thermo Fisher’s services division.</p><p class=\"\">In commercial innovation, Eli Lilly is partnering with Walmart Pharmacy to offer the first retail pickup option for its direct-to-consumer Zepbound program. The collaboration allows patients to order the GLP-1 therapy online through LillyDirect and retrieve prescriptions directly at Walmart locations nationwide. The initiative aims to improve access and convenience amid growing demand for obesity medications and ongoing supply constraints. Analysts say the partnership represents a new model for pharma-retail collaboration—blending digital prescription management with traditional pharmacy fulfillment to streamline the patient experience.</p><p class=\"\">And in regulatory updates, the FDA has released new draft guidance for biosimilar development, emphasizing the reduction of redundant clinical testing. The document encourages the use of advanced analytical data and real-world evidence to support biosimilarity claims, a move expected to accelerate approvals and lower costs for developers. Agency officials said the updated approach aligns with broader efforts to expand biosimilar competition and increase patient access to affordable biologics. Industry stakeholders welcomed the guidance, calling it a pragmatic step toward modernizing the evidentiary standards for biosimilar approval.</p><p class=\"\">Thanks for listening to <em>Pharmaceutical Executive</em> Daily.

            "description": "<div class=\"w-full _blockContent_s7hzj_1\" id=\"block-content\"> <p class=\"\">Tylenol’s maker is facing a new lawsuit despite an admission from the government that there isn’t sufficient proof that the medication causes autism.</p><p class=\"\">One of the most unexpected stories of the year continues to play out in a chaotic way. Earlier this year,  that Tylenol, when taken by pregnant women, could increase the risk of autism.</p><h1 class=\"pb-4 pt-2 text-3xl\">Who is suing Tylenol's maker?</h1><p class=\"\">Since then, experts have weighed in and pushed back against the President’s claims. Meanwhile, foreign health agencies have refused to adjust their policies around recommending Tylenol to pregnant women.</p><p class=\"\">This week, two major events occurred.</p><p class=\"\">First, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit against Johnson &amp; Johnson and Kenvue.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup> According to his claims, both companies participated in deceptive marketing by not disclosing links to autism.</p><p class=\"\">Kenvue is the current manufacturer of Tylenol. The company was previously part of Johnson &amp; Johnson, which is why the larger pharmaceutical company is also named in the lawsuit.</p><p class=\"\">In a press release, Paxton stated, ““Big Pharma betrayed America by profiting off of pain and pushing pills regardless of the risks. These corporations lied for decades, knowingly endangering millions to line their pockets. Additionally, seeing that the day of reckoning was coming, Johnson &amp; Johnson attempted to escape responsibility by illegally offloading their liability onto a different company. By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again.”</p><p class=\"\">Paxton is also arguing that Johnson &amp; Johnson violated Texas’ Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act by transferring liabilities related to Tylenol to Kenvue to “shield their assets.”</p><p class=\"\">The Texas AG’s statement directly references the White House’s statement on Tylenol and its potential link to autism.</p><p class=\"\">However, later in the week, HHS Secretary Kennedy made public comments that seemed to take a less aggressive approach to the topic.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">2</sup></p><p class=\"\">During a press briefing to announce FDA’s new draft guidance for biosimilars, Kennedy took a question from a reporter regarding Tylenol. During his answer, Kennedy stated that there is not sufficient evidence to say that Tylenol causes autism.</p><p class=\"\">He continued to say that his view was that people simply should be cautious.</p><p class=\"\">These statements appear to conflict with Texas’ lawsuit against Kenvue and J&amp;J. It is unclear what, if any, impact Secretary Kennedy’s comments will have on the lawsuit.</p><p class=\"\">This latest chapter in the ongoing story likely won’t be the last. Since President Trump first made his comments, Kenvue has been actively working to fight the allegations. The company’s stock has dropped since rumors of the announcement first began to circulate, and the stock took a more significant plunge after the President’s comments.</p><p class=\"\">Kenvue issued the following statement after the President first made his comments, “Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy. Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives. High fevers and pain are widely recognized as potential risks to a pregnancy if left untreated.”</p><p class=\"\">At the time, FDA Commissioner Makary said in a statement, “The FDA is taking action to make parents and doctors aware of a considerable body of evidence about potential risks associated with acetaminophen. Even with this body of evidence, the choice still belongs with parents. The precautionary principle may lead many to avoid using acetaminophen during pregnancy, especially since most low-grade fevers don’t require treatment. It remains reasonable, however, for pregnant women to use acetaminophen in certain scenarios.”</p><p class=\"\"></p><h2 class=\"pb-4 pt-2 text-2xl\">Sources</h2><ol class=\"my-2\"><li class=\"ml-8 list-decimal\">Attor­ney Gen­er­al Pax­ton Sues Big Phar­ma Man­u­fac­tur­ers for Decep­tive­ly Mar­ket­ing Tylenol to Preg­nant Moth­ers Despite Known Dan­gers to Unborn Children. <em>Attorney General of Texas</em>.

Until now, we lacked options to help prevent a devastating recurrence and immunotherapy was only available for patients with advanced CSCC who were no longer candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation,” said Vishal A. Patel, M.D., associate professor of dermatology and of medicine (hematology/oncology) at the George Washington University School of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences and director of the Cutaneous Oncology Program at the GW Cancer Center. “Many patients who undergo surgical resection of their CSCC are later found, on full pathological evaluation, to be at high risk of recurrence. As the first and only immunotherapy approved in the adjuvant setting, Libtayo represents a practice-changing opportunity for this patient population, backed by compelling data showcasing its ability to significantly improve disease-free survival.”</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><h1 class=\"text-3xl pb-4 pt-2\">What is FDA’s approval based on?</h1><p class=\"pb-2\">Libtayo’s approval from FDA is based on data collected from the Phase III C-Post trial, which investigated adjuvant Libtayo compared to placebo in patients diagnosed with CSCC who are at high risk of recurrence after surgery and radiation.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1 </sup>Results from the study, showed Libtayo’s 68% reduction in risk of disease recurrence or death, compared to patients administered with placebo who have CSCC, and are at high risk of recurrence after surgery and radiation.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup></p><p class=\"pb-2\">Libtayo’s safety profile is consistent with the known safety profile for Libtayo monotherapy in advanced cancers, with the most common adverse reactions of a single agent in adjuvant CSCC at high risk of recurrence were rash, pruritus, and hypothyroidism.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup> Serious adverse reactions were reported in 18% of patients, including pneumonia 1.5%, rash 1.5%, diarrhea 1.5%, adrenal insufficiency 1%, and arrhythmia 1%, in the arm administered with the Libtayo treatment.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">“This approval provides patients with CSCC at high risk of disease recurrence following surgery and radiation a much-needed option, as Libtayo is the only immunotherapy to demonstrate efficacy in this setting,” said George D.

The experimental drug for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes is currently in Phase III clinical trials.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Ray uses the push and pull factors of MariTide to focus on the general decision-making processes around moving compounds forward in a commercial big pharma setting.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">MariTide is a bispecific antibody-peptide conjugate that acts on two hormone receptors simultaneously. As a GLP-1 receptor agonist, MariTide activates the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor, which promotes insulin release and suppresses appetite.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Also, simultaneously, as a GIP receptor antagonist, it blocks the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor, which may reduce fat storage.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">This dual mechanism provides a different approach compared to existing GLP-1 drugs, like Wegovy and Zepbound, which are GLP-1 receptor agonists but may also be GIP receptor agonists.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Raymond J.

EFX is the only treatment to show significant fibrosis regression in compensated cirrhosis patients in a phase II trial.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">EFX holds the potential to address the complex, multi-system disease state of all stages of MASH, while also improving risk factors linked to cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death among patients diagnosed with MASH.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup> Additionally, EFX is designed for subcutaneous dosing once a week, along with being engineered to mirror the biological activity profile of native FGF21.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup></p><p class=\"pb-2\">“Efruxifermin complements Novo Nordisk’s leading portfolio and is aligned with our commitment to building a competitive portfolio of treatment options across the stages of MASH.

And the key word with ultra-sensitivity is the ability to pick up diseases earlier. So, the challenges that presents itself is others mimic that same wording, right? But Simoa truly has that capability, and what's important is its ability to be accurate and highly sensitive in also undesirable matrices, right? And other platforms will claim to have that same capability, but the ability for Simoa to routinely and reliably provide absolute quantitation of biomarker levels is critical, right? And that's been proven through case study after case study with our platform, the measures across cohorts remain consistent, independent of users or study sites, so they others will claim Ultra sensitivity, but truly, Simoa has that capacity and has the reliability and performance that's been unmatched, and that has been shown over and over throughout clinic, different case studies.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>PE: How is Quanterix approaching inclusivity and representation in the development and communication of biomarker-driven diagnostics?<br/></em><strong>Tetrault:</strong> Well, what's critical and important about biomarker diagnostics and with each trial that presents itself, is the ability to measure different cohorts independent of who performed the testing. Right? And so, when we bring up diversity in populations, populations inherently male, female, Hispanic, Black, Pacific Islander, white, everyone has a different measure in terms of their biomarker baselines, right? And it's understood that different biomarkers represent themselves differently in different cohorts. And it's important for some for these studies to be able to be performed with something that's ultra-sensitive and reliable, so independent of the population and independent of the person performing the study. It's critical that you understand that the data that's coming out is, in fact, accurate. So when we think about representation and applying the right metrics for the right populations, you want to be able to have reliable and consistent data, and that's truly what Simoa is able to provide.</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"blockText_blockContent__TbCXh\"><div class=\"relative\"><div autoplay=\"\" class=\"brightcove-fluid\"></div></div><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>Pharmaceutical Executive: How will pharma companies react to the administration's efforts?</em><br/><strong>Dr. William Soliman:</strong> We’ve seen Pfizer doing a deal with Trump, and I think other companies will follow. If they can come to a compromise for even just some branded drugs, that’s a happy middle-ground. What they’re looking for in exchange for dropping prices is for the administration to push back the tariffs. That’s part of the Pfizer deal.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">I do think it will make a difference and pharma companies will concede, even if not fully to what Trump wants. Even if it’s a little bit, that’s still better than nothing.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>PE: What is the timeline for American patients to notice the impact on drug pricing?</em><br/><strong>Soliman:</strong> If you remember, the provision is specific to patients that are under Medicare. Elderly patients will see more of an impact. For people on commercial plans, the impact remains to be seen. But if you’re under a federally-funded program, you might see more of an impact.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">In America, 80% of people on drugs are on generics. We talk a lot about pharma pricing, but the majority of people who are on multiple medications are on generics. For those drugs, you’re not going to see much of a difference. It’s mostly for the branded drugs where you’ll see some savings.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>PE: How will US drug price negotiations impact global market dynamics?</em><br/><strong>Soliman:</strong> In the US, it’s going to put more scrutiny on how we price drugs, how the pricing models are developed, and how we determine if they’re fair. Today, in the United States, FDA doesn’t look at cost effectiveness as criteria. In Europe, they do. We may move towards more of an emphasis on looking at how we’re going to price drugs before we bring them to the market and commercialize them.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Pricing in comparison to other countries wasn’t something that people talked about in the media until the Trump administration brought it up. A lot of people knew it, and people would get their drugs from Canada or something like that. It wasn’t something that any administration had thought about in any formal way.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">From that perspective, the MFN executive order is a great idea, but the devil is in the details, such as which drugs are required to be in there.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>Pharmaceutical Executive: How is the pharma industry already reacting to the administration's efforts?</em><br/><strong>Soliman:</strong> We’ve seen a lot of pharma companies saying that they want to comply and work with the administration. Some have already committed to manufacture domestically. Long term, this could be good for the country. I agree with the administration that relying on foreign countries could be a national security threat.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">There’s been a lot of data published about some of the quality and safety concerns coming out of some of the plants in China. FDA has had a hard time auditing those plants. It’s a good thing for pharma companies to manufacture here long term. Will there potentially be an increase in cost? There could be.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">How much will get passed down to the patient? That remains to be seen. Overall, it’s a net positive because it means we don’t have as much reliance on these other countries.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">We know that generic drugs are often manufactured outside of the US and we often see that these drugs, unfortunately, can be compromised. There’s been a lot of issues.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>PE: How are the drug pricing negotiations impacting pharma's relationship with DC?</em><br/><strong>Soliman:</strong> Since the IRA, there’s been strain between DC and the pharma industry. During the Biden administration, his administration attempted to put a price cap on insulin and there was a lot of push back. A lot of the pharma companies left the trade organization PHARMA. Some went to the courts to fight.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">There’s some strain, and I think it is unfair to the pharma industry to put these kinds of limits and caps on what they’re doing. Making the pharma industry cap out costs could stifle innovation. The pharma industry has helped to cure major diseases, like polio. HIV used to be a death sentence, and now people can be kept alive.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>PE: How are other players in the healthcare industry reacting to drug pricing negotiations?</em><br/><strong>Soliman:</strong> The insurance companies and PBMs, they make money on rebates. The rebates are based on the drug’s price, and the higher the price, the higher the rebate. If the drug price is lower, they’ll make lower profit. For PBMS, they’re probably not that happy about it. We saw this a few years ago during Senate hearings. The Merck CEO talked about how PBMs were driving up costs and the system was set up in a way that made it difficult to keep prices lower.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">That’s something that must be explored.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>PE: How are updates to FDA's processes impacting medical affairs teams?</em><br/><strong>Soliman:</strong> One of the things with the Trump administration, is that by FDA speeding up approvals with priority vouchers, this is going to speed up launch times. Today, if you’re a field medical affairs organization, making sure that your team has the broad skill sets to deal with policy changes that are happening across the country is important. Medical affairs, more so than salespeople, are the major face in front of doctors.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">MSLs, on average, get about 40 minutes in front of a doctor, where a sales rep only gets about a minute.</p></div>",
