On the other hand, industries like retail goods, energy, and semiconductors have lower labor-cost shares and are less exposed to AI impact. This trend highlights a widening performance gap between asset-heavy, goods-producing sectors and asset-light, service-oriented industries. While AI can boost productivity, it also poses challenges such as margin compression and labor displacement.",
