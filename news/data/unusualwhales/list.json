            "description": "On Friday, October 31, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) will report its third-quarter earnings before the market opens. Analysts predict earnings of $1.82 per share, a decrease from $1.92 per share in the same period last year. Revenue for the quarter is estimated at $87.71 billion, lower than the $90.02 billion reported a year ago. The company, based in Spring, Texas, saw its stock close at $114.69 on Thursday, dropping by 1.5%. Exxon Mobil's recent stock performance was bolstered by a rally in the sector following U.S. sanctions on Russian oil producers, leading to an increase in crude prices, ultimately benefiting the company's profitability.
