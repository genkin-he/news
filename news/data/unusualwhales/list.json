Munster pointed out in a blog post that while revenue growth used to be the main driver, investors are now more concerned about the growth prospects for 2027. Analysts project a 31% growth in 2027, higher than previous estimates, leading to a debate on whether these figures are too conservative or too uncertain for investors to consider presently. Data center sales, which make up nearly 90% of revenue, are mainly driven by hyperscalers accounting for half of the business.
