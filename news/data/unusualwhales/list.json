            "description": "Investors are shifting focus in the U.S. market towards industries with lower exposure to AI-driven labor automation over the past six months. Goldman Sachs' analysis shows that sectors like software, communication, and professional services are more vulnerable to AI disruption due to high labor costs as a percentage of total revenue. On the other hand, industries like retail goods, energy, and semiconductors have lower labor-cost shares and are less exposed to AI impact. This trend highlights a widening performance gap between asset-heavy, goods-producing sectors and asset-light, service-oriented industries. While AI can boost productivity, it also poses challenges such as margin compression and labor displacement.",
