            "description": "In January, the Producer Price Index (PPI) showed an unexpected increase, raising concerns about inflation and complicating the Federal Reserve's rate-cut plans. Monthly headline PPI rose by 0.5%, surpassing the 0.3% forecast and accelerating from December's 0.4%. Year-over-year figures showed a 2.9% increase, exceeding the 2.6% expectation. Core PPI, excluding food and energy, saw a significant 0.8% jump in January and reached a 3.6% yearly increase, outpacing forecasts. The surge was primarily driven by services, with final demand services rising by 0.8%, largely due to a 14.4% increase in margins for professional and commercial equipment wholesaling. Goods prices, however, fell by 0.3%. The article discusses these numbers further on Benzinga.com.",
