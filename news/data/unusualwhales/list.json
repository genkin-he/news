Canary Capital modified its S-1 filing for the XRP spot ETF by eliminating the \"delaying amendment,\" making the registration auto-effective, paving the way for a potential launch on Nov. 13. This adjustment led to a surge in buying activity as traders anticipated imminent approval and speculated on the future price movement after a period of subdued market activity. The ETF is seen as a key driver for institutional investments into XRP, potentially enhancing liquidity in its markets. Notably, on-chain data from Coinglass revealed early accumulation patterns in XRP, with $3.96 million in positive netflows.",

If the market value doubles to $55 trillion, Bitcoin could also double in value without a rise in dominance. Alternatively, if Bitcoin's market share increases from 9% to 18%, it has the potential to double in value once more. Hougan's detailed explanation can be found in a recent post on X.",

This move could potentially lead to a stock market surge similar to the late 90s tech boom, speculated by Ed Yardeni. Yardeni adjusted the chances of a \"Roaring 2020s\" bull market from 55% to 50%, while increasing the likelihood of a more fervent meltup from 25% to 30%. This change comes as a result of lower inflation than anticipated, continued economic resilience, and the Federal Reserve's commitment to easing monetary policies, even in the absence of significant macroeconomic pressures. Investors are optimistic about the return of the \"Fed Put,\" with the belief that the Fed will intervene to mitigate market downturns if necessary. The S&P 500, represented by the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: VOO), has seen an 18.6% increase over the past year and recently hit record highs following September's lower-than-expected Consumer Price Index report.

Adjusted net sales also saw a boost, rising to $4.66 billion from $4.38 billion in the previous year, slightly above the anticipated $4.64 billion. The adjusted gross profit margin experienced a slight decline to 38.6% from 39.2%, and the adjusted operating margin narrowed to 15.2% from 15.6% year-over-year. This dip in the operating margin was attributed to unfavorable gross margin in High-Touch Solutions â€“ N.A., partially offset by expense leverage in Endless Assortment. Additionally, W.W.
