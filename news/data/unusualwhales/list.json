            "description": "German carmakers Mercedes-Benz and Porsche AG are facing financial challenges due to tariffs, price wars, and slowing demand in key markets. In Q3, Mercedes' net profit decreased by 31% to €1.19 billion, while Porsche reported a net operating loss of €967 million, a sharp decline from a profit of €974 million a year earlier. Germany's auto industry output contracted by 18.5% in August. Mercedes' deliveries in China dropped by 27% to 125,133 units, and Porsche's deliveries fell by 26% to 32,195 units in the third quarter. German carmakers are struggling to maintain sales in Europe, North America, and China, with quarterly GDP stagnating in Q3. Analysts had expected Porsche to report a loss of €611 million. German automakers are losing their competitive edge in key markets, as Chinese demand for European cars has plummeted due to US protectionism and high energy costs in Europe. ByD, a Chinese car brand, has doubled its market share in Europe.",
