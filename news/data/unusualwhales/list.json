The company's shares have dropped by 75% since the start of the year despite strong growth in smart products. Chen Silong, the founder, started the company in 2008 after previously working in industries like shoelace production and carabiners. The rise of China's pet economy, especially among millennials and GenZ, has driven demand for pet products. The company went public in 2017 and saw success in 2022 due to the pandemic's effect on pet adoption. However, recent declines in revenue and share prices have affected Dogness negatively. With the emergence of high-tech pet products, there is potential for the company's recovery as shown in its latest annual results.",

The growth is mainly driven by strong performances in major economies such as the United States, China, and India. However, concerns about trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties remain key risks to this optimistic outlook. In contrast, the Eurozone is projected to experience a more modest growth rate of around 1.5% amid ongoing challenges within the region. This disparity in growth rates among different regions highlights the uneven nature of the global economic recovery. Despite positive growth forecasts, experts warn that factors such as inflation rates, unemployment levels, and government policies could impact the overall economic stability in the near future.",
