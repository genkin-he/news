The chart gained attention following the introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022, showing a remarkable 70% surge in the S&P 500 alongside a significant 30% decrease in job openings. Journalist Derek Thompson, in a recent Substack post, referred to this graph as \"the scariest chart in the world,\" noting its complexity. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that job openings hit a peak of 11.5 million in March 2022, dropping to 7.18 million by August 2025. During the same period, the S&P 500 index climbed from around 3,840 to close to 6,700, marking a 74% increase. Thompson attributed this economic divide not to AI but to the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening measures as per reports from Fortune.
