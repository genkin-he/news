            "description": "According to a recent report from Chainalysis, ransomware attackers are finding it increasingly challenging to generate profits, partly due to regulatory crackdowns and a growing number of victims refusing to pay. These factors have resulted in a decline in ransom proceeds for the attackers. The report highlights the effort ransomware attackers are putting into their activities relative to the diminishing returns they are now experiencing. This indicates a shift in the ransomware landscape, with attackers facing more obstacles in their attempts to cash in on their malicious activities.",

As per OCC regulations, applicants must disclose all principal shareholders holding a minimum of a 10% direct or indirect interest in the proposed bank, with failure to comply leading to potential rejection. Senator Warren demanded access to the complete application to ensure that all necessary disclosures were included, along with Senator Tim Scott (R-South Carolina), who chairs the Banking Committee.
