The formation of this deal was aimed at securing a pardon for Zhao. Prior to the launch of World Liberty's dollar-pegged cryptocurrency, USD1, Binance allocated more than a dozen engineers to develop the underlying technology. Following this, Binance orchestrated a transaction where an Emirati state investor purchased a minority stake in Binance for $2 billion, with the payment made in USD1. This transaction significantly boosted World Liberty's market capitalization and expanded its operations. The detailed account can be accessed on Benzinga.com.",
