            "description": "The duration for reducing draining tunnels has been extended to three years. Among patients with at least one draining tunnel initially, 48.2% no longer had any after one year, and this percentage increased to 62.9% after three years. This sustained reduction indicates ongoing relief from symptoms related to these lesions. Additionally, for patients who had no draining tunnels initially, this count remained at zero for three years.",
