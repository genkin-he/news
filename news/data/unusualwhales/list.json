Dorsey attributed the decision to advancements in artificial intelligence models and efforts to streamline operations. The layoff, affecting nearly 40% of employees, was driven by the company's push toward functionalization. Dorsey explained that the company effectively operates as two separate entities, likely Square and Cash App, with independent corporate structures leading to duplication. By functionalizing the company, Block aims to operate as a more cohesive unit, recognizing common capabilities and foundations.
