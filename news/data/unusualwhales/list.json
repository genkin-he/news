The Fed recently lowered rates to 3.75%-4.00%, leading to market expectations of a third cut due to slowing growth. However, Powell's comments caused a reevaluation, with the probability of holding rates steady rising to 12%, up from 1%. The committee is divided on how to proceed, with some focused on upside inflation risks and others on labor market softness. The U.S. government shutdown is limiting key statistics, complicating the Fed's decision-making process.",
