As per the government’s fall economic statement, there is a proposed plan to decrease hospital funding by 10% in real terms over three years, reaching 2027-28. This decision has been motivated by the fact that the projected spending does not suffice to cover the annual cost inflation of six percent for hospitals, according to CUPE.

This figure surpassed the analyst consensus of $238.96 million, marking a notable 9.4% increase compared to the previous year. Despite revenue growth, the adjusted earnings per share (EPS) stood at 25 cents, falling short of the street's expectation of 34 cents. Consequently, the stock price experienced a decline post-announcement. The rise in revenues was attributed to heightened sales in single-wafer cleaning, Tahoe, and semi-critical cleaning equipment, as well as strong performance in advanced packaging (excluding ECP), services, and spares. Total shipments for the quarter amounted to $228 million, a decrease from $264 million year-over-year. Additionally, the adjusted gross margin saw a decline of 880 basis points, landing at 41.0%, below the projected range of 42%-48% detailed in ACM's long-term business model. As of December 31, 2025, the company held $1.13 billion in cash and equivalents. CEO Dr. David Wang helms ACM Research, overseeing these recent results. For the full report, visit Benzinga.com.",
