According to the document dated Sept. 30, Bankman-Fried highlighted that FTX and Alameda Research held $25 billion in assets and $16 billion in equity before facing a liquidity crisis in November 2022 due to $8 billion in withdrawal requests. He insisted that the company could have met creditor demands within weeks, if not for legal interference. Bankman-Fried accused FTX's bankruptcy team of misrepresenting the situation and unnecessary Chapter 11 filing, alleging they had enough assets to cover debts. The founder argued that legal actions had severely impacted the company's financial standing.",
