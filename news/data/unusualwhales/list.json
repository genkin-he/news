The company reported quarterly revenue of $17.60 billion, up 54% compared to the previous year, exceeding the expected $16.02 billion. This growth was fueled by a 62% increase in volume, partially offset by a 10% decline in realized prices. Adjusted earnings per share were reported at $7.02, a significant rise from $1.18 last year, beating the expected $5.70. Analysts at Goldman Sachs are optimistic about Eli Lilly's potential, especially with the upcoming launch of orforglipron in 2026, labeling it as a significant new product cycle in the biopharma sector. Asad Haider maintains a Buy rating and has increased the price target from $879.",
