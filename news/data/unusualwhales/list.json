The drug showed improvements in itch and hives as early as Week 1, sustained through Week 52, with positive impacts on quality of life and sleep observed. The positive opinion is backed by results from the REMIX-1 and REMIX-2 Phase III trials, showing a favorable safety profile with no liver safety concerns. The decision from the European Commission is expected in two months, aiming to address the unmet needs of CSU patients in Europe. Remibrutinib is a BTK inhibitor approved in the US and China under the name Rhapsido, with positive results also seen in chronic inducible urticaria. It is being studied for other immune-mediated conditions like hidradenitis suppurativa and food allergy. Novartis is working to make the medicine available globally to those who need it.",
