            "description": "Two federal judges issued orders on Friday demanding that President Donald Trump's administration restore funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) amidst the current government shutdown. Judges John J. McConnell in Rhode Island and Indira Talwani in Massachusetts instructed the use of emergency reserves to sustain the program, which serves approximately one in eight Americans. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) had planned to cease SNAP payments starting November 1, citing a lack of funding authority. SNAP costs around $8 billion per month and is a vital component of the nation's social safety net. The rulings coincided and were prompted by the USDA's decision. Judge McConnell oversaw one of the cases.",
