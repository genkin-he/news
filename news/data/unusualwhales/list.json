Senator Warren insisted on transparency during her interrogation of Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan Gould about whether all legal requirements were followed in the bank charter application submitted by World Liberty Financial, a company co-owned by President Donald Trump's children. As per OCC regulations, applicants must disclose all principal shareholders holding a minimum of a 10% direct or indirect interest in the proposed bank, with failure to comply leading to potential rejection. Senator Warren demanded access to the complete application to ensure that all necessary disclosures were included, along with Senator Tim Scott (R-South Carolina), who chairs the Banking Committee.
