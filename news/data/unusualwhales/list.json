Analyst insights revealed from various reports include Goldman Sachs' Gabriela Borges maintaining a Buy rating and reducing the price target to $216 from $246. Needham's Mike Cikos also upheld a Buy rating but lowered the price target from $280 to $200. Blair Abernethy of Rosenblatt Securities maintained a Buy rating with a $275 price target. According to Goldman Sachs, Snowflake exceeded product revenue expectations by 2% and surpassed EBIT margins by 350 basis points. Despite some concerns post-earnings, with worries about guidance conservatism, the company is seen as having the potential to exceed Street estimates through increased product revenue acceleration. Snowflake’s expansion of its monetizable surface across its AI Data Cloud is expected to contribute to this.For further details, the full story can be accessed on Benzinga.com.",
