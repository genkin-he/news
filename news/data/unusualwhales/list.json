Market analyst Ted Pillows pointed out that Bitcoin briefly dipped below $107,000 before recovering, but struggles to maintain levels above $110,000, indicating potential weakness. To initiate a broader recovery, a breakthrough above $112,000 is crucial, as failure to do so could result in a drop below $100,000. Analyst Lennaert Snyder emphasized that Bitcoin reached a low of $106,667 before bouncing back, and identified $111,300 as the next critical resistance level.
