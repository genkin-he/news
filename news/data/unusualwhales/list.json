            "description": "Shares of Figure Technology Solutions Inc (NASDAQ: FIGR) are experiencing a decline as the blockchain-native capital marketplace revealed its fourth-quarter financial results, showing a revenue beat but missing earnings per share estimates. The company reported quarterly earnings of 6 cents per share, falling short of the projected 8 cents. However, quarterly sales were strong at $159.913 million, surpassing the anticipated $151.379 million. Net revenue saw a significant 91% increase year-over-year, with adjusted net revenue rising by 106% compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. Despite this earnings miss, Figure Technology demonstrated robust operational performance, including notable growth in Consumer Loan Marketplace volume which reached $2.7 million. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods and Needham both reduced their price targets on FIGR shares. The stock is nearing critical lows amidst these developments.",
