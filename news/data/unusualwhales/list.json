Yardeni adjusted the chances of a \"Roaring 2020s\" bull market from 55% to 50%, while increasing the likelihood of a more fervent meltup from 25% to 30%. This change comes as a result of lower inflation than anticipated, continued economic resilience, and the Federal Reserve's commitment to easing monetary policies, even in the absence of significant macroeconomic pressures. Investors are optimistic about the return of the \"Fed Put,\" with the belief that the Fed will intervene to mitigate market downturns if necessary.
