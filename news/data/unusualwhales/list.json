The lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and 11 states alleged that Walmart had deceived its employees about their base pay, incentive pay, and potential tips. The allegations specifically focus on Walmart's Spark Delivery network, which has been operational since 2021. The Spark Program, launched in 2018, enables gig workers to carry out deliveries for Walmart as well as other companies like Home Depot Inc. and 1-800-Flowers.com Inc. The FTC also claimed that Walmart had provided false information to customers by stating that 100% of tips would directly benefit the drivers. Despite being aware of these issues, Walmart allegedly neglected to address them, leading to violations that were highlighted in the complaint.",
