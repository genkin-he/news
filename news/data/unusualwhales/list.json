This increase made it the most valuable privacy-focused cryptocurrency, surpassing Monero (XMR). The market capitalization of Zcash reached $6.2 billion, surpassing Monero and solidifying its position in the privacy coin sector. ZEC's price has risen by more than 45% in the last week and has recorded an increase of over 800% since early October. This growth is notable as the broader cryptocurrency market has been in a consolidation phase. Privacy coins like Zcash and Monero offer anonymity by obscuring sender, receiver, and transaction data, which Bitcoin (BTC) does not provide. With increasing regulatory scrutiny on blockchain transparency, investors are showing interest in tokens that maintain transaction privacy. The surge in Zcash's value was accelerated by predictions made by BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, who suggested that Zcash could potentially rally to $10,000, referring to it as a significant rotation play in the market. ZEC's price climbed from $272 in response to this prediction.",
