CEO, Brian Moynihan, and Moody's Analytics Chief Economist, Mark Zandi, warn that the U.S. economy is being significantly harmed by the ongoing government shutdown. Moynihan cautions that the impasse could lead to an economic \"malaise\" as essential government functions have been halted, impacting businesses. If the shutdown persists through the end of the year, Zandi believes a recession is \"more likely than not.\" Moynihan highlights the adverse effects on government employees and private sector businesses, with 250,000 to 300,000 of BofA's customers impacted by the situation. The original belief that the shutdown would have minimal impact is fading, and the uncertainty may cause consumers to reduce spending and employers to cut jobs.",
