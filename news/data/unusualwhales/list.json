            "description": "The Carbon Capture Materials Market is expected to grow from USD 66,904.7 million in 2025 to USD 99,098.5 million by 2030 at a CAGR of 8.2%. Industries like cement, steel, and chemicals aiming to decarbonize are driving the demand for carbon capture materials. CCS systems, like membranes and alkaline solvents, help in reducing CO2 emissions up to 90%. Stricter emission regulations in Europe and North America are prompting industries to adopt CCS, boosting the market for capture materials. Key players in the market include Ecolab, BASF, DOW, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Membranes are expected to dominate the material segment, and power generation leads in end-use industry segment. Major challenges include high energy requirements and costs for large-scale material regeneration. The study's full details are available on Benzinga.com.",
