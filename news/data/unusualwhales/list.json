Canaccord reduced its target from $247, but raised its 2026 EBITDA forecast to $618 million from $485 million. Despite being down 72% from its post-IPO high of $299, CRCL is up from its low of $49.90. Both firms argue that the price target cuts are due to risk-off sentiment, not fundamental issues. Needham compared Circle to Tesla, calling it \"paradigm-shifting\" like dominant AI companies, as its addressable market is the global money supply. Needham's $130 target implies 57% upside, while Canaccord's $160 target implies 93% upside. Stablecoins are seen as programmable digital dollars competing with traditional currencies.",
