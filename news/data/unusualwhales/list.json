The growth is mainly driven by strong performances in major economies such as the United States, China, and India. However, concerns about trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties remain key risks to this optimistic outlook. In contrast, the Eurozone is projected to experience a more modest growth rate of around 1.5% amid ongoing challenges within the region. This disparity in growth rates among different regions highlights the uneven nature of the global economic recovery. Despite positive growth forecasts, experts warn that factors such as inflation rates, unemployment levels, and government policies could impact the overall economic stability in the near future.",
