            "description": "An article from San Francisco reports on the ongoing largest intergenerational wealth transfer in history, with $124 trillion in U.S. household wealth expected to change hands by 2048. However, there is concern that much of this fortune may vanish into a digital black hole, as an estimated 11-18% of Bitcoin's total supply, worth tens of billions of dollars, is already permanently lost due to forgotten passwords and abandoned accounts. In the U.S. alone, nearly $5 billion annually in unclaimed assets from forgotten accounts and policies are returned by states. Globally, there are tens of billions sitting in \"lost\" financial accounts. This wealth loss is exacerbated by demographic changes, with digital assets spread across countries, lack of clear succession plans, and childless individuals. Ana Mineva, CEO at DGLegacy, warns that this invisible leakage crisis poses a threat to wealth transfer. The full story is available on Benzinga.com.",
