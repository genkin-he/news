S&P rates the company at BBB+, while Fitch and Moody’s rate one notch lower at BBB and Baa2 respectively. Q4 results for Digital Realty showed positive growth with Core FFO per share reaching $1.86, a 7.5% increase over Q4 2024, bringing the full-year figure to $7.39, a 10.1% increase. Revenue grew by 13.9% to approximately $1.63 billion, driven by demand in hyperscale and enterprise segments. Fee income also doubled from $64.9 million in 2024 to $137.2 million in 2025, following an oversubscribed closed-end fund that attracted $3.225 billion in commitments. The company's balance sheet maintained health with a net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA at 4.9x. In November, Digital Realty issued €1.4 billion of green Eurobonds and repaid €1.075 billion of senior notes in December. However, GAAP net income per share fell to $0.24 in Q4, with a $78.5 million impairment provision and elevated operating costs. Transaction and integration expenses totaled $36.1 million in the quarter. While S&P credits the company's capital diversification, increasing fee income, and leverage discipline, Fitch and Moody's take a more cautious stance due to the drop in net income and high AFFO payout ratio.",
