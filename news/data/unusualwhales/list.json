September's composite LMI reading of 57.4 was the lowest since March, showing cautious decision-making amid changes. Warehouse utilization rose to 65.3, while capacity balanced at 51.6, indicating a nearing supply-demand equilibrium. Although profitability pressures persisted, operators shifted focus to efficiency.
