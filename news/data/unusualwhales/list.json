This surge comes in the wake of a Q4 loss of $1.7 billion due to Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) writedowns. The $1.7 billion net loss for Q4 represents a significant drop from the $528.3 million net income reported a year earlier. A substantial decrease in the fair value of Bitcoin holdings by $1.5 billion negated any operating gains, coinciding with BTC's price drop from $114,068 at the end of Q3 to $87,498 by December 31. Revenue also took a hit in Q4, falling by 6% to $202.3 million from $214.4 million in Q4 2024, propelled by a 14% decline in the average price of Bitcoin mined during that period. Despite this, the full-year revenue experienced a notable 38% growth to $907.1 million. However, this positive full-year growth was overshadowed by the massive quarterly writedown. MARA currently holds 53,822 BTC with an estimated value of approximately $4.7 billion.",
