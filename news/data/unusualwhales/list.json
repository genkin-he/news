The Logistics Managers' Index dropped from 59.2 to 57.4, hinting at industry slowdown due to tariff uncertainty and reduced consumer demand. Warehousing prices slightly decreased but remained elevated annually, pressuring margins. September's composite LMI reading of 57.4 was the lowest since March, showing cautious decision-making amid changes. Warehouse utilization rose to 65.3, while capacity balanced at 51.6, indicating a nearing supply-demand equilibrium. Although profitability pressures persisted, operators shifted focus to efficiency. The latest data suggests a tapering off of the post-summer rebound as companies adjust inventories for a softer peak season. Tapering off can possibly be attributed to recalibration and preparation for changes in the industry.",
