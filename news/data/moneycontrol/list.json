The index not only held the 100-day EMA (24,750) as support but also closed slightly above the 10-day and 50-day EMAs, partly aided by the banking sector on October 3.</p><p>Going forward, if the index reclaims and sustains above the 24,900-25,000 zone (20-day EMA and the midline of the Bollinger Bands), a rally toward 25,200-25,250 could be possible. However, another bullish candle formation signals the continuation of a \"buy on dips\" strategy, with 24,600 acting as a strong support, experts said.</p><p>The Nifty 50 gained strength in the last hour of trading after a volatile and range-bound session since the opening tick. The index rose by 58 points to 24,894, forming a bullish candle on the daily charts, with a higher high-lower low structure on a day-to-day basis.</p><p class=\"lastPara\">The short- and medium-term moving averages remained flat, while the RSI inched further to the 49.29 zone, yet to show a positive crossover. The MACD is still in a bearish crossover, though the weak momentum in the histogram has faded further.</p><p>According to Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, the underlying short-term trend for Nifty remains positive. \"The next upside target to watch is around the 25,200 level by next week.

The 24,800 strike holds the maximum Put open interest, followed by the 24,700 and 24,600 strikes, with the maximum Put writing at the 24,900, 24,800, and 24,850 strikes.</p><p><strong>Bank Nifty</strong></p><p>The Bank Nifty appears to be approaching both the falling resistance trendline (55,650) and the September high (55,835), which could trigger the start of a higher high-higher low structure. The banking index rallied by 241 points to 55,589 and formed a bullish candle above all key moving averages on the daily charts, signaling strength in the index.</p><p>The ratio line in the Bank Nifty/Nifty ratio chart is rising and trading above all key moving averages, indicating that the Bank Nifty is significantly outperforming the Nifty index.</p><p>The RSI is inching toward the 60 mark (currently at 58.1), suggesting strengthening bullish momentum with room for further upside. The +DI has crossed over the -DI in the ADX indicator, confirming that buyers are in control. The MACD has turned positive with a fresh bullish crossover, supported by green histogram bars, pointing toward the continuation of the uptrend.</p><p>According to Sudeep Shah, Head of Technical Research and Derivatives at SBI Securities, the overall structure suggests that Bank Nifty is regaining leadership after a phase of consolidation.</p><p>\"The 55,700–55,800 zone will act as immediate resistance for the index. If the index manages to move above the 55,800 level, the pullback could extend further toward 56,300, followed by 56,600,\" said Sudeep Shah, Head of Technical Research and Derivatives at SBI Securities.</p><p>On the downside, the 55,200-55,100 zone will act as crucial support for the index, he added.</p><p>Meanwhile, the India VIX, which measures the expected market volatility, remained subdued for the fourth consecutive session, providing comfort to bulls. It was down by 2.21 percent to 10.06, the lowest closing level since September 19.</p><p><em>Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Losses eased in FMCG and technology stocks, while metals and PSU banks extended gains. Both Sensex and Nifty ended the week higher by nearly one percent, marking their second consecutive day of gains.</p><p>At close, the Sensex rose 213 points, or 0.26 percent, to close at 81,196, while the Nifty gained 57 points, or 0.23 percent, to end at 24,894. Market breadth was positive with 2,516 stocks advancing, 1,366 declining, and 113 remaining unchanged.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/stock-market-live-sensex-nifty-50-share-price-gift-nifty-latest-updates-03-10-2025-liveblog-13594602.html\" rel=\"dofollow\">Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog</a></p><p class=\"lastPara\">Metal stocks were the standout performers through the week, with the Nifty Metal index climbing 4 percent. Several factors supported the rally in metals — a weaker US dollar index, reports that the European Union may raise steel import tariffs to as high as fifty percent, improving demand prospects, and China’s decision to cut steel output.</p><p>Copper prices also continued their upward momentum globally. On the London Metal Exchange, three-month futures crossed 10,500 dollars per ton, rising more than 3 percent for the week and extending gains for the third straight session.</p><div class=\"taboolaClass\" id=\"taboola-mid-article-thumbnails\" style=\"width:70%;margin:0 auto;height:auto;\"></div><p>PSU bank stocks were another key driver, with the Nifty PSU Bank index advancing 2 percent during the week. The Reserve Bank of India’s decision to keep policy rates steady at five and a half 5.5 percent offered comfort to banks, preventing the risk of shrinking margins that could have arisen if deposit and lending rates had moved unevenly.</p><p>Broader participation was also visible as all sectors posted weekly gains. However, IT, Realty, Pharma, and FMCG stocks ended with only marginal advances.</p><p>According to analysts at ICICI Securities, Nifty has staged a solid rebound after eight straight sessions of decline. They expect the index to rise about 7 percent over the next month, although intermittent volatility cannot be ruled out. Strong support for the index is seen in the 24,400–24,200 range.</p><p><em>Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
