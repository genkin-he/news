There were two deaths due to bone marrow failure. For 7 of 13 patients treated with XOFIGO bone marrow failure was ongoing at the time of death. Among the 13 patients who experienced bone marrow failure, <percent>54%</percent> required blood transfusions. Four percent (<percent>4%</percent>) of patients in the XOFIGO arm and <percent>2%</percent> in the placebo arm permanently discontinued therapy due to bone marrow suppression. In the randomized trial, deaths related to vascular hemorrhage in association with myelosuppression were observed in <percent>1%</percent> of XOFIGO-treated patients compared to <percent>0.3%</percent> of patients treated with placebo. The incidence of infection-related deaths (<percent>2%</percent>), serious infections (<percent>10%</percent>), and febrile neutropenia (&lt;<percent>1%</percent>) was similar for patients treated with XOFIGO and placebo. Myelosuppression–notably thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, and leukopenia–has been reported in patients treated with XOFIGO.<br/><br/>Monitor patients with evidence of compromised bone marrow reserve closely and provide supportive care measures when clinically indicated. Discontinue XOFIGO in patients who experience life-threatening complications despite supportive care for bone marrow failure<br/><br/></li><li><b>Hematological Evaluation:</b> Monitor blood counts at baseline and prior to every dose of XOFIGO. Prior to first administering XOFIGO, the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be ≥1.5 × 109/L, the platelet count ≥100 × 109/L, and hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL. Prior to subsequent administrations, the ANC should be ≥1 × 109/L and the platelet count ≥50 × 109/L. Discontinue XOFIGO if hematologic values do not recover within 6 to 8 weeks after the last administration despite receiving supportive care<br/><br/></li><li><b>Concomitant Use With Chemotherapy:</b> Safety and efficacy of concomitant chemotherapy with XOFIGO have not been established. Outside of a clinical trial, concomitant use of XOFIGO in patients on chemotherapy is not recommended due to the potential for additive myelosuppression. If chemotherapy, other systemic radioisotopes, or hemibody external radiotherapy are administered during the treatment period, XOFIGO should be discontinued<br/><br/></li><li><b>Increased Fractures and Mortality in Combination With Abiraterone Plus Prednisone/Prednisolone:</b> XOFIGO is not recommended for use in combination with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone outside of clinical trials. At the primary analysis of the Phase 3 ERA-223 study that evaluated concurrent initiation of XOFIGO in combination with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone in 806 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic mCRPC patients, an increased incidence of fractures (<percent>28.6%</percent> vs <percent>11.4%</percent>) and deaths (<percent>38.5%</percent> vs <percent>35.5%</percent>) have been observed in patients who received XOFIGO in combination with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone compared to patients who received placebo in combination with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone. Safety and efficacy with the combination of XOFIGO and agents other than gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues have not been established<br/><br/></li><li><b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: </b>The safety and efficacy of XOFIGO have not been established in females. XOFIGO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female. Advise pregnant females and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise male patients to use condoms and their female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for 6 months after completing treatment with XOFIGO</li></ul><p><b>Administration and Radiation Protection:</b> XOFIGO should be received, used, and administered only by authorized persons in designated clinical settings. The administration of XOFIGO is associated with potential risks to other persons from radiation or contamination from spills of bodily fluids such as urine, feces, or vomit. Therefore, radiation protection precautions must be taken in accordance with national and local regulations</p><p><b>Fluid Status:</b> Dehydration occurred in <percent>3%</percent> of patients on XOFIGO and <percent>1%</percent> of patients on placebo. XOFIGO increases adverse reactions such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, which may result in dehydration. Monitor patients’ oral intake and fluid status carefully and promptly treat patients who display signs or symptoms of dehydration or hypovolemia</p><p><b>Injection Site Reactions:</b> Erythema, pain, and edema at the injection site were reported in <percent>1%</percent> of patients on XOFIGO</p><p><b>Secondary Malignant Neoplasms:</b> XOFIGO contributes to a patient’s overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure may be associated with an increased risk of cancer and hereditary defects. Due to its mechanism of action and neoplastic changes, including osteosarcomas, in rats following administration of radium-223 dichloride, XOFIGO may increase the risk of osteosarcoma or other secondary malignant neoplasms. However, the overall incidence of new malignancies in the randomized trial was lower on the XOFIGO arm compared to placebo (&lt;<percent>1%</percent> vs <percent>2%</percent>; respectively), but the expected latency period for the development of secondary malignancies exceeds the duration of follow-up for patients on the trial</p><p><b>Subsequent Treatment With Cytotoxic Chemotherapy:</b> In the randomized clinical trial, <percent>16%</percent> of patients in the XOFIGO group and <percent>18%</percent> of patients in the placebo group received cytotoxic chemotherapy after completion of study treatments. Adequate safety monitoring and laboratory testing was not performed to assess how patients treated with XOFIGO will tolerate subsequent cytotoxic chemotherapy</p><p><b>Adverse Reactions:</b> The most common adverse reactions (≥<percent>10%</percent>) in the XOFIGO arm vs the placebo arm, respectively, were nausea (<percent>36%</percent> vs <percent>35%</percent>), diarrhea (<percent>25%</percent> vs <percent>15%</percent>), vomiting (<percent>19%</percent> vs <percent>14%</percent>), and peripheral edema (<percent>13%</percent> vs <percent>10%</percent>). Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were reported in <percent>57%</percent> of XOFIGO-treated patients and <percent>63%</percent> of placebo-treated patients. The most common hematologic laboratory abnormalities in the XOFIGO arm (≥<percent>10%</percent>) vs the placebo arm, respectively, were anemia (<percent>93%</percent> vs <percent>88%</percent>), lymphocytopenia (<percent>72%</percent> vs <percent>53%</percent>), leukopenia (<percent>35%</percent> vs <percent>10%</percent>), thrombocytopenia (<percent>31%</percent> vs <percent>22%</percent>), and neutropenia (<percent>18%</percent> vs <percent>5%</percent>).</p><p>Please see the <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flabeling.bayerhealthcare.com%2Fhtml%2Fproducts%2Fpi%2FXofigo_PI.pdf&amp;esheet=54433531&amp;newsitemid=20260225000389&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=full+Prescribing+Information&amp;index=2&amp;md5=2ec60fd1a978ac9087891120683da216\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">full Prescribing Information</a> for XOFIGO (radium Ra 223 dichloride).</p><p><b>About Oncology at Bayer</b></p><p>Bayer is committed to delivering science for a better life by advancing a portfolio of innovative treatments.

systematically logged and photographed by Banyan geology personnel. All core samples (HTW and NTW diameter) were split on-site at Banyan's core processing facilities. Once split, half samples were placed back in the core boxes with the other half of split samples sealed in poly bags with one part of a three-part sample tag inserted within. Samples were delivered by Banyan personnel or a dedicated expediter to the Bureau Veritas, Whitehorse preparatory laboratory where samples are prepared and then shipped to Bureau Veritas's Analytical laboratory in Vancouver, B.C. for pulverization and final chemical analysis.</p><p>Core splits reported in this news release were analysed by Bureau Veritas of Vancouver, B.C., utilizing the four-acid digestion ICP-ES 35-element MA-300 or ICP-ES/MS 59-element MA-250 analytical package with FA-450 50-gram Fire Assay with AAS finish for gold on all samples. Samples returning &gt;10 g/t Au were reanalysed by fire assay with gravimetric finish on a 50g sample (FA-550). High-grade samples with documented visible gold are also analysed using metallic screen fire assay (FS-652). Bureau Veritas is an accredited lab following ISO/IEC 17025:2017 SCC File Number 15895.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Burlington, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - February 26, 2026) - Silver Bullet Mines Corp. (TSXV: SBMI) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/SBMCF/\" title=\"View SBMCF stock overview\">SBMCF</a>) (\"SBMI\" or \"the Company\") is pleased to provide historical technical information related to its two recent acquisitions, the Columbia Mine and the Gold Queen Mine. These past producing mines are contiguous to each other located in Gila County, Arizona, roughly 30 miles from the Company's mill in Globe, Arizona.</p><p>The Company has repeatedly spoken of its hub and spoke business model, commencing in 2020. This model envisions the hub being the Company's wholly-owned mill and the spokes of the wheel being whatever proximate mines it may own or from which mineralized material is provided to the mill to be processed. This has been a successful model for SBMI. The proximity of the Columbia Mine and the Gold Queen Mine to the mill supports the Company's hub and spoke thesis.</p><p>The Columbia Mine and the Gold Queen Mine were until recently owned by Phelps Dodge Corporation (now a subsidiary of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. as a result of a USD<money>$25.9 billion</money> acquisition in 2007). They have historically produced mainly copper with secondary production of gold, silver, zinc and lead. They are in the Dripping Springs District of Arizona, a district with well-documented mining production. </p><p>SBMI has not been able to locate any data related to these mines disseminated in accordance with <i>NI 43-101</i>. All data either predates <i>NI 43-101, </i>was created by entities not subject to <i>NI 43-101</i>, or was anecdotal from trusted sources. SBMI has not found any historical resource estimates in any category for these mines, and cannot state whether the work supporting the data was carried out under the supervision of, or approved by, a Qualified Person, or what QAQC measures were followed. SBMI does rely upon such data to inform its investment thesis and to provide guidance for possible future exploration and development. Readers should treat all data referred to herein with caution.</p><p>Background data from independent third parties, including the United States Geological Survey, with references can be found at:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/LqpLoHGxg0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://mrdata.usgs.gov/mrds/show-mrds.php?dep_id=10046332</a> </li><li><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/oPyp2cB7bb\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Dripping Springs Mines (Dripping Springs claims; Cocreham and Haywood Mine; Gold Nugget Mine; Gold Queen Mine; Columbia Mine; Roundtop Mine), Dripping Springs, Dripping Spring Wash, Dripping Springs Mining District, Gila County, Arizona, USA</a></li><li><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/OARPwH2Ga5\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Dripping Springs Mines - Western Mining History</a></li><li><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/PqENoHgQ8R\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Gold Queen Mine Near Kelvin, Arizona | The Diggings™</a></li></ul><p>SBMI has in its possession a PowerPoint presentation created in 2018 (the \"Presentation\") by a prior private corporate owner of the Gold Queen and Columbia Mines. Two of the Company's current contractors were part of the team working those assets in 2018, and therefore can attest to and have attested to their belief in the accuracy of the contents of the Presentation and its authorship. The author of the Presentation was a Canadian B.Sc., P.Geo. having the characteristics and qualities of a Qualified Person, and who in fact served as a Qualified Person for Canadian reporting issuers.</p><p><b>The reader should be made aware that in the paragraph below, the historical production figures and grades are anecdotal and not necessarily to be relied upon.</b></p><p>According to the Presentation, Dripping Spring Mines shipments including but not limited to the Columbia and Gold Queen Mines in the 1940's were reported to contain 2 - <percent>7%</percent> copper with 0.08 to 0.28 oz per ton gold. Then-recent vein and stockpile sampling yielded high grade gold values including 49.1 g/t, 35.8 g/t, and 27.6 g/t. Historical sketches of the Columbia Mine included in the Presentation show numerous significant assay results for copper at depth in the Columbia Mine (pages 15 and 16).</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8464/285483_mgm1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

(NASDAQ: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/RMCF/\" title=\"View RMCF stock overview\">RMCF</a>), America’s Chocolatier®, today announced the launch of its omnichannel growth strategy, marking the next phase of the company’s broader transformation initiative. Systemwide rollout is underway and expected to be substantially implemented over the next six weeks.</p> <p align=\"left\">For more than 40 years, the company has delivered a premium five-senses retail experience through handcrafted chocolates, live caramel apple dipping, in-store fudge making, and immersive confectionery theater. As Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory continues modernizing its store prototype and expanding into new territories, the omnichannel initiative extends that same craft-driven experience into the digital ecosystem, increasing accessibility while preserving brand integrity and operational discipline.</p> <p align=\"left\">Phase One includes implementation of a centralized order management system powered by Deliverect, enabling seamless integration between franchise locations and leading third-party marketplaces, including Uber Eats, DoorDash, Grubhub, and ezCater. The company will also expand availability through Instacart as part of its broader marketplace strategy.</p> <p align=\"left\">This integrated infrastructure represents a scalable digital foundation for the brand, routing marketplace orders directly into store systems where applicable, improving operational efficiency, maintaining pricing consistency, and enhancing real-time data visibility across the system.</p> <p align=\"left\">By expanding into high-frequency digital marketplaces, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory increases brand visibility and purchase frequency among new customer segments. Online consumers typically skew younger and demonstrate higher impulse purchasing behavior, creating incremental demand beyond traditional store traffic and supporting long-term brand relevance.</p> <p align=\"left\">“Our transformation is about honoring our heritage while building a modern, scalable platform for growth,” said Jeff Geygan, Interim Chief Executive Officer. “By pairing our immersive five-senses retail experience with a disciplined omnichannel infrastructure, we are expanding how consumers engage with our brand, strengthening unit-level economics for our franchisees, and positioning Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory for sustainable national expansion.”</p> <p align=\"left\">Through ezCater integration, the company expands into corporate catering and gifting channels, providing businesses with direct access to Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory products for meetings, employee recognition, and client gifting. This initiative is designed to drive incremental same-store sales, increase average order value potential, and diversify revenue streams in a capital-light manner.</p> <p align=\"left\">Integrated marketplace ordering enhances systemwide data capture, providing actionable insights into consumer behavior, product performance, and purchasing patterns. These insights support menu optimization, targeted marketing initiatives, improved forecasting, and more informed capital allocation decisions as the company continues executing its disciplined growth strategy.</p> <p align=\"left\">By modernizing revenue channels without materially increasing fixed store overhead, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory strengthens its franchise development proposition and long-term value creation strategy. The omnichannel launch represents another milestone in the company’s multi-year roadmap focused on operational excellence, scalable infrastructure, and sustained franchise and shareholder growth.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>About Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc.</strong></p> <p align=\"left\">Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc. is a leading franchiser of a premium chocolate and confectionary retail store concept.

            "title": "Waste Energy Corp to Present at Clean Energy & Renewables Virtual Investor Conference on March 5th; Highlights Permian Basin Deployment and 2026 Operational Roadmap | WAST Stock News",
            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><strong id=\"dateline\">MIDLAND, TX / <a href=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ACCESS Newswire</a> / February 26, 2026 / </strong>Waste Energy Corp (OTCQB:WAST) (\"WEC\" or the \"Company\"), a clean-energy company converting non-recyclable waste into usable fuel and renewable energy products, today announced that is will present at the Clean Energy &amp; Renewables Virtual Investor Conference on March 5, 2026, hosted by OTC Markets Group. Management will walk through the Company's waste conversion model, its first facility in Midland, Texas, and the operational milestones it expects to hit as commissioning draws near.</p><p><strong>Permian Basin: A Deliberate Starting Point</strong></p><p>The Midland facility wasn't placed in the Permian Basin by accident. The region offers something most early-stage energy infrastructure companies spend years chasing established distribution networks, industrial-scale fuel demand, and a deep base of energy capital that understands long-cycle infrastructure investment. Waste tire feedstock is also concentrated in the area, reducing inbound logistics costs and simplifying supply chain management.</p><p>Management sees the Permian not just as a first market, but as a template. If the model works here, it travels.</p><p><strong>What the Facility Actually Does</strong></p><p>Running Phase 1 at full capacity 30 tons per day, 330 days a year, the Midland plant is designed to process around 10,000 tons of waste tires annually. That's north of 300,000 passenger tires, or roughly 140,000 heavy truck tires, every year. Beyond the headline fuel output, the process recovers carbon black, syngas to run the system and high grade steel, all of which have established regional buyers. Steel alone could represent 990 to 1,485 tons of recoverable material annually, based on typical tire composition.</p><p>The Company is also working with local partners on landfill diversion and tire stockpile remediation in the Permian Basin, a community angle that has drawn interest from regional stakeholders.</p><p><strong>Rethinking How Carbon Credits Get Made</strong></p><p>The voluntary carbon market has a credibility problem. Credits get challenged, methodologies get disputed, and human reporting introduces errors that undermine confidence in the underlying asset. Waste Energy Corp has filed a patent for a system designed to fix that at the source.</p><p>The Company's patent-pending carbon credit automation system uses on-site video monitoring and sensor data to capture the conversion process in real time. That data is then run through a carbon credit algorithm when a match is confirmed, a credit is created automatically, minted as an NFT, and deposited directly into a digital wallet. The credits will be tradeable on the Company's own blockchain-based platform.</p><p>The logic is straightforward: remove the human from the reporting chain, and you remove the most common source of error and dispute. The result is a carbon credit with a verifiable, immutable record of exactly how and when it was generated, something the market has struggled to produce consistently.</p><p>For investors, this matters beyond the environmental angle. A carbon credit with a clean chain of custody and blockchain-based provenance is a more defensible asset. It's also a potential competitive advantage as regulators and institutional buyers apply increasing scrutiny to voluntary market integrity.</p><p><strong>The Carbon Credit Opportunity</strong></p><p>Based on combustion-equivalent emission factors, full-capacity throughput at the Midland facility could translate to roughly 12,800 metric tons of CO₂e annually. Whether that supports a meaningful credit position still depends on third-party validation and registry methodology, a process that hasn't concluded. Conservative estimates put potential annual credits in the 7,000 to 17,000 range, with a theoretical ceiling around 22,000 to 28,000. Management isn't booking that revenue yet, but the automated issuance system is designed to make the validation process faster, cleaner, and more defensible when it does get there.</p><p><strong>Midland Facility Commissioning &amp; Timelines</strong></p><p>The Midland facility is approaching commissioning. Management has committed to regular updates tied to actual milestones production ramp, first revenue, and expansion decisions rather than forward-looking timelines that tend to slip.</p><p>\"We are building Waste Energy Corp around disciplined execution and measurable results,\" said Scott Gallagher, Chairman &amp; CEO. \"Our first priority is to demonstrate a model that works operationally and economically. The Permian Basin deployment is not simply a site launch, it is the foundation for a scalable environmental infrastructure platform designed to generate diversified revenue streams, including fuel, recovered materials, and carbon-linked assets.\"</p><p>Gallagher continued, \"As we move toward commissioning, transparency becomes increasingly important. During the March 5th presentation, I will provide a clear framework outlining our expected path to revenue for the Midland facility. Shareholder value is created through execution, consistency, and scale and our focus in 2026 is to deliver on each of those.\"</p><p>The broader context isn't lost on the Company either. U.S. electricity demand hit record highs in 2025 and is projected to keep climbing, driven largely by the data center and AI infrastructure buildout that shows no sign of slowing. Data center electricity demand has grown more than <percent>400%</percent> over the past decade. Carbon credits, and U.S. data center power demand is forecast to reach 134 gigawatts by 2030, nearly triple current levels. That kind of structural demand creates a sustained need for new domestic energy sources, particularly ones that don't require greenfield grid infrastructure. Waste Energy Corp's model, modular, deployable near existing waste streams, and producing fuel that can flow through established regional distribution networks is designed for exactly that environment.</p><p>At the same time, institutional capital continues its rotation toward ESG-aligned infrastructure. Corporate power purchase agreements for zero-carbon electricity reached 29.5 gigawatts in 2025, the highest annual total on record, a signal that large buyers are actively seeking credible, verifiable clean energy and carbon assets. The Company believes its combination of waste diversion, domestic fuel production, and blockchain-verified carbon credits positions it squarely in that flow of capital. The Midland facility will ultimately have to prove the model but the market conditions for doing so have rarely been better aligned.</p><p><strong>Conference Details</strong></p><p>Waste Energy Corp will present at the Clean Energy &amp; Renewables Virtual Investor Conference on March 5, 2026.

These high grades are significant because they are comparable to those seen in other major Arizona-Sonora mining camps, where early mining of silver veins later evolved into major copper discoveries at more than a dozen large mines, including Cananea, La Caridad, Bisbee, Resolution, Morenci, and Ray, to name a few.</p><p>\"Riverside early 2026 field program at the Ariel and Maria Luisa mineral concessions now consolidated into a single, fully permitted drill-ready project area found high grade precious and base metals typical of the major copper mines in the region and now the targets at Ariel continue to improve as the Company derisks the project with systematic fieldwork to sharpen targeting and prepare it for partnering and immediate drilling,\" said John-Mark Staude, CEO of Riverside Resources. \"The combination of geologic mapping, geochemistry, alteration mineral studies, and integrated geophysics is providing stronger vectors into the most prospective zones. Ariel remains a compelling, undrilled copper district target in a premier belt, with excellent access, safety and infrastructure. The recent geochemistry continues to enhance the porphyry Cu target potential at Ariel.\"</p><p><b>Exploration Work and Targeting Progress</b></p><p>Riverside has full mineral title for the Ariel property and has advanced copper exploration through database compilations, field mapping, sampling, remote sensing, mineral concession consolidation and regional geophysical data interpretation, leading to the definition of two principal porphyry target areas (Ariel and Maria Luisa). The project has seen limited to no historical drilling to Riverside's knowledge, and the Company considers Ariel a high-quality, drill-stage copper district target with extensive exposed targets and additional areas masked by shallow post-mineral cover. The Project is available for partnership per the Company's business model of project generation; however, the Company could choose to drill the project given the quality exploration district. </p><p><b>Project Highlights</b></p><ul><li><p>District-scale, consolidated footprint: Ariel totals 1,640 hectares (16 km²) across five fully titled concessions in good standing, including the Maria Luisa area, providing multiple priority target zones for drill testing. </p></li><li><p>Two priority target styles defined: Ongoing work continues to refine (1) a porphyry copper target with near surface copper sulphides and oxides, and (2) an epithermal arget interpreted as the upper portion of a porphyry system, consistent with alteration, veining and breccia styles with walk up safe, easy access on private ranch land. </p></li><li><p>Modern scientific exploration tools improving vectoring: Riverside is applying portable geochemical and mineralogical tools (including portable XRF and short-wave/infrared spectral mineral scanning) to distinguish vein and alteration assemblages and prioritize drill-ready areas. </p></li><li><p>Strategically located in the Sonora, Mexico Laramide copper belt and less than 20km from the La Caridad Cu-Mo porphyry mining complex, with additional regional porphyry prospects in the district. </p></li><li><p>Ariel is underlain by Late Cretaceous volcanic rocks of the Tarahumara Formation intruded by Paleocene (ca. 57 Ma) porphyritic intrusions comparable in age to regional porphyry mineralization events similar to many of the mines in the Arizona- Sonora Belt which includes over 10 significant copper operations.</p></li></ul><p><b>2026 Sampling North Area - \"Maria Luisa\" Epithermal Target</b></p><p>New exploration geochemistry results from the early 2026 program for the Maria Luisa part of the Ariel Project have high grade Ag and Pb typical of lateral expressions of porphyry copper like those in Arizona at Resolution, Globe-Miami and Bingham in Utah. Here, silver values reach up to &gt;10 oz/t Ag and Pb values reach up to <percent>5.4%</percent>, along with gold anomalies of up to 0.4 g/t Au, as shown in the Table, Summary Map, and Cross Section figures in this news release.  The sampling showed multiple sets of parallel veining consistent with what is common in major copper districts. Chip samples ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 m were taken by cutting the veins perpendicularly.

Samples were then shipped for analysis by ACT Labs in Zacatecas, Mexico. Samples were analyzed for by gold fire assay, with pulps analyzed with Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mas Spectrometry (\"ICP-MS\") following four-acid digestion to determine silver, base metals, and pathfinders. Samples were maintained in chain of custody being delivered to the laboratory in sealed bags. Standards and blanks were inserted every 20 samples and the laboratory also did duplicates every 20 samples as additional check on the quality control.  The QA/QC was analyzed with a check for any variations in the standards beyond 2 standard deviations and the standards passed.   Historic samples were analyzed using the same procedures with samples delivered to Bureau Veritas (Hermosillo, Sonora) for gold fire assay, with pulps forwarded to Vancouver, Canada for Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mas Spectrometry (\"ICP-MS\") following four-acid digestion to determine silver, base metals, and pathfinders.</p><p><b>Qualified Person</b></p><p>The technical content of the news release has been reviewed and approved by Freeman Smith, P.Geo.
