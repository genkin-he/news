The renovated facility is now JBT Marel’s premier customer destination for sustainable food tech—from production of fresh fruit and vegetables to ready meals to beverages and dairy.</p><p>JBT Marel’s dozens of CIC facilities around the world enable customers to work side by side with experts to run their products through JBT Marel equipment and solve efficiency, quality, and regulatory challenges. CICs serve as production stages to demonstrate cutting-edge solutions and software through private demonstrations, industry events, hands-on training, and virtual reality (VR).</p><p>“At JBT Marel, we are committed to transforming the future of food in ways that create a positive impact and lasting value for our customers, our communities, and the global food system. Our Customer Innovation Centers reinforce that mission by enabling customers to test, validate, and scale technologies that help feed the world more responsibly,” said Brian Deck, CEO at JBT Marel.</p><p>The Lakeland CIC now includes a new microbiology lab in addition to its revitalized analytical and wet chemistry labs.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p> <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\">LONDON</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Global wearable device shipments climbed past 200 million units in 2025, growing <percent>6%</percent> year on year <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fomdia.tech.informa.com%2Fadvance-your-business%2Fconsumer-electronics-and-pro-av&amp;esheet=54435131&amp;newsitemid=20260227981313&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=according+to+Omdia&amp;index=1&amp;md5=7a895114c6557484e2eb5ff50fa73149\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">according to Omdia</a>. Xiaomi has reclaimed the top spot for the first time since 2020, capturing an <percent>18%</percent> market share to become the world’s largest wearable vendor by annual shipments. Apple followed closely in second place with <percent>17%</percent>, while Huawei secured third with <percent>16%</percent>. The market is also seeing increased consolidation, with the top five vendors, including Samsung (<percent>9%</percent>) and Garmin (<percent>5%</percent>), with the top three in a tight race.</p><div id=\"bwbodyimg\" style=\"width: 480px; float:left; padding-left:0px; padding-right:20px; padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;\"><img alt=\"Global wearable band market share, by category, 2024-2025\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20260227981313/en/2733308/4/Updated_-_Global_wearable_band_market_share%2C_by_category%2C_2024-2025.jpg\"/><p style=\"font-size:85%;\">Global wearable band market share, by category, 2024-2025</p></div><p>“Wearables are moving from a hardware-driven race to an ecosystem-led competition,” said <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fomdia.tech.informa.com%2Fauthors%2Fcynthia-chen&amp;esheet=54435131&amp;newsitemid=20260227981313&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Omdia+Research+Manager+Cynthia+Chen&amp;index=2&amp;md5=5e83be3a43ed949b85e52a351e4a483c\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">Omdia Research Manager Cynthia Chen</a>. “With less than one percentage point separating the top three vendors, competitive advantage now depends on seamless cross-device integration and the ability to deliver monetizable, value-added data services.” Xiaomi’s rise reflects a structured multi-category strategy rather than reliance on a single flagship product. Its bands continue to anchor volume in the mass market, while its basic watches, supported by in-house chip development and deeper ecosystem integration, are enabling the brand to move up the value chain. Apple retains a strong premium position, leveraging 5G connectivity and advanced health features, including hypertension monitoring, to sustain high loyalty among its high-value users. Huawei has consolidated its mainstream presence through a broad portfolio, while intensifying its focus on professional sports and medical-grade health applications.</p><p>AI and subscription services are reshaping competition, transforming from nice-to-have features into essential revenue drivers of growth and profitability. Wearable bands are increasingly optimized for continuous health monitoring, with some vendors exploring screenless or reduced-screen designs to improve comfort and data continuity. “The wearables profit model is undergoing structural change,” said <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fomdia.tech.informa.com%2Fauthors%2Fjason-low&amp;esheet=54435131&amp;newsitemid=20260227981313&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Omdia+Research+Director+Jason+Low&amp;index=3&amp;md5=580e5ddc32c1c0b2f40a4a50ce7551f3\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">Omdia Research Director Jason Low</a>. “Algorithms and services are becoming standalone profit centers, with advanced health insights, professional training plans, and AI-powered coaching generating recurring subscription revenue.” For vendors with a higher-priced portfolio, subscription services represent more than just additional revenue. They are becoming essential to maintaining profitability as hardware margins compress due to rising component costs. This recurring revenue model provides a critical buffer against the volatility of hardware pricing. Meanwhile, improved insights into health and sport tracking are designed to increase usage and stickiness, which, in turn, provides more data points for more tailored services.</p><p>Looking ahead, Omdia expects the global wearables market to deliver modest single-digit growth in 2026, reflecting not only continued expansion in shipment volume but also a gradual shift in industry value dynamics. Growth will increasingly be driven by on-device AI advancements and the rising demand for more professional-grade sports and health management. Meaningful upgrade cycles will rely on real breakthroughs in substantive health monitoring capabilities. For leading smartwatch vendors, such as Apple, Samsung, and Huawei, progress in key physiological metrics, particularly blood glucose and blood pressure monitoring, will become the primary catalyst for renewed growth. Among the three major categories, smartwatches are expected to show the strongest momentum, combining advanced sensing, AI analytics, and deeper ecosystem connectivity to serve as the most scalable platform for AI agent integration. At the same time, improving subscription and service monetization is strengthening profitability and enabling reinvestment in technology and ecosystem development. Over time, competitive advantage will depend less on shipment scale alone and more on the depth of AI capability and the strength of cross-device ecosystem integration.</p><table cellspacing=\"0\"

Mutations enhance AMPK activity leading to abnormal glycogen accumulation in heart muscle cells leading to thickened heart muscles, electrical conduction problems, and arrhythmias. There are 1,000 – 2,000 people with PRKAG2 syndrome in the US. Current management is limited to symptomatic treatment; no approved therapies exist to address the underlying genetic driver of disease.</p><p><b>About PLN Cardiomyopathy</b></p><p>PLN (phospholamban) cardiomyopathy is a rare autosomal dominant, progressive cardiac disease caused by mutations in PLN, a key regulator of SERCA2a calcium pump. Pathogenic variants produce protein aggregates that disrupt endoplasmic reticulum processes and lead to dilated, arrhythmogenic, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathies and a significantly increased risk of heart failure and sudden cardiac death. There are 2,000 – 4,000 people with pathogenic PLN variants in the US. No approved therapies target the underlying molecular cause of the disease.</p><p><b>Forward-Looking Statements</b></p><p>This communication contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Our business model is to provide clients with toll milling services and produce high-grade marketable concentrates from mineral purchases. The Aguila Norte processing plant has an environmental permit (\"IGAC\") from the Peruvian government which provides the Company with the ability to expand operations past the current 100 tonnes per day level. The Company continues to acquire and develop precious and base metal properties in Peru.</p><p>The Company has recently completed a financing which will allow the Company to focus its 2026 development program on its high-grade Au-Ag Palta Dorada property. New metallurgical results in both oxide and sulphide material highlight the gold potential at Palta Dorada. Provisional permits are in place allowing the company to extract large bulk samples of both the oxide and sulphide material. Sulphide material will be transported to our Aguila Norte mill for processing where we will be able to produce an Au-Ag concentrate for sale. The oxide gold material, along with similar oxide mineral at our Aguila Norte site, will be one of many catalysts and sources of material for a potential CIP circuit. Peruvian Metals will move into the Peruvian gold space which will be bolstered by the progress at Palta Dorada.</p><p><b>About PDAC</b></p><p>The World's Premier Mineral Exploration &amp; Mining Convention is the leading convention for people, governments, companies and organizations connected to mineral exploration. The annual convention is held in Toronto, Canada. It has grown in size, stature and influence since it began in 1932 and today is the event of choice for the world's mineral industry.</p><p>We look forward to seeing you there.</p><p><b>ON BEHALF OF PERUVIAN METALS</b><br/><b>CORP.</b><br/><u>(Signed) Jeffrey Reeder</u> <u> </u></p><div id=\"contactInfo\"><p><b>For additional information, contact: </b><br/>Jeffrey Reeder, C.E.O.<br/>Telephone: (647) 302-3290<br/>Email<i>: </i><a href=\"mailto:jeffrey.reeder@peruvianmetals.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">jeffrey.reeder@peruvianmetals.com</a></p></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><b>Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.</b></i></p><p><i><b>Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements: </b></i>This press release contains certain \"Forward-Looking Statements\" within the meaning of applicable securities legislation.
