(\"Biglari Capital\"), the largest stockholder of Jack in the Box Inc. (NasdaqGS: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/JACK/\" title=\"View JACK stock overview\">JACK</a>), with a <percent>9.86%</percent> ownership stake, today issued the following statement regarding the preliminary voting results from <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/JACK/\" title=\"View JACK stock overview\">JACK</a>'s 2026 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.</p><p><b>A Clear Divide: Accountability vs. Complacency </b></p><p>Preliminary voting results from JACK's stockholder meeting reveal a stark and troubling divide. Active fund managers and retail stockholders — those who bear the real consequences of failed corporate governance — voted to hold Chairman David Goebel accountable for the destruction of stockholder value and his failure to act as a responsible steward of stockholder interests. By contrast, ISS, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street supported the status quo, providing cover for a board that has presided over value destruction.</p><p><b>JACK spent <money><money>$5 Million</money></money> to Defend One Director for One More Year </b></p><p>JACK spent an estimated <money><money>$5 million</money></money> on this proxy contest — not to protect the company's future, but to defend the reelection of David Goebel for a single additional year.</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>Over the last five years alone, Mr. Goebel collected approximately <money><money>$1.55 million</money></money> in director compensation.</li><li>During the same period, JACK's stockholders lost approximately <percent>80%</percent> of their investment — roughly <money><money>$1.8 billion</money></money> in stockholder value.</li><li>Mr. Goebel was paid millions to oversee billions in destruction.</li></ul><p><b>ISS, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street: A Governance Failure </b></p><p>While active fund managers and retail stockholders voted for accountability, ISS and the three largest index funds — BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street — supported JACK's failed leader.</p><p>Preliminary voting data for the three index funds imply that the proxy voting teams at these firms are completely indifferent to how their decisions impact the owners whose capital they are entrusted to protect. One is left to wonder: Do these governance teams even consider the repercussions their rubber-stamping of failed leadership has on the investors who have lost <percent>80%</percent> of the value of their JACK holdings?</p><p>JACK is a poster child of everything that can go wrong at a public company — catastrophic acquisition, leadership turnover, persistent operational underperformance, and entrenched governance — yet it has still managed to secure the support of a proxy advisor and the three largest index funds. This is not governance; it is the institutionalization of unaccountability.</p><p><b>The Underlying Investors Would Disagree</b></p><p>If the ETF investors who have entrusted their savings to BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street — retail investors saving for retirement, college, and financial security — had had a say, they likely would have voted against Goebel. These investors did not hand over their savings so that the governance teams at these institutions could give a free pass to the same failed leadership at JACK that destroyed <money><money>$1.8 billion</money></money> in stockholder value.</p><p>Failing to hold boards accountable promotes mediocrity. It puts the entire system of meritocracy at risk. When the largest stewards of capital — BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street — abdicate their governance responsibilities, the consequences extend far beyond any single company.</p><p><b>JACK's False and Misleading Statements</b></p><p>In addition to these governance failures, JACK made false and misleading statements in its proxy materials. Biglari Capital reserves the right to pursue all available legal remedies.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b></p><p>Mr. Goebel should be embarrassed and ashamed of the company's performance. He should have resigned years ago instead of playing politics and trying to hold on, wasting money for personal gain while relying on abstain votes, ISS, and index funds. He has no credibility with active investors.</p><p>SOURCE Biglari Capital Corp.</p></div></article>",

If consummated, the proposed transaction could expand Tevogen’s clinical development capabilities and could support the Company’s evolution into a revenue-generating healthcare enterprise.</p> <p>Dr. Ryan Saadi, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Tevogen, stated, “The potential acquisition of a CRO could introduce revenue-generating service capabilities while allowing us to optimize trial execution internally. We believe this combination of operational control and service revenue may strengthen earnings visibility, support a more capital-efficient growth model, and enhance patient affordability.”</p> <p>The proposed transaction remains subject to, among other things, completion of due diligence, negotiation and execution of definitive documentation, required approvals, and satisfaction of customary closing conditions.</p> <p>Tevogen is also actively considering other transactions with a focus on life sciences-related businesses; however, there can be no assurance that any such transaction will be consummated.</p> <p><strong>About Tevogen</strong></p> <p>Tevogen is a socially integrated healthcare enterprise built on the principles of affordability, efficiency, and scientific rigor.

Geochemical analysis certificates included in Assessment Report 31,834 comprise results from three laboratories: Pioneer Labs (Certificate 2102718, 2010), ALS (Certificate VA10144345, 2010), and SGS (Certificate CA02322, 2010). The SGS certificate reported three rare earth elements including La 10 percent, Pr 0.77 percent, and Ce 13.1 percent.</p><p>Sample AR-20 was taken from a shear zone at 2,270 meters elevation hosted in coarse grain syenite gneiss with elevated apatite and zircon. The historic Copeland Mine, at elevation 2,100 metres is located 1.2 km northwest of Mount Copeland. Review of the 2010 technical report identified a typographical transcription error in the summary table. The original laboratory certificates contained in the appendix were correct; however, certain assay values for rock chip sample COPE10AR-20 were not accurately transcribed into the summary table. Using the original laboratory certificates referenced in the appendix, the Company recalculated the Total Rare Earth Oxide equivalent for sample AR20, which returns approximately 26 percent TREO.</p><p>The Company cautions that this recalculated TREO value is derived from historic laboratory certificates and has not been independently re-assayed or verified under current National Instrument 43-101 standards. The reported value relates to a select rock chip sample and is not necessarily representative of mineralization across the property. Rock chip samples are selective in nature and may not be indicative of grade or continuity.</p><p>In 2024, additional rock chip samples collected near the edge of the Copeland Glacier returned values of up to 0.234 percent niobium associated with elevated molybdenum. These results are also based on selective sampling and may not be representative of mineralization across the property. Representative samples from AR20 and other prospective zones are being prepared for submission to an independent laboratory for ICP-MS analysis to support potential future NI 43-101 compliant disclosure.</p><p><b>Molybdenum and Rhenium Update</b></p><p>The Company has also applied its dry mineral separation process to molybdenum-bearing rock chip samples from both Mount Copeland and the Red Bird property, upgrading the material to molybdenum concentrates. </p><p>The Red Bird property is characterized as a copper-molybdenum porphyry system with associated silver and rhenium mineralization, as documented in prior exploration work. Rhenium is commonly associated with molybdenite in porphyry environments.</p><p>Preliminary internal XRF analysis was performed using an Elvatech ElvaX ProSpector 3 X-ray fluorescence analyzer. The instrument was calibrated in accordance with manufacturer specifications and verified using certified reference standards prior to analysis.</p><p>Internal XRF analysis indicates that Mount Copeland material returned approximately 2,790 ppm rhenium in elemental analysis. Red Bird material returned approximately 3,182 ppm rhenium in oxide analysis and 2,115 ppm rhenium in elemental analysis of selected separated samples.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9904/285660_ef0bab2f8407998f_001full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

All rhenium results reported are preliminary and based on internal XRF analysis. The reported values relate to selected samples and may not be representative of mineralization across the respective properties. Representative samples from both properties will be submitted to an independent laboratory for verification using ICP-MS methods, and any future technical disclosure will be made in accordance with NI 43-101.</p><p>At PDAC 2026, in addition to graphite concentrates, graphene materials, and lithium-metal battery samples, Volt Carbon intends to display rock chip sample COPE10AR-20 from the Mount Copeland property, along with dry separated molybdenum concentrate samples derived from Mount Copeland that demonstrated measurable rhenium values in internal XRF analysis.</p><p><b>Qualified Person</b></p><p>The technical content of this release has been reviewed and approved by Andris Kikauka, P.Geo., who is the author of the 2010 Mount Copeland technical report and acts as a geologist for the Company.

The dose for expansion was successfully identified, with ≥<percent>80%</percent> of patients achieving a PSA50 response at the expansion dose.</p><p>New data were presented during the 2026 American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium, taking place in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\">San Francisco, CA</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location>, from February 26-28, 2026.

The compound is designed specifically to increase uptake within the tumor, with the goal to provide a differentiated safety and efficacy profile.</p><p>Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men with less than three years median survival among metastatic patients, who have developed castration-resistance. There is an increasing unmet need to improve the outcomes of men with mCRPC.<sup>6</sup></p><p><b>About the PAnTHa study (NCT06217822)<br/></b><b>P</b>SMA-targeted <b>A</b>cti<b>n</b>ium-225-<b>T</b>rillium Fi<b>H</b> study in <b>A</b>dvanced mCRPC (PAnTHa), is a Phase I, open-label, first-in-human, multicenter study to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of <sup>225</sup>Ac-PSMA-Trillium (BAY 3563254) in participants with advanced metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) that have at least 1 PSMA-positive lesion on PSMA-PET. In the trial, patients received <sup>225</sup>Ac-PSMA-Trillium intravenously every 6 weeks for up to 4 doses. At data cut-off, 50 patients were enrolled across four dose levels in the escalation cohort and <percent>80%</percent> completed all four cycles of <sup>225</sup>Ac-PSMA-Trillium (range: 75 to 150 kBq/kg; 12-13 patients/cohort).</p><p><b>Detailed Results from PAnTHa<br/></b>To date, <sup>225</sup>Ac-PSMA-Trillium has had no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) or treatment-related deaths. Most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were dry mouth, fatigue and nausea. Overall, <percent>38%</percent> of patients had Gr ≥3 TEAEs, most commonly lymphopenia, <percent>16%</percent> of patients had serious TEAEs and <percent>4%</percent> of patients discontinued treatment due to TEAEs. The overall response rate per PCWG3 criteria across all doses in patients with measurable disease at baseline (n=24) was <percent>46%</percent>, with disease control rate of <percent>83%</percent>. Respective PSA50 and PSA90 response rates were <percent>58%</percent> and <percent>36%</percent> overall, and <percent>83%</percent> and <percent>58%</percent> at the Recommended Dose for Expansion (RDE). This was further supported by the decline in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) fraction at the RDE. Further, PSA50 responses were observed across all baseline mean Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmean) groups.</p><p><b>About 225Ac-PSMA-Trillium (BAY 3563254)<br/></b><sup>225</sup>Ac-PSMA-Trillium (BAY 3563254) is a next-generation TAT that comprises a highly specific PSMA-targeting motif, an albumin-binding domain to optimize tumor uptake and retention, and a Macropa<sup>TM</sup> chelator complexed with the alpha-emitter actinium-225. The distinctive structural components are designed to provide a differentiated safety and efficacy profile. Both in vitro and in vivo characterization of <sup>225</sup>Ac-PSMA-Trillium demonstrates high tumor uptake and retention. Potent antitumor efficacy has been observed in several preclinical models of prostate cancer. PSMA-Trillium resulted from the acquisition of PSMA Therapeutics and Noria Therapeutics in 2021 and are now under clinical investigation.</p><p><b>About Targeted Alpha Therapy<br/></b>Targeted alpha therapy (TAT) is an emerging class of radionuclide therapy that can be used against a variety of tumors. It delivers alpha particle radiation directly to the tumor inside the body, either via its bone-seeking property (radium-223) or by combining alpha radionuclides, such as actinium-225, with specific targeting moieties.</p><p>Actinium-225 is an alpha particle–emitting radionuclide with a 9.9-day half-life. Alpha particles deposit highly ionizing radiation over a short range. This localized delivery of the radioactive payload induces irreparable DNA double-strand breaks, often resulting in cell death.</p><p><b>About prostate cancer<br/></b>Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men. Despite significant advances in the last decade, the prognosis for men with mCRPC remains poor with a median survival of about 31 months.<sup>2</sup> With increasing incidence, more than 300 thousand prostate cancer cases were reported in the US in 2025; 5-year relative survival with distant disease is only <percent>34%</percent>.<sup>3</sup> Advances in imaging technologies (i.e. PSMA-PET) and their utilization across all stages of prostate cancer will likely result in an increased number of patients diagnosed with metastatic disease earlier. Consequently, more men will be diagnosed with <i>de novo</i> PSMA-positive metastatic disease.</p><p><b>About Bayer<br/></b>Bayer is a global enterprise with core competencies in the life science fields of health care and nutrition.
