Zabrocky, International Seaways President and CEO commented, “We concluded 2025 with our strongest quarter since the first quarter of 2024, with solid contributions from both the crude and product segments and a return of VLCCs as leaders in tanker earnings. Our fleet renewal activity in 2025 reflects the disciplined approach we strive to take across the cycles: monetizing older assets at attractive values while securing modern tonnage that positions the fleet for long-term trading opportunities. We remained active through the fourth quarter and into the start of the year highlighted by the sales of older vessels, the strategic consolidation of Tankers International, and substantial returns to shareholders amid the strength of the tanker markets.”</p><p>Ms. Zabrocky continued, “Strong market fundamentals remain the underlying driver of tanker earnings, while today’s geopolitical environment has served as a powerful catalyst. Beneath the geopolitical headlines, we continue to see healthy oil demand growth of more than one million barrels per day, alongside supply growth from the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/am\">Americas</location> and OPEC+. On the supply side, while the orderbook stands at more than <percent>15%</percent> of the existing fleet, nearly half of the fleet is expected to reach 20 years of age by the time those vessels deliver. At the same time, we are seeing increased enforcement actions targeting sanctioned tonnage, which now exceeds the size of the orderbook, and we expect this to constrain effective fleet growth in compliant trades. Against this backdrop, Seaways remains well positioned with our significant operating leverage to convert positive market dynamics into strong cash flow generation, supporting the continued execution of our disciplined capital allocation strategy.”</p><p>Jeff Pribor, the Company’s CFO stated, “Following the placement of <money><money>$250 million</money></money> in senior unsecured bonds, we repaid higher-cost debt and unencumbered six additional vessels. Over the course of the year, we took advantage of our financial strength and flexibility to renew the fleet without stretching the balance sheet, funding investments through sales of older vessels and attractively priced financing, while reducing our net loan-to-value ratio to <percent>13%</percent> and returning nearly <money><money>$150 million</money></money> to shareholders. With continued strength in tanker markets into 2026, we remain focused on deploying cash flow toward fleet renewal and shareholder returns.”</p><p><b>FOURTH QUARTER 2025 RESULTS</b></p><p>Net income for the fourth quarter of 2025 was <money><money>$128 million</money></money>, or <money><money>$2.56</money></money> per diluted share, compared to net income of <money><money>$36 million</money></money>, or <money><money>$0.72</money></money> per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2024. The increase in results was primarily driven by higher TCE revenues<sup>(1)</sup> from spot earnings across the fleet, with weighted average spot rates increasing by approximately <money><money>$15,400</money></money> per day, and the impact of fleet optimization, reflected in lower vessel expenses and gains on vessel sales compared with a non-cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2024.</p><p>Shipping revenues for the fourth quarter were <money><money>$268 million</money></money>, compared to <money><money>$195 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2024. Consolidated TCE revenues<sup>(1)</sup> for the fourth quarter were <money><money>$260 million</money></money>, compared to <money><money>$191 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2024.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA<sup>(1)</sup> for the fourth quarter was <money><money>$175 million</money></money>, compared to <money><money>$95 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2024.</p><p><b>Crude Tankers</b></p><p>Shipping revenues for the Crude Tankers segment were <money><money>$151 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to <money><money>$96 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2024. TCE revenues<sup>(1)</sup> were <money><money>$147 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter, compared to <money><money>$93 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2024. This increase was attributable to higher spot earnings across the segment, with weighted average spot rates increasing by over <money><money>$26,000</money></money> per day and higher time charter revenues, reflecting incremental profit sharing of approximately <money><money>$36,900</money></money> per day on our dual-fuel VLCCs.</p><p><b>Product Carriers</b></p><p>Shipping revenues for the Product Carriers segment were <money><money>$117 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to <money><money>$99 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2024. TCE revenues<sup>(1)</sup> were <money><money>$113 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to <money><money>$97 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2024. The increase was driven by higher spot earnings across the product segment, with weighted average spot rates increasing by over <money><money>$8,000</money></money> per day.</p><p><b>FLEET OPTIMIZATION PROGRAM</b></p><p>On January 27, 2026, the Company acquired sole ownership of Tankers International, a leading shipping pool founded in 2000, providing commercial management of modern, independent VLCC tonnage. Tankers International has formed a new pool to expand its commercial management into the Suezmax class, to which the Company expects to contribute its Suezmax vessels trading in the spot market.</p><p>During the fourth quarter of 2025, the Company took delivery of <i>Seaways Gibbs Hill</i>, a 2020-built, scrubber-fitted VLCC. In August 2025, the Company agreed to purchase the vessel for <money><money>$119 million</money></money>, of which <money><money>$12 million</money></money> was paid during the third quarter in connection with the agreement.</p><p>In the fourth quarter, the Company sold three MR vessels with an average age of 18.5 years for net proceeds of <money><money>$36 million</money></money>. During the year ended December 31, 2025, the Company sold ten vessels, eight MRs and two LR1s, with an average age of 18.0 years for proceeds of approximately <money><money>$131 million</money></money>, excluding two vessels that were swapped in early 2025. The vessel swap exchanged two older VLCCs and <money><money>$3 million</money></money> in cash for three younger MRs through a series of vessel sales and purchase agreements spanning over the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025.</p><p>Between December 2025 and February 2026, the Company sold or entered into agreements to sell seven vessels for aggregate proceeds of approximately <money><money>$216 million</money></money>, net of commissions and fees. The vessels are among the oldest remaining in the fleet, consisting of five MRs with an average age of 18 years and two VLCCs with an average age of 15 years. The Company expects to close these transactions during the first quarter of 2026 and recognize gains from the vessel sales of approximately <money><money>$80 million</money></money>.</p><p>During the fourth quarter of 2025, the Company took delivery of the <i>Seaways Balboa</i>, the second of six LR1 newbuildings under construction in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/kr\">Korea</location> with K Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. The aggregate contract price for the six scrubber-fitted, dual-fuel ready LR1 vessels is approximately <money><money>$359 million</money></money>. As of December 31, 2025, the Company has approximately <money><money>$188 million</money></money> in remaining construction costs, of which approximately <money><money>$158 million</money></money> is expected to be drawn from the ECA Credit Facility (as defined below) in accordance with the delivery schedule. In the first quarter of 2026, the Company paid approximately <money><money>$30 million</money></money> in installment payments related to the construction of these vessels.</p><p>In the fourth quarter, the Company entered into a time charter agreement for one year on a 2012-built Suezmax that commenced in November 2025. As of January 1, 2026, the Company has 13 vessels on time charter agreements with an average duration of 1.4 years and total future contracted revenues through expiry of approximately <money><money>$210 million</money></money>, excluding any applicable profit share.</p><p><b>BALANCE SHEET ENHANCEMENTS</b></p><p>In September 2025, the Company successfully issued <money><money>$250 million</money></money> of senior unsecured bonds maturing in 2030 in the Norwegian bond market at a coupon rate of <percent>7.125%</percent>. Proceeds from the bonds were used in the exercise of declared purchase options on existing sale leaseback arrangements bearing interest at SOFR plus 405 basis points with an 18-year amortization profile. The purchase options were paid in November 2025 for <money><money>$258 million</money></money>, which unencumbered six VLCCs, reduced interest expense and eliminated approximately <money><money>$22 million</money></money> in annual mandatory principal payments.</p><p>In August 2025, the Company entered into a Korean export agency-backed financing with DNB Bank and K-Sure for up to <money><money>$240 million</money></money>, secured by six LR1 newbuildings delivering between the third quarter of 2025 and the third quarter of 2026 (the “ECA Credit Facility”). The 12-year facility combines for a 20-year amortization profile and a blended interest rate of SOFR plus 125 basis points across two tranches. Funds will be drawn under the facility in connection with the delivery of each vessel. During 2025, the Company drew <money><money>$82 million</money></money> in connection with the delivery of two vessels.</p><p>In the year ended December 30, 2025, the Company repaid <money><money>$145 million</money></money> on its revolving credit facilities, composed of <money><money>$69 million</money></money>, primarily borrowed for timing differences in connection with the vessel swap and <money><money>$76 million</money></money> to offset capacity reductions in our revolving credit facilities.</p><p><b>RETURNING CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS</b></p><p>In December 2025, the Company paid a combined dividend of <money><money>$0.86</money></money> per share of common stock, composed of a regular quarterly dividend of <money><money>$0.12</money></money> per share of common stock and a supplemental dividend of <money><money>$0.74</money></money> per share.</p><p>On February 25, 2026, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a combined dividend of <money><money>$2.15</money></money> per share of common stock, composed of a regular quarterly dividend of <money><money>$0.12</money></money> per share of common stock and a supplemental dividend of <money><money>$2.03</money></money> per share of common stock. Both dividends will be paid on March 30, 2026, to shareholders with a record date at the close of business on March 20, 2026.</p><p>In October 2025, the Company’s Board of Directors extended the expiry of the <money><money>$50 million</money></money> share repurchase program to the end of 2026.</p><p><sup>(1) </sup>This is a non-GAAP financial measure used throughout this press release; please refer to the section “Reconciliation to Non-GAAP Financial Information” for explanations of our non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of reported GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures.</p><p><b>CONFERENCE CALL</b></p><p>The Company will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2025 results at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, February 26, 2026.

Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA adjusted for the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent, and should not be a substitute for, net income or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations are: (i) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and (iii) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used as a measure of operating results and performance, neither of them is necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation. The following table reconciles net income as reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:</p><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb

The Company possesses fantastic brands and has strong category growth tailwinds at its back. I see a clear path to create tremendous value for our shareholders and intend to make a sizable open-market purchase of Nomad shares in the coming weeks to express my confidence and align my interests with our shareholders. The value creation, however, will not be immediate and we have work to do to unlock our full potential. We have a number of opportunities to address in the organization, and we will be focused on these in the coming months. We continue to streamline the organization to increase our speed, agility, focus and accountability. We believe this will help us improve our commercial execution while unlocking additional resources for reinvestment. We are also ensuring that the right talent, sourced both internally and externally, is in the right roles to help us succeed. We believe we can and will deliver better results, but we anticipate 2026 being a transition year as our financial outlook reflects the time required to implement and manage change. I am excited to show investors what Nomad Foods is capable of once we see the results of our new approach.\"</p><p>Noam Gottesman, Nomad Foods' Co-Chairman and Founder, commented, \"While it has only been a few months, I am encouraged by the rapid changes being implemented at Nomad Foods and the multi-year vision that is beginning to unfold. Dominic and his team have a lot of work ahead of them, but they are starting from a good place. The company's portfolio is strong, category growth is robust and retail-sell out in 2025 delivered modest growth. The opportunity ahead is substantial. Dominic and his team have the Board's full support during this transition year and I am excited to see him unlock significant underappreciated value in Nomad Foods for shareholders.\"</p><p><b><i>Fourth Quarter of 2025 results compared to the Fourth Quarter of 2024</i></b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li><b>Revenue</b> decreased <percent>2.6%</percent> to <money>€773 million</money>. <b>Organic revenue</b> decrease of <percent>1.3%</percent> was driven by a <percent>0.2%</percent> price/mix decline and by <percent>1.1%</percent> volume decline.</li><li><b>Adjusted gross profit </b>decreased <percent>11%</percent> to <money>€202 million</money>.

In addition, we exclude other adjustments such as the impact of share based payment expenses and related employer payroll taxes, and non-operating M&amp;A related costs, because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs, can vary significantly in amount and frequency, and are unrelated to our underlying operating performance. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA provides important comparability of underlying operating results, allowing investors and management to assess operating performance on a consistent basis.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to profit/(loss) for the period, determined in accordance with IFRS, as an indicator of the Company's operating performance.</p><p>Adjusted Profit for the period is defined as profit for the period excluding, when they occur, the impacts of exited markets, acquisition purchase price adjustments and exceptional items such as restructuring charges, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, net financing income/(cost) on amendment of terms of debt, interest cost on tax relating to legacy tax audits, foreign exchange translation gains/(losses), foreign exchange gains/(losses) on derivatives, as well as certain other items considered unusual or non-recurring in nature. In addition, we exclude other adjustments such as the impact of share based payment expenses and related employer payroll taxes, and non-operating M&amp;A related costs, because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs, can vary significantly in amount and frequency, and are unrelated to our underlying operating performance. The Company believes Adjusted Profit for the period provides important comparability of underlying operating results, allowing investors and management to assess operating performance on a consistent basis.</p><p>Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share excluding, when they occur, the impacts of exited markets, acquisition purchase price adjustments and exceptional items such as restructuring charges, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, net financing income/(cost) on amendment of terms of debt, interest cost on tax relating to legacy tax audits, foreign exchange translation gains/(losses), foreign exchange gains/(losses) on derivatives, certain one-time credits on the recognition of deferred tax assets, as well as certain other items considered unusual or non-recurring in nature. In addition, we exclude other adjustments such as the impact of share based payment expenses and related employer payroll taxes, and non-operating M&amp;A related costs, because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs, can vary significantly in amount and frequency, and are unrelated to our underlying operating performance. The Company believes Adjusted EPS provides important comparability of underlying operating results, allowing investors and management to assess operating performance on a consistent basis.</p><p>Organic revenue growth/(decline) is an adjusted measurement of our operating results. The comparison for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2025 and 2024 presented in this press release takes into consideration only those activities that were in effect during both time periods. Organic revenue growth/(decline) reflects reported revenue adjusted for currency translation and non-comparable trading items such as expansion, acquisitions, disposals, closures, trading day impacts or any other event that artificially impacts the comparability of our results period over period.</p><p>Adjusted Gross Profit and adjusted gross margin exclude accelerated depreciation associated with restructuring programs within cost of goods sold.</p><p>Adjustments for currency translation are calculated by translating data of the current and comparative periods using a budget foreign exchange rate that is set once a year as part of the Company's internal annual forecast process.</p><p>Adjusted Free Cash Flow is the amount of cash generated from operating activities less cash flows related to exceptional items (as described above), non-operating M&amp;A related costs and working capital movements on employer taxes associated with share based payment awards, plus capital expenditure (on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets), net interest paid, proceeds/(payments) on settlement of derivatives where hedge accounting is not applied and payments of lease liabilities. Adjusted free cash flow reflects cash flows that could be used for payment of dividends, repayment of debt or to fund acquisitions or other strategic objectives.</p><p>Cash flow conversion is Adjusted Free Cash Flow as a percentage of Adjusted Profit for the period.</p><p>Adjusted and Organic non-IFRS financial information should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements of Nomad Foods included in this press release as well as the historical financial statements of the Company previously filed with the SEC.</p><p>Nomad Foods believe its non-IFRS financial measures provide an important additional measure with which to monitor and evaluate the Company's ongoing financial results, as well as to reflect its acquisitions. Nomad Foods' calculation of these financial measures may be different from the calculations used by other companies and comparability may therefore be limited. The Adjusted and Organic financial information presented herein is based upon certain assumptions that Nomad Foods believes to be reasonable and is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of any anticipated financial position or future results of operations that the Company will experience. You should not consider the Company's non-IFRS financial measures an alternative or substitute for the Company's reported results and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these results and information as they may not be representative of our actual or future results as a Company.</p><p>Please see on pages 9 to 18, the non-IFRS reconciliation tables attached hereto and the schedules accompanying this release for an explanation and reconciliation of the Adjusted and Organic financial information to the most directly comparable IFRS measure. The Company is unable to reconcile, without unreasonable efforts, Organic Growth, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS guidance to the most directly comparable IFRS measure.</p><div><table border=\"0\"

(NASDAQ: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/DNUT/\" title=\"View DNUT stock overview\">DNUT</a>) (“Krispy Kreme”, “KKI”, or the “Company”) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 28, 2025.</p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">Fourth Quarter Highlights <i>(vs Q4 2024)</i></span></b></p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Net revenue of <money><money>$392.4 million</money></money></li><li>Organic revenue decreased <percent>3.9%</percent>, reflecting the strategic closure of underperforming doors</li><li>GAAP net loss of <money><money>$29.1 million</money></money></li><li>Adjusted EBITDA of <money><money>$55.6 million</money></money></li><li>Cash provided by operating activities of <money><money>$45.0 million</money></money>, free cash flow of <money><money>$27.9 million</money></money></li></ul><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">Full Year Highlights <i>(vs FY 2024)</i></span></b></p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Net revenue of <money><money>$1,522.6 million</money></money></li><li>Systemwide Sales of <money><money>$1.96 billion</money></money>, up <percent>0.7%</percent> in constant currency</li><li>Organic revenue decreased <percent>1.3%</percent></li><li>GAAP net loss of <money><money>$523.8 million</money></money></li><li>Adjusted EBITDA of <money><money>$140.3 million</money></money></li><li>Cash provided by operating activities of <money><money>$33.9 million</money></money>, free cash flow of <money><money>$(64.0) million</money></money></li><li>Global Points of Access decreased 2,363, or <percent>13.5%</percent> to 15,194 reflecting the strategic closure of underperforming doors</li></ul><p>“During the fourth quarter, we demonstrated meaningful progress on our turnaround, unlocking strong consumer demand for Krispy Kreme’s iconic, fresh doughnuts through our two biggest opportunities: profitable <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> expansion and capital-light international franchise growth. Although our decision to exit underperforming <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> doors resulted in a modest decline in net revenue, we expanded adjusted EBITDA margin 280 basis points year-over-year. In addition, we reduced our financial leverage quarter-over-quarter, delivered positive free cash flow, and secured a strategic refranchising agreement for our operations in Japan.”</p><p>“We are pleased to have ended 2025 with positive momentum, driven by quality growth in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> with key strategic partners, higher digital sales, and international expansion. In 2026, we look forward to building on this momentum through systemwide sales growth, additional refranchising activity, disciplined capital expenditures, lower net leverage, and positive free cash flow generation,” said Krispy Kreme CEO Josh Charlesworth.</p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">Turnaround Plan</span></b></p><p>The Company’s comprehensive turnaround plan is designed to deleverage the

Forward-looking statements can be identified by use of forward-looking terminology, including terms such as “plan,” “believe,” “may,” “continue,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “could,” “will,” “should,” “would,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “objective,” “seek,” “pursue,” “strive,” “look forward,” or the negatives of these words, comparable terminology, or other references to future periods; however, statements may be forward-looking whether or not these terms or their negatives are used. Forward-looking statements are not a representation by us that the future plans, estimates, or expectations contemplated by us will be achieved. Our actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements included in this press release. We consider the assumptions and estimates on which forward-looking statements are based to be reasonable, but they are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to our operations, financial results, financial conditions, business, prospects, future plans and strategies, projections, liquidity, the economy, and other future conditions. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements including, without limitation: food safety issues, including risks of food-borne illnesses, tampering, contamination, and cross-contamination; impacts from any material failure, inadequacy, or interruption of our information technology systems, including breaches or failures of such systems or other cybersecurity or data security-related incidents;</i> <i>our ability to execute our business strategy, including our turnaround plan and growth through international development with strategic partners and profitable expansion of our fresh delivery and digital channels; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from past or potential future strategic transactions (including refranchising); failure by our franchisees, subfranchisees, or third-party service providers to operate effectively and in compliance with our standards and applicable law; any harm to our reputation or brand image; negative impacts on our business due to changes in consumer spending habits, consumer preferences, or demographic trends;</i> <i>our ability to open new and maintain existing shops and points of access both domestically and internationally; disruptions to our and our franchisees’ supply chain, including the loss of or failure to perform by single-source or limited suppliers, vendors, distributors, or manufacturers; our significant indebtedness and our ability to meet the financial and other covenants under our credit facilities; changes in the cost of raw materials and other commodities, including due to import and export requirements (including tariffs), inflation, or foreign exchange rates; our ability to recruit and retain key personnel; adverse regulatory actions or publicity concerning food or occupational safety, food quality, health, and other issues or regulatory investigations, enforcement actions, or material litigation; and other risks and uncertainties described under the heading “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and in other filings the Company makes from time to time with the SEC.

These non-GAAP and operating measures include organic revenue (decline)/growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Net Income/(Loss), Diluted, Adjusted EPS, Free Cash Flow, Net Debt, Fresh Revenue from Hubs with Spokes, Sales per Hub and Systemwide Sales. We believe these non-GAAP and operating measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. Management believes these measures are important indicators of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of our core operating results and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying business, and they are consistent with how business performance is planned, reported and assessed internally by management and the Company’s Board of Directors. We monitor the key business metrics and non-GAAP metrics set forth herein to help us evaluate our business and growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. These non-GAAP and operating measures are not standardized, and it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Other companies may calculate similarly titled financial measures differently than we do or may not calculate them at all. Additionally, the non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP or a substitute for results reported under GAAP. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, we urge you to review our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed with the SEC and not to rely on any single financial measure.</p><p>See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.</p><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl bwwidth100\"><tr><td class=\"bwpadl0 bwalignc\"

expense, net, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization, with further adjustments for share-based compensation, certain strategic initiatives, acquisition and integration expenses, and certain other non-recurring, infrequent or non-core income and expense items. Adjusted EBITDA, both on a consolidated and at the segment level, is a principal metric that management uses to monitor and evaluate operating performance and provides a consistent benchmark for comparison across reporting periods. “Adjusted EBITDA margin” reflects Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenues.</p><p>We define “Adjusted EBIT” as earnings before interest expense, net and income tax expense, with further adjustments for share-based compensation, certain strategic initiatives, acquisition and integration expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and certain other non-recurring, infrequent or non-core income and expense items. Adjusted EBIT is a metric complementary to Adjusted EBITDA that takes into account depreciation expense and amortization of right of use assets, allowing management to have a view of performance when including amortized costs from capital investments and lease obligations.</p><p>We define “Adjusted Net Income/(Loss), Diluted” as net (loss)/income attributable to common shareholders, adjusted for interest expense, share-based compensation, certain strategic initiatives, acquisition and integration expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, the tax impact of adjustments, and certain other non-recurring, infrequent or non-core income and expense items. “Adjusted EPS” is Adjusted Net Income/(Loss), Diluted converted to a per share amount.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Net Income/(Loss), Diluted, and Adjusted EPS have certain limitations, including adjustments for income and expense items that are required by GAAP. In evaluating these non-GAAP measures, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation, such as share-based compensation. Our presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results in addition to using these non-GAAP measures supplementally.</p><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb

foreign currency, and we believe it is useful for investors to understand the expansion of our global footprint through internal efforts. We define “organic revenue (decline)/growth” as the (decline)/growth in revenues, excluding (i) the impact of revenues of acquired shops owned by us for less than 12 months following their acquisition, (ii) the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, (iii) the impact of shop closures related to restructuring programs, (iv) the impact of the divestiture of a controlling interest in Insomnia Cookies, (v) the impact of the divestiture of shops through refranchising, and (vi) the impact of revenues generated during the 53<sup>rd </sup>week for those fiscal years that have a 53<sup>rd</sup> week based on our fiscal calendar.</p><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl bwwidth100\"><tr><td class=\"bwvertalignb bwpadl0 bwwidth49\" colspan=\"1\"

Adjusted gross loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and depreciation, was <money>$49.1 million</money>.</li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Net loss attributable to shareholders totaled <money>$120.5 million</money>. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted EBITDA loss was <money>$71.5 million</money> compared to <money>$44.6 million</money> in the prior year period, a 492-point margin improvement, reflecting stronger operational performance.</li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Total cash of <money>$624.6 million</money>, including restricted cash, as of December 31, 2025.</li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Order backlog totaled <money>$701.5 million</money>, representing 2.8 GWh, up <percent>9%</percent> sequential quarter, reflecting strong commercial momentum and growing demand.</li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Commercial opportunity pipeline of <money>$23.6 billion</money>, a <percent>4%</percent> increase compared to prior quarter and <percent>64%</percent> increase compared to December 31, 2024.<br/><br/></li></ul> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Full Year 2025 Highlights</strong></p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Revenue of <money>$114.2 million</money>, more than 7x 2024, driven by scaled production of the company’s first generation highly automated manufacturing process and a <percent>609%</percent> increase in customer deliveries.</li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Gross loss of <money>$143.8 million</money>, improving margins by 408 points, as manufacturing volumes increased and Z3 production costs declined. Adjusted gross loss was <money>$128.5 million</money>.</li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Net loss attributable to shareholders of <money>$969.6 million</money>, driven primarily by <money>$746.8 million</money> or <percent>77%</percent> non-cash items related to fair value accounting, capital structure optimization, and other items such as stock-based compensation and depreciation.</li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Adjusted EBITDA loss of <money>$219.1 million</money>, compared to <money>$156.6 million</money> in 2024, an 812-point margin improvement, driven by ongoing operational efficiencies, leverage, and cost reductions.<br/><br/></li></ul> <p align=\"justify\">“2025 was a structural turning point for Eos. We accelerated production, expanded annual capacity to 2 GWh, delivered record quarterly revenue, strengthened our cash position to over <money>$600 million</money>, and secured more than <money>$240 million</money> in fourth quarter bookings across diversified markets,” said Joe Mastrangelo, Eos Chief Executive Officer. “While disappointed in not meeting revenue expectations, execution improved significantly as 2025 progressed, and we exited the year with clear operational momentum.”</p> <p align=\"justify\">Mastrangelo continued, “In 2026, our focus is on disciplined scale and margin improvement — driving manufacturing efficiency, improving unit economics quarter-over-quarter, and converting our backlog into high-quality revenue. With a strengthened balance sheet and improving cost profile, we believe we are positioned to transition from accelerated growth to sustainable value creation.”</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>2026 Outlook</strong></p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">For the full year 2026, Eos expects to achieve revenue between <money>$300 million</money> and <money>$400 million</money>.<br/><br/></li></ul> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Recent Business Highlights</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Record Operational Performance</strong><br/>Eos exited 2025 with 2 GWh of annualized production capacity achieved through continued automation, subassembly integration, and manufacturing process optimization. Although the capacity milestone was reached 5 weeks later than initially planned, the Company accelerated operational execution throughout the second half of the year, achieving production records across all operations. While full year’s revenue was below expectations, execution accelerated significantly with record fourth quarter revenue and year-over-year shipments increasing <percent>659%</percent>.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Indensity<sup><strong>™</strong></sup></strong><strong> Launch </strong><br/>The Company continued to advance its technology and market positioning with the launch of Eos Indensity™, a next-generation stackable energy storage architecture engineered to deliver up to 1 GWh of storage per acre, or roughly four times the density of many incumbent battery technologies. Indensity applies Spatial Intelligence configurations to provide both horizontal and vertical site layouts, enhancing site flexibility, safety, and adaptability to meeting diverse load profiles. On an installed $/kWh basis, Indensity is designed to be cost competitive with incumbent storage technologies while delivering long-duration performance and non-flammable chemistry advantages.</p> <p><strong>Commercial Growth</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">In 2025, Eos continued to build momentum, laying the groundwork and establishing strategic commercial relationships with leading entities across the energy, infrastructure, and hyperscale sectors. The Company ended the year with a backlog of <money>$701.5 million</money>, booking over <money>$240 million</money> in new orders in the fourth quarter across 8 customers and 9 projects representing nearly 1.1 GWh of contracted volume. Demand was broad based across commercial and industrial, distributed generation portfolios, and large front of the meter utility scale projects. The <percent>9%</percent> increase from the end of the third quarter includes shipments, new order bookings, and backlog adjustments.</p> <p><strong>Strengthened Balance Sheet </strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">In the fourth quarter, the Company significantly strengthened its liquidity and capital structure through the completion of a convertible senior notes offering and a concurrent registered direct common stock offering, generating approximately <money>$580.5 million</money> and <money>$458.2 million</money> in proceeds.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Key outcomes: </strong></p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Retired <money>$200 million</money> of the 2030 convertible notes</li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Reduced annual interest expense by approximately <money>$3 million</money></li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Added approximately <money>$474 million</money> of new net cash</li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Extended all corporate debt maturities to 2030 and beyond<br/><br/></li></ul> <p align=\"justify\">Given the Company’s current cash position and ongoing margin improvements, management has concluded that substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern no longer exists.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Earnings Conference Call and Webcast</strong><br/>Eos will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2025 results on February 26, 2026, at 8:30 a.m. ET.

Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our expected revenue, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2026, our path to profitability and strategic outlook, statements regarding orders backlog and opportunity pipeline, statements regarding our expectation that we can continue to increase product volume on our state-of-the-art manufacturing line, statements regarding our future expansion and its impact on our ability to scale up operations and increase margins, statements regarding the expected impact of DawnOS<sup>TM</sup> on efficiency operating costs, and grid-coordination, statements regarding the launch of Indensity<sup>TM</sup> and our expectations for the architecture and its expected energy density, statements regarding our expectation that we can continue to strengthen our overall supply chain, statements that refer to outlook, projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions. The words \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intends,\" \"may,\" \"might,\" \"plan,\" \"possible,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"should,\" \"would\" and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based on our management’s beliefs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, them. Because such statements are based on expectations as to future financial and operating results and are not statements of fact, actual results may differ materially from those projected.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Factors which may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: changes adversely affecting the business in which we are engaged; our ability to forecast trends accurately; our ability to generate cash, service indebtedness and incur additional indebtedness; our ability to raise financing in the future; risks associated with the credit agreement with Cerberus, including risks of default, and dilution of outstanding common stock; consequences for failure to meet milestones and contractual lockup of shares; our customers’ ability to secure project financing; the amount of final tax credits available to our customers or to Eos pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act, including potential impacts from any repeal or modifications of the legislation; the timing and availability of future funding under the Department of Energy Loan Facility; our ability to continue to develop efficient manufacturing processes to scale and to forecast related costs and efficiencies accurately; fluctuations in our revenue and operating results; competition from existing or new competitors; our ability to convert firm order backlog and pipeline to revenue; risks associated with security breaches in our information technology systems; risks related to legal proceedings or claims; risks associated with evolving energy policies in the United States and other countries and the potential costs of regulatory compliance; risks associated with changes to the U.S. trade environment; our ability to maintain the listing of our shares of common stock on NASDAQ; our ability to grow our business and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with customers and suppliers and retain our management and key employees; risks related to adverse changes in general economic conditions, including inflationary pressures and increased interest rates; risk from supply chain disruptions and other impacts of geopolitical conflict; changes in applicable laws or regulations; the possibility that Eos may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; other factors beyond our control; and other risks and uncertainties.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are also subject to additional risks, uncertainties, and factors, including those more fully described in the Company’s most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Further information on potential risks that could affect actual results will be included in the subsequent periodic and current reports and other filings that the Company makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. Moreover, the Company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, and new risks and uncertainties may emerge that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this press release.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and, except as required by law, the Company assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Key Metrics</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Backlog</strong>. Our backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to realize from existing agreements with our customers for the sale of our battery energy storage systems and performance of services. The backlog is calculated by adding new orders in the current fiscal period to the backlog as of the end of the prior fiscal period and then subtracting the shipments in the current fiscal period. If the amount of an order is modified or cancelled, we adjust orders in the current period and our backlog accordingly, but do not retroactively adjust previously published backlogs. There is no comparable US-GAAP financial measure to backlog. We believe that the backlog is a useful indicator regarding the future revenue of our Company.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Pipeline</strong>. Our pipeline represents projects for which we have submitted technical proposals or non-binding quotes plus letters of intent (“LOI”) or firm commitments from customers. Pipeline does not include lead generation projects.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Booked Orders</strong>. Booked orders are orders where we have legally binding agreements with a Purchase Order (“PO”), or Master Supply Agreement (“MSA”) executed by both parties.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed in this earnings release non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit (loss), and adjusted EPS, which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the SEC. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures of the Company’s calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company believes adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit (loss), and adjusted EPS are useful measures in evaluating its financial and operational performance distinct and apart from financing costs, certain non-cash expenses and non-operational expenses.</p> <p align=\"justify\">We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively may be helpful to our investors in assessing its operating performance. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures and their nearest GAAP equivalents. For example, the Company’s definitions of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Below is a description of the non-GAAP financial information included herein as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. You should review the reconciliations below but not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (net loss) attributable to Eos adjusted for interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of debt and derivatives, debt extinguishment, and other non-cash or non-recurring items as determined by management which it does not believe to be indicative of its underlying business trends. Adjusted gross profit (loss) is defined as gross profit (loss) adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EPS is defined as GAAP net loss per common share as adjusted for non-cash stock-based compensation expense change in fair value of debt and derivatives and debt extinguishment per common share.</p> <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p> </p> <p>Thursday, February 26, 2026</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Dear Shareholders and Investors,</strong></p> <p>Ninety day periods offer a short-term snapshot. A more meaningful analysis must contain a longer-term picture. The direction of <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/NAT/\" title=\"View NAT stock overview\">NAT</a> is up. A few days ago, we entered into a 1-year fixed contract with an oil major, giving us more than <money>$50,000</money> per day. </p> <p><strong>Highlights:  <br/></strong>         </p> <ol><li>The dividend for the fourth quarter 2025 is 17 cents (<money>$0.17)</money> per share. This is our 114th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The dividend is payable March 24, 2026, to shareholders on record as of March 10, 2026.</li></ol> <p> </p> <ol><li value=\"2\">The market is very solid for our ships. Nearly two-thirds of our spot days in 1Q26 have been booked at about <money>$55,000</money> per day. At this stage we are booking ships well into 2Q26, which bodes well. The long-term outlook for our fleet of tankers is bright. The striking scarcity of compliant ships has become obvious as pressure on the so-called shadow fleet has intensified.</li></ol> <p> </p> <ol><li value=\"3\">Our fourth quarter result for 2025 was the best quarter of the year and the average time charter equivalent (TCE) for our fleet came in at <money>$35,000</money> per day per ship, up <percent>25%</percent> from the previous quarter. Our operating costs are about <money>$9,000</money>/day/ship. The net result for the fourth quarter 2025 came in at <money>$11.7 million</money> and the EBITDA was <money>$34.7 million</money>. Our cash position at the day of this report is above <money>$100 million</money>. </li></ol> <p> </p> <ol><li value=\"4\">During the first half of 2025, we acquired two 2016-built suezmax tankers. During the second half of 2025 we also entered into an agreement with a South-Korean shipyard to build two vessels for delivery in 2028 (the signing took place in January 2026). </li></ol> <p> </p> <ol><li value=\"5\">During the 2025 calendar year we also took advantage of the increasing asset prices and sold four of our vessels built between 2003 and 2005. The two latest vessels were delivered to the buyers in January 2026. In the first quarter of 2026, we also sold a 2003-built ship which is soon to be delivered to the buyers.</li></ol> <p> </p> <ol><li value=\"6\">The top quality of the <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/NAT/\" title=\"View NAT stock overview\">NAT</a> vessels is reflected in the vetting performance (the score card) undertaken by the major oil companies. Major oil companies charter about <percent>50%</percent> of our vessels. As per December 31, 2025, the <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/NAT/\" title=\"View NAT stock overview\">NAT</a> fleet consist of 20 vessels. We expect to grow our fleet in the time to come. </li></ol> <p> </p> <ol><li value=\"7\">Thanks to careful voyage planning and adjustment of speed of our ships, we reduce emissions. </li></ol> <p><br/>  </p> <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>Herbjorn Hansson<br/>Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO</p> <p>Nordic American Tankers Ltd.                                                        <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=eHV4rz3zH7cvF5-viEhdqBD_Yxh1Fuo9agKSE1POS1h9tMhery2x_kNKdrFHARLrHBSLBnF7YRtLOtDuVKtPAA==\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.nat.bm</a></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p align=\"center\"><strong> CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS</strong></p> <p>Matters discussed in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements.

The words “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “plan,” “potential,” “will,” “may,” “should,” “expect,” “pending” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.</p> <p>The forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including without limitation, our management’s examination of historical operating trends, data contained in our records and other data available from third parties. Although we believe that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond our control, we cannot assure you that we will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.</p> <p>Important factors that, in our view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include the strength of world economies and currencies, general market conditions, including fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values, changes in demand in the tanker market, as a result of changes in OPEC’s petroleum production levels and worldwide oil consumption and storage, changes in our operating expenses, including bunker prices, drydocking and insurance costs, the market for our vessels, availability of financing and refinancing, changes in governmental rules and regulations or actions taken by regulatory authorities, potential liability from pending or future litigation, general domestic and international political conditions, potential disruption of shipping routes due to accidents or political events, vessels breakdowns and instances of off-hires and other important factors described from time to time in the reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the prospectus and related prospectus supplement, our Annual Report on Form 20-F, and our reports on Form 6-K.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Contacts:  </strong>     </p> <p>Bjørn Giæver, CFO                                                             <br/>Nordic American Tankers Ltd                                             <br/>Tel: +1 888 755 8391                                  </p> <p>Alexander Kihle, Finance Manager<br/>Nordic American Tankers Ltd<br/>Tel: +47 91 724 171    </p> <p><br/> </p> <p id=\"gnw_attachments_section-header\"><strong>Attachment</strong></p><ul id=\"gnw_attachments_section-items\"><li><a href=\"https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/3d8d217e-2eb3-411d-bbf2-bec7a827b24a\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NAT 4Q2025 report</a></li></ul><img alt=\"\" class=\"__GNW8366DE3E__IMG\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=MTAwMTE2NjkyMyM0MDIzNDkxMTkjMjA4Mzk1Mg==\"/> <br/><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\" src=\"https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/media/MTMzMDExZGMtN2JmNy00ODcxLTk5YjAtYzg3YzhiZWE4MDAzLTEwOTU1MjMtMjAyNi0wMi0yNi1lbg==/tiny/Nordic-American-Tankers-Limite.png\"/></article>",

Despite soft category consumption and a challenging Infant Formula end-market, we gained share across store brands and in key brands as our team executed with discipline. These results reinforce the strength of our consumer-preferred portfolio, deep retail partnerships and sharpened focus on everyday consumer health. Our 'Three–S plan' is delivering meaningful progress in stabilizing our business, streamlining our complexity and strengthening what is working, supported by cost savings program benefits and the implementation of our new commercial operating model.\"</p><p>\"Looking ahead, we are prioritizing resources and investments towards CORE Perrigo, our go-forward business, which excludes the Infant Formula business under strategic review, and previously announced divestitures. Our 2026 outlook reflects near-term headwinds, balanced by favorable mix in our base business, disciplined execution of our new operational enhancement program and targeted cost actions to align our structure with current market realities. We are confident that our disciplined approach is enabling us to navigate the transition year ahead and positions Perrigo to create long-term value for our shareholders,\" concluded Lockwood-Taylor.</p><p>Refer to Tables I through VII at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjustments to the current year and prior year periods and additional non-GAAP information. The Company's reported results are included in the attached Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Balance Sheets and Statements of Cash Flows.</p><p><u><b>Concluding Project Energize</b></u></p><p>Project Energize, a global investment and efficiency program launched during the first quarter of 2024, delivered gross annualized pre-tax savings of approximately <money><money>$167 million</money></money> as of the end of FY2025, towards the high-end of the Company's estimated range of <money>$140 million</money> to <money>$170 million</money>.</p><p>Reinvestments of savings of <money><money>$35 million</money></money> over the same period are within the Company's estimated range of <money><money>$30 million</money></money> to <money><money>$40 million</money></money>. Restructuring charges incurred by the Company over the same period in connection with Project Energize were approximately <money><money>$138 million</money></money>. As the program has substantively finalized, the Company anticipates less than <money><money>$10 million</money></money> of costs to be incurred through FY2026.</p><p><u><b>Concluding Supply Chain Reinvention Program</b></u></p><p>The Company initiated a Supply Chain Reinvention Program in 2022 to reduce structural costs, improve profitability and service levels to retail partners, and strengthen Perrigo's resiliency by streamlining and simplifying the Company's global supply chain. The program was successfully completed and achieved cumulative annual run-rate benefits of <money><money>$157 million</money></money> in the fourth quarter of 2025, in the range of estimated program benefits of <money><money>$150 million</money></money> to <money><money>$200 million</money></money> (not including related depreciation expense on capital investments). Total costs incurred over the same period including capital investments, restructuring expenses and implementation costs were <money><money>$286 million</money></money>, below the estimated range of <money><money>$300 million</money></money> to <money><money>$350 million</money></money> originally expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal year 2028, with the substantial portion of the costs incurred by the end of FY2025. As the program has completed, the Company anticipates less than <money><money>$10 million</money></money> of costs to be incurred through FY2026.</p><p><u><b>Agreement to Divest Dermacosmetics Business</b></u></p><p>On July 14, 2025, the Company announced it signed an agreement to sell the Company's Dermacosmetics branded business for up to <money>€327 million</money>, including <money>€300 million</money> in upfront cash and up to an additional <money>€27 million</money> contingent on the achievement of net sales milestones over the next three years. The Company anticipates this transaction closing in the second quarter of 2026, subject to customary closing conditions.</p><p><u><b>Goodwill Impairment</b></u></p><p>During the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company's reporting units had an indication of potential impairment due to a sustained decrease in share price, lower expected cash flows principally related to infant formula market dynamics and a change in near-term expectations of the broader self-care market. As such, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment of <money><money>$1.3 billion</money></money> as of December 31, 2025.</p><p>The Company is also required to reallocate goodwill from its existing reporting units to the new reporting units (see 'New Reporting Segments Beginning First Quarter 2026' below for details). While the total estimated fair and carrying values are unchanged from December 31, 2025, the redistribution of goodwill across the Company's new reporting units may cause the Company to record additional non–cash goodwill impairment charges of up to <money><money>$350 million</money></money> in the first quarter of 2026.</p><p><u><b>Perrigo Fourth Quarter 2025 Results from Continuing Operations</b></u></p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"prnbcc\"><tr><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"6\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Fourth Quarter 2025 Net Sales Change Compared to Prior Year</b><sup><b>(5)</b></sup></span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen4\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><br/></td><td class=\"prngen5\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml10\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Reported <br/>Net Sales <br/>Growth</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml20\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Foreign <br/>Exchange <br/>Impact</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml10\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Constant <br/>Currency Net <br/>Sales</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml6\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Divestitures &amp; <br/>Exited <br/>Products</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml10\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Organic <br/>Net Sales <br/>Growth</b></span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>CSCA</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen6\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">(6.3) %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">— %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">(6.3) %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">— %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">(6.3) %</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen8\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>CSCI</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">4.7 %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">6.8 %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">(2.1) %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">(1.1) %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">(1.0) %</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen9\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Total Perrigo</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen10\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>(2.5) %</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen10\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>2.3 %</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen10\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>(4.9) %</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen10\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>(0.4) %</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen10\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>(4.5) %</b></span></p></td></tr></table></div><p>Net sales of <money><money>$1.11 billion</money></money> decreased <percent>2.5%</percent>, or <money><money>$29 million</money></money>, including favorable currency translation of <percent>2.3%</percent> and divestitures and exited products of -<percent>0.4%</percent>.

We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. While we believe these expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, including: our ability to complete the proposed divestment of the Dermacosmetics branded business, receipt of works council and regulatory approval regarding the transaction, performance by counterparties to the transaction and the likelihood of satisfying the deferred payment milestones associated with the transaction, supply chain impacts on our business, including those caused or exacerbated by armed conflict, trade and other economic sanctions and/or disease; general economic, credit, and market conditions; increased or new tariffs by the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> or foreign governments (and any retaliatory or reciprocal tariffs) and changes in global trade relations; the impact of the war in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ua\">Ukraine</location> and any escalation thereof, including the effects of economic and political sanctions imposed by <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">United Kingdom</location>, European Union, and other countries related thereto; the outbreak or escalation of conflict in other regions where we do business, including the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/mde\">Middle East</location>; current and future impairment charges, if we determine that the carrying amount of specific assets may not be recoverable from the expected future cash flows of such assets; customer acceptance of new products; competition from other industry participants, some of whom have greater marketing resources or larger market shares in certain product categories than we do; pricing pressures from customers and consumers; resolution of uncertain tax positions and any litigation relating thereto, ongoing or future government investigations and regulatory initiatives; uncertainty regarding our ability to obtain and maintain our regulatory approvals; potential costs and reputational impact of product recalls or sales halts; potential adverse changes to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> and foreign tax, healthcare and other government policy; the effect of epidemic or pandemic disease; the timing, amount and cost of any share repurchases (or the absence thereof) and/or any refinancing of outstanding debt at or prior to maturity; fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates; receipt of potential earnout payments in connection with the sale of the HRA Rare Diseases Business and the risk that potential costs or liabilities incurred or retained in connection with this transaction may exceed our estimates or adversely affect our business or operations; the risk that potential costs or liabilities incurred or retained in connection with the sale of our Rx business may exceed our estimates or adversely affect our business or operations; the consummation and success of other announced and unannounced acquisitions or dispositions, and our ability to realize the desired benefits thereof; and our ability to execute and achieve the desired benefits of announced cost-reduction efforts and other strategic initiatives and investments, including our ability to achieve the expected benefits from our ongoing restructuring programs described herein. Adverse results with respect to pending litigation could have a material adverse impact on our operating results, cash flows and liquidity, and could ultimately require the use of corporate assets to pay damages, reducing assets that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. These and other important factors, including those discussed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025, and in any subsequent filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release are made only as of the date hereof, and unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.</p><p><u><b>Non-GAAP Measures</b></u></p><p>This press release contains certain non-GAAP measures. A \"non-GAAP financial measure\" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the statements of operations, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the Company. Pursuant to the requirements of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company has provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> GAAP measures for the following non-GAAP financial measures referred to in this press release:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>net sales growth on an organic basis, which excludes acquisitions, divestitures and exited products, and the impact of currency,</li><li>adjusted gross profit,</li><li>adjusted gross margin,</li><li>adjusted operating income,</li><li>adjusted operating margin,</li><li>adjusted net income,</li><li>adjusted diluted earnings per share,</li></ul><p>These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to the GAAP reported measures, should not be considered replacements for, or superior to the GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies. The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures in order to provide transparency to our investors because they are measures that management uses to assess both management performance and the financial performance of our operations and to allocate resources. In addition, management believes that these measures may assist investors with understanding and evaluating our initiatives to drive improved financial performance and enables investors to supplementally compare our operating performance with the operating performance of our competitors including with those of our competitors having different capital structures. While we have excluded certain of these items from historical non-GAAP financial measures, there is no guarantee that the items excluded from non-GAAP financial measures will not continue into future periods. For instance, we expect to continue to experience and report restructuring-related charges associated with continued execution of our strategic initiatives.</p><p>The Company provides non-GAAP financial measures as additional information that it believes is useful to investors and analysts in evaluating the performance of the Company's ongoing operating trends, facilitating comparability between periods and, where applicable, with companies in similar industries and assessing the Company's prospects for future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items, such as amortization expense, unusual litigation, impairment charges, restructuring charges, and acquisition and integration-related charges, that by their nature affect comparability of operational performance or that we believe obscure underlying business operational trends. The intangible asset amortization excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures represents the entire amount recorded within the Company's GAAP financial statements and is excluded because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. The non-GAAP measures the Company provides are consistent with how management analyzes and assesses the operating performance of the Company, and disclosing them provides investor insight into management's view of the business. Management uses these adjusted financial measures for planning and forecasting in future periods, and evaluating segment and overall operating performance. In addition, management uses certain of the profit measures as factors in determining compensation.</p><p>Non-GAAP measures related to profit measurements, which may include adjusted gross profit, adjusted net income, adjusted operating income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted gross margin, constant currency net sales, and adjusted operating margin are useful to investors as they provide them with supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company's underlying business performance and trends, and enhance the ability of investors and analysts to compare the Company's period-to-period financial results. Management believes that adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin are useful to investors, in addition to the reasons discussed above, by allowing them to more easily compare and analyze trends in the Company's peer business group and assisting them in comparing the Company's overall performance to that of its competitors. The Company also discloses net sales growth excluding the impact of currency on an organic basis. In addition, the Company presents non–GAAP measures for 'CORE' Perrigo, reflecting its go–forward business and excluding infant formula currently under strategic review and previously announced divestitures. CORE measures may include CORE net income, CORE net sales, CORE organic net sales, CORE gross profit, CORE operating income, CORE diluted earnings per share, CORE gross margin, and CORE operating margin, including on an organic, constant–currency basis. Management believes these measures provide greater consistency in financial reporting and facilitate meaningful comparisons of underlying operating results and acquisition and divestiture activity.</p><p>The Company cannot reconcile its 'All In' or 'CORE' expected organic net sales growth, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate, net leverage, or adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measures under \"Fiscal Year 2026 Outlook from Continuing Operations\" without unreasonable effort because certain items that impact net income and other reconciling metrics are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted at this time. These items include, but are not limited to, uncertainty of non-recurring infant formula related charges and timing and amount of restructuring charges and the income tax effects of these items or other income tax-related events.</p><p>The Company believes these supplemental financial measures provide investors with consistency in financial reporting, enabling meaningful comparisons of past and present underlying operating results, and also facilitate analysis of the Company's operating performance and acquisition and divestiture trends.</p><p>A copy of this press release, including the

</i>Net sales of <money><money>$442.1 million</money></money> decreased <percent>11.1%</percent> due primarily to lower consumption of proton pump inhibitors for heartburn, as well as the net impact

Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning Enovis’ plans, goals, objectives, outlook, expectations and intentions, and other statements that are not historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements are based on Enovis’ current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause Enovis’ results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to, risks related to Enovis’ integration of Lima; the impact of public health emergencies and global pandemics; disruptions in the global economy caused by escalating geopolitical tensions including in connection with the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East; macroeconomic conditions, including the impact of inflationary pressures; changes in government trade policies, including the implementation of tariffs; supply chain disruptions; increasing energy costs and availability concerns, particularly in the European market; other impacts on Enovis’ business and ability to execute business continuity plans; and the other factors detailed in Enovis’ reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the caption “Risk Factors,” as well as the other risks discussed in Enovis’ filings with the SEC. In addition, these statements are based on assumptions that are subject to change. This press release speaks only as of the date hereof. Enovis disclaims any duty to update the information herein.</i></p> <p align=\"left\"><b><i>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</i></b></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>Enovis has provided in this press release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“non-GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures may include one or more of the following: adjusted net income from continuing operations (“Adjusted net income”), Adjusted net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted gross profit, and Adjusted gross profit margin. </i></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per diluted share exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interest from continuing operations, net of taxes; the effect of income from discontinued operations, net of taxes; restructuring charges; Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) fees and other costs; strategic transaction costs; stock-based compensation; acquisition-related intangible asset amortization; strategic purchase of economic interest on future royalty payments; property plant and equipment step-up depreciation, and</i><i> inventory step-up</i><i>; goodwill impairment charges; Other (income) expense, net; and include the tax effect of adjusted pre-tax income at applicable tax rates and other tax adjustments. Enovis also presents Adjusted net income margin, which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted net income. </i></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted net income excluding interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Enovis presents Adjusted EBITDA margin, which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted EBITDA.</i></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>Adjusted gross profit represents gross profit excluding the fair value charges of acquired inventory, depreciation step-up of acquired fixed assets, and the impact of restructuring charges. Adjusted gross profit margin is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted gross profit.</i></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>Organic sales growth calculates sales growth period over period, after excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. </i></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>These non-GAAP financial measures assist Enovis management in comparing its operating performance over time because certain items may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult, as they are of a nature and/or size that occur with inconsistent frequency or relate to discrete restructuring plans that are fundamentally different from the ongoing productivity improvements of the Company. Enovis management also believes that presenting these measures allows investors to view its performance using the same measures that the Company uses in evaluating its financial and business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures presented above to GAAP results has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release. Enovis does not provide reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA or adjusted earnings per share on a forward-looking basis to the closest GAAP financial measures, as such information is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to uncertainties regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items excluded from these measures. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the guidance period. </i></p> <p align=\"justify\">Kyle Rose<br/>Vice President, Investor Relations<br/>Enovis Corporation<br/>+1-917-734-7450<br/><u>investorrelations@enovis.com</u></p> <p align=\"center\"><b>Enovis Corporation</b><br/><b>Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations</b><br/><b>Dollars in thousands, except per share data</b><br/><b>(Unaudited)</b></p> <table align=\"center\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

These costs are classified as Selling, general and administrative expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.<br/><sup>(</sup><sup>4</sup><sup>)</sup> In the first and second quarters of 2025, we completed strategic purchases of economic interest on future royalty payments in our intellectual property (“royalty interest”) for a fixed price of <money>$56.5 million</money>, which will be paid over nine years. We accrued a liability and recognized <money>$45.8 million</money> charge for the net present value of the purchases for the year ended December 31, 2025. <br/><sup>(</sup><sup>5</sup><sup>)</sup> Inventory step-up expense represents the incremental expense of inventory sold recognized at its fair value after business combination accounting is applied versus the expense that would have been recognized if sold at its cost to manufacture. Since only the inventory that existed at the business combination date was stepped-up to fair value, we believe excluding the incremental expense enhances comparability between periods, allowing investors to better understand our business performance and the underlying trends relevant to our ongoing business performance.</p> <p align=\"center\"><b>Enovis Corporation</b><br/><b>Reconciliation of Gross Margin (GAAP) to Adjusted Gross Margin (non-GAAP)</b><br/><b>Dollars in millions</b><br/><b>(Unaudited)</b></p> <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

The program honors organizations and technologies that demonstrate excellence, innovation and measurable market impact.</p><p>The dual Gold recognition highlights Ooma AirDial’s role in helping organizations modernize fire, life-safety, elevator, and other mission-critical communications as telecommunications carriers continue to retire legacy copper networks nationwide.</p><p>“Critical communications infrastructure is undergoing a major transition as copper lines are phased out,” said Jim Gustke, senior vice president of marketing at Ooma. “These awards continue to validate Ooma AirDial’s ability to help organizations maintain reliability, visibility and compliance while transitioning to a more modern, resilient communications architecture.”</p><p><b>Addressing a Growing Infrastructure Challenge</b></p><p>Organizations across commercial real estate, healthcare, education, government and other sectors continue to rely on analog devices originally designed for traditional Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) lines. As carriers accelerate copper retirement and support resources decline, many enterprises are facing increased risk, rising costs and reduced visibility into critical systems.</p><p>Ooma AirDial was designed to help organizations transition away from legacy copper infrastructure without requiring replacement of existing endpoint devices, enabling a more controlled and predictable modernization path.</p><p><b>Award-Winning Innovation</b></p><p>The Merit Awards judges recognized Ooma AirDial for its combination of cloud-based management, real-time operational visibility, compliance-based architecture, and resilient connectivity architecture.</p><p><b>Key capabilities include:</b></p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li><b>Remote Device Management</b> which provides centralized visibility into device status, connectivity and call activity across locations.</li><li><b>Automated alerts</b> that notify teams of emergency calls and power events.</li><li><b>Patented MultiPath™ technology</b> that simultaneously routes traffic over LTE and wired Ethernet.</li><li><b>Support for life-safety compliance requirements</b> including NFPA 72 and ASME A17.1 environments.</li></ul><p>Together, these capabilities help shift critical communications management from reactive troubleshooting to proactive monitoring and control.</p><p><b>Building on Industry Recognition</b></p><p>The Merit Awards add to a growing list of industry recognition for Ooma AirDial, now recognized as one of the most awarded POTS replacement solutions in the industry. In recent years, the solution has earned recognition from organizations including TMC, Channel Vision, UC Today, Elevator World and FacilitiesNet, reflecting continued market validation across communications and facilities management sectors.</p><p><b>Supporting the Ongoing Copper Transition</b></p><p>With copper network retirement accelerating across <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>, many organizations are now reassessing how legacy voice lines support life-safety and operational systems. Solutions that provide centralized oversight, redundancy and predictable deployment models are becoming increasingly important for multi-site enterprises and public-sector environments.</p><p>“Ooma AirDial was built specifically to help organizations navigate this transition with confidence,” Gustke added. “As the copper sunset continues, visibility and reliability are becoming mission critical for enterprise communications.”</p><p>Ooma AirDial is available today for organizations seeking to modernize legacy copper-dependent systems.

MSC-NTF cells are produced from autologous, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that have been expanded and differentiated ex vivo. MSCs are converted into MSC-NTF cells by growing them under patented conditions that induce the cells to secrete high levels of neurotrophic factors (NTFs). Autologous MSC-NTF cells are designed to effectively deliver multiple NTFs and immunomodulatory cytokines directly to the site of damage to elicit a desired biological effect and ultimately slow or stabilize disease progression.</p><p><b>About BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc</b>.              <br/>BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/BCLI/\" title=\"View BCLI stock overview\">BCLI</a>) is a leading developer of autologous adult stem cell therapies for debilitating neurodegenerative diseases. The company's proprietary NurOwn® platform uses autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to produce neurotrophic factor-secreting cells (MSC-NTF cells), designed to deliver targeted biological signals that modulate neuroinflammation and promote neuroprotection.           </p><p>NurOwn® is BrainStorm's lead investigational therapy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and has received Orphan Drug designation from both the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). A Phase 3 trial in ALS (NCT03280056) has been completed, and a second Phase 3b trial is set to launch under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreement with the FDA. The NurOwn clinical program has generated valuable insights into ALS disease biology, including pharmacogenomic response associated with the UNC13A genotype, biomarker data collected at seven longitudinal time points, and a comprehensive analysis of the \"Floor Effect\" - a critical challenge in measuring clinical outcomes in advanced ALS. BrainStorm has published its findings in multiple peer-reviewed journals. In addition to ALS, BrainStorm has completed a Phase 2 open-label multicenter trial (NCT03799718) of MSC-NTF cells in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), supported by a grant from the National MS Society. BrainStorm is also advancing a proprietary, allogeneic exosome-based platform designed to deliver therapeutic proteins and nucleic acids. The company recently received a Notice of Allowance from the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Patent and Trademark Office for a foundational patent covering its exosome technology, further strengthening BrainStorm's growing IP portfolio in this emerging area of regenerative medicine.

The Project is largely underlain by the same Triassic-Jurassic geology that hosts nearby copper-gold porphyry deposits, including those held by Centerra, by Amarc Resources, and by TDG Gold.  The NIV property displays strongly anomalous soil geochemistry (&gt;100 ppm copper, &gt;75 ppb gold, &gt;4 ppm molybdenum) over broad areas along a five kilometre long trend that are coincident with similarly strongly anomalous geophysical responses (IP (Induced Polarization) chargeability and resistivity, airborne MT (Magnetotellurics) which stretch to depths of several hundreds of metres or more. Such coincident anomalies are suggestive of the potential for a large scale porphyry copper-gold system at depth, with scale to accommodate multiple porphyry centers.  Neither the NIV nor West NIV property has been drill-tested previously.   </p><p><b>Initial Drill Program Set for June </b></p><p>The initial drill program in planning for the NIV property will be designed to test multiple porphyry Cu-Au-Mo targets along the length of the NIV property's 5 km long trend of coincident geochemical and geophysical anomalies. Each target will be tested by multiple drill holes. The initial drilling will likely consist of a total of between 4,000 and 8,000 metres. </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/xEjZMtKmxn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">CLICK HERE to View NIV Target Areas</a></p><p>Final drill site selection will be informed by ongoing compilation and interpretation of all geological, geochemical and geophysical data. Geological ground-truthing and possible additional geophysics (ground AMT surveys; completion of the West NIV airborne geophysical survey) may be conducted to further refine drill sites concurrent with initiation of the drill program.</p><p>Metal Energy intends to mobilize drill crews in June 2026, with contractors engaged and logistical planning well underway.</p><p><b>Fully Capitalized and Backed by Majors</b></p><p>The Company enters 2026 fully capitalized, with approximately <money>$10 million</money> in cash, and with the backing of two major mining companies, Centerra Gold (\"Centerra\") and Teck Resources (\"Teck\") (refer to <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/7n1ZESMAa5\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">December 17, 2025 news release</a>).

While not all of the information that the Company posts to the Enovis Investor Relations website is of a material nature, some information could be deemed to be material. Accordingly, the Company encourages investors, the media and others interested in Enovis to review the information that it shares on <u>ir.enovis.com</u>.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><b><i>Forward-Looking Statements</i></b></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>This press release includes forward-looking statements, including forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning Enovis’ plans, goals, objectives, outlook, expectations and intentions, and other statements that are not historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements are based on Enovis’ current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause Enovis’ results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to, risks related to Enovis’ integration of Lima; the impact of public health emergencies and global pandemics; disruptions in the global economy caused by escalating geopolitical tensions including in connection with the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East; macroeconomic conditions, including the impact of inflationary pressures; changes in government trade policies, including the implementation of tariffs; supply chain disruptions; increasing energy costs and availability concerns, particularly in the European market; other impacts on Enovis’ business and ability to execute business continuity plans; and the other factors detailed in Enovis’ reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the caption “Risk Factors,” as well as the other risks discussed in Enovis’ filings with the SEC. In addition, these statements are based on assumptions that are subject to change. This press release speaks only as of the date hereof. Enovis disclaims any duty to update the information herein.</i></p> <p align=\"left\"><b><i>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</i></b></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>Enovis has provided in this press release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“non-GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures may include one or more of the following: adjusted net income from continuing operations (“Adjusted net income”), Adjusted net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted gross profit, and Adjusted gross profit margin. </i></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per diluted share exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interest from continuing operations, net of taxes; the effect of income from discontinued operations, net of taxes; restructuring charges; Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) fees and other costs; strategic transaction costs; stock-based compensation; acquisition-related intangible asset amortization; strategic purchase of economic interest on future royalty payments; property plant and equipment step-up depreciation, and</i><i> inventory step-up</i><i>; goodwill impairment charges; Other (income) expense, net; and include the tax effect of adjusted pre-tax income at applicable tax rates and other tax adjustments. Enovis also presents Adjusted net income margin, which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted net income. </i></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted net income excluding interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Enovis presents Adjusted EBITDA margin, which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted EBITDA.</i></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>Adjusted gross profit represents gross profit excluding the fair value charges of acquired inventory, depreciation step-up of acquired fixed assets, and the impact of restructuring charges. Adjusted gross profit margin is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted gross profit.</i></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>Organic sales growth calculates sales growth period over period, after excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. </i></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>These non-GAAP financial measures assist Enovis management in comparing its operating performance over time because certain items may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult, as they are of a nature and/or size that occur with inconsistent frequency or relate to discrete restructuring plans that are fundamentally different from the ongoing productivity improvements of the Company. Enovis management also believes that presenting these measures allows investors to view its performance using the same measures that the Company uses in evaluating its financial and business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures presented above to GAAP results has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release. Enovis does not provide reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA or adjusted earnings per share on a forward-looking basis to the closest GAAP financial measures, as such information is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to uncertainties regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items excluded from these measures. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the guidance period. </i></p> <p align=\"justify\">Kyle Rose<br/>Vice President, Investor Relations<br/>Enovis Corporation<br/>+1-917-734-7450<br/><u>investorrelations@enovis.com</u></p> <p align=\"center\"><b>Enovis Corporation</b><br/><b>Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations</b><br/><b>Dollars in thousands, except per share data</b><br/><b>(Unaudited)</b></p> <table align=\"center\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

We accrued a liability and recognized <money>$45.8 million</money> charge for the net present value of the purchases for the year ended December 31, 2025. <br/><sup>(</sup><sup>5</sup><sup>)</sup> Inventory step-up expense represents the incremental expense of inventory sold recognized at its fair value after business combination accounting is applied versus the expense that would have been recognized if sold at its cost to manufacture. Since only the inventory that existed at the business combination date was stepped-up to fair value, we believe excluding the incremental expense enhances comparability between periods, allowing investors to better understand our business performance and the underlying trends relevant to our ongoing business performance.</p> <p align=\"center\"><b>Enovis Corporation</b><br/><b>Reconciliation of Gross Margin (GAAP) to Adjusted Gross Margin (non-GAAP)</b><br/><b>Dollars in millions</b><br/><b>(Unaudited)</b></p> <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP.

The LOI is structured in two stages: first, the Company will fund a low-cost auger drill program of up to C<money>$20,000</money> (\"Due Diligence Payment\") in order to conduct diligence (\"Initial Due Diligence\") on the Property; if the Company wishes to then proceed, it will, in consideration for the Due Diligence Payment, acquire the Option. The Initial Due Diligence program will consist of up to 10 auger drill holes designed to verify the presence of ionic clay REE mineralization and assess the character and distribution of the rare earth-bearing horizon.</p><p>\"This Patos acquisition expands our exposure to another potential ionic clay rare earth system in Brazil, a country that has seen several recent rare earth discoveries within favourable geological settings,\" commented Canamera CEO Brad Brodeur. \"We will apply a systematic exploration program to determine whether similar mineralization may be present on the Patos property in a mining friendly, relatively low cost jurisdiction.\"</p><p><b>Option Exercise - Cash and Share Consideration</b></p><p>Should Canamera acquire the Option following the completion of the Initial Due Diligence program, then such Option may be exercised by the Company making the following cash and Company share payments (\"Option Payments\") immediately following completion of the Initial Due Diligence program:</p><ul><li><p><b>Cash Consideration: </b>C<money>$228,000</money> in aggregate, comprising the C<money>$20,000</money> Due Diligence Payment and a remaining cash payment of C<money>$208,000</money>; and</p></li><li><p><b>Share Consideration: </b>Common shares of Canamera having an aggregate deemed value of C<money>$307,800</money>, issued at a price equal to the 10-day volume-weighted average price (\"VWAP\") of the Company's shares over the 10 trading days immediately prior to closing, subject to applicable Canadian securities laws and CSE approval. Fifty percent (<percent>50%</percent>) of the shares will be held in escrow for four (4) months and the remaining fifty percent (<percent>50%</percent>) for six (6) months from the date of issuance.</p></li></ul><p>Upon making the Option Payments, Canamera will acquire a <percent>100%</percent> interest in the Property, subject to a <percent>2%</percent> net smelter return royalty (\"NSR\") in favor of the Offeror (and the obligation to make the Milestone Payments described below). Canamera will have the right to buy back <percent>50%</percent> of the NSR (reducing it to a <percent>1%</percent> NSR) for C<money>$228,000</money> upon certain terms and conditions.</p><p><b>Milestone Payments</b></p><p>Subject to acquiring and exercising the Option, Canamera has also agreed to pay the following milestone payment amounts (\"Milestone Payments\") to the Offeror:</p><ul><li><p><b>Milestone Payment 1: </b>C<money>$342,000</money> (comprised of <percent>50%</percent> cash / <percent>50%</percent> Company shares at 20-day VWAP) payable if Canamera reports, in respect of the Property, a 43-101-compliant Inferred Resource of 250 million tonnes or more, grading at least 2,000 ppm Total Rare Earth Oxides (\"TREO\") within five (5) years from the date of acquisition.</p></li><li><p><b>Milestone Payment 2: </b>C<money>$228,000</money> (comprised of <percent>50%</percent> cash / <percent>50%</percent> Company shares at 20-day VWAP) payable if Canamera reports, in respect of the Property, drill intercepts of 25 metres grading at least 2,500 ppm TREO within three (3) years from the date of acquisition.</p></li></ul><p><b>Patos Project Overview</b></p><p>The Patos Project consists of eight (8) prospecting licences (ANM Licence IDs: 830763/2024 through 830771/2024) totalling approximately 15,979 hectares, located in the municipality of Presidente Olegário in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The Property is road accessible and situated approximately 330 kilometres from Belo Horizonte.</p><p>The Property is underlain by the Patos Formation, a member of the Mata da Corda Group — the same stratigraphic package currently being explored for ionic clay REE mineralization by other companies active in the region. Ionic clay REE deposits are of particular interest given their amenability to low-cost, low-impact extraction methods relative to hard-rock REE deposits.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/11828/285428_66887350c49ce911_001full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 26, 2026) - Eureka Lithium Corp. (CSE: ERKA) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/UREKF/\" title=\"View UREKF stock overview\">UREKF</a>) (FSE: S58) (\"<b>Eureka Lithium</b>\" or \"<b>Eureka</b>\" or the \"<b>Company</b>\") is pleased to announce, further to its news release dated January 28, 2026, that it has completed the acquisition (\"<b>Acquisition</b>\") of a <percent>100%</percent> interest in the Cabin Lake Polymetallic Project, located in the Omineca Mining District of British Columbia, and of a <percent>100%</percent> interest in the Tyee Titanium-Vanadium Project, located within the Havre-St-Pierre region of Quebec (together, the \"<b>Properties</b>\"), through its acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares (\"<b>Stairway Shares</b>\") of Stairway Mining Inc. (\"<b>Stairway</b>\").</p><p>The Acquisition was made pursuant to the terms of an amended and restated share purchase agreement (\"<b>Share Purchase Agreement</b>\") dated February 20, 2026, under which Eureka acquired the Stairway Shares in exchange for an aggregate of 9,100,000 common shares of Eureka, issued to Stairway Shareholders on a pro rata basis (\"<b>Consideration Shares</b>\"). In addition, Eureka has agreed to make a milestone cash payment of, in aggregate, CAD <money>$1,000,000</money> (the \"<b>Milestone Payment</b>\", and together with the Consideration Shares, the \"<b>Consideration</b>\") to former Stairway Shareholders, on a pro rata basis, in the event that all of the following milestones are achieved: (i) Eureka files a technical report for each of the Properties on SEDAR+ within six months of the date of the Share Purchase Agreement; (ii) Eureka delineates and publicly discloses a mineral resource estimate in respect of at least one the Properties within nine months of the date of the Share Purchase Agreement; and (iii) Eureka publicly discloses a preliminary economic assessment in respect of at least one of the Properties within 15 months of the date of the Share Purchase Agreement. The Consideration Shares are subject to a hold period of four months and one day from the date of issuance.  The Company notes that, as disclosed in its January 28, 2026 news release, the original consideration contemplated to be paid for the Acquisition was 12,000,000 common shares of Eureka, with no Milestone Payment.  These terms were amended as a result of the Company's inability to vary the four month and one day hold applicable to the Consideration Shares pursuant to Canadian Securities Exchange policies.</p><p>The Company notes that the Consideration for the Acquisition was determined through arm's length negotiations between the Company and Stairway.  During such negotiations, the Company's management and board applied its business judgment, having regard to comparable transactions in the junior mining industry.  Stairway originally staked or acquired the Tyee Project claims in December 2025. The Company's Consideration was not based on the historical staking or acquisition cost of the claims, but rather on its independent assessment of the exploration potential, geological merit, strategic value and market comparables for similar stage critical mineral assets. Management does not consider the difference between Stairway's original acquisition cost and the Consideration to be indicative of the fair value of the Properties.</p><p>The former Stairway Shareholders are arm's length to the Company and to its directors, officers, and, to its knowledge, insiders. </p><p>The Cabin Lake Project is comprised of six contiguous mineral claims totaling approximately 2,363 hectares in central British Columbia's Omineca Mining District. Cabin Lake is a polymetallic system prospective for zinc, lead, copper, molybdenum and silver, with multiple historical showings and a 600 metre by 1,000 metre target footprint identified through prior exploration work.</p><p>The Cabin Lake Project is strategically located near established infrastructure and producing and past-producing mines, including the Endako Mine<sup>1</sup> and the Blackwater Mine<sup>2</sup>, underscoring the district-scale fertility of the region.*</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9639/285386_569dd43d44164ad0_002full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?
