            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p> <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.wakefi\">WAKEFIELD, Mass.</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Franklin Street Properties Corp. (the “Company”, “FSP”, “our” or “we”) (NYSE American: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/FSP/\" title=\"View FSP stock overview\">FSP</a>) announced today that it has closed a <money><money>$320 million</money></money> secured credit facility (the “Facility”) with an affiliate of TPG Credit (the “Lender”). The Company repaid in full all of its outstanding <money><money>$248.9 million</money></money> aggregate principal amount of indebtedness in an initial drawdown of <money><money>$258.5 million</money></money> under the Facility, net of original issue discount of <money><money>$16.5 million</money></money> (the “Initial Term Loans”). The Facility includes up to <money><money>$45 million</money></money> of delayed draw term loans, which, subject to certain conditions, will be used to fund tenant improvements, leasing commissions, building improvements and other uses approved by the Lender (“Delayed Draw Term Loans”) and contains customary covenants. Alter Domus (US) LLC will act as administrative agent for the Facility.</p><p>A summary of key terms is below:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Aggregate principal amount <money><money>$320 million</money></money> (including both the Initial Term Loans and the Delayed Draw Term Loans).</li><li>Original stated maturity of February 26, 2029.</li><li>Initial coupon rate of <percent>9.0%</percent>.</li><li>An exit fee of <percent>4.0%</percent> of the funded amount of the loans due upon repayment.</li><li>The maturity date is subject to potential extension of up to one year at the option of the Company, subject to certain conditions.</li><li>Collateral consisting of a first priority lien on substantially all assets of the Company.</li></ul><p><a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/FSP/\" title=\"View FSP stock overview\">FSP</a> was represented by Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP and Stifel.

Carter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/FSP/\" title=\"View FSP stock overview\">FSP</a>, said, “After considering a number of different potential strategic alternatives in consultation with our professional advisors, we concluded that refinancing our outstanding indebtedness was the best alternative available to us at this time. In addition, the Delayed Draw Term Loan feature of the Facility provides additional flexibility to allow us to lease additional space in our existing portfolio, which could enhance future value. We are pleased to have TPG as a strategic lending partner and look forward to building a long-term relationship with them.</p><p>However, now that our near-term debt maturity has been addressed, we are continuing our review of potential strategic alternatives. Our Board of Directors and management team remain deeply committed to continuing to explore ways to maximize shareholder value. We believe that having successfully addressed our near-term debt maturities has reduced a significant source of near-term uncertainty and avoided having to make forced or suboptimal decisions, enabling us to focus on executing property-level initiatives in what continues to be an uneven office market environment. We believe this approach best positions the Company to navigate current market conditions while preserving maximum strategic flexibility. We look forward to continuing to update the market as and when appropriate.”</p><p>David Busker, Managing Director and Head of Commercial Real Estate Debt, TPG Credit, said “We are pleased to partner with Franklin Street Properties to provide a tailored capital solution that provides the financial flexibility needed to navigate the current market.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 27, 2026) - Restart Life Sciences Corp. (CSE: HEAL) (FSE: HN30) (OTC Pink: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/NMLSF/\" title=\"View NMLSF stock overview\">NMLSF</a>) (\"Restart Life\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that it has successfully closed the previously announced acquisition of <percent>100%</percent> of the issued and outstanding shares of Holy Crap Foods Inc. (\"Holy Crap\") pursuant to the deﬁnitive agreement dated February 12, 2026, among the Company, Happy Belly Coffee Inc., a subsidiary of Happy Belly Food Group Inc. (CSE: HBFG), and Holy Crap (the \"Acquisition\").</p><p>Effective as of the closing date of the transaction, the Acquisition adds in excess of <money>$1 million</money> in annualized revenue to Restart Life, marking a signiﬁcant milestone in the Company's evolution and immediately establishing Restart Life as a revenue-producing organization.</p><p>This milestone transaction represents a strategic inﬂection point for Restart Life, providing a foundational operating platform from which to execute its broader growth strategy within the health and wellness sector.</p><p>The Acquisition represents a comprehensive transfer of the entire Holy Crap business ecosystem. It includes the full Holy Crap portfolio of brands and product lines, together with all associated trademarks, proprietary formulations, trade secrets, intellectual property, packaging designs, marketing assets, digital infrastructure, and established goodwill. The transaction also encompasses longstanding retail and distributor relationships, direct-to-consumer channels, customer data, supplier agreements, and all ﬁnished goods, raw materials, packaging components, and work-in-progress inventory, ensuring operational continuity from day one.</p><p>Central to the Acquisition is Holy Crap's dedicated manufacturing operation located in Gibsons, British Columbia. The Gibsons facility, which operates under a lease agreement, serves as the primary production and fulﬁllment hub for the brand's product lines. The site includes established blending and batching systems, production lines, packaging infrastructure, warehousing capacity, food safety and quality assurance programs, and trained operational personnel. Management believes this turnkey manufacturing platform provides immediate production stability with proven throughput capacity and built-in scalability to support distribution expansion and future product innovation. By acquiring a fully functioning manufacturing footprint, Restart Life minimizes near-term capital expenditure requirements, reduces integration risk, and preserves ﬁnancial ﬂexibility while maintaining the operational backbone necessary to execute its strategic growth initiatives.</p><p>Founded in 2009, Holy Crap was originally launched under the name \"Hapi Food\" with a mission to address food allergies and provide clean, simple ingredient nutrition. The brand achieved national recognition after appearing on CBC's Dragon's Den in 2010, where overwhelming consumer demand generated approximately <money>$1 million</money> in sales virtually overnight, ﬁrmly establishing Holy Crap as a breakout success story in the natural foods space.</p><p>The brand's rapid rise continued later that year when its products were featured during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. In a milestone few food brands can claim, Holy Crap cereal was also selected to be enjoyed by astronauts aboard the International Space Station, a testament to its nutritional proﬁle, quality standards, and broad appeal.</p><p>Effective upon closing, Holy Crap now operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of Restart Life. The Company intends to maintain existing operations at the Gibsons facility and work collaboratively with the current management and production team to ensure seamless continuity while identifying operational efﬁciencies and measured expansion opportunities.</p><p>Members of the Restart Life team conducted an in-person visit and operational tour of the Gibsons manufacturing facility, meeting directly with management and staff to review operations and discuss next phase growth initiatives. The Company extends its sincere appreciation to the Holy Crap team for their professionalism, experience, and continued dedication to the brand, which has been instrumental in building its loyal customer base and strong market reputation.</p><p>With the transaction complete, Restart Life is actively executing on a disciplined strategic growth plan focused on expanding distribution channels, enhancing operational efﬁciencies, and evaluating new product development opportunities. The Company intends to leverage Holy Crap's established revenue base, embedded customer relationships, and in-house manufacturing capabilities as the cornerstone of its expansion strategy, supporting both organic growth and potential future brand development initiatives.</p><p>Consumers and investors are encouraged to visit HolyCrap.com to learn more about the product line and experience ﬁrsthand the functional cereal that has built a loyal following across North America. For a limited time, customers will receive a free bag with every order, providing an opportunity to get familiar with a product that truly delivers on its promise of simple ingredients and real results.</p><p>Steve Loutskou, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer of Restart Life, commented, \"We are excited to ofﬁcially welcome Holy Crap to Restart Life. Over the past several weeks, our team has been working diligently behind the scenes on product research and development from every angle, from formulation and nutrition science to operations and scalability. What we have acquired is not just a brand, but a fully integrated operating business with strong infrastructure and signiﬁcant growth potential. We are energized to work alongside Holy Crap's passionate and dedicated team to enhance, expand, and elevate the brand to new levels. With closing complete, our focus now turns to disciplined execution and strategic growth from this solid foundation.\"</p><p>Restart Life would like to thank its shareholders for their ongoing support as the Company advances its mission and continues to execute on its strategy.</p><p><b>About Holy Crap Foods Inc.</b><br/>Holy Crap Cereal, a Holy Crap brand, is a premium breakfast brand known for its delicious, nutrient-dense cereals made with simple, wholesome ingredients.

Viewed more broadly, approximately <percent>91%</percent> of the NAV reduction was tied to investments that were underwritten in 2021 or earlier. Certain of these businesses benefited from high levels of pandemic-era demand but have since seen results soften. In addition, because these investments were originated in a low base-rate environment, several have struggled to adapt to a period of sustained higher interest rates.</p><p>The Company’s highest near-term priority is to improve portfolio credit quality by working diligently to resolve challenged credits. At the same time, it continues to execute on the refined investment strategy described last year, including deploying capital selectively into senior-secured, first-lien loans, maintaining a well-diversified portfolio, and fully leveraging the resources of BlackRock’s platform.</p><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwwidth100 bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl\"><tr><td class=\"bwpadl0\"

On March 18, 2024, the Company completed its previously announced merger with BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation (\"Merger\"). The Merger has been accounted for as an asset acquisition of BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation (\"BCIC\") by the Company in accordance with the asset acquisition method of accounting as detailed in ASC 805-50 (\"ASC 805\"), Business Combinations-Related Issues. The Company determined the fair value of the shares of the Company's common stock that were issued to former BCIC shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement plus transaction costs to be the consideration paid in connection with the Merger under ASC 805. The consideration paid to BCIC shareholders was less than the aggregate fair values of the BCIC assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the “purchase discount”). The consideration paid was allocated to the individual BCIC assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair values of net identifiable assets acquired other than “non-qualifying” assets and liabilities (for example, cash) and did not give rise to goodwill. As a result, the purchase discount was allocated to the cost basis of the BCIC investments acquired by the Company on a pro-rata basis based on their relative fair values as of the effective time of the Merger. Immediately following the Merger, the investments were marked to their respective fair values in accordance with ASC 820 which resulted in immediate recognition of net unrealized appreciation in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a result of the Merger. The purchase discount allocated to the BCIC debt investments acquired will amortize over the remaining life of each respective debt investment through interest income, with a corresponding adjustment recorded to unrealized appreciation or depreciation on such investment acquired through its ultimate disposition. The purchase discount allocated to BCIC equity investments acquired will not amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, the Company may recognize a realized gain or loss with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired.</p></td></tr></table><p>As a supplement to the Company’s reported GAAP financial measures, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>“Adjusted net investment income” – excludes the amortization of purchase accounting discount from net investment income calculated in accordance with GAAP;</li><li>“Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss)” – excludes the unrealized appreciation resulting from the purchase discount and the corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation from the amortization of the purchase discount from the determination of net realized and unrealized gain (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP; and</li><li>“Adjusted net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations” – calculates net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations based on Adjusted net investment income and Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss).</li></ul><p>We believe that the adjustment to exclude the full effect of purchase discount accounting under ASC 805 from these financial measures is meaningful because of the potential impact on the comparability of these financial measures that we and investors use to assess our financial condition and results of operations period over period. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are intended to enhance investors’ understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP.

Our management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate operating performance, to forecast future results and as a basis for compensation. The Company believes this is an important supplemental measure of operating performance because it eliminates items that have less bearing on its operating performance and highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. The Company believes the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful for investors because it enables them to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company’s management, helps improve their ability to understand the Company’s operating performance and makes it easier to compare the Company’s results with other companies that may have different depreciation and amortization policies, non-cash share-based payment costs, impairment of long-lived assets, workforce reorganization costs, termination costs, system optimization costs, satellite transition costs, acquisition and transition related costs and advisor fees.</p><p>Adjusted OIBDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenue.

In addition, Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin have the limitation of not reflecting the effect of the Company’s non-cash share-based payment costs, impairment of long-lived assets, workforce reorganization costs, termination of the Regal ESA, system optimization costs, satellite transition costs, acquisition and transition related costs, and advisor fees related to involvement in the Cineworld proceeding and Chapter 11 case. Adjusted OIBDA should not be regarded as an alternative to operating income, net income or as indicators of operating performance, nor should it be considered in isolation of, or as substitutes for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that operating income is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted OIBDA, and operating margin is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted OIBDA margin. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these non-GAAP presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, or calculations in NCM LLC’s debt agreement.</p><p>The Company has not provided a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP Adjusted OIBDA measure to forward-looking GAAP operating income due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of impacts outside of the Company’s control on certain items, including the timing of revenue and charges reflected in our reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which, based on historical experience, could be significant and are difficult to reasonably predict. Accordingly, a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort.</p><p>The following table reconciles the Company's operating loss and operating margin to Adjusted

financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>. Adjusted net income (loss) and income (loss) per share are calculated using reported net income (loss) and income (loss) per share and exclude workforce reorganization costs, system optimization costs, satellite transition costs, Spotlight acquisition and integration costs, advisor fees related to the Cineworld proceeding and Chapter 11 case and (gain) loss on re-measurement of the payable to ESA Parties under the tax receivable agreement. Our management use these non-GAAP financial measures as an additional tool to evaluate operating performance. The Company believes these are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they eliminate items that have less bearing on its operating performance and so highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. The Company believes the presentation of these measures is relevant and useful for investors because it enables them to view performance in a manner similar to a method used by the Company’s management and helps improve their ability to understand the Company’s operating performance. Adjusted net income (loss) and income (loss) per share should not be regarded as alternatives to net income (loss) and income (loss) per share or as indicators of operating performance, nor should they be considered in isolation of, or as substitutes for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that net income (loss) and income (loss) per share are the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.</p><p>The following table reconciles as reported

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><strong id=\"dateline\">TORONTO, ON / <a href=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ACCESS Newswire</a> / February 27, 2026 / </strong><strong>Sterling Metals Corp. (TSXV:SAG)(OTCQB:SAGGF) (\"Sterling\" or the \"Company\")</strong> is pleased to report additional assay results from its expanded and completed 2025 drilling program at the Soo Copper Project (\"<strong>Soo Copper</strong>\" or the \"<strong>Project\"</strong>) located near Batchewana Bay, Ontario. Results from 6 additional drill holes continue to expand the copper mineralized footprint, while further defining and extending the high-grade bornite zone. Assays remain pending for the final 5 holes drilled within the core of the MEPS discovery area.</p><p><strong>Highlights:</strong></p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><p>Systematic step-out and infill drilling within the MEPS zone confirms continuous copper mineralization from surface across approximately 400m of east-west strike, centered on discovery hole MEPS-25-02 and remains open (see Figure 1 and 2).</p></li><li><p>A 30m expansion of the high-grade bornite zone in MEPS-25-18, highlighted by the highest-grade individual copper sample intersected to date of <strong><percent>38.9%</percent> Cu over 0.3m </strong>in MEPS-25-18 at 227.4m (see Figure 2) that is included within a high grade bornite-rich interval grading 24m of <percent>2.05%</percent> CuEq and also within a broader 237.2m interval grading <percent>0.5%</percent> CuEq.</p></li><li><p>New high-grade zone associated with the GFP felsic porphyry dykes and adjacent magnetite veining at shallow depths in holes MEPS-25-14, 15 and 16, including a highlighted interval in MEPS-25-16 of 13.55m grading <percent>2.04%</percent> CuEq from 96.35m depth within a larger interval of 177.3m of <percent>0.4%</percent> CuEq and a broader interval of 419.9m of <percent>0.3%</percent>CuEq.</p></li><li><p>Magnetite veins associated with early GFP felsic dykes remain the dominant hosts of the highest-grade copper sulphide mineralization observed to date, with later felsic porphyry dykes and alteration events hosting lower grade copper mineralization, supporting the interpretation that this discovery zone is situated above a large, multi-stage porphyry-style copper system.</p></li></ul><p>Jeremy Niemi, SVP Exploration and Development, commented, \"We are very excited about these wide intervals of copper from surface and, importantly, the systematic expansion of the high-grade bornite zone by 150 metres around the discovery hole MEPS-25-02. Each step-out hole has successfully extended the zone either laterally or vertically, demonstrating strong continuity of the high-grade core within a much broader copper system. The mineralization remains open in most directions, and we are beginning to see clear structural and grade trends emerging that will guide our 2026 resource-focused drilling.\"</p><p><strong>High-Grade Copper Zone Continues to Develop</strong></p><p>In addition to establishing a broad, continuous zone of copper mineralization from surface, results from new drill hole intervals continue to identify and expand the high-grade bornite zone first recognized in MEPS-25-02. Step-out drilling has now systematically extended this zone in multiple directions and increased confidence in the continuity and scale of the high-grade zone which the Company anticipates will come to surface.</p><p>Hole MEPS-25-14 extended the bornite mineralization approximately 50m east of MEPS-25-02. Follow-up hole MEPS-25-15 stepped a further 30m east, bringing the eastern expansion to 80m from the discovery hole. Hole MEPS-25-16, drilled beneath MEPS-25-15, extended the bornite zone approximately 40m vertically, demonstrating depth continuity within the high-grade domain. Hole MEPS-25-17 then pushed the eastern extent another 40m, expanding bornite mineralization to approximately 120m east of MEPS-25-02.</p><p>To the west, MEPS-25-18 intersected high-grade bornite mineralization approximately 30m beyond MEPS-25-02, confirming expansion in that direction and bringing the total newly defined east-west strike extension of the bornite zone to approximately 150m.</p><p>Importantly, these step-outs demonstrate not only lateral continuity but also vertical development of the high-grade bornite core within a much broader, near-surface envelope of chalcopyrite-dominant copper mineralization. The bornite mineralization remains open along strike and at depth and is a key focus for the planned 2026 drill program.</p><a href=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/65e536f2-9f4f-486c-a56a-21bf45d06558/1142049/figonesm.png\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/65e536f2-9f4f-486c-a56a-21bf45d06558/1142049/figonesm.png\" style=\"width:720px;text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto;\"/></a><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Figure 1.

services were provided by Actlabs, which is an independent, CALA- and SCC-accredited analytical services firm registered to ISO 17025 and ISO 9001 standard. Drill core samples were logged and split in half with a diamond core saw. Half-core samples were securely stored at the core logging facility until being delivered to Actlabs Thunder Bay lab by commercial transport. Samples were crushed (&lt; 7 kg) up to 90% passing 2mm (10 mesh), riffle split to 250 g and pulverized by mild steel to 95% passing 105μm (150 mesh). Samples splits underwent a 4-acid near total digestion followed by a multi-element analysis, including base metals, using an ICP method for 35 elements. Selected sample pulps were then analyzed for gold using a 30 g aliquot mixed with fire assay fluxes and Ag as a collector, placed in a fire clay crucible, gradually heated to 1060ºC for 60 min, and followed with an AA finish.</p><p>Laboratory QA/QC for the ICP analysis was <percent>14%</percent> for each batch, including 5 method reagent blanks, 10 in-house controls, 10 samples duplicates, and 8 certified reference materials. An additional <percent>13%</percent> QA/QC was performed as part of the instrumental analysis to ensure quality in the areas of instrumental drift. Laboratory quality control for the gold fire assay included two blanks per 42 samples, three sample duplicates and 2 certified reference materials, one high and one low (QC 7 out of 42 samples). In-house QA/QC included the systematic insertion of blanks, duplicates, and certified reference materials (CRM).</p><p><strong>Qualified Person</strong></p><p>Jeremy Niemi, P.Geo., Senior Vice President, Exploration and Evaluation for Sterling Metals has reviewed and approved the technical information presented herein.</p><p><strong>About the Soo Copper Project</strong></p><p>The Soo Copper Project sits just 20 minutes off the Trans-Canada Highway, one hour north of Sault Ste. Marie, and 20km from rail and deep-water access. With near-surface copper-one of the most critical of all critical metals-alongside gold, and with the project now demonstrating both scale and grade, Sterling sees the potential for Soo Copper to become a nationally significant asset as Canada accelerates its efforts to secure strategic copper resources. Prime Minister Carney's recent designation of copper as one of Canada's first five strategic assets underscores the importance of this discovery and its potential to emerge as a key project of national interest.</p><p><strong>About Sterling Metals</strong></p><p>Sterling Metals is a mineral exploration company focused on large scale and high-grade Canadian exploration opportunities. The Company is advancing the 25,000-hectare Soo Copper Project in Ontario which has past production, and multiple breccia and porphyry targets strategically located near robust infrastructure and the 29,000-hectare Adeline Project in Labrador which covers an entire sediment-hosted copper belt with significant silver credits. Both opportunities have demonstrated potential for important new copper discoveries, underscoring Sterling's commitment to pioneering exploration in mineral rich Canada.</p><p>Sterling Metals acknowledges that its exploration activities within the Soo Copper project are conducted on the traditional lands of the Batchewana, Garden River, and Michipicoten First Nations of the North Shore of Lake Superior. We recognize and respect the longstanding and diverse relationships Indigenous Peoples have with the land and are committed to engaging in a manner that is respectful, transparent, and inclusive.</p><p><strong>For more information, please contact:</strong></p><p>Sterling Metals Corp.<br/>Mathew Wilson, CEO and Director</p><p>Tel: (416) 643-3887<br/>Email: <a href=\"mailto:info@sterlingmetals.ca\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">info@sterlingmetals.ca</a><br/>Website: <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3vp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.sterlingmetals.ca</a></p><p><i>Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.

We were particularly encouraged by stronger performance at Andaz Miami Beach and Wailea Beach Resort which saw robust demand over the festive period with the momentum continuing into 2026.\"</p><p>Mr. Giglia continued, \"While macroeconomic uncertainty and other factors impeded industry growth in 2025, we nevertheless had a productive year at Sunstone. We recycled out of a lower growth hotel and used the proceeds to accretively repurchase our stock, debuted Andaz Miami Beach, completed other capital investments intended to drive future growth, and returned over <money><money>$170 million</money></money> to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. While we see reasons to be optimistic about the year ahead, we remain cautious and know the operating environment can be impacted, both positively and negatively, by events outside of our control. In 2026, we will continue to execute our strategy of recycling capital, investing in our portfolio, and returning capital to shareholders while working to address the valuation discount at which we trade. We have an exceptional portfolio with meaningful growth potential, a flexible balance sheet with optionality, a nimble size that allows us to pivot among the most accretive capital allocation opportunities, and a singular focus to realize the embedded value of our portfolio for our shareholders.\"</p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"prnbcc\"><tr><td

In May 2025, the Company opened Andaz Miami Beach, following a complete transformation of the property. The fully renovated luxury resort had a strong finish in 2025 and is expected to generate meaningful earnings growth for the Company in 2026 during its first full year of operations. Later this year, the resort will introduce Olazul, a members only beach club and will also debut Bazaar Meat, a signature dining destination by José Andrés Group. In addition to substantial earnings growth in 2026, the Company expects Andaz Miami Beach will contribute further to earnings in 2027 and 2028 as it ramps up and stabilizes.</p><p><i>Hilton New Orleans St. Charles Disposition</i>. In June 2025, the Company sold the 252-room Hilton New Orleans St. Charles for a gross sale price of <money><money>$47.0 million</money></money>. The sale price represented an <percent>8.7%</percent> cap rate on the hotel's prior year earnings or a <percent>6.6%</percent> cap rate inclusive of the Company's estimate of near-term capital expenditures. The Company utilized proceeds received from the sale to accretively repurchase shares of its common stock.</p><p><i>Stock Repurchase Program</i>. During 2025, the Company repurchased an aggregate amount of <money><money>$103.6 million</money></money>, before expenses, of its common and preferred stock. In addition, from the start of this year through February 26, 2026, the Company has allocated an additional <money><money>$7.5 million</money></money>, before expenses, into repurchases of its common and preferred stock. The Company believes this repurchase activity has been done on a discounted basis and generated significant value for its shareholders.</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li><i>Common stock</i>: During 2025, the Company repurchased 11,589,722 shares at an average purchase price per share of <money><money>$8.83</money></money> for a total repurchase amount before expenses of <money><money>$102.4 million</money></money>.

The average repurchase price per share reflects a <percent>23.0%</percent> discount to the preferred stock liquidation value.</li></ul><p><i>Amended and Restated Credit Agreement</i>. In September 2025, the Company completed its Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Amended Credit Agreement\"), which provides for an aggregate borrowing capacity of <money><money>$1.35 billion</money></money>, and allowed the Company to address all near term maturities, extend the duration of the remaining in-place loans, and further strengthen the Company's balance sheet. Inclusive of extension options, loans under the Amended Credit Agreement mature at various points in 2030 and 2031 but are freely prepayable at any time. In connection with the new facilities, the Company entered into a series of interest rate swaps to lower its borrowing cost and better manage interest rate risk.</p><p><b>Recent Developments</b></p><p><i>Stock Repurchase Program Reauthorization</i>. In February 2026, Sunstone's Board of Directors reauthorized the Company's stock repurchase program which allows the Company to acquire up to <money><money>$500.0 million</money></money> of its common and preferred stock. The authorization has no stated expiration and future repurchases under the program will depend on various factors including the Company's capital needs, other capital allocation opportunities available to the Company, and the price of the Company's common and preferred stock. Including repurchase activity completed subsequent to the reauthorization, the Company currently has nearly <money><money>$500.0 million</money></money> remaining under the new authorization.</p><p><i>Delayed-Draw and Series A Senior Notes Repayment</i>. In January 2026, the Company drew the remaining <money><money>$90.0 million</money></money> available under its <money><money>$275.0 million</money></money> delayed-draw term loan facility and used a majority of the proceeds received to repay the <money><money>$65.0 million</money></money> balance of the Series A Senior Notes at their scheduled maturity. Following this repayment, the Company has no debt maturities until 2028.</p><p><i>Corporate Responsibility Report</i>.

Copies of these reports are available on our website at <a href=\"http://www.sunstonehotels.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.sunstonehotels.com</a> and through the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval System (\"EDGAR\") at <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.sec.gov</a>.</p><p><b>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</b></p><p>We present the following non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as key supplemental measures of our operating performance: earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate, or EBITDA<i>re</i>; Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> (as defined below); funds from operations attributable to common stockholders, or FFO attributable to common stockholders; Adjusted FFO attributable to common stockholders (as defined below); hotel Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i>; and hotel Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> margins. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our calculation of these measures may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly the same as us. These non-GAAP measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. They should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), cash flow from operations, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure.</p><p>We present EBITDA<i>re</i> in accordance with guidelines established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"Nareit\"), as defined in its September 2017 white paper \"Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate.\" We believe EBITDA<i>re</i> is a useful performance measure to help investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period in comparison to our peers. Nareit defines EBITDA<i>re</i> as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on the disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change in control), impairment write-downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in the value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDA<i>re</i> of unconsolidated affiliates.</p><p>We make additional adjustments to EBITDA<i>re</i> when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance, and that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i>, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. In addition, we use both EBITDA<i>re</i> and Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> as measures in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions.</p><p>We believe that the presentation of FFO attributable to common stockholders provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance because it is a measure of our operations without regard to specified noncash items such as real estate depreciation and amortization, any real estate impairment loss and any gain or loss on sale of real estate assets, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and may be of lesser significance in evaluating our current performance. Our presentation of FFO attributable to common stockholders conforms to Nareit's definition of \"FFO applicable to common shares.\" Our presentation may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the terms in accordance with the current Nareit definition, or that interpret the current Nareit definition differently than we do.</p><p>We also present Adjusted FFO attributable to common stockholders when evaluating our operating performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and may facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and our peer companies.</p><p>We adjust EBITDA<i>re</i> and FFO attributable to common stockholders for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to these measures as either Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> or Adjusted FFO attributable to common stockholders:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li><i>Amortization of deferred stock compensation</i>: we exclude the noncash expense incurred with the amortization of deferred stock compensation as this expense is based on historical stock prices at the date of grant to our corporate employees and does not reflect the underlying performance of our hotels.</li><li><i>Amortization of contract intangibles</i>: we exclude the noncash amortization of any favorable or unfavorable contract intangibles recorded in conjunction with our hotel acquisitions. We exclude the noncash amortization of contract intangibles because it is based on historical cost accounting and is of lesser significance in evaluating our actual performance for the current period.</li><li><i>Gains or losses from debt transactions</i>: we exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired because, like interest expense, their removal helps investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure.</li><li><i>Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle</i>: from time to time, the FASB promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. We exclude these one-time adjustments, which include the accounting impact from prior periods, because they do not reflect our actual performance for that period.</li><li><i>Other adjustments</i>: we exclude other adjustments that we believe are outside the ordinary course of business because we do not believe these costs reflect our actual performance for the period and/or the ongoing operations of our hotels. Such items may include: lawsuit settlement costs; the write-off of development costs associated with abandoned projects; property-level restructuring, severance, and management transition costs; pre-opening costs associated with extensive renovation projects; debt resolution costs; lease terminations; property insurance restoration proceeds or uninsured losses; and other nonrecurring identified adjustments.</li></ul><p>In addition, to derive Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i>, we exclude the amortization of our right-of-use assets and related lease obligations as these expenses are based on historical cost accounting and do not reflect the actual rent amounts due to the respective lessors or the underlying performance of our hotels. We also exclude the effect of gains and losses on the disposition of undepreciated assets because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets.</p><p>To derive Adjusted FFO attributable to common stockholders, we also exclude the noncash interest on our derivatives as we believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs. Additionally, we exclude the real estate amortization of our right-of-use assets and related lease obligations (with the exception of our corporate operating lease) as these expenses are based on historical cost accounting and do not reflect the actual rent amounts due to the respective lessors or the underlying performance of our hotels. We also exclude gains or losses on the redemptions or repurchases of preferred stock, changes to deferred tax assets, liabilities or valuation allowances, and income tax benefits or provisions associated with the application of net operating loss carryforwards, uncertain tax positions or with the sale of assets.</p><p>In presenting hotel Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> and hotel Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> margins, miscellaneous non-hotel items have been excluded. We believe the calculation of hotel Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> results in a more accurate presentation of the hotel Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> margins for our hotels, and that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in evaluating our property-level operating performance.</p><p>Reconciliations of net income to EBITDA<i>re</i>, Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i>, FFO attributable to common stockholders, Adjusted FFO attributable to common stockholders, hotel Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> and hotel Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> margins are set forth in the following pages of this release.</p><p><u>For Additional Information</u>:<br/>Aaron Reyes<br/>Sunstone Hotel Investors, Inc.<br/>(949) 382-3018</p><p> </p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"
