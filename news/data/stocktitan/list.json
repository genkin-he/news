(Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/DJT/\" title=\"View DJT stock overview\">DJT</a>) (\"TMTG\" or the \"Company\"), operator of the social media platform Truth Social, the video streaming service Truth+, and the financial services and FinTech brand Truth.Fi, announced its financial results for the full year ending on December 31, 2025. These results are included in TMTG's Annual Report on Form 10-K that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") today.</p> <p>TMTG closed 2025 with financial assets of approximately <money>$2.5 billion</money> comprising cash, restricted cash, short-term investments, equity securities, note receivable, digital assets, and digital assets pledged—more than tripling the Company’s <money>$776.8 million</money> in financial assets at the end of 2024. These holdings position TMTG to continue pursuing all its key strategic objectives including:</p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">continuing to implement its mergers and acquisitions strategy;</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">further expanding the Truth Social and Truth+ platforms;  </li><li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">robustly growing the Truth.Fi brand including its newly launched slates of exchange traded funds (\"ETFs\") and separately managed accounts (“SMAs”); and</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">continuing to integrate the Company’s cryptocurrency strategy into its operations and financial planning.<br/><br/></li></ul> <p>The Company achieved a milestone by reporting positive operating cash flow of <money>$14.8 million</money> for 2025, including positive and growing cash flow in each of the last three quarters—as compared to a <money>$61.0 million</money> operating cash outflow for 2024. Having achieved positive operating cash flow for a calendar year less than two years after going public, TMTG believes its diversification, acquisitions, and growth strategies position the Company for future revenue growth and long-term shareholder value creation.</p> <p>Furthermore, as part of its bitcoin treasury hedging activities, TMTG earned <money>$44.0 million</money> in cash proceeds through its covered-put options strategy.</p> <p>TMTG CEO and Chairman Devin Nunes said,\"TMTG has entered a crucial period in our expansion and diversification. Since going public in March 2024, our financial assets have grown from roughly <money>$200 million</money> to approximately <money>$2.5 billion</money> at the end of 2025. We now have positive operating cash flow bolstered partly by the cash proceeds from our options strategy. The strength of our balance sheet has enabled the company to rigorously carry out our mergers and acquisitions strategy while launching new products and services such as our Truth.Fi financial products. We look forward to continuing our momentum in 2026 and beyond, positioning TMTG as a leader in the America First economy.\"</p> <p>For 2025, TMTG had a <money>$712.3 million</money> consolidated net loss, most of which comprised unrealized losses stemming from a drop in the price of digital assets and digital asset related securities. This included non-cash losses related to changes in the fair value of digital assets and digital assets pledged (<money>$403.2 million</money>) and non-cash losses stemming from the fair value mark to market of digital asset related securities (<money>$178.8 million</money>). The figure also includes <money>$59.2 million</money> in non-cash stock-based compensation and <money>$27.0 million</money> in non-cash interest expense on outstanding debt, leading to consolidated adjusted EBITDA loss of <money>$664.4 million</money>. The Company posted <money>$3.7 million</money> in revenue for the year.</p> <p><strong>About TMTG</strong></p> <p>The mission of Trump Media is to end Big Tech's s assault on free speech by opening up the Internet and giving people their voices back.

            "title": "Railtown AI Technologies Inc. Clarifies Certain Disclosure | RLAIF Stock News",
            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 27, 2026) - <b>Railtown AI Technologies Inc. (CSE: RAIL) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/RLAIF/\" title=\"View RLAIF stock overview\">RLAIF</a>) </b>(\"<b>Railtown</b>\" or the \"<b>Company</b>\") is issuing the following news release to clarify its disclosure pursuant to a recent review of the Company's continuous disclosure record by the British Columbia Securities Commission (the \"<b>BCSC</b>\").</p><p><u>October 8, 2025 News Release</u></p><p>In this news release, Railtown announced that it had entered into a memorandum of understanding (\"<b>MOU</b>\") with Uniserve Communications Corporation (TSXV: USS) (\"<b>Uniserve</b>\") regarding a strategic partnership. The Company would like to clarify that the MOU is non-binding, is for a term of 12 months beginning on September 23, 2025 but subject to mutually agreeable extensions, and that either party has the right to terminate the MOU upon 30 days' written notice. The primary purpose of the partnership is to allow Uniserve to integrate Railtown's AI frameworks, tools and solutions into Uniserve's offerings, thereby enabling Uniserve's internal sales team to promote and sell AI capabilities to Uniserve's customers.</p><p>Each of Railtown and Uniserve has certain defined obligations under the MOU, pursuant to which the parties have agreed to negotiate and execute separate commercial agreements, statements of work or service orders, as the case may be, in connection with, among other things, customer engagements, revenue sharing and pricing. Neither party is required to pay any fees to the other under the MOU, and Company and Uniserve are currently in the process of modelling their revenue sharing strategy.</p><p>Railtown is capable of readily deploying its technologies to Uniserve's customers, and expects to conclude one or more definitive agreements with Uniserve in the coming months.</p><p><u>September 23, 2022 News Release</u></p><p>In this news release, Railtown announced that it had entered into a service provider license agreement (the \"<b>SPLA</b>\") with Quisitive Technology Solutions Inc. (\"<b>Quisitive</b>\") pursuant to which the Company agreed to provide a white-label version of its technology to Quisitive to be branded and sold as Velocity Insights. The Company would like to clarify that the SPLA was technically an interim agreement with a term of six (6) months and was intended to be superseded by a longer-term definitive license agreement that has yet to be negotiated. In addition, each party had the ability to terminate the SPLA prior to the completion of the term by providing 30 days' written notice to the other party, with certain support obligations of Railtown continuing for a transition period of four (4) months following the effective date of termination.</p><p>The SLPA required the Company to provide a license to the technology and related support services to Quisitive at no cost, and the primary purpose of the agreement was to confirm the viability of the technology for use and integration with Quisitive's products and services, and to test the technology with up to 10 customers of Quisitive.  Despite the expiry of the SPLA and the acquisition of Quisitive by H.I.G. Capital in early 2025, the testing is ongoing and Quisitive continues to offer the technology to its customers.</p><p>Although Railtown has not generated any revenue from Quisitive or its customers to date, the Company anticipates entering into a revenue sharing agreement with Quisitive upon the adoption of any Quisitive technology that includes a version of the company's platform. In the meantime, the Velocity Insights product suite remains available for purchase on a stand-alone basis on Microsoft Marketplace.</p><p><u>June 28, 2024 News Release</u></p><p>In this news release, Railtown announced a strategic partnership with Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute (\"<b>Mila</b>\"). The Company would like to clarify that, under the partnership agreement governing the relationship between the parties, Railtown paid Mila the sum of <money>$10,000</money> plus applicable taxes - Mila's standard fee for new partners - in exchange for certain privileges typically provided to Mila's partners including having the Company's name or logo appear on Mila's website and certain promotional documents, and the ability to access and use certain of Mila's resources, including research, talent and intellectual property (such as, for example, Mila's expertise on advanced computing technologies, Mila's students for internship purposes, and a presence for Railtown in Mila's artificial intelligence \"hub\").  </p><p>The partnership agreement was for a term of 12 months and automatically terminated on June 19, 2025; however, the Company continues to engage with Mila and anticipates partnering again with Mila in the future.</p><p><u>July 23, 2024 News Release</u></p><p>In this news release, the Company announce that it had entered into a co-development agreement with the Alberta Machine Learning Institute (\"<b>Amii</b>\") pursuant to which the parties agreed to partner on a specific project and build related to Railtown's core technology. The Company would like to clarify that the relationship was governed by Amii's customary services contract and an accompanying statement of work (\"<b>SOW</b>\"), and that the term of the relationship was the longer of 14 months or one (1) month following the final day of employment of the Amii machine learning resident dedicated to the project (the \"<b>ML Resident</b>\").</p><p>In consideration for the services of both Amii and the ML Resident under the program covered by the agreement and SOW, Railtown paid Amii an aggregate of <money>$100,000</money> plus GST, being Amii's standard fee for programs of this nature. Although the Company no longer has access to Amii's resources following the automatic termination of the relationship in July 2025, the ML Resident was hired by Railtown following the completion of the program and is currently a full time employee.</p><p><u>June 9, 2025 News Release</u></p><p>In this news release, the Company announced a strategic partnership with ESGAI Technologies Inc. (\"<b>ESGAI</b>\") to co-develop an advanced suite of intelligent ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) software agents. The Company would like to clarify that the partnership is structured as a MOU between the parties that anticipates the execution and delivery of a formal license agreement (the \"<b>License Agreement</b>\") whereby ESGAI will license certain software technology owned and developed by Railtown in connection with the development of the agents.</p><p>The effective date of the MOU is June 6, 2025, and it automatically terminates upon the earlier of (a) the execution of the License Agreement, (b) the mutual written agreement of the parties, and (c) 180 days from the effective date. The Company complied with each of its obligations under the MOU; however, the parties were unable to negotiate the terms of the License Agreement prior to the automatic termination of the MOU on December 3, 2025, largely because such terms were predicated on ESGAI establishing a market for the agents first.</p><p>Regardless, Railtown remains committed to developing the ESG agent suite with ESGAI as circumstances allow. </p><p><u>July 28, 2025 News Release</u></p><p>In this news release, Railtown announced a strategic joint partnership with Braiyt AI Inc. (\"<b>Braiyt</b>\") to deliver AI technologies to Dubai and the broader Middle East region. The Company would like to retract the overly promotional disclosure in the news release and confirm that the partnership is structured as a MOU between Braiyt, Railtown and AIP, pursuant to which Braiyt agreed, for a term of three years, to promote the products and services of each of the Company, AIP and any affiliates of AIP in the Middle East as opportunities arise. In exchange, Braiyt is entitled to enter into a finder's fee arrangement with the relevant selling party on terms to be negotiated between the parties.</p><p><u>General</u></p><p>In certain of Railtown's previously filed continuous disclosure documents, the Company has used phrases such as \"<i>selling its AI services and solutions</i>\" that the BCSC believes may potentially be misleading given the lack of revenue reflected in the Company's financial statements at the time. While the Company acknowledges that the language may have been less than perfect and that a phrase such as \"<i>the AI services and solutions are available for sale</i>\" may technically have been more accurate, the Company would like to clarify that it has in fact generated nominal (i.e., non-material) sales revenue from paying customers.</p><p>In addition, the BCSC has expressed its concern over the accuracy of phrases such as \"<i>the platform is fully trained on clients' applications</i>\" (from Railtown's news release dated December 6, 2023), and that the system \"<i>continually trains on a client's application</i>\" and \"<i>automates a wide range of tasks associated with the client's application</i>\" (from Railtown's management discussion and analysis for the period ended June 30, 2025), because the Company either had no customers or a limited number of customers at the relevant time. The Company would like to clarify that it was using the word \"client\" in a general sense in this disclosure - that is, as a substitute for \"user\" and not in relation to a specific customer - and that the language was intended to convey how the Company's technology works once a customer downloads and connects to the platform. More specifically, once a customer downloads the Company's Railtracks agentic framework and connects to Conductr, the platform runs on the customer's own cloud infrastructure or on the customer's local computers or servers, with the result that the AI agent is able to access to the customer's data stored in those locations and learn by ingesting the data in real time.</p><p>Finally, Railtown would like to take this opportunity to confirm that the Company's primary focus for 2026 will be the building out of its Canadian agent development and deployment ecosystem with the Company's Canadian partners.</p><p><b>About Railtown</b></p><p>Railtown AI Technologies Inc. builds AI developer tools and agentic frameworks that power the next generation of intelligent applications. Its Platform - including real-time ingestion (Railengine), agent development frameworks (Railtracks ADK), and advanced observability (Conductr) - helps teams build, deploy, and operate AI agents with confidence and at scale.</p><p>For more information, visit <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/jNY0DHOLGV\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.railtown.ai</a>.</p><p><b>Follow us on social media</b></p><ul><li>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/vEzGBTojL1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/railtown-ai/</a> </li></ul><p><b>SUBSCRIBE FOR INVESTOR NEWS</b></p><p><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/JkYOjC7OXn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Click here</a> to receive our latest investor news alerts.</p><p><b>ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD</b></p><p>\"Cory Brandolini\" <br/>Cory Brandolini, Chief Executive Officer</p><p><b>INVESTOR CONTACT</b></p><div id=\"contactInfo\"><p>Rebecca Kerswell<br/>Investor Relations Contact<br/>Email: <a href=\"mailto:investors@railtown.ai\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">investors@railtown.ai</a> <br/>Phone: 1-604-417-4440</p></div><p><i>This news release contains forward-looking statements relating to the future operations of the Company and other statements that are not historical facts.

A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that a shareholder invested in a Fund is paid back to them.

The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations.

The actual source amounts of all Fund distributions will be included in the Fund’s annual or semi-annual reports. In addition, the tax treatment may differ from the accounting treatment used to calculate the source of the Fund’s distributions as shown on shareholders’ statements. Shareholders should refer to their Form 1099-DIV for the character and amount of distributions for income tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after December 31, 2026 and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV early in 2027.

The level of distribution amount shown is not guaranteed and special dividends may or may not be paid in the future. Further, no conclusions should be drawn about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount or rate of distribution shown.</p><p><b>Managed Distribution Plan. </b>The above distribution was declared in accordance with the Fund’s currently effective managed distribution plan (the “Plan”), whereby the Fund will make monthly distributions to shareholders at a fixed amount of <money><money>$0.05</money>8</money> per share. Thus, the distribution amount shown excludes special dividends (which are not paid pursuant to the plan). The Fund will generally distribute amounts necessary to satisfy the Fund’s Plan and the requirements prescribed by excise tax rules and Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan is intended to provide shareholders with a constant, but not guaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value of the Fund’s common shares, but there is no assurance that the Plan will be successful in doing so.</p><p>Under the Plan, to the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution rate. As a result, long-term capital gains and/or return of capital may be a material source of any distribution. No conclusions should be drawn about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of the Fund’s distributions or from the terms of the Fund’s Plan. The Board of Trustees (the “Board”) may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to Fund shareholders. No level of distribution can be guaranteed. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund’s common shares. The Plan is subject to the periodic review by the Board, including a yearly review of the annual minimum fixed rate to determine if an adjustment should be made.</p><p><b>Past Performance is No Assurance of Future Results. </b>Investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Investors should consider the investment objective, risks and expenses carefully.

There can be no assurance that the Fund will meet its investment objective. The Fund seeks to achieve this objective by investing globally in debt and equity securities of public and private companies, which includes, among other things, investments in closed‐end funds, special purpose acquisition companies (“SPACs”), reinsurance, and public and private debt instruments. The Fund also may utilize derivatives including but not limited to total return swaps, credit default swaps, options and futures, in seeking to enhance returns and/or to reduce portfolio risk.</p><p>The value of the Fund’s investments in equity securities of public and private, listed and unlisted companies and equity derivatives generally varies with the performance of the issuer and movements in the equity markets more generally. As a result, the Fund may suffer losses if it invests in equity instruments of issuers whose performance diverges from the Fund’s investment manager’s expectations or if equity markets generally move in a single direction and the Fund has not hedged against such a general move. The Fund invests in closed-end funds and SPACs, which are subject to additional risks and considerations. The performance of reinsurance-related securities and the reinsurance industry itself are tied to the occurrence of various triggering events, including but not limited to weather, natural disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, etc.), non-natural large catastrophes and other specified events causing physical and/or economic loss. To the extent the Fund invests in reinsurance-related securities for which a triggering event occurs, losses associated with such event could result in losses to the Fund’s investment, and a series of major triggering events affecting a large portion of the reinsurance- related securities held by the Fund could result in substantial losses to the Fund’s investment. The Fund may invest in high yield securities, which are speculative in nature and are subject to additional risk factors such as increased possibility of default, illiquidity of the security, and changes in value based on changes in interest rates. Changes in short-term market interest rates may directly affect the yield on the Fund’s common shares. If such rates fall, the Fund’s yield may also fall. If interest rate spreads on bonds and loans owned by the Fund decline in general, the yield on the bonds and loans will likely fall and the value of such bonds and loans may decrease. When short-term market interest rates rise, because of the lag between changes in such short-term rates and the resetting of the floating rates on bonds and loans in the Fund’s portfolio, the impact of rising rates will be delayed to the extent of such lag. Because of the limited secondary market for certain bonds and loans, the Fund’s ability to sell such securities in a timely fashion and/or at a favorable price may be limited. An increase in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the rate of interest payable on new bonds and loans acquired by the Fund, and it may also increase the price of bonds and loans purchased by the Fund in the secondary market. A decrease in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the price of bonds and loans in the Fund’s portfolio, which would cause the Fund’s net asset value to decrease. Investment in foreign borrowers involves special risks, including but not limited to potentially less rigorous accounting requirements, differing legal systems and potential political, social and economic adversity. The Fund may engage in currency exchange transactions to seek to hedge, as closely as practicable, all of the economic impact to the Fund arising from foreign currency fluctuations. Other risks include, but are not limited to, the use of derivatives, the potential lack of diversification in the Fund’s portfolio, and the fact that the Fund’s portfolio may be concentrated in a small group of industries or industry sectors from time to time. Investors should consult the Fund’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the materials on the Fund’s website for a more detailed discussion of these or other risk factors that affect the Fund.</p><p><b>About Saba Capital Income &amp; Opportunities Fund II. </b>Saba Capital Income &amp; Opportunities Fund II is a publicly-traded registered closed-end management investment company.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 27, 2026) - Gelum Resources Ltd. (CSE: GMR) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/GMRCF/\" title=\"View GMRCF stock overview\">GMRCF</a>) (\"Gelum\" or the \"Company\") reports that it has entered into an letter of intent under which Gelum can earn a <percent>100%</percent> interest in the Las Tinajas Gold Project (\"Las Tinajas\") covering 2,600 hectares (the \"Concessions\") in the north end of the Maricunga Gold Belt, Chile. Las Tinajas is located 120km northeast of Copiapó, in the Atacama Region of northern Chile (Figure 1).</p><p>Gelum CEO Henk Van Alphen stated, <i>\"Gelum is entering a new phase of corporate development. The acquisition of Las Tinajas is an event that will radically transform Gelum into a premier gold exploration company with a South American focus. We have had the people and partners within Gelum, and now we have the asset to greatly add shareholder value.\"</i></p><p><b>Las Tinajas Highlights</b></p><p>Las Tinajas is located at the north end of the Maricunga Belt, the largest gold belt in Chile, extending for 200 km with both porphyry and high-sulphidation types of mineralization containing a total of 103 million ounces<sup>*</sup>. The Las Tinajas 2600 Ha claim block lies between 3,600-4,000 metres above sea level and is accessible via a Codelco-maintained mining road. Gold mineralization at Las Tinajas is associated with silicified porphyry intrusions and associated diatreme breccias. Skarn features also occur in adjacent metasedimentary units. Since 1986, 64 drillholes totaling 10,990m have been drilled in three campaigns, the most recent being 16 holes totaling 2,831m drilled in 2024-2025 by Horizon Mining SA. Multiple historical holes have significant intervals of &gt;1g/t gold, with several ending in ≥1g/t gold, including (all are end of hole):</p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li>43m of 1.18 g/t Au (DT06)</li><li>35m of 1.23 g/t Au (TT014)</li><li>26m of 2.09 g/t Au (TT004)</li><li>58m of 1.42 g/t Au (TT027)</li><li>82m of 0.93 g/t Au (TDH-010)</li></ul><p>Only a small portion of the claim block has been drilled. There is significant potential to expand the known mineralized centres associated with the diatreme breccia. In addition, the drilling has not tested the favourable contact between the diatreme breccia and calcareous, reactive metasediments to the west. A thin layer of post-mineral volcanic material covers about <percent>40%</percent> of the claims and obscures broad zones of hydrothermal and skarn alteration.</p><p>Readers are cautioned that descriptions of historical drilling results reported here should be viewed primarily as a guidance for exploration drilling. The qualified person for this release has not done sufficient work to independently verify the historical sampling results described above.</p><p><b>Las Tinajas Details</b></p><p>Gold is associated with potassic, silicic and sericite alteration of a central, dacitic, diatreme breccia, with alteration/mineralization extending into adjacent calcareous sedimentary units. Gold occurs freely and as inclusions within disseminated pyrite-sphalerite-tennantite. The most intense sericitic alteration coincides with gold-zinc mineralization and a gold soil anomaly of &gt;500 ppb. The diatreme and associated surface alteration clearly extends to the west, north and east and offers excellent potential to increase the target size as indicated by numerous drill holes ending in mineralization. </p><p>Porphyry-style quartz veinlets with anomalous gold values occur in one drill hole that intercepted a weakly mineralized dacite porphyry plug and rhyolite dikes, suggesting presence of an Au-Cu-Mo dacite porphyry at depth, below the limits of historical drilling. In addition, clasts within the diatreme breccia host quartz stockworks that are closely similar in character to those in the porphyry gold deposits of the Maricunga belt.</p><p>An IP survey (dipole-dipole) completed in 1994 outlined two strong (&gt;40 millirad) northwest-trending chargeability zones spaced one kilometre apart, of which the southern anomaly coincided with known mineralization but was only drill-tested at the northwest end. The anomaly remains open and untested to the southeast.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/6458/285772_6af85e3194aee98c_002full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund’s Plan (as defined below). The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of the Fund’s distribution to shareholders may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that a shareholder invested in a Fund is paid back to them. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income.” The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV to shareholders for the calendar year that will describe how to report the Fund’s distributions for federal income tax purposes.</b></p><p>The determination of the actual source of distributions can only be made at year-end. The actual source amounts of all Fund distributions will be included in the Fund’s annual or semi-annual reports. In addition, the tax treatment may differ from the accounting treatment used to calculate the source of the Fund’s distributions as shown on shareholders’ statements. Shareholders should refer to their Form 1099-DIV for the character and amount of distributions for income tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after December 31, 2026 and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV early in 2027. Since each shareholder’s tax situation is unique, it may be advisable to consult a tax advisor as to the appropriate treatment of Fund distributions.</p><p>Effective after the close of business on June 4, 2021, Saba Capital Management, L.P. replaced Voya Financial as the investment adviser to Saba Capital Income &amp; Opportunities Fund (formerly known as the Voya Prime Rate Trust).

Further, no conclusions should be drawn about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount or rate of distribution shown.</p><p><b>Managed Distribution Plan. </b>The above distribution was declared in accordance with the Fund’s currently effective managed distribution plan (the “Plan”), whereby the Fund will make monthly distributions to shareholders at a fixed amount of <money><money>$0.08</money>5</money> per share. Thus, the distribution amount shown excludes special dividends (which are not paid pursuant to the plan). The Fund will generally distribute amounts necessary to satisfy the Fund’s Plan and the requirements prescribed by excise tax rules and Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan is intended to provide shareholders with a constant, but not guaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value of the Fund’s common shares, but there is no assurance that the Plan will be successful in doing so.</p><p>Under the Plan, to the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution rate. As a result, long-term capital gains and/or return of capital may be a material source of any distribution. No conclusions should be drawn about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of the Fund’s distributions or from the terms of the Fund’s Plan. The Board of Trustees (the “Board”) may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to Fund shareholders. No level of distribution can be guaranteed. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund’s common shares. The Plan is subject to the periodic review by the Board, including a yearly review of the annual minimum fixed rate to determine if an adjustment should be made.</p><p><b>Past Performance is No Assurance of Future Results. </b>Investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Investors should consider the investment objective, risks and expenses carefully.

There can be no assurance that the Fund will meet its investment objective. The Fund seeks to achieve this objective by investing globally in debt and equity securities of public and private companies, which includes, among other things, investments in closed‐end funds, special purpose acquisition companies (“SPACs”), reinsurance, and public and private debt instruments. The Fund also may utilize derivatives including but not limited to total return swaps, credit default swaps, options and futures, in seeking to enhance returns and/or to reduce portfolio risk.</p><p>The value of the Fund’s investments in equity securities of public and private, listed and unlisted companies and equity derivatives generally varies with the performance of the issuer and movements in the equity markets more generally. As a result, the Fund may suffer losses if it invests in equity instruments of issuers whose performance diverges from the Fund’s investment manager’s expectations or if equity markets generally move in a single direction and the Fund has not hedged against such a general move. The Fund invests in closed-end funds and SPACs, which are subject to additional risks and considerations. The performance of reinsurance-related securities and the reinsurance industry itself are tied to the occurrence of various triggering events, including but not limited to weather, natural disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, etc.), non-natural large catastrophes and other specified events causing physical and/or economic loss. To the extent the Fund invests in reinsurance-related securities for which a triggering event occurs, losses associated with such event could result in losses to the Fund’s investment, and a series of major triggering events affecting a large portion of the reinsurance- related securities held by the Fund could result in substantial losses to the Fund’s investment. The Fund may invest in high yield securities, which are speculative in nature and are subject to additional risk factors such as increased possibility of default, illiquidity of the security, and changes in value based on changes in interest rates. Changes in short-term market interest rates may directly affect the yield on the Fund’s common shares. If such rates fall, the Fund’s yield may also fall. If interest rate spreads on bonds and loans owned by the Fund decline in general, the yield on the bonds and loans will likely fall and the value of such bonds and loans may decrease. When short-term market interest rates rise, because of the lag between changes in such short-term rates and the resetting of the floating rates on bonds and loans in the Fund’s portfolio, the impact of rising rates will be delayed to the extent of such lag. Because of the limited secondary market for certain bonds and loans, the Fund’s ability to sell such securities in a timely fashion and/or at a favorable price may be limited. An increase in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the rate of interest payable on new bonds and loans acquired by the Fund, and it may also increase the price of bonds and loans purchased by the Fund in the secondary market. A decrease in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the price of bonds and loans in the Fund’s portfolio, which would cause the Fund’s net asset value to decrease. The Fund’s use of leverage, if any, through borrowings or issuance of preferred shares can adversely affect the yield on the Fund’s common shares. Investment in foreign borrowers involves special risks, including but not limited to potentially less rigorous accounting requirements, differing legal systems and potential political, social and economic adversity. The Fund may engage in currency exchange transactions to seek to hedge, as closely as practicable, all of the economic impact to the Fund arising from foreign currency fluctuations. Other risks include, but are not limited to, the use of derivatives, the potential lack of diversification in the Fund’s portfolio, and the fact that the Fund’s portfolio may be concentrated in a small group of industries or industry sectors from time to time. Investors should consult the Fund’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the materials on the Fund’s website for a more detailed discussion of these or other risk factors that affect the Fund.</p><p><b>About Saba Capital Income &amp; Opportunities Fund. </b>Saba Capital Income &amp; Opportunities Fund is a publicly-traded registered closed-end management investment company.

We were thrilled to have the opportunity to present this technology and the trial design to leaders in the field at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, where we received positive feedback and encouraging interest.\"</p><p>\"ATR-04 has previously been granted Fast Track designation from the FDA, signaling the potential for this candidate to help the approximately 150,000 people in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> annually who are impacted by major dermatologic toxicities associated with EGFR inhibitor treatments. Though an impactful treatment for various serious cancers, EGFR inhibition can result in adverse skin reactions that can make it difficult for patients to stay on these effective therapies.\"</p><p>Mr. Salva added: \"For our lead program, ATR-12, we continue to be encouraged by the promising safety data generated thus far in our Phase 1b trial and are optimistic that this candidate has the potential to be a life-changing innovation for people with Netherton syndrome, a rare, autosomal recessive disease, a chronic condition characterized by severe inflammation, pruritus, scaling, red, and dehydrated skin with no known cure and limited treatment options.\"</p><p>Mr. Salva continued: \"Also in 2025, we presented positive preclinical data for our ATR-01 program targeting ichthyosis vulgaris. Impacting approximately 1.3 million in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> with no treatment options beyond symptom management, ichthyosis vulgaris, is an autosomal semidominant genetic disorder caused by missing or abnormal filaggrin levels. The condition is characterized by generalized xerosis and fine, white to gray scales that are prominent on the abdomen, chest, and extensor surfaces of the extremities.\"</p><p>Mr. Salva concluded: \"2026 promises to be an important year for Azitra with several anticipated milestones including topline data for both our Phase 1b study in Netherton Syndrome and the Phase 1/2 study in EGFRi-associated rash. We also look forward to completing IND-enabling studies for ATR-01. We remain excited and optimistic as we work towards these key events, which we believe can help build significant value for our shareholders in 2026, while we progress innovative and potentially transformative treatments for patients with severe and life-altering dermatological conditions.\"</p><p><b><u>Pipeline Achievements and Upcoming Milestones</u></b></p><p><b>ATR-12 - Advancing Phase 1b Clinical Trial in Netherton Syndrome</b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>In June 2025, Azitra reported promising safety data with <percent>50%</percent> of patients enrolled.</li><li>ATR12-351, a live precision dermatology therapeutic candidate has been generally safe and well-tolerated with occasional, transient, mild to moderate symptoms at application site to date.</li><li>Topline data from the Phase 1b trial is anticipated H2 2026.</li></ul><p><b>ATR-04 – Addressing an Unmet Need for Cancer Patients in a Multi-billion Dollar Market Opportunity</b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>Dosed first patient in Phase 1/2 Trial for ATR-04 program targeting oncology patients with EGFRi-associated rash in Q3 2025.</li><li>Topline data from first cohort of Phase 1/2 trial expected around mid-2026.</li></ul><p><b>ATR-01 – Targeting Ichthyosis Vulgaris Which Impacts 1.3 million in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location></b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>Announced positive preclinical data for ATR-01 program in Q3 2025, demonstrating delivery of active, functional filaggrin through human stratum corneum and repair of damaged model skin</li><li>IND-enabling studies continue in 2026.</li></ul><p><b>Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2025</b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li><b>Research and Development (R&amp;D) expenses:</b> R&amp;D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2025, were <money><money>$4.8 million</money></money> compared to <money><money>$4.7 million</money></money> for the fiscal year 2024.<br/><br/></li><li><b>General and Administrative (G&amp;A) expenses: </b>G&amp;A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2025, were <money><money>$6.2 million</money></money> compared to <money><money>$6.3 million</money></money> for the fiscal year 2024.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Net Loss </b>was <money><money>$11.0 million</money></money> for the year ended December 31, 2025, compared to <money><money>$9.0 million</money></money> for the fiscal year 2024.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Cash and cash equivalents: </b> As of December 31, 2025, Azitra had cash and cash equivalents of <money><money>$2.1 million</money></money>.</li></ul><p><b>About Azitra, Inc.</b></p><p>Azitra, Inc. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative therapies for precision dermatology. Azitra's lead program, ATR-12, uses an engineered strain of <i>S. epidermidis</i> designed to treat Netherton syndrome, a rare, chronic skin disease with no approved treatment options. Netherton syndrome may be fatal in infancy with those living beyond a year having profound lifelong challenges. The ATR-12 program includes a Phase 1b clinical trial in adults with Netherton syndrome. ATR-04, Azitra's additional clinical program, utilizes another engineered strain of <i>S. epidermidis</i> for the treatment of EGFR inhibitor (\"EGFRi\") associated skin toxicity; a Phase 1/2 clinical trial has been initiated for this program. Azitra has received Fast Track designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration for this program to treat EGFRi associated rash, which impacts approximately 150,000 people in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>. The ATR-12 and ATR-04 programs were developed from Azitra's proprietary platform of engineered proteins and topical live biotherapeutic products that includes a microbial library comprised of approximately 1,500 bacterial strains. The platform is augmented by artificial intelligence and machine learning technology that analyzes, predicts, and helps screen the library of strains for drug like molecules.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p> </p><p> <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">NEW YORK</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BlackRock Utilities, Infrastructure, &amp; Power Opportunities Trust (NYSE: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/BUI/\" title=\"View BUI stock overview\">BUI</a>) (the \"Fund\") today announced the terms of transferable rights (\"Rights\") to be issued to the holders of the Fund's common shares of beneficial interest (par value <money><money>$0.00</money>1</money> per share) (\"Shares\") as of March 9, 2026 (the \"Record Date\"). Holders of Rights will be entitled to subscribe for additional Shares (the \"Offer\") at a discount to the market price of the Shares.</p><p>After considering a number of factors, including potential benefits and costs, the Fund’s Board of Trustees (the “Board”) and the Fund's investment adviser, BlackRock Advisors, LLC (the \"Adviser\"), have determined that it is in the best interests of both the Fund and its shareholders to conduct the Offer and increase the assets of the Fund available to take advantage of existing and future investment opportunities that are consistent with the Fund’s investment objectives to provide total return and income through a combination of current income and long-term capital appreciation.</p><p><b>All expenses of the Offer will be borne by the Adviser, and not by the Fund or any of the Fund's shareholders.</b></p><p>The Adviser believes this is an attractive time to raise additional assets for the Fund based on several factors, including the following potential benefits:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li><b>Infrastructure: </b>Infrastructure<b> </b>sits at the intersection of three structural mega forces - the Artificial Intelligence buildout, national security priorities, and the transition to a lower carbon economy - creating sustained investment opportunities. Additionally, listed infrastructure valuations are attractive relative to history, providing a compelling entry point for new capital.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Utilities:</b> Utilities have a pressing need to raise significant capital. Rising power demand and reshoring of power supply chains are stressing existing grids and triggering the largest utility capex cycle in decades, and the Adviser believes the Fund is well-positioned to deploy capital into these opportunities.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Reward</b>: Rights provide shareholders with an opportunity to buy new shares below market price or potentially realize value from the sale of Rights.<br/><br/></li><li><b>No offering fees</b>: The Adviser, not the Fund, is paying for the expenses of the Offer.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Lower expense ratio</b>: The Offer is anticipated to spread fixed operating costs across a larger asset base.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Enhanced liquidity</b>: The Offer creates the potential for increased trading volume and liquidity of Shares.</li></ul><p><b>The Fund expects to maintain its current distribution level following the Offer.</b> Shares issued pursuant to the Offer will be entitled to receive the monthly distribution expected to be payable in April 2026, but will <span class=\"bwuline\">not</span> be eligible for the distribution payable in March 2026.</p><p>Certain key terms of the Offer include:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li><b>Rights ratio:</b> Holders of Shares on the Record Date (\"Record Date Shareholders\") will receive one Right for each outstanding Share owned on the Record Date. Rights entitle the holder to purchase one new Share for every 4 Rights exercised (1-for-4); however, any Record Date Shareholder who owns fewer than four Shares as of the Record Date will be entitled to subscribe for one Share. Fractional Shares will not be issued upon the exercise of Rights.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Pricing formula:</b> The subscription price per Share (the \"Subscription Price\") will be determined on the expiration date of the Offer, which is currently expected to be April 2, 2026, unless extended by the Fund (the \"Expiration Date\"), and will be equal to <percent>95%</percent> of the average of the last reported sales price per Share on the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") on the Expiration Date and each of the four (4) immediately preceding trading days provided that, if such price is equal to or above net asset value (“NAV”) at the Expiration Date, it shall be reduced to <money><money>$0.01</money></money> below NAV on the Expiration Date (the \"Formula Price\"). If, however, the Formula Price is less than <percent>95%</percent> of the Fund's NAV per Share at the close of trading on the NYSE on the Expiration Date, the Subscription Price will be <percent>95%</percent> of the Fund's NAV per Share at the close of trading on the NYSE on the Expiration Date. The Subscription Price will be determined by the Fund on the Expiration Date.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Over-subscription privilege:</b> Record Date Shareholders who fully exercise all Rights issued to them can subscribe, subject to certain limitations and allotment, for any additional Shares which were not subscribed for by other holders of Rights at the Subscription Price, provided that the Board may eliminate this over-subscription privilege. Investors who are not Record Date Shareholders but who otherwise acquire Rights in the secondary market are not entitled to participate in the over-subscription privilege. If sufficient Shares are available, all Record Date Shareholders' over-subscription requests will be honored in full. If these requests exceed available Shares, they will be allocated pro rata among those fully exercising Record Date Shareholders who over-subscribe based on the number of Rights originally issued to them by the Fund.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Transferable rights:</b> Rights are transferable and are expected to be admitted for trading on the NYSE under the symbol \"<a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/BUI/\" title=\"View BUI stock overview\">BUI</a> RT\" during the course of the Offer and will cease trading April 1, 2026, one trading day before the Expiration Date. During this time, Record Date Shareholders may choose to sell their Rights if they do not intend to subscribe for additional Shares.</li></ul><p>The Offer will be made only by means of a prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus. The Fund expects to mail subscription certificates evidencing the Rights and a copy of the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus for the Offer to Record Date Shareholders within <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> shortly following the Record Date. To exercise their Rights, shareholders who hold their Shares through a broker, custodian or trust company should contact such entity to forward their instructions to either exercise or sell their Rights on their behalf. Shareholders who do not hold Shares through a broker, custodian, or trust company should forward their instructions to either exercise or sell their Rights by completing the subscription certificate and delivering it to the subscription agent for the Offer, together with their payment, at one of the locations indicated on the subscription certificate or in the prospectus supplement.</p><p><b>The information in this press release is not complete and is subject to change.
