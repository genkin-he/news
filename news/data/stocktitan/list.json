The company is increasing its commitment for the next 10 years by <percent>50%</percent>, pledging an additional <money>$150 million</money> to further empower and inspire the next generation of science and technology leaders, and bringing its 20-year investment in STS to <money>$250 million</money>. Regeneron is also the title sponsor of the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF), a program of the Society and the world’s largest high school science competition. Regeneron’s support for these two premier programs totals more than <money>$300 million</money> from 2017 to 2036.</p> <p>“My own scientific journey can be traced back to my experience with the Science Talent Search, which profoundly shaped who I am today. Participating in and becoming a winner of STS gave me the confidence to dedicate my life to science and the pursuit of inventing medicines that improve people’s lives,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., co-Founder, co-Chairman, President, and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron, and a 1976 STS Winner. “Today, Regeneron helps millions of people around the world facing serious diseases, which is a testament to what is possible when young scientific talent is nurtured. We are renewing our commitment to STS because we see in these students that same potential to transform our world, and we eagerly await their future contributions to science and humanity.”</p> <p>“At Regeneron, our success has always been driven by a deep belief in science and the people behind it,” said Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., co-Founder, co-Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer at Regeneron, and 1970 STS Alumnus. “This renewed, long-term investment in the Regeneron Science Talent Search – alongside our support for many other STEM education programs – reflects our confidence in the extraordinary potential of young scientists and our responsibility to help cultivate the curiosity, rigor and leadership that will shape the future of scientific discovery.”</p> <p><strong>What is the Regeneron Science Talent Search? </strong><br/>The Regeneron Science Talent Search, first established in 1942 as the Westinghouse Science Talent Search and later the Intel Science Talent Search, is now proudly supported by Regeneron as its third long-term sponsor. Since the beginning of this enduring sponsorship through this year’s STS, Regeneron and the Society have engaged and inspired more than 20,000 of the nation’s top young scientists, recognized 3,000 as Regeneron scholars, and awarded over <money>$31 million</money> in prizes.</p> <p>For 85 years, STS has recognized and championed the United States’ most promising young scientists whose groundbreaking research and leadership potential can fuel the breakthroughs of tomorrow. The competition serves as a catalyst for young scientists to build confidence, strengthen their research skills, and deepen their commitment to high-quality scientific inquiry.</p> <p>“In its 85th year, the Science Talent Search inspires and elevates the nation’s top high school students passionate about tackling the world’s most intractable problems,” said Maya Ajmera, President and CEO at Society for Science; Executive Publisher, Science News; and 1985 STS Alumna. “This renewal not only secures the legacy of this historic competition but also amplifies its impact in the years ahead. With Regeneron’s unwavering support, we will continue to empower the extraordinary – the rising stars and the legends in the making – who will define the future of science, innovation, and discovery.”</p> <p>Each year, nearly 2,500 of the nation’s top science and math students from across the United States enter STS, presenting original research spanning fields such as artificial intelligence, climate science, cancer biology, and renewable energy. Thousands of STS alumni have gone on to world-changing careers in science, with several earning esteemed honors, including the Nobel Prize, the Fields Medal, the National Medal of Science, and the MacArthur Fellowship for groundbreaking research across STEM fields. Since Regeneron became the title sponsor, entries to STS have increased by <percent>49%</percent>, reflecting a significant expansion in the program’s reach and impact on young scientists nationwide.</p> <p>As part of this sponsorship renewal, Regeneron will continue to support the Society's <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=q-vp1Klghzw1GbFsuEM6qPnhu-Urovokd1-9aduVos0xkwG7p3bOH9Yr7yj9xEKK_2XnoC52DnA62u5tYLtsypkNN57QH63mM9ypRG0SjQwASRIUhsuBXgVd5mteuMKo02aScVUVFl40a6X7JHvtqA==\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">STEM Outreach Programs</a>.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Ottawa, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - February 26, 2026) - <b>Stria Lithium Inc. (TSXV: SRA) </b>(\" <b>Stria </b>\" or the \" <b>Company </b>\") announced today the closing of its non-brokered private placement (the \" Offering \") previously announced on February 13, 2026 and February 25, 2026, and raised <money>$1,000,000</money> gross proceeds. The Company issued 2,127,659 Units at a price of <money>$0.47</money> per Unit. Each Unit is composed of one common share of the Company and one common share purchase warrant (the \"Warrant\"). Each Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one common share of the Company at a price of <money>$0.59</money> per share for a period of 36 months following the closing of the private placement, 26 February 2029.</p><p>The proceeds of the Financing will be used for advancement of the Company's mineral exploration assets and operations, potential future acquisitions, and general working capital purposes. No finder fees were paid in relation to the private placement and no insiders participated in the equity financing. </p><p>All securities issued pursuant to the Financing will be subject to a statutory hold period of four months and one day from the date of issuance in accordance with applicable securities laws and TSXV policies.</p><p><b>About Stria Lithium</b></p><p>Stria Lithium (TSXV: SRA) is an emerging resource exploration company developing Canadian lithium reserves to meet legislated demand for electric vehicles and their rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. The Company is committed to growth through responsible and efficient exploration and development of its mining assets.</p><p>Stria's Central Pontax Lithium Project covers 36 square kilometres, including 8 km of strike along the prospective Chambois Greenstone Belt. The region, known as the Canadian \"Lithium Triangle,\" is one of only a few known sources of lithium available for hard rock mining in North America. Stria's Pontax Central Project Joint Venture with Cygnus Metals now has a maiden JORC-compliant inferred mineral resource estimate of 10.1Mt at <percent>1.04%</percent> Li2O based on the central area of the known mineralisation.</p><p>This JORC estimate establishes Pontax Central as a significant occurrence in the emerging James Bay lithium region. Cygnus Metals, being an ASX issuer, adhered to Australian JORC Code 2012 guidelines, meaning that such mineral resource estimate is not necessarily compliant with CIM and National Instrument 43-101 standards and the Company is not considering them as such at this time.</p><p>Cygnus Metals is committed to fully funding and managing the current two-stage exploration and drilling program to a maximum of <money>$10 million</money> at Stria's Pontax property and will also pay Stria up to <money>$6 million</money> in cash. In return, Cygnus may acquire up to a <percent>70%</percent> interest in the property. Cygnus has fulfilled its stage 1 requirements within the agreement and has now earned its <percent>51%</percent> interest in the property.</p><p>As momentum builds for the green energy revolution and the shift to electric vehicles, governments in Canada and the United States are aggressively supporting the North American lithium industry, presenting the industry and its investors with a rare opportunity for growth and prosperity well into the next decade and beyond.</p><p>Stria is committed to exceeding the industry's environmental, social and governance standards. A critical part of that commitment is forging meaningful, enduring and mutually beneficial relationships with local communities and stakeholders, and engaging openly and respectfully as neighbours and collaborators in this project that has the potential to create lasting jobs and prosperity.</p><p>The scientific and technical content disclosed herein was reviewed and approved by Réjean Girard, P.Geo and president of IOS Services Geoscientifiques Inc., a qualified person as defined under National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.</p><p>Reference:<br/>JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of Pontax Project, James Bay Quebec, Brian Wolfe; Duncan Grieve, August 14, 2023.</p><p>For more information about Stria Lithium and the Pontax Lithium project, please visit <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/Q2pXKCEYma\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://strialithium.com</a>.</p><p>Follow us on:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li>Twitter @StriaLithium</li><li>Instagram @strialithium</li><li>Facebook <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/mjxEwsxX3K\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://www.facebook.com/strialithium</a></li><li>LinkedIn <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/kXYx2sYDpp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://www.linkedin.com/company/stria-lithium/</a></li></ul><div id=\"contactInfo\"><p>For more information on Stria Lithium Inc., please contact:</p><p>Dean Hanisch<br/>CEO, Stria Lithium<br/><a href=\"mailto:dhanisch@strialithium.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">dhanisch@strialithium.com</a></p><p>Investor Relations, Stria Lithium Inc.<br/><a href=\"mailto:info@strialithium.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">info@strialithium.com</a></p></div><p>Neither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the accuracy or adequacy of this release.</p><p><i><b>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information</b></i></p><p><i>Except for statements of historical fact, this news release contains certain forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities law.

            "title": "Waste Energy Corp to Present at Clean Energy & Renewables Virtual Investor Conference on March 5th; Highlights Permian Basin Deployment and 2026 Operational Roadmap | WAST Stock News",
            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><strong id=\"dateline\">MIDLAND, TX / <a href=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ACCESS Newswire</a> / February 26, 2026 / </strong>Waste Energy Corp (OTCQB:WAST) (\"WEC\" or the \"Company\"), a clean-energy company converting non-recyclable waste into usable fuel and renewable energy products, today announced that is will present at the Clean Energy &amp; Renewables Virtual Investor Conference on March 5, 2026, hosted by OTC Markets Group. Management will walk through the Company's waste conversion model, its first facility in Midland, Texas, and the operational milestones it expects to hit as commissioning draws near.</p><p><strong>Permian Basin: A Deliberate Starting Point</strong></p><p>The Midland facility wasn't placed in the Permian Basin by accident. The region offers something most early-stage energy infrastructure companies spend years chasing established distribution networks, industrial-scale fuel demand, and a deep base of energy capital that understands long-cycle infrastructure investment. Waste tire feedstock is also concentrated in the area, reducing inbound logistics costs and simplifying supply chain management.</p><p>Management sees the Permian not just as a first market, but as a template. If the model works here, it travels.</p><p><strong>What the Facility Actually Does</strong></p><p>Running Phase 1 at full capacity 30 tons per day, 330 days a year, the Midland plant is designed to process around 10,000 tons of waste tires annually. That's north of 300,000 passenger tires, or roughly 140,000 heavy truck tires, every year. Beyond the headline fuel output, the process recovers carbon black, syngas to run the system and high grade steel, all of which have established regional buyers. Steel alone could represent 990 to 1,485 tons of recoverable material annually, based on typical tire composition.</p><p>The Company is also working with local partners on landfill diversion and tire stockpile remediation in the Permian Basin, a community angle that has drawn interest from regional stakeholders.</p><p><strong>Rethinking How Carbon Credits Get Made</strong></p><p>The voluntary carbon market has a credibility problem. Credits get challenged, methodologies get disputed, and human reporting introduces errors that undermine confidence in the underlying asset. Waste Energy Corp has filed a patent for a system designed to fix that at the source.</p><p>The Company's patent-pending carbon credit automation system uses on-site video monitoring and sensor data to capture the conversion process in real time. That data is then run through a carbon credit algorithm when a match is confirmed, a credit is created automatically, minted as an NFT, and deposited directly into a digital wallet. The credits will be tradeable on the Company's own blockchain-based platform.</p><p>The logic is straightforward: remove the human from the reporting chain, and you remove the most common source of error and dispute. The result is a carbon credit with a verifiable, immutable record of exactly how and when it was generated, something the market has struggled to produce consistently.</p><p>For investors, this matters beyond the environmental angle. A carbon credit with a clean chain of custody and blockchain-based provenance is a more defensible asset. It's also a potential competitive advantage as regulators and institutional buyers apply increasing scrutiny to voluntary market integrity.</p><p><strong>The Carbon Credit Opportunity</strong></p><p>Based on combustion-equivalent emission factors, full-capacity throughput at the Midland facility could translate to roughly 12,800 metric tons of CO₂e annually. Whether that supports a meaningful credit position still depends on third-party validation and registry methodology, a process that hasn't concluded. Conservative estimates put potential annual credits in the 7,000 to 17,000 range, with a theoretical ceiling around 22,000 to 28,000. Management isn't booking that revenue yet, but the automated issuance system is designed to make the validation process faster, cleaner, and more defensible when it does get there.</p><p><strong>Midland Facility Commissioning &amp; Timelines</strong></p><p>The Midland facility is approaching commissioning. Management has committed to regular updates tied to actual milestones production ramp, first revenue, and expansion decisions rather than forward-looking timelines that tend to slip.</p><p>\"We are building Waste Energy Corp around disciplined execution and measurable results,\" said Scott Gallagher, Chairman &amp; CEO. \"Our first priority is to demonstrate a model that works operationally and economically. The Permian Basin deployment is not simply a site launch, it is the foundation for a scalable environmental infrastructure platform designed to generate diversified revenue streams, including fuel, recovered materials, and carbon-linked assets.\"</p><p>Gallagher continued, \"As we move toward commissioning, transparency becomes increasingly important. During the March 5th presentation, I will provide a clear framework outlining our expected path to revenue for the Midland facility. Shareholder value is created through execution, consistency, and scale and our focus in 2026 is to deliver on each of those.\"</p><p>The broader context isn't lost on the Company either. U.S. electricity demand hit record highs in 2025 and is projected to keep climbing, driven largely by the data center and AI infrastructure buildout that shows no sign of slowing. Data center electricity demand has grown more than <percent>400%</percent> over the past decade. Carbon credits, and U.S. data center power demand is forecast to reach 134 gigawatts by 2030, nearly triple current levels. That kind of structural demand creates a sustained need for new domestic energy sources, particularly ones that don't require greenfield grid infrastructure. Waste Energy Corp's model, modular, deployable near existing waste streams, and producing fuel that can flow through established regional distribution networks is designed for exactly that environment.</p><p>At the same time, institutional capital continues its rotation toward ESG-aligned infrastructure. Corporate power purchase agreements for zero-carbon electricity reached 29.5 gigawatts in 2025, the highest annual total on record, a signal that large buyers are actively seeking credible, verifiable clean energy and carbon assets. The Company believes its combination of waste diversion, domestic fuel production, and blockchain-verified carbon credits positions it squarely in that flow of capital. The Midland facility will ultimately have to prove the model but the market conditions for doing so have rarely been better aligned.</p><p><strong>Conference Details</strong></p><p>Waste Energy Corp will present at the Clean Energy &amp; Renewables Virtual Investor Conference on March 5, 2026.

As she reaches the end of her second term as CEO, the Board of Directors unanimously supports her remaining as Chair to ensure strategic continuity and guide Viridien’s long-term vision. Since 2018, her leadership has repositioned Viridien as an asset-light, technology-driven company with a stronger financial foundation and a more diversified portfolio.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The Board also unanimously approved the appointment of Henning Berg as Viridien’s new CEO, effective June 3, 2026. Henning Berg brings more than 27 years of experience in the oil and gas services industry, including several senior global leadership roles at SLB. He will join the Group on March 3, 2026, as Chief Operating Officer, ensuring a structured and gradual transition to the CEO role. His appointment as Director will also be submitted for approval at the upcoming General Meeting</p> <p align=\"center\" style=\"padding-left:4pt;\"><b>OUTLOOK</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">While short-term energy price volatility may result in some industry caution and softer activity in the first half of 2026, we anticipate a recovery in the second half. Under an overall business environment comparable to last year, Viridien expects to deliver around <money>$100 million</money> of Net Cash Flow in FY26, with a seasonal profile similar to 2025 and full allocation to further deleveraging. This target incorporates the planned Phase 1 expansion of our US HPC infrastructure and assumes a normalization of working capital, including PEMEX.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Looking further ahead, the structural dynamics of global energy supply increasingly point toward a new exploration upcycle<sup>7</sup>. Frontier discoveries and offshore deepwater developments, areas where Viridien holds clear technological leadership, will be critical to sustaining production and reinforce our confidence in the Group’s medium- and long-term trajectory.</p> <p align=\"center\">***</p> <p align=\"left\"><b>Q4 2025 conference call details</b><br/><br/>The press release and presentation will be made available on <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tJH3gufvMFZB8juXlhAbOQs2hjeqmuIbzPr90Nn4geVhUetAGjRlhF8OE-aeoej3zUbMZOtJ4jt7XaPoyCTplOEMxQlZhGIbOD7LdqA8XaU=\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.viridiengroup.com</a> at 5:45 p.m. (CET).<br/><br/>An English-language conference call is scheduled today at 6:00 p.m. (CET).</p> <p align=\"justify\">Participants must register for the conference call by clicking <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=VoRpnFOMFf1dGKGt7XcvdPmsf3ByL-a4t_IaTOjYQlEc73RyDLO00xV8Fd80WPae8SkaN8o2UTTlWrCAwfHXhr73AllpLNCvBRIHnwsrxcx3ejSZOONP3bMdBB4uu3zkIo1g4rZwd6C-Zp0PN5Aat_o0QI65udaDWBof2xhmFy0=\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to receive a dial-in number and PIN code.

There were two deaths due to bone marrow failure. For 7 of 13 patients treated with XOFIGO bone marrow failure was ongoing at the time of death. Among the 13 patients who experienced bone marrow failure, <percent>54%</percent> required blood transfusions. Four percent (<percent>4%</percent>) of patients in the XOFIGO arm and <percent>2%</percent> in the placebo arm permanently discontinued therapy due to bone marrow suppression. In the randomized trial, deaths related to vascular hemorrhage in association with myelosuppression were observed in <percent>1%</percent> of XOFIGO-treated patients compared to <percent>0.3%</percent> of patients treated with placebo. The incidence of infection-related deaths (<percent>2%</percent>), serious infections (<percent>10%</percent>), and febrile neutropenia (&lt;<percent>1%</percent>) was similar for patients treated with XOFIGO and placebo. Myelosuppression–notably thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, and leukopenia–has been reported in patients treated with XOFIGO.<br/><br/>Monitor patients with evidence of compromised bone marrow reserve closely and provide supportive care measures when clinically indicated. Discontinue XOFIGO in patients who experience life-threatening complications despite supportive care for bone marrow failure<br/><br/></li><li><b>Hematological Evaluation:</b> Monitor blood counts at baseline and prior to every dose of XOFIGO. Prior to first administering XOFIGO, the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be ≥1.5 × 109/L, the platelet count ≥100 × 109/L, and hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL. Prior to subsequent administrations, the ANC should be ≥1 × 109/L and the platelet count ≥50 × 109/L. Discontinue XOFIGO if hematologic values do not recover within 6 to 8 weeks after the last administration despite receiving supportive care<br/><br/></li><li><b>Concomitant Use With Chemotherapy:</b> Safety and efficacy of concomitant chemotherapy with XOFIGO have not been established. Outside of a clinical trial, concomitant use of XOFIGO in patients on chemotherapy is not recommended due to the potential for additive myelosuppression. If chemotherapy, other systemic radioisotopes, or hemibody external radiotherapy are administered during the treatment period, XOFIGO should be discontinued<br/><br/></li><li><b>Increased Fractures and Mortality in Combination With Abiraterone Plus Prednisone/Prednisolone:</b> XOFIGO is not recommended for use in combination with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone outside of clinical trials. At the primary analysis of the Phase 3 ERA-223 study that evaluated concurrent initiation of XOFIGO in combination with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone in 806 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic mCRPC patients, an increased incidence of fractures (<percent>28.6%</percent> vs <percent>11.4%</percent>) and deaths (<percent>38.5%</percent> vs <percent>35.5%</percent>) have been observed in patients who received XOFIGO in combination with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone compared to patients who received placebo in combination with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone. Safety and efficacy with the combination of XOFIGO and agents other than gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues have not been established<br/><br/></li><li><b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: </b>The safety and efficacy of XOFIGO have not been established in females. XOFIGO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female. Advise pregnant females and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise male patients to use condoms and their female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for 6 months after completing treatment with XOFIGO</li></ul><p><b>Administration and Radiation Protection:</b> XOFIGO should be received, used, and administered only by authorized persons in designated clinical settings. The administration of XOFIGO is associated with potential risks to other persons from radiation or contamination from spills of bodily fluids such as urine, feces, or vomit. Therefore, radiation protection precautions must be taken in accordance with national and local regulations</p><p><b>Fluid Status:</b> Dehydration occurred in <percent>3%</percent> of patients on XOFIGO and <percent>1%</percent> of patients on placebo. XOFIGO increases adverse reactions such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, which may result in dehydration. Monitor patients’ oral intake and fluid status carefully and promptly treat patients who display signs or symptoms of dehydration or hypovolemia</p><p><b>Injection Site Reactions:</b> Erythema, pain, and edema at the injection site were reported in <percent>1%</percent> of patients on XOFIGO</p><p><b>Secondary Malignant Neoplasms:</b> XOFIGO contributes to a patient’s overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure may be associated with an increased risk of cancer and hereditary defects. Due to its mechanism of action and neoplastic changes, including osteosarcomas, in rats following administration of radium-223 dichloride, XOFIGO may increase the risk of osteosarcoma or other secondary malignant neoplasms. However, the overall incidence of new malignancies in the randomized trial was lower on the XOFIGO arm compared to placebo (&lt;<percent>1%</percent> vs <percent>2%</percent>; respectively), but the expected latency period for the development of secondary malignancies exceeds the duration of follow-up for patients on the trial</p><p><b>Subsequent Treatment With Cytotoxic Chemotherapy:</b> In the randomized clinical trial, <percent>16%</percent> of patients in the XOFIGO group and <percent>18%</percent> of patients in the placebo group received cytotoxic chemotherapy after completion of study treatments. Adequate safety monitoring and laboratory testing was not performed to assess how patients treated with XOFIGO will tolerate subsequent cytotoxic chemotherapy</p><p><b>Adverse Reactions:</b> The most common adverse reactions (≥<percent>10%</percent>) in the XOFIGO arm vs the placebo arm, respectively, were nausea (<percent>36%</percent> vs <percent>35%</percent>), diarrhea (<percent>25%</percent> vs <percent>15%</percent>), vomiting (<percent>19%</percent> vs <percent>14%</percent>), and peripheral edema (<percent>13%</percent> vs <percent>10%</percent>). Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were reported in <percent>57%</percent> of XOFIGO-treated patients and <percent>63%</percent> of placebo-treated patients. The most common hematologic laboratory abnormalities in the XOFIGO arm (≥<percent>10%</percent>) vs the placebo arm, respectively, were anemia (<percent>93%</percent> vs <percent>88%</percent>), lymphocytopenia (<percent>72%</percent> vs <percent>53%</percent>), leukopenia (<percent>35%</percent> vs <percent>10%</percent>), thrombocytopenia (<percent>31%</percent> vs <percent>22%</percent>), and neutropenia (<percent>18%</percent> vs <percent>5%</percent>).</p><p>Please see the <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flabeling.bayerhealthcare.com%2Fhtml%2Fproducts%2Fpi%2FXofigo_PI.pdf&amp;esheet=54433531&amp;newsitemid=20260225000389&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=full+Prescribing+Information&amp;index=2&amp;md5=2ec60fd1a978ac9087891120683da216\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">full Prescribing Information</a> for XOFIGO (radium Ra 223 dichloride).</p><p><b>About Oncology at Bayer</b></p><p>Bayer is committed to delivering science for a better life by advancing a portfolio of innovative treatments.

systematically logged and photographed by Banyan geology personnel. All core samples (HTW and NTW diameter) were split on-site at Banyan's core processing facilities. Once split, half samples were placed back in the core boxes with the other half of split samples sealed in poly bags with one part of a three-part sample tag inserted within. Samples were delivered by Banyan personnel or a dedicated expediter to the Bureau Veritas, Whitehorse preparatory laboratory where samples are prepared and then shipped to Bureau Veritas's Analytical laboratory in Vancouver, B.C. for pulverization and final chemical analysis.</p><p>Core splits reported in this news release were analysed by Bureau Veritas of Vancouver, B.C., utilizing the four-acid digestion ICP-ES 35-element MA-300 or ICP-ES/MS 59-element MA-250 analytical package with FA-450 50-gram Fire Assay with AAS finish for gold on all samples. Samples returning &gt;10 g/t Au were reanalysed by fire assay with gravimetric finish on a 50g sample (FA-550). High-grade samples with documented visible gold are also analysed using metallic screen fire assay (FS-652). Bureau Veritas is an accredited lab following ISO/IEC 17025:2017 SCC File Number 15895.
