AgriBank's year-to-date return on assets (ROA) ratio of 52 basis points was slightly above the target of 50 basis points.</li><li><b>Credit quality: </b>Total loan portfolio credit quality remained strong, with 99.2 percent of loans classified as acceptable at December 31, 2025.</li><li><b>Liquidity and capital: </b>End-of-the-quarter liquidity was 147 days, well above the regulatory requirement. Capital also remained well above the regulatory minimums and company targets.</li></ul><p>\"AgriBank delivered another year of strong financial results in 2025, reflecting disciplined growth, prudent balance‑sheet management, and the underlying strength of our District,\" said AgriBank CEO Jeffrey Swanhorst. \"Higher net interest income was driven by favorable retail loan spreads and increased wholesale loan volume, while credit quality, capital, and liquidity remained strong. Together, these factors position AgriBank to continue providing reliable funding and financial solutions to our Farm Credit Association‑owners as they support farmers, ranchers, and rural communities through challenging economic and market conditions.\"</p><p><b>2025</b><b> Results of Operations</b></p><p>Net interest income was <money><money>$1.2 billion</money></money> for the year ended December 31, 2025, an increase of <money><money>$143.8 million</money></money>, or 13.5 percent, compared to the same period of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher spread income on retail loans in AgriBank's asset pool portfolio and on AgriBank's wholesale loan portfolio due to an increase in volume. These factors were somewhat offset by decreased spread income on investment securities due to the mix of investment securities. The benefit of equity financing in net interest income increased compared to the prior year, due to higher levels of equity partially offset by a decline in interest rates. Equity financing represents the benefit of non-interest bearing funding. With interest rates moving lower during the second half of 2025, opportunities were taken to call and refinance debt at lower levels. While some loans have followed this pattern, the repricing or conversion of loans has been slower, resulting in wider retail interest rate spreads.</p><p>Non-interest income was <money><money>$113.9 million</money></money> for the year ended December 31, 2025, an increase of <money><money>$5.0 million</money></money>, or 4.6 percent, compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily related to an increase in loan fees due to marginally higher conversion and commitment fees generating additional income during the year. The increase in non-interest income was partially offset by the reduction in mineral income related to lower oil prices.</p><p>Non-interest expense was <money><money>$235.9 million</money></money> for the year ended December 31, 2025, an increase of <money><money>$19</money></money>.1 million, or 8.8 percent, compared to the same period of the prior year. The increase was mainly due to dealer incentive expenses related to AgriBank's crop input financing portfolio. Loan servicing expense increased due to asset pool activity during 2025 and the second half of 2024. Additionally, contractor fees added to increased purchased services expense related to additional resources for technology projects during the year.</p><p><b>Loan Portfolio</b> </p><p>Total loans were <money><money>$177</money></money>.9 billion at December 31, 2025, an increase of <money><money>$13</money></money>.2 billion, or 8.0 percent, compared to December 31, 2024. This increase was primarily attributable to wholesale loan growth and increases in retail loans from expanded participation in asset pool programs.</p><p>AgriBank's credit quality reflects the overall financial strength of District Associations and their underlying portfolios of retail loans. AgriBank's portfolio was composed of 99.2 percent acceptable loans at December 31, 2025, compared to 99.4 percent at December 31, 2024. Loans classified as acceptable represent the highest-quality assets. The credit quality of AgriBank's retail loan portfolio decreased slightly to 94.9 percent classified as acceptable at December 31, 2025, compared to 95.7 percent acceptable at December 31, 2024.</p><p><b>Agricultural Conditions</b></p><p>On February 5, 2026, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS) released its initial forecast of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> aggregate farm income and financial conditions for 2026 and updated its 2025 forecast. The revised 2025 net farm income forecast of <money><money>$154.5 billion</money></money> represents a <money><money>$27.0 billion</money></money> increase from the 2024 level, up 21.2 percent, driven by increasing direct government payments and animal and animal product cash receipts, which more than offset rising expenses. When adjusting for inflation, the 2025 net farm income forecast is <money><money>$28.4 billion</money></money>, or 22.0 percent, above the 10-year average (2015-2024) net farm income in 2026 dollars. The initial 2026 net farm income projection of <money><money>$153.4 billion</money></money> represents a decrease of <money><money>$1.2 billion</money></money>, or 0.7 percent, from the revised 2025 net farm income forecast, and if realized, would be <money><money>$24.3 billion</money></money>, or 18.8 percent, above the 10-year average net farm income in 2026 dollars.</p><p>Many factors, including weather, trade, government and monetary policy, global agricultural production levels, and pathogenic outbreaks in livestock and poultry, may keep agriculture market volatility elevated. Implementation of cost-saving technologies, marketing methods, and risk management strategies will continue to cause a wide range of results among the respective agricultural producers.</p><p><b>Capital Resources</b> <b>and Liquidity</b></p><p>Total capital remained strong at <money><money>$10</money></money>.5 billion as of December 31, 2025, an increase of <money><money>$1</money></money>.0 billion compared to December 31, 2024. The increase was driven by AgriBank's strong net income and the issuance of capital stock, which were partially offset by cash patronage declared, consistent with AgriBank's capital plan. AgriBank exceeded all regulatory capital minimum requirements, including additional regulatory buffers.</p><p>Cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled <money><money>$25</money></money>.4 billion and <money><money>$25</money></money>.1 billion at December 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively. AgriBank's end-of-the-period liquidity position represented 147 days coverage of maturing debt obligations, which supports operational demands, and was well above the 90-day minimum established by AgriBank's regulator.</p><p><b>About AgriBank </b></p><p>AgriBank is part of the customer-owned, nationwide Farm Credit System.

Continued approval for this indication, which was based on an improvement in annualized growth velocity (AGV), may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).</p> <p>Achondroplasia is a rare genetic condition causing skeletal dysplasia and, for many affected individuals, an increased risk of muscular, neurological, and cardiorespiratory complications. YUVIWEL is a prodrug of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) administered once weekly, designed to provide continuous exposure of active CNP to receptors on tissues throughout the body to counteract the overactive FGFR3 signaling in achondroplasia.</p> <p>“The approval of once-weekly YUVIWEL is a major step forward in the treatment of children with achondroplasia, giving physicians for the first time the option of prescribing a once-weekly medicine backed by compelling efficacy and excellent tolerability data from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials,” said Carlos A. Bacino, MD, FACMG, Professor of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children’s Hospital. “My goal is to help children and parents develop care plans tailored to their individual needs and objectives, and I look forward to adding YUVIWEL to my discussions with them.”</p> <p>“Little People of America, the largest national advocacy and support organization for people with dwarfism, is committed to ensuring that the voices of people with dwarfism remain central in conversations about research and medical options such as YUVIWEL,” said the Board of Directors of Little People of America. “We champion dwarf and disability pride, advocate for inclusion and respect, and foster open dialogue across diverse perspectives. Our goal is to empower individuals and families to make healthcare decisions that reflect their own values and experiences, while pushing for research efforts and new treatment options such as this that could have the potential to support outcomes that truly matter to our community.”</p> <p>The FDA based its approval of YUVIWEL on their review of the clinical package for TransCon CNP submitted with the Company’s New Drug Application, which included safety and efficacy data from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials and up to three years of open-label extension data. The pivotal ApproaCH Trial data is available in <em>JAMA Pediatrics</em>.<sup>i</sup></p> <p>“We are confident in YUVIWEL’s potential to transform the treatment of achondroplasia and are deeply grateful to patients, clinicians, and advocates for their many contributions to this important milestone,” said Jan Mikkelsen, President and Chief Executive Officer at Ascendis Pharma. “We have listened to advocacy groups for people with dwarfism to ensure we address what the community actually cares about. This reflects our ongoing commitment to pursue outcomes that patient communities have told us are important to them, and gives the achondroplasia community a new way to look at the promise of pharmacological treatment options.”</p> <p>Ascendis expects to make YUVIWEL available through prescribing physicians in the United States during the early part of the second quarter of 2026. Ascendis plans to offer a suite of patient services for YUVIWEL through its U.S. Ascendis Signature Access Program (A.S.A.P.), including support navigating the treatment journey and financial assistance programs for eligible patients.</p> <p>With this approval, the FDA also issued a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV), which confers priority review to a subsequent drug application that would not otherwise qualify for priority review. This program is designed to encourage development of new drugs and biologics for the prevention or treatment of rare pediatric diseases.</p> <p><strong>Conference Call and Webcast Information</strong><br/>Ascendis will host a call to review the FDA approval of YUVIWEL on Monday, March 2, 2026, at 8:00 am ET.

While historically considered a bone growth disorder, the FGFR3 variant seen in achondroplasia is expressed in tissues throughout the body, and is associated with an increased risk of muscular, neurological, and cardiorespiratory complications in addition to skeletal dysplasia. Medical complications of achondroplasia can vary from individual to individual and across different stages of life. Throughout infancy and childhood, observed complications include spinal abnormalities, enlarged brain ventricles, impaired muscle strength and reduced stamina, hearing deficits and chronic ear infections, upper airway obstructions, sleep-disordered breathing, hip problems, leg bowing, and chronic pain; some of which persist or worsen in adulthood. These medical complications can affect quality of life, physical well-being, influenced by a range of clinical, social, and individual factors. Some individuals with achondroplasia require multiple procedures and surgeries to address specific functional or anatomical concerns.</p> <p><strong>About Ascendis Pharma A/S</strong><br/>Ascendis Pharma is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on applying our innovative TransCon technology platform to make a meaningful difference for patients.

(\"Algo Grande\") (TSXV:ALGR)(OTC:<a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/KNDYF/\" title=\"View KNDYF stock overview\">KNDYF</a>)(FRA:KM00) announces the closing of its previously announced non-brokered private placement and the election of three new directors at its Annual General Meeting held on February 25, 2026.</p><p>Pursuant to its news releases dated February 11, 2026 and February 19, 2026, the Company has closed its previously announced non-brokered private placement (the \"Offering\") of common shares in the capital of the Company (the \"Shares\"), at a deemed price of <money>$0.65</money> per Share. The Offering consisted of 10,037,020 Shares for aggregate gross proceeds of <money>$6,524,063.</money></p><p>The Offering will fund the next phase of exploration at the Company's <percent>100%</percent>-owned Adelita Project in Sonora, Mexico, focused on a Phase II drill program. Phase I drilling at the Cerro Grande skarn intersected multiple stacked Cu-Au-Ag skarn horizons at depth, including skarn zones that had not been identified by historic drilling. The upcoming program will target expansion drilling at Cerro Grande and first-pass drilling along an approximately 6-kilometre prospective limestone corridor hosting multiple, undrilled, outcropping skarn targets. Proceeds from the Offering will also be used for additional operating costs and general working capital requirements.</p><p>Commenting on the opportunity at Adelita, newly elected Director Raymond Jannas stated: \"The Adelita Project exhibits many of the characteristics we look for in emerging district-scale systems, high-grade skarn mineralization with clear geological vectors toward a deeper potential porphyry source. What excites me most is the combination of compelling geology and a focused, determined team that is executing with discipline. With capital in place and a clear exploration roadmap, Algo Grande is well positioned to unlock the broader potential of this system.\"</p><p>In connection with the closing of the Offering, the Company paid certain eligible finders (each, a \"Finder\") aggregate cash commissions of <money>$169,605.44</money>, being equal to <percent>7%</percent> of the aggregate gross proceeds raised from those purchasers introduced by such Finder, and issued 355,863 common share purchase warrants (each, a \"Finder Warrant\") being equal to <percent>7%</percent> of the number of Shares purchased by those purchasers introduced by such Finder. Each Finder Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire a Share (each, a \"Finder's Warrant Share\") at an exercise price of <money>$0.65</money> per Finder's Warrant Share until the date that is three years after issuance.</p><p>Additionally, Canaccord Genuity Corp. (\"Canaccord\") acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Offering. The Company paid Canaccord a corporate finance fee of <money>$50,000</money> (the \"Corporate Finance Fee\"). The Corporate Finance Fee was settled through the issuance of 76,923 Shares at a deemed price of <money>$0.65</money> per Share.</p><p>Securities issued in the Offering are subject to a four-month hold period in accordance with applicable securities laws, which will expire four months and one day from the date of closing of the Offering. The Offering is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, receipt of all necessary approvals, including approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.</p><p>The Company also announces that at its Annual General Meeting held on February 25, 2026, shareholders approved all matters brought before the meeting, including the election of three new directors:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><p>Raymond Jannas</p></li><li><p>Hunter Scharfe</p></li><li><p>Enrico Gay</p></li></ul><p>The appointments follow the Company's previously announced board strengthening initiatives (see news release dated February 11, 2026).</p><p>Certain directors of the Company (the \"Insiders\") subscribed for an aggregate of 77,155 Shares for aggregate gross proceeds of <money>$50,150.75</money> in the Offering. The Insiders' participation constitutes a \"related party transaction\" within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - <i>Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions</i> (\"MI 61-101\"). The Company is relying on the exemption from the valuation requirements and minority shareholder approvals in MI 61-101 pursuant to subsections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101, respectively, as the value of the Insiders' participation in the Offering does not represent more than <percent>25%</percent> of the Company's market capitalization, as determined in accordance with MI 61-101.</p><p>This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities in the United States. The securities have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"U.S. Securities Act\"), or any state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons unless registered under the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or an exemption from such registration is available.</p><p><strong>About Algo Grande Copper Corp.</strong><br/>Algo Grande Copper Corp. is a growth-focused mineral exploration company advancing the Adelita Project, a district-scale, multi-system copper-gold-silver opportunity positioned in the prolific Arizona-Sonora copper belt.</p><p>The company is dedicated to unlocking the full potential of this under-explored corridor through disciplined data-driven exploration, technical excellence, and a firm commitment to value creation for shareholders. The 5,895-hectare Adelita Project is anchored by the high-grade Cerro Grande Cu-Au-Ag skarn discovery, which exhibits strong continuity along a defined corridor extending over 6 kilometers. Reprocessing of legacy geophysical data and field mapping indicate the presence of a potential porphyry system at depth, suggesting a classic skarn-porphyry mineralization model similar to major deposits found throughout northwestern Mexico.</p><p>ON BEHALF OF ALGO GRANDE COPPER CORP.</p><p>Enrico Gay<br/>Chief Executive Officer</p><p>For more information, please contact:</p><p>E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:info@algo-grande.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">info@algo-grande.com</a></p><p>Website: <a href=\"https://pr.report/j58y\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.algo-grande.com</a></p><p><strong>Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information</strong></p><p><i>NEITHER THE TSX VENTURE EXCHANGE NOR ITS REGULATION SERVICES PROVIDER (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN THE POLICIES OF THE TSX VENTURE EXCHANGE) ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS RELEASE.</i></p><p><i>This news release contains statements and information that, to the extent that they are not historical fact, constitute \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable securities legislation.

The Delivra Health portfolio features innovative brands Dream Water® and LivRelief™, which deliver relief from common health issues such as sleeplessness, chronic pain and anxiety.</p><p>During the first half of fiscal 2026, the Company has seen encouraging momentum in its targeted e-commerce strategy and continued growth within the Dream Water® brand. Year-to-date e-commerce sales increased <percent>26%</percent> for Dream Water® and <percent>28%</percent> for LivRelief™, reflecting strong consumer engagement and repeat purchasing behavior. At the same time, overall revenue has been impacted by temporary shifts in customer ordering patterns across certain retail markets, along with the transition of our licensed LivRelief™ Infused distribution channel. While these factors have created near-term variability in reported results, underlying consumer demand for the Company's core brands remains solid, and management is actively addressing fluctuations in distribution timing and engaging in channel optimization to stabilize and accelerate growth in the second half of fiscal 2026.</p><p><b>Management Commentary</b></p><p>\"While our results this quarter reflect temporary timing variability in certain retail markets, we are encouraged by the strength of our core business fundamentals. Our targeted e-commerce strategy continues to deliver measurable growth, our U.S. expansion remains a key driver, and consumer demand for both Dream Water® and LivRelief™ continues to develop,\" said Gord Davey, President and Chief Executive Officer of Delivra Health Brands Inc. \"We are focused on disciplined execution — strengthening distribution, optimizing customer mix, advancing innovation, and investing in scalable revenue channels. As we move through the second half of fiscal 2026, our priority remains clear: stabilize retail ordering patterns, reignite growth in licensed markets, and continue expanding high-margin direct-to-consumer and U.S. retail opportunities.

This net decrease was primarily due to lower sales of Dream Water® in the U.S. and Canada by <money>$183</money>, lower sales of LivRelief™ OTC by <money>$93</money> impacted by the timing of customer ordering patterns and partially, offset by growing ecommerce LivRelief™ OTC sales, and finally lower sales of LivRelief™ Infused topical creams by <money>$45</money> due to the transition to a new licensed distribution partner. </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><b>Gross profit and gross profit margin:</b> In the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company reported gross profit of <money>$972</money> and a gross profit margin of <percent>40%</percent> as compared to <money>$1,294</money> and <percent>47%</percent> in the same period last year. The decrease in gross profit is driven by lower revenue and higher product cost due to price increases by certain vendors and the reduction in gross profit margin was the result of a different product and customer mix in this quarter compared to same quarter last year.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><b>Expenses including selling, general and administrative (\"SG&amp;A\") expenses and excluding non-cash items</b>: In the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company reported expenses of <money>$1,391</money> as compared to <money>$1,544</money> in the same period last year, representing a <money>$153</money> or <percent>10%</percent> decrease. The decrease was mainly driven by lower investments in marketing campaigns and digital marketing programs of <money>$182</money> or <percent>32%</percent>, offset by a slight increase in general and administrative costs of <money>$29</money> or <percent>3%</percent> mainly driven by increased investments in investor relation programs. </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><b>Adjusted EBITDA</b><sup><b>(1)</b></sup><b>:</b> In the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company reported Adjusted EBITDA of <money>$(369)</money> as compared to <money>$(194)</money> in the same period last year.

These declines were partially offset by increased e-commerce sales of LivRelief™ OTC by <percent>28%</percent> and Dream Water® products in Canada and USA by <percent>26%</percent> driven by strong consumer demand and online marketing.

Prior year fiscal 2025 first half sales and marketing expenses were higher than the first half of fiscal 2026 sales and marketing expenses by <money>$426</money> or <percent>34%</percent> given that the Company released in November 2024 two major marketing campaigns, 'Shush Your Mind' for Dream Water® and 'Quiets Chronic Pain' for LivRelief™. General and administrative costs were higher in the first half of fiscal 2026 compared with same period last year by <money>$115</money> or <percent>6%</percent> mainly as a result of higher investor relation programs and higher professional and consulting services offset by lower salaries costs. </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><b>Adjusted EBITDA</b><sup><b>(1)</b></sup><b>:</b> In the six months ended December 31, 2025, the Company reported Adjusted EBITDA of <money>$(313)</money> compared to <money>$(176)</money> in the same period last year, representing a <money>$(137)</money> year-over-year reduction.

Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of the Company's loss from operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and adjusted for share-based compensation, common shares issued for services, fair value effects of accounting for biological assets and inventories, asset impairment and write-downs, and other non-cash items, and is a non-IFRS measure.</p><p>This measure can be used to analyze and compare profitability among companies and industries, as it eliminates the effects of financing and capital expenditures. It is often used in valuation ratios and can be compared to enterprise value and revenue. This measure does not have any standardized meaning according to IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.</p><p>There are no comparable IFRS financial measures presented in Delivra Health's financial statements. Reconciliations of the supplemental non-IFRS measure are presented in the Company's management discussion and analysis for the three and six months ended December 31, 2025 (the \"<b>Q2 2026 MD&amp;A</b>\"). This non-IFRS financial measure is presented because management has evaluated the financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items and believes that the non-IFRS financial measure presented provides additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the business. The Company believes that the supplemental measure provides information which is useful to shareholders and investors in understanding the Company's performance and may assist in the evaluation of the Company's business relative to that of its peers.</p><p>The non-IFRS financial measure should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with the IFRS financial measures presented in the Company's financial statements. For more information, please see \"Adjusted EBITDA (non-IFRS measure)\"  and \"Non-IFRS Measures\" in the Q2 2026 MD&amp;A, which is available under the Company's SEDAR+ profile on <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/N3KpqSPxRw\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.sedarplus.ca</a>.</p><p><b><font style=\"font-size: 11px;\">Notes:</font></b></p><ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11px;\"><li>This is a non-IFRS reporting measure.

The PAH enzyme is required for the metabolism of Phe, an essential amino acid found in most protein-containing foods. If functional enzyme is not present in sufficient quantities, Phe accumulates to abnormally high levels in the blood and becomes toxic to the brain, resulting in a variety of complications including severe intellectual disability, seizures, tremors, behavioral problems and psychiatric symptoms.</p><p>As a result of newborn screening efforts implemented in the 1960s and early 1970s, virtually all individuals with PKU born after this period in countries with newborn screening programs are diagnosed at birth and treatment is implemented soon after.</p><p>PKU can be managed with a severe Phe-restricted diet, supplemented by low-protein modified foods and Phe-free medical foods; however, it is difficult for most individuals to adhere to this strict diet to the extent needed to achieve adequate control of blood Phe levels. Dietary control of Phe in childhood can prevent major developmental issues and neurological consequences, but poor Phe control in adolescence and adulthood is associated with a range of neuropsychological deficits and functional impairment.</p><p><b>PALYNZIQ <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Indication and Important Safety Information</b></p><p>PALYNZIQ<sup>®</sup> (pegvaliase-pqpz) is a phenylalanine (Phe)-metabolizing enzyme indicated to reduce blood Phe concentrations in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with phenylketonuria (PKU) who have uncontrolled blood Phe concentrations greater than 600 micromol/L (10 mg/dL) on existing management.</p><p><b>BOXED WARNING: ANAPHYLAXIS</b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>Anaphylaxis has been reported after administration of PALYNZIQ and may occur at any time during treatment.</li><li>Administer the initial dose of PALYNZIQ under the supervision of a healthcare provider equipped to manage anaphylaxis, and closely observe patients for at least 60 minutes following injection.
