            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p> <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.midand\">MIDLAND, Texas</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--New Era Energy &amp; Digital, Inc. (Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/NUAI/\" title=\"View NUAI stock overview\">NUAI</a>) (“New Era” or the “Company”), a developer and operator of next-generation digital infrastructure and integrated power assets in the Permian Basin, today announced it has entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent (\"LOI\") to acquire approximately 54 acres of strategically located land adjacent to its Texas Critical Data Centers (“TCDC”) campus in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.ector\">Ector County, Texas</location>.</p><div id=\"bwbodyimg\" style=\"width: 150px; float:left; padding-left:0px; padding-right:20px; padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;\"><img alt=\"Site Overview\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20260226055146/en/2732622/4/New_Era.jpg\"/><p style=\"font-size:85%;\">Site Overview</p></div><p>The contemplated acquisition was undertaken as part of ongoing lease negotiations with a leading hyperscale tenant and partners, where securing the additional acreage emerged as a key milestone in advancing discussions. This development is accompanied by continued site advancement, including initial land clearing, removal of out-of-service and abandoned pipeline infrastructure, relocation of active lines, and subsurface soil sampling to support civil engineering design. These activities are intended to optimize the developable footprint and maximize usable acreage for data center deployment.</p><p>By seeking to consolidate this corridor, New Era is looking to enhance its ability to structure direct power solutions and optimize interconnection design as it advances development of its now 438-acre, master-planned TCDC campus, which is designed to scale to more than 1 gigawatt over time.</p><p>The additional acreage would expand New Era’s capacity to:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Directly on next for major power offtake arrangements with nearby energy generation and transport infrastructure</li><li>Negotiate more efficient and flexible interconnection structures</li><li>Reduce exposure to broader grid congestion and transmission constraints; and</li><li>Enhance redundancy, reliability, and long-term expansion flexibility</li></ul><p>The Company expects control of the corridor between operating generation assets and its campus footprint may potentially increase New Era’s negotiating leverage with power producers while improving development sequencing. It also expands the Company’s options for transmission access and energy integration, which are critical for hyperscale and high-performance computing tenants requiring scalable, resilient power infrastructure.</p><p>E. Will Gray II, CEO of New Era Energy &amp; Digital commented: “By taking the first step to secure this additional 54 acres, we are seeking to strengthen our strategic land position between major power generation and transmission assets and take a pivotal step toward finalizing a definitive lease agreement with our end tenant. This transaction would further reinforce TCDC’s positioning as an integrated power and digital infrastructure platform designed for long-term expansion and operational reliability.”</p><p><b>About New Era Energy &amp; Digital, Inc.<br/></b>New Era Energy &amp; Digital, Inc.
