(Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/GSAT/\" title=\"View GSAT stock overview\">GSAT</a>) (\"Globalstar\" or the \"Company\") today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2025.</p><p>Globalstar reported full year revenue of <money><money>$273.0 million</money></money>, representing a <percent>9%</percent> increase from 2024, and lower net loss, delivering an Adjusted EBITDA* margin of <percent>50%</percent>, reflecting disciplined execution and continued progress across its business. Both total revenue and Adjusted EBITDA margin were in line with guidance.</p><p>“2025 was a transformational year for Globalstar,” said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, Globalstar's CEO. “We advanced our strategy across every dimension of the business: from global infrastructure expansion to product innovation and growing commercial adoption across government, enterprise, and industrial markets. We expanded our addressable markets and validated technologies that position us at the center of next-generation satellite and private wireless connectivity. Throughout the year, we have made significant progress with our satellite and ground station partners and are now poised to deploy not only the satellites to replenish our existing constellation but also extend our reach with our third-generation system.\"</p><p>Dr. Jacobs continued, \"As we enter 2026, we believe the momentum we have built gives us a strong foundation to scale. With replacement 2nd generation satellites rolling off the line, continued progress on key regulatory and network infrastructure initiatives, the commercial rollout of two-way IoT capabilities, and traction for XCOM RAN, we are moving decisively from groundwork to growth. We believe Globalstar is uniquely positioned to deliver differentiated connectivity solutions that combine satellite innovation, licensed spectrum, and proprietary wireless technology to meet the evolving needs of customers worldwide.”</p><p><b>2025 OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS</b></p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li><i>Advanced Development of Extended MSS Network</i><ul class=\"bwlistcircle\"><li><i>Infrastructure Investment for Long-Term Growth</i>: Progressed global ground station expansion, including new construction and existing site expansion in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/eur\">Europe</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/asp\">Asia</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LB/nam\">North America</location>, strengthening capacity, redundancy, and readiness for next-generation services.</li><li><i>Satellite Construction Milestone Progress</i>: Completion of critical design review for next-generation C-3 satellites completed by MDA Space.</li></ul></li><li><i>Commercial IoT Market Expansion</i><ul class=\"bwlistcircle\"><li><i>Expanded Product and Solution Portfolio:</i> Introduced two-way satellite IoT capabilities and advanced higher-value offerings designed to support enterprise, government, and industrial applications requiring reliable command and control.

The increase in total revenue was due primarily to performance bonuses earned during the fourth quarter of 2025, as well as higher wholesale capacity services revenue resulting from additional service fees associated with the reimbursement of network-related costs.</p><p>Revenue was also impacted favorably by (1) an increase in Commercial IoT related revenue due to higher average subscribers and device sales, which was offset partially by a decline in Duplex and SPOT driven revenue due to subscriber churn; and (2) revenue recognized under our service agreement with Parsons Corporation as we moved beyond the proof of concept phase during 2025, which was offset by a decrease in revenue from XCOM RAN sales.</p><p><i>Loss from Operations</i></p><p>Loss from operations was <money><money>$0.4 million</money></money> during the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to a loss from operations of <money><money>$4.2 million</money></money> during the prior year's fourth quarter. This improvement was due to higher revenue (as discussed above) offset partially by an increase in operating expenses (as discussed below).</p><p>During the fourth quarter of 2025, higher cost of services, marketing, general and administrative (\"MG&amp;A\") expenses and cost of subscriber equipment sales were offset partially by lower stock-based compensation expenses. Higher cost of services resulted primarily from network operating costs to support the build out of our next-generation satellite and ground network infrastructure, a significant portion of which are reimbursed to us, and this consideration is recognized as revenue. Additionally, costs increased to support the development of XCOM RAN technology and new MSS products. MG&amp;A expense was higher than the prior year's fourth quarter due primarily to legal and professional fees.</p><p>The cost of subscriber equipment sales increased during the fourth quarter of 2025 due to higher hardware sales as well as <money><money>$1.1 million</money></money> in expense related to tariffs on equipment imported and re-exported to foreign subsidiaries. These tariffs were previously recorded as recoverable duty drawbacks but are no longer deemed probable of being refunded.</p><p><i>Net Loss</i></p><p>Net loss was <money><money>$11.6 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to net loss of <money><money>$50.2 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2024. This improvement was due primarily to a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the paydown of the 2023 <percent>13%</percent> Notes recorded during the fourth quarter of 2024. Favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to the remeasurement of intercompany balances as well as a non-cash gain on the quarterly mark-to-market adjustment of our derivative asset gain were offset by higher interest expense resulting from our recognition of non-cash imputed interest related to the 2024 Prepayment Agreement (as defined in our periodic reports).</p><p><i>Adjusted EBITDA</i></p><p>Adjusted EBITDA increased to <money><money>$32.4 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to <money><money>$30.4 million</money></money> for the same period in 2024. This <percent>7%</percent> increase was due to an increase in revenue of <money><money>$10.8 million</money></money> offset partially by a <money><money>$8.8 million</money></money> increase in operating expenses (excluding adjustments for non-cash or non-recurring items).</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information, refer to “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA.”</p><p><b>ANNUAL FINANCIAL REVIEW</b></p><p><i>Revenue</i></p><p>Total revenue was <money><money>$273.0 million</money></money> during the twelve months ended December 31, 2025, including <money><money>$257.3 million</money></money> of service revenue and <money><money>$15.7 million</money></money> of revenue generated from subscriber equipment sales. Total revenue increased <percent>9%</percent> from 2024, reaching a record high for the fourth consecutive year. This increase was due to higher service revenue and higher revenue from subscriber equipment sales.</p><p>Service revenue increased <money><money>$19.6 million</money></money>, or <percent>8%</percent>, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024 due to increases in wholesale capacity services. Revenue from subscriber equipment sales increased <money><money>$3.0 million</money></money>, or <percent>24%</percent>, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024 due to a higher volume of Commercial IoT device sales.</p><p><i>Income (Loss) from Operations</i></p><p>Income from operations was <money><money>$7.4 million</money></money> during 2025 compared to loss from operations of <money><money>$0.9 million</money></money> during 2024 due to higher revenue (as discussed above) offset partially by higher operating expenses (as discussed below).</p><p>Higher cost of services, MG&amp;A expense and cost of subscriber equipment sales were offset partially by lower stock-based compensation expenses. A non-cash loss on disposal of assets during the first quarter of 2025 also increased operating expenses. The drivers of higher cost of services, MG&amp;A expense and cost of subscriber equipment sales for the full year 2025 compared to 2024 are generally consistent with the quarterly increases noted above. Costs incurred to enhance and develop our XCOM RAN product and service offerings were also impacted by our recognition of certain non-cash amortized costs beginning in May 2024.</p><p>Operating expenses were partially offset by employee retention credits received in 2025 as a result of our eligibility under the provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act for 2021. The total credits of <money><money>$3.9 million</money></money> reduced operating expenses during 2025, of which <money><money>$2.7 million</money></money> was allocated to cost of services and <money><money>$1.2 million</money></money> was allocated to MG&amp;A expense, based on the employee costs incurred during the eligible period.</p><p><i>Net Loss</i></p><p>Net loss was <money><money>$8.7 million</money></money> for 2025 compared to <money><money>$63.2 million</money></money> for 2024. This improvement was due primarily to higher revenue (discussed above), net foreign currency gains due to the remeasurement of intercompany balances and non-cash gains on the quarterly mark-to-market adjustment of our derivative asset. This improvement was also due to a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the paydown of the 2023 <percent>13%</percent> Notes recorded during the fourth quarter of 2024. These favorable items were offset partially by higher operating expenses (discussed above) as well as higher interest expense resulting from our recognition of non-cash imputed interest related to the 2024 Prepayment Agreement.</p><p><i>Adjusted EBITDA</i></p><p>Adjusted EBITDA was <money><money>$136.1 million</money></money> in 2025, reaching a record high for the Company and representing a margin of <percent>50%</percent>. This increase from 2024 was due to a <money><money>$22.6 million</money></money> increase in total revenue (for reasons previously discussed), offset partially by a <money><money>$21.9 million</money></money> increase in operating expenses (excluding adjustments for non-cash or non-recurring items) primarily due to investment in growth opportunities. Specifically, while we continue to enhance and develop our XCOM RAN product and service offerings, we incur costs, primarily for personnel, in advance of significant revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information, refer to “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA.\"</p><p><i>Liquidity</i></p><p>As of December 31, 2025, we held cash and cash equivalents of <money><money>$447.5 million</money></money>, compared to <money><money>$391.2 million</money></money> as of December 31, 2024.</p><p>During 2025, net cash flows generated from operations were <money><money>$621.7 million</money></money>, capital expenditures were <money><money>$550.4 million</money></money> and net cash flows used in financing activities were <money><money>$16.2 million</money></money>. Cash and cash equivalents were also positively impacted by a <money><money>$1.2 million</money></money> change in foreign currency exchange rates. Operating cash flows during 2025 included <money><money>$430.6 million</money></money> received in connection with the Infrastructure Prepayment and other cash flows generated from the business. Capital expenditures were primarily associated with our commitments under the Updated Services Agreements related to the deployment of the replacement satellites and Extended MSS Network.</p><p>Adjusted free cash flow during 2025 was <money><money>$171.5 million</money></money> compared to <money><money>$131.9 million</money></money> during 2024. This increase primarily includes <money><money>$45.0 million</money></money> in accelerated service payments received during 2025 as well as higher service payments received pursuant to the Updated Services Agreements, offset partially by higher operating costs (as discussed above). Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information, refer to \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted Free Cash Flow\".</p><p>The principal amount of our debt was <money><money>$410.0 million</money></money> at December 31, 2025, compared to <money><money>$417.5 million</money></money> at December 31, 2024. This decrease was due to scheduled recoupments of <money><money>$34.6 million</money></money> under the 2021 Funding Agreement, offset partially by the issuance of <money><money>$27.1 million</money></money> of debt under the 2023 Funding Agreement in August 2025.</p><p>(Capitalized terms not defined in this release have the meanings ascribed to them in our periodic reports)</p><p><b>FINANCIAL GUIDANCE</b></p><p>Our financial guidance for 2026 is as follows:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Total revenue between <money><money>$280 million</money></money> and <money><money>$305 million</money></money></li><li>Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately <percent>50%</percent></li></ul><p><b>CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION</b></p><p>The Company will host a conference call to discuss its results at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) on Friday, February 27, 2026.

These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” \"might,\" \"could,\" “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that could cause or contribute to such differences include, without limitation, those described under Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as may be further updated by subsequent filings with the SEC. Further, new risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risk factors, nor can we accurately assess the ultimate impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to amounts reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are provided in this press release. For forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA margin, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable effort because estimating such GAAP measures and providing a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and requires a level of precision that is unavailable for these future periods and the information needed to reconcile these measures is dependent upon future events, many of which are outside of our control as described above.

before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, accretion and derivative (gains)/losses. Adjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash compensation expense, reduction in the value of assets, foreign exchange (gains)/losses, and certain other non-cash or non-recurring charges as applicable. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to manage the Company's business and to compare its results more closely to the results of its peers. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measurements, such as net loss. These terms, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.</p><p class=\"bwcellpmargin\"> </p><p class=\"bwcellpmargin\">The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measurement of its operating performance. The Company believes it best reflects changes across time in the Company's performance, including the effects of pricing, cost control and other operational decisions. The Company's management uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of its annual operating budget. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA also is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies in similar industries. As indicated, Adjusted EBITDA does not include interest expense on borrowed money or depreciation expense on our capital assets or the payment of income taxes, which are necessary elements of the Company's operations. Because Adjusted EBITDA does not account for these expenses, its utility as a measure of the Company's operating performance has material limitations. Because of these limitations, the Company's management does not view Adjusted EBITDA in isolation and also uses other measurements, such as revenues and operating profit, to measure operating performance.</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"bwpadl0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"></td><td class=\"bwpadl0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"></td><td class=\"bwpadl0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> </td></tr><tr><td class=\"bwpadl0 bwpadr0 bwvertalignt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"bwalignr bwcellpmargin\">(2)</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"></td><td class=\"bwvertalignt bwpadl0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"bwcellpmargin\">In connection with the License Agreement with XCOM, the Company entered into a Support Services Agreement (the “SSA”).

Couloir Capital's Senior Mining analyst, Ron Wortel, MBA, P.Eng., QP, crafted a report titled \"Drilling targeting resource development and regional consolidation, driving interest in this Nevada explorer.\"   </p><p>Report excerpt: \"We are updating our coverage of North Peak Resources as it is systematically advancing its flagship Prospect Mountain project toward an initial, near-surface gold resource by expanding and linking mineralization northward between known high-grade trends. Recent results from the first six holes (807 m) of the Wabash/Industry Tunnel drill program demonstrate this strategy in action, with encouraging halo mineralization intersected between the Wabash and Williams lodes, including 42.67 m @ 0.82 g/t Gold and 99.06 m @ 0.56 g/t Gold and the discovery of a new gold-bearing zone along the Silver Connor fault. These results not only extend the mineralized envelope northward but also illustrate that the Company is expanding a continuous mineralized system with both depth and strike potential, rather than merely chasing isolated high-grade hits.</p><p>Beyond the northern area, North Peak has identified a second near-surface resource opportunity at Lower PME, located at the base of the mountain and interpreted to host the Hamburg/Dunderberg contact under cover. This structure corresponds to the same fault zone that McEwen Mining is actively advancing, targeting a resource in H1 2026.  McEwen's regional consolidation, most recently involving Golden Lake Exploration, now places North Peak between McEwen and i-80 Gold, both of whom are investing heavily in delineation and development across the camp. Importantly, North Peak's Lower PME target represents a down-dip extension of the system that remains open at depth.\"</p><p>The report can be accessed through Couloir Capital's portal:  <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/y4vJOHbZGX\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.couloircapital.com/research-portal</a>.  </p><p><b>About Couloir Capital Ltd.</b></p><p>Couloir Capital Ltd. is an investment research firm with a team of experienced investment professionals providing institutional-quality research coverage for small-cap equities.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p> <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.wakefi\">WAKEFIELD, Mass.</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Franklin Street Properties Corp. (the “Company”, “FSP”, “our” or “we”) (NYSE American: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/FSP/\" title=\"View FSP stock overview\">FSP</a>) announced today that it has closed a <money><money>$320 million</money></money> secured credit facility (the “Facility”) with an affiliate of TPG Credit (the “Lender”). The Company repaid in full all of its outstanding <money><money>$248.9 million</money></money> aggregate principal amount of indebtedness in an initial drawdown of <money><money>$258.5 million</money></money> under the Facility, net of original issue discount of <money><money>$16.5 million</money></money> (the “Initial Term Loans”). The Facility includes up to <money><money>$45 million</money></money> of delayed draw term loans, which, subject to certain conditions, will be used to fund tenant improvements, leasing commissions, building improvements and other uses approved by the Lender (“Delayed Draw Term Loans”) and contains customary covenants. Alter Domus (US) LLC will act as administrative agent for the Facility.</p><p>A summary of key terms is below:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Aggregate principal amount <money><money>$320 million</money></money> (including both the Initial Term Loans and the Delayed Draw Term Loans).</li><li>Original stated maturity of February 26, 2029.</li><li>Initial coupon rate of <percent>9.0%</percent>.</li><li>An exit fee of <percent>4.0%</percent> of the funded amount of the loans due upon repayment.</li><li>The maturity date is subject to potential extension of up to one year at the option of the Company, subject to certain conditions.</li><li>Collateral consisting of a first priority lien on substantially all assets of the Company.</li></ul><p><a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/FSP/\" title=\"View FSP stock overview\">FSP</a> was represented by Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP and Stifel.

Carter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/FSP/\" title=\"View FSP stock overview\">FSP</a>, said, “After considering a number of different potential strategic alternatives in consultation with our professional advisors, we concluded that refinancing our outstanding indebtedness was the best alternative available to us at this time. In addition, the Delayed Draw Term Loan feature of the Facility provides additional flexibility to allow us to lease additional space in our existing portfolio, which could enhance future value. We are pleased to have TPG as a strategic lending partner and look forward to building a long-term relationship with them.</p><p>However, now that our near-term debt maturity has been addressed, we are continuing our review of potential strategic alternatives. Our Board of Directors and management team remain deeply committed to continuing to explore ways to maximize shareholder value. We believe that having successfully addressed our near-term debt maturities has reduced a significant source of near-term uncertainty and avoided having to make forced or suboptimal decisions, enabling us to focus on executing property-level initiatives in what continues to be an uneven office market environment. We believe this approach best positions the Company to navigate current market conditions while preserving maximum strategic flexibility. We look forward to continuing to update the market as and when appropriate.”</p><p>David Busker, Managing Director and Head of Commercial Real Estate Debt, TPG Credit, said “We are pleased to partner with Franklin Street Properties to provide a tailored capital solution that provides the financial flexibility needed to navigate the current market.

            "title": "Restart Life Sciences Closes Acquisition of Holy Crap Foods | NMLSF Stock News",
            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 27, 2026) - Restart Life Sciences Corp. (CSE: HEAL) (FSE: HN30) (OTC Pink: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/NMLSF/\" title=\"View NMLSF stock overview\">NMLSF</a>) (\"Restart Life\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that it has successfully closed the previously announced acquisition of <percent>100%</percent> of the issued and outstanding shares of Holy Crap Foods Inc. (\"Holy Crap\") pursuant to the deﬁnitive agreement dated February 12, 2026, among the Company, Happy Belly Coffee Inc., a subsidiary of Happy Belly Food Group Inc. (CSE: HBFG), and Holy Crap (the \"Acquisition\").</p><p>Effective as of the closing date of the transaction, the Acquisition adds in excess of <money>$1 million</money> in annualized revenue to Restart Life, marking a signiﬁcant milestone in the Company's evolution and immediately establishing Restart Life as a revenue-producing organization.</p><p>This milestone transaction represents a strategic inﬂection point for Restart Life, providing a foundational operating platform from which to execute its broader growth strategy within the health and wellness sector.</p><p>The Acquisition represents a comprehensive transfer of the entire Holy Crap business ecosystem. It includes the full Holy Crap portfolio of brands and product lines, together with all associated trademarks, proprietary formulations, trade secrets, intellectual property, packaging designs, marketing assets, digital infrastructure, and established goodwill. The transaction also encompasses longstanding retail and distributor relationships, direct-to-consumer channels, customer data, supplier agreements, and all ﬁnished goods, raw materials, packaging components, and work-in-progress inventory, ensuring operational continuity from day one.</p><p>Central to the Acquisition is Holy Crap's dedicated manufacturing operation located in Gibsons, British Columbia. The Gibsons facility, which operates under a lease agreement, serves as the primary production and fulﬁllment hub for the brand's product lines. The site includes established blending and batching systems, production lines, packaging infrastructure, warehousing capacity, food safety and quality assurance programs, and trained operational personnel. Management believes this turnkey manufacturing platform provides immediate production stability with proven throughput capacity and built-in scalability to support distribution expansion and future product innovation. By acquiring a fully functioning manufacturing footprint, Restart Life minimizes near-term capital expenditure requirements, reduces integration risk, and preserves ﬁnancial ﬂexibility while maintaining the operational backbone necessary to execute its strategic growth initiatives.</p><p>Founded in 2009, Holy Crap was originally launched under the name \"Hapi Food\" with a mission to address food allergies and provide clean, simple ingredient nutrition. The brand achieved national recognition after appearing on CBC's Dragon's Den in 2010, where overwhelming consumer demand generated approximately <money>$1 million</money> in sales virtually overnight, ﬁrmly establishing Holy Crap as a breakout success story in the natural foods space.</p><p>The brand's rapid rise continued later that year when its products were featured during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. In a milestone few food brands can claim, Holy Crap cereal was also selected to be enjoyed by astronauts aboard the International Space Station, a testament to its nutritional proﬁle, quality standards, and broad appeal.</p><p>Effective upon closing, Holy Crap now operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of Restart Life. The Company intends to maintain existing operations at the Gibsons facility and work collaboratively with the current management and production team to ensure seamless continuity while identifying operational efﬁciencies and measured expansion opportunities.</p><p>Members of the Restart Life team conducted an in-person visit and operational tour of the Gibsons manufacturing facility, meeting directly with management and staff to review operations and discuss next phase growth initiatives. The Company extends its sincere appreciation to the Holy Crap team for their professionalism, experience, and continued dedication to the brand, which has been instrumental in building its loyal customer base and strong market reputation.</p><p>With the transaction complete, Restart Life is actively executing on a disciplined strategic growth plan focused on expanding distribution channels, enhancing operational efﬁciencies, and evaluating new product development opportunities. The Company intends to leverage Holy Crap's established revenue base, embedded customer relationships, and in-house manufacturing capabilities as the cornerstone of its expansion strategy, supporting both organic growth and potential future brand development initiatives.</p><p>Consumers and investors are encouraged to visit HolyCrap.com to learn more about the product line and experience ﬁrsthand the functional cereal that has built a loyal following across North America. For a limited time, customers will receive a free bag with every order, providing an opportunity to get familiar with a product that truly delivers on its promise of simple ingredients and real results.</p><p>Steve Loutskou, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer of Restart Life, commented, \"We are excited to ofﬁcially welcome Holy Crap to Restart Life. Over the past several weeks, our team has been working diligently behind the scenes on product research and development from every angle, from formulation and nutrition science to operations and scalability. What we have acquired is not just a brand, but a fully integrated operating business with strong infrastructure and signiﬁcant growth potential. We are energized to work alongside Holy Crap's passionate and dedicated team to enhance, expand, and elevate the brand to new levels. With closing complete, our focus now turns to disciplined execution and strategic growth from this solid foundation.\"</p><p>Restart Life would like to thank its shareholders for their ongoing support as the Company advances its mission and continues to execute on its strategy.</p><p><b>About Holy Crap Foods Inc.</b><br/>Holy Crap Cereal, a Holy Crap brand, is a premium breakfast brand known for its delicious, nutrient-dense cereals made with simple, wholesome ingredients.

In addition, because these investments were originated in a low base-rate environment, several have struggled to adapt to a period of sustained higher interest rates.</p><p>The Company’s highest near-term priority is to improve portfolio credit quality by working diligently to resolve challenged credits. At the same time, it continues to execute on the refined investment strategy described last year, including deploying capital selectively into senior-secured, first-lien loans, maintaining a well-diversified portfolio, and fully leveraging the resources of BlackRock’s platform.</p><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwwidth100 bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl\"><tr><td class=\"bwpadl0\"

On March 18, 2024, the Company completed its previously announced merger with BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation (\"Merger\"). The Merger has been accounted for as an asset acquisition of BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation (\"BCIC\") by the Company in accordance with the asset acquisition method of accounting as detailed in ASC 805-50 (\"ASC 805\"), Business Combinations-Related Issues. The Company determined the fair value of the shares of the Company's common stock that were issued to former BCIC shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement plus transaction costs to be the consideration paid in connection with the Merger under ASC 805. The consideration paid to BCIC shareholders was less than the aggregate fair values of the BCIC assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the “purchase discount”). The consideration paid was allocated to the individual BCIC assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair values of net identifiable assets acquired other than “non-qualifying” assets and liabilities (for example, cash) and did not give rise to goodwill. As a result, the purchase discount was allocated to the cost basis of the BCIC investments acquired by the Company on a pro-rata basis based on their relative fair values as of the effective time of the Merger. Immediately following the Merger, the investments were marked to their respective fair values in accordance with ASC 820 which resulted in immediate recognition of net unrealized appreciation in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a result of the Merger. The purchase discount allocated to the BCIC debt investments acquired will amortize over the remaining life of each respective debt investment through interest income, with a corresponding adjustment recorded to unrealized appreciation or depreciation on such investment acquired through its ultimate disposition. The purchase discount allocated to BCIC equity investments acquired will not amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, the Company may recognize a realized gain or loss with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired.</p></td></tr></table><p>As a supplement to the Company’s reported GAAP financial measures, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>“Adjusted net investment income” – excludes the amortization of purchase accounting discount from net investment income calculated in accordance with GAAP;</li><li>“Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss)” – excludes the unrealized appreciation resulting from the purchase discount and the corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation from the amortization of the purchase discount from the determination of net realized and unrealized gain (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP; and</li><li>“Adjusted net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations” – calculates net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations based on Adjusted net investment income and Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss).</li></ul><p>We believe that the adjustment to exclude the full effect of purchase discount accounting under ASC 805 from these financial measures is meaningful because of the potential impact on the comparability of these financial measures that we and investors use to assess our financial condition and results of operations period over period. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are intended to enhance investors’ understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP.

At the core of our strategy is the Cancer BioShield<sup>™</sup> platform, which is designed to stimulate critical lymphocytes, including natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T cells, and memory T cells via our proprietary IL-15 superagonist, ANKTIVA<sup>® </sup>(nogapendekin alfa inbakicept).

Our management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate operating performance, to forecast future results and as a basis for compensation. The Company believes this is an important supplemental measure of operating performance because it eliminates items that have less bearing on its operating performance and highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. The Company believes the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful for investors because it enables them to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company’s management, helps improve their ability to understand the Company’s operating performance and makes it easier to compare the Company’s results with other companies that may have different depreciation and amortization policies, non-cash share-based payment costs, impairment of long-lived assets, workforce reorganization costs, termination costs, system optimization costs, satellite transition costs, acquisition and transition related costs and advisor fees.</p><p>Adjusted OIBDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenue.

In addition, Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin have the limitation of not reflecting the effect of the Company’s non-cash share-based payment costs, impairment of long-lived assets, workforce reorganization costs, termination of the Regal ESA, system optimization costs, satellite transition costs, acquisition and transition related costs, and advisor fees related to involvement in the Cineworld proceeding and Chapter 11 case. Adjusted OIBDA should not be regarded as an alternative to operating income, net income or as indicators of operating performance, nor should it be considered in isolation of, or as substitutes for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that operating income is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted OIBDA, and operating margin is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted OIBDA margin. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these non-GAAP presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, or calculations in NCM LLC’s debt agreement.</p><p>The Company has not provided a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP Adjusted OIBDA measure to forward-looking GAAP operating income due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of impacts outside of the Company’s control on certain items, including the timing of revenue and charges reflected in our reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which, based on historical experience, could be significant and are difficult to reasonably predict. Accordingly, a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort.</p><p>The following table reconciles the Company's operating loss and operating margin to Adjusted

financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>. Adjusted net income (loss) and income (loss) per share are calculated using reported net income (loss) and income (loss) per share and exclude workforce reorganization costs, system optimization costs, satellite transition costs, Spotlight acquisition and integration costs, advisor fees related to the Cineworld proceeding and Chapter 11 case and (gain) loss on re-measurement of the payable to ESA Parties under the tax receivable agreement. Our management use these non-GAAP financial measures as an additional tool to evaluate operating performance. The Company believes these are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they eliminate items that have less bearing on its operating performance and so highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. The Company believes the presentation of these measures is relevant and useful for investors because it enables them to view performance in a manner similar to a method used by the Company’s management and helps improve their ability to understand the Company’s operating performance. Adjusted net income (loss) and income (loss) per share should not be regarded as alternatives to net income (loss) and income (loss) per share or as indicators of operating performance, nor should they be considered in isolation of, or as substitutes for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that net income (loss) and income (loss) per share are the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.</p><p>The following table reconciles as reported net income (loss) and income (loss) per share to adjusted net income (loss) and income (loss) per share excluding workforce reorganization costs, system optimization costs, satellite transition costs, Spotlight acquisition and integration costs, advisor fees related to the Cineworld proceeding and Chapter 11 case and (gain) loss on remeasurement of the payable to ESA Parties under the tax

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><strong id=\"dateline\">TORONTO, ON / <a href=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ACCESS Newswire</a> / February 27, 2026 / </strong><strong>Sterling Metals Corp. (TSXV:SAG)(OTCQB:SAGGF) (\"Sterling\" or the \"Company\")</strong> is pleased to report additional assay results from its expanded and completed 2025 drilling program at the Soo Copper Project (\"<strong>Soo Copper</strong>\" or the \"<strong>Project\"</strong>) located near Batchewana Bay, Ontario. Results from 6 additional drill holes continue to expand the copper mineralized footprint, while further defining and extending the high-grade bornite zone. Assays remain pending for the final 5 holes drilled within the core of the MEPS discovery area.</p><p><strong>Highlights:</strong></p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><p>Systematic step-out and infill drilling within the MEPS zone confirms continuous copper mineralization from surface across approximately 400m of east-west strike, centered on discovery hole MEPS-25-02 and remains open (see Figure 1 and 2).</p></li><li><p>A 30m expansion of the high-grade bornite zone in MEPS-25-18, highlighted by the highest-grade individual copper sample intersected to date of <strong><percent>38.9%</percent> Cu over 0.3m </strong>in MEPS-25-18 at 227.4m (see Figure 2) that is included within a high grade bornite-rich interval grading 24m of <percent>2.05%</percent> CuEq and also within a broader 237.2m interval grading <percent>0.5%</percent> CuEq.</p></li><li><p>New high-grade zone associated with the GFP felsic porphyry dykes and adjacent magnetite veining at shallow depths in holes MEPS-25-14, 15 and 16, including a highlighted interval in MEPS-25-16 of 13.55m grading <percent>2.04%</percent> CuEq from 96.35m depth within a larger interval of 177.3m of <percent>0.4%</percent> CuEq and a broader interval of 419.9m of <percent>0.3%</percent>CuEq.</p></li><li><p>Magnetite veins associated with early GFP felsic dykes remain the dominant hosts of the highest-grade copper sulphide mineralization observed to date, with later felsic porphyry dykes and alteration events hosting lower grade copper mineralization, supporting the interpretation that this discovery zone is situated above a large, multi-stage porphyry-style copper system.</p></li></ul><p>Jeremy Niemi, SVP Exploration and Development, commented, \"We are very excited about these wide intervals of copper from surface and, importantly, the systematic expansion of the high-grade bornite zone by 150 metres around the discovery hole MEPS-25-02. Each step-out hole has successfully extended the zone either laterally or vertically, demonstrating strong continuity of the high-grade core within a much broader copper system. The mineralization remains open in most directions, and we are beginning to see clear structural and grade trends emerging that will guide our 2026 resource-focused drilling.\"</p><p><strong>High-Grade Copper Zone Continues to Develop</strong></p><p>In addition to establishing a broad, continuous zone of copper mineralization from surface, results from new drill hole intervals continue to identify and expand the high-grade bornite zone first recognized in MEPS-25-02. Step-out drilling has now systematically extended this zone in multiple directions and increased confidence in the continuity and scale of the high-grade zone which the Company anticipates will come to surface.</p><p>Hole MEPS-25-14 extended the bornite mineralization approximately 50m east of MEPS-25-02. Follow-up hole MEPS-25-15 stepped a further 30m east, bringing the eastern expansion to 80m from the discovery hole. Hole MEPS-25-16, drilled beneath MEPS-25-15, extended the bornite zone approximately 40m vertically, demonstrating depth continuity within the high-grade domain. Hole MEPS-25-17 then pushed the eastern extent another 40m, expanding bornite mineralization to approximately 120m east of MEPS-25-02.</p><p>To the west, MEPS-25-18 intersected high-grade bornite mineralization approximately 30m beyond MEPS-25-02, confirming expansion in that direction and bringing the total newly defined east-west strike extension of the bornite zone to approximately 150m.</p><p>Importantly, these step-outs demonstrate not only lateral continuity but also vertical development of the high-grade bornite core within a much broader, near-surface envelope of chalcopyrite-dominant copper mineralization. The bornite mineralization remains open along strike and at depth and is a key focus for the planned 2026 drill program.</p><a href=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/65e536f2-9f4f-486c-a56a-21bf45d06558/1142049/figonesm.png\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/65e536f2-9f4f-486c-a56a-21bf45d06558/1142049/figonesm.png\" style=\"width:720px;text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto;\"/></a><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Figure 1.

services were provided by Actlabs, which is an independent, CALA- and SCC-accredited analytical services firm registered to ISO 17025 and ISO 9001 standard. Drill core samples were logged and split in half with a diamond core saw. Half-core samples were securely stored at the core logging facility until being delivered to Actlabs Thunder Bay lab by commercial transport. Samples were crushed (&lt; 7 kg) up to 90% passing 2mm (10 mesh), riffle split to 250 g and pulverized by mild steel to 95% passing 105μm (150 mesh). Samples splits underwent a 4-acid near total digestion followed by a multi-element analysis, including base metals, using an ICP method for 35 elements. Selected sample pulps were then analyzed for gold using a 30 g aliquot mixed with fire assay fluxes and Ag as a collector, placed in a fire clay crucible, gradually heated to 1060ºC for 60 min, and followed with an AA finish.</p><p>Laboratory QA/QC for the ICP analysis was <percent>14%</percent> for each batch, including 5 method reagent blanks, 10 in-house controls, 10 samples duplicates, and 8 certified reference materials. An additional <percent>13%</percent> QA/QC was performed as part of the instrumental analysis to ensure quality in the areas of instrumental drift. Laboratory quality control for the gold fire assay included two blanks per 42 samples, three sample duplicates and 2 certified reference materials, one high and one low (QC 7 out of 42 samples). In-house QA/QC included the systematic insertion of blanks, duplicates, and certified reference materials (CRM).</p><p><strong>Qualified Person</strong></p><p>Jeremy Niemi, P.Geo., Senior Vice President, Exploration and Evaluation for Sterling Metals has reviewed and approved the technical information presented herein.</p><p><strong>About the Soo Copper Project</strong></p><p>The Soo Copper Project sits just 20 minutes off the Trans-Canada Highway, one hour north of Sault Ste. Marie, and 20km from rail and deep-water access. With near-surface copper-one of the most critical of all critical metals-alongside gold, and with the project now demonstrating both scale and grade, Sterling sees the potential for Soo Copper to become a nationally significant asset as Canada accelerates its efforts to secure strategic copper resources. Prime Minister Carney's recent designation of copper as one of Canada's first five strategic assets underscores the importance of this discovery and its potential to emerge as a key project of national interest.</p><p><strong>About Sterling Metals</strong></p><p>Sterling Metals is a mineral exploration company focused on large scale and high-grade Canadian exploration opportunities. The Company is advancing the 25,000-hectare Soo Copper Project in Ontario which has past production, and multiple breccia and porphyry targets strategically located near robust infrastructure and the 29,000-hectare Adeline Project in Labrador which covers an entire sediment-hosted copper belt with significant silver credits. Both opportunities have demonstrated potential for important new copper discoveries, underscoring Sterling's commitment to pioneering exploration in mineral rich Canada.</p><p>Sterling Metals acknowledges that its exploration activities within the Soo Copper project are conducted on the traditional lands of the Batchewana, Garden River, and Michipicoten First Nations of the North Shore of Lake Superior. We recognize and respect the longstanding and diverse relationships Indigenous Peoples have with the land and are committed to engaging in a manner that is respectful, transparent, and inclusive.</p><p><strong>For more information, please contact:</strong></p><p>Sterling Metals Corp.<br/>Mathew Wilson, CEO and Director</p><p>Tel: (416) 643-3887<br/>Email: <a href=\"mailto:info@sterlingmetals.ca\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">info@sterlingmetals.ca</a><br/>Website: <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3vp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.sterlingmetals.ca</a></p><p><i>Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.
