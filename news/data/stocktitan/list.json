            "title": "Gelum Plans Acquisition of Las Tinajas Gold Project, Northern Maricunga Belt, Chile | GMRCF Stock News",
            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 27, 2026) - Gelum Resources Ltd. (CSE: GMR) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/GMRCF/\" title=\"View GMRCF stock overview\">GMRCF</a>) (\"Gelum\" or the \"Company\") reports that it has entered into an letter of intent under which Gelum can earn a <percent>100%</percent> interest in the Las Tinajas Gold Project (\"Las Tinajas\") covering 2,600 hectares (the \"Concessions\") in the north end of the Maricunga Gold Belt, Chile. Las Tinajas is located 120km northeast of Copiapó, in the Atacama Region of northern Chile (Figure 1).</p><p>Gelum CEO Henk Van Alphen stated, <i>\"Gelum is entering a new phase of corporate development. The acquisition of Las Tinajas is an event that will radically transform Gelum into a premier gold exploration company with a South American focus. We have had the people and partners within Gelum, and now we have the asset to greatly add shareholder value.\"</i></p><p><b>Las Tinajas Highlights</b></p><p>Las Tinajas is located at the north end of the Maricunga Belt, the largest gold belt in Chile, extending for 200 km with both porphyry and high-sulphidation types of mineralization containing a total of 103 million ounces<sup>*</sup>. The Las Tinajas 2600 Ha claim block lies between 3,600-4,000 metres above sea level and is accessible via a Codelco-maintained mining road. Gold mineralization at Las Tinajas is associated with silicified porphyry intrusions and associated diatreme breccias. Skarn features also occur in adjacent metasedimentary units. Since 1986, 64 drillholes totaling 10,990m have been drilled in three campaigns, the most recent being 16 holes totaling 2,831m drilled in 2024-2025 by Horizon Mining SA. Multiple historical holes have significant intervals of &gt;1g/t gold, with several ending in ≥1g/t gold, including (all are end of hole):</p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li>43m of 1.18 g/t Au (DT06)</li><li>35m of 1.23 g/t Au (TT014)</li><li>26m of 2.09 g/t Au (TT004)</li><li>58m of 1.42 g/t Au (TT027)</li><li>82m of 0.93 g/t Au (TDH-010)</li></ul><p>Only a small portion of the claim block has been drilled. There is significant potential to expand the known mineralized centres associated with the diatreme breccia. In addition, the drilling has not tested the favourable contact between the diatreme breccia and calcareous, reactive metasediments to the west. A thin layer of post-mineral volcanic material covers about <percent>40%</percent> of the claims and obscures broad zones of hydrothermal and skarn alteration.</p><p>Readers are cautioned that descriptions of historical drilling results reported here should be viewed primarily as a guidance for exploration drilling. The qualified person for this release has not done sufficient work to independently verify the historical sampling results described above.</p><p><b>Las Tinajas Details</b></p><p>Gold is associated with potassic, silicic and sericite alteration of a central, dacitic, diatreme breccia, with alteration/mineralization extending into adjacent calcareous sedimentary units. Gold occurs freely and as inclusions within disseminated pyrite-sphalerite-tennantite. The most intense sericitic alteration coincides with gold-zinc mineralization and a gold soil anomaly of &gt;500 ppb. The diatreme and associated surface alteration clearly extends to the west, north and east and offers excellent potential to increase the target size as indicated by numerous drill holes ending in mineralization. </p><p>Porphyry-style quartz veinlets with anomalous gold values occur in one drill hole that intercepted a weakly mineralized dacite porphyry plug and rhyolite dikes, suggesting presence of an Au-Cu-Mo dacite porphyry at depth, below the limits of historical drilling. In addition, clasts within the diatreme breccia host quartz stockworks that are closely similar in character to those in the porphyry gold deposits of the Maricunga belt.</p><p>An IP survey (dipole-dipole) completed in 1994 outlined two strong (&gt;40 millirad) northwest-trending chargeability zones spaced one kilometre apart, of which the southern anomaly coincided with known mineralization but was only drill-tested at the northwest end. The anomaly remains open and untested to the southeast.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/6458/285772_6af85e3194aee98c_002full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

Continued approval for this indication, which was based on an improvement in annualized growth velocity (AGV), may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).</p> <p>Achondroplasia is a rare genetic condition causing skeletal dysplasia and, for many affected individuals, an increased risk of muscular, neurological, and cardiorespiratory complications. YUVIWEL is a prodrug of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) administered once weekly, designed to provide continuous exposure of active CNP to receptors on tissues throughout the body to counteract the overactive FGFR3 signaling in achondroplasia.</p> <p>“The approval of once-weekly YUVIWEL is a major step forward in the treatment of children with achondroplasia, giving physicians for the first time the option of prescribing a once-weekly medicine backed by compelling efficacy and excellent tolerability data from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials,” said Carlos A. Bacino, MD, FACMG, Professor of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children’s Hospital. “My goal is to help children and parents develop care plans tailored to their individual needs and objectives, and I look forward to adding YUVIWEL to my discussions with them.”</p> <p>“Little People of America, the largest national advocacy and support organization for people with dwarfism, is committed to ensuring that the voices of people with dwarfism remain central in conversations about research and medical options such as YUVIWEL,” said the Board of Directors of Little People of America. “We champion dwarf and disability pride, advocate for inclusion and respect, and foster open dialogue across diverse perspectives. Our goal is to empower individuals and families to make healthcare decisions that reflect their own values and experiences, while pushing for research efforts and new treatment options such as this that could have the potential to support outcomes that truly matter to our community.”</p> <p>The FDA based its approval of YUVIWEL on their review of the clinical package for TransCon CNP submitted with the Company’s New Drug Application, which included safety and efficacy data from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials and up to three years of open-label extension data. The pivotal ApproaCH Trial data is available in <em>JAMA Pediatrics</em>.<sup>i</sup></p> <p>“We are confident in YUVIWEL’s potential to transform the treatment of achondroplasia and are deeply grateful to patients, clinicians, and advocates for their many contributions to this important milestone,” said Jan Mikkelsen, President and Chief Executive Officer at Ascendis Pharma. “We have listened to advocacy groups for people with dwarfism to ensure we address what the community actually cares about. This reflects our ongoing commitment to pursue outcomes that patient communities have told us are important to them, and gives the achondroplasia community a new way to look at the promise of pharmacological treatment options.”</p> <p>Ascendis expects to make YUVIWEL available through prescribing physicians in the United States during the early part of the second quarter of 2026. Ascendis plans to offer a suite of patient services for YUVIWEL through its U.S. Ascendis Signature Access Program (A.S.A.P.), including support navigating the treatment journey and financial assistance programs for eligible patients.</p> <p>With this approval, the FDA also issued a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV), which confers priority review to a subsequent drug application that would not otherwise qualify for priority review. This program is designed to encourage development of new drugs and biologics for the prevention or treatment of rare pediatric diseases.</p> <p><strong>Conference Call and Webcast Information</strong><br/>Ascendis will host a call to review the FDA approval of YUVIWEL on Monday, March 2, 2026, at 8:00 am ET.

While historically considered a bone growth disorder, the FGFR3 variant seen in achondroplasia is expressed in tissues throughout the body, and is associated with an increased risk of muscular, neurological, and cardiorespiratory complications in addition to skeletal dysplasia. Medical complications of achondroplasia can vary from individual to individual and across different stages of life. Throughout infancy and childhood, observed complications include spinal abnormalities, enlarged brain ventricles, impaired muscle strength and reduced stamina, hearing deficits and chronic ear infections, upper airway obstructions, sleep-disordered breathing, hip problems, leg bowing, and chronic pain; some of which persist or worsen in adulthood. These medical complications can affect quality of life, physical well-being, influenced by a range of clinical, social, and individual factors. Some individuals with achondroplasia require multiple procedures and surgeries to address specific functional or anatomical concerns.</p> <p><strong>About Ascendis Pharma A/S</strong><br/>Ascendis Pharma is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on applying our innovative TransCon technology platform to make a meaningful difference for patients.

(\"Algo Grande\") (TSXV:ALGR)(OTC:<a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/KNDYF/\" title=\"View KNDYF stock overview\">KNDYF</a>)(FRA:KM00) announces the closing of its previously announced non-brokered private placement and the election of three new directors at its Annual General Meeting held on February 25, 2026.</p><p>Pursuant to its news releases dated February 11, 2026 and February 19, 2026, the Company has closed its previously announced non-brokered private placement (the \"Offering\") of common shares in the capital of the Company (the \"Shares\"), at a deemed price of <money>$0.65</money> per Share. The Offering consisted of 10,037,020 Shares for aggregate gross proceeds of <money>$6,524,063.</money></p><p>The Offering will fund the next phase of exploration at the Company's <percent>100%</percent>-owned Adelita Project in Sonora, Mexico, focused on a Phase II drill program. Phase I drilling at the Cerro Grande skarn intersected multiple stacked Cu-Au-Ag skarn horizons at depth, including skarn zones that had not been identified by historic drilling. The upcoming program will target expansion drilling at Cerro Grande and first-pass drilling along an approximately 6-kilometre prospective limestone corridor hosting multiple, undrilled, outcropping skarn targets. Proceeds from the Offering will also be used for additional operating costs and general working capital requirements.</p><p>Commenting on the opportunity at Adelita, newly elected Director Raymond Jannas stated: \"The Adelita Project exhibits many of the characteristics we look for in emerging district-scale systems, high-grade skarn mineralization with clear geological vectors toward a deeper potential porphyry source. What excites me most is the combination of compelling geology and a focused, determined team that is executing with discipline. With capital in place and a clear exploration roadmap, Algo Grande is well positioned to unlock the broader potential of this system.\"</p><p>In connection with the closing of the Offering, the Company paid certain eligible finders (each, a \"Finder\") aggregate cash commissions of <money>$169,605.44</money>, being equal to <percent>7%</percent> of the aggregate gross proceeds raised from those purchasers introduced by such Finder, and issued 355,863 common share purchase warrants (each, a \"Finder Warrant\") being equal to <percent>7%</percent> of the number of Shares purchased by those purchasers introduced by such Finder. Each Finder Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire a Share (each, a \"Finder's Warrant Share\") at an exercise price of <money>$0.65</money> per Finder's Warrant Share until the date that is three years after issuance.</p><p>Additionally, Canaccord Genuity Corp. (\"Canaccord\") acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Offering. The Company paid Canaccord a corporate finance fee of <money>$50,000</money> (the \"Corporate Finance Fee\"). The Corporate Finance Fee was settled through the issuance of 76,923 Shares at a deemed price of <money>$0.65</money> per Share.</p><p>Securities issued in the Offering are subject to a four-month hold period in accordance with applicable securities laws, which will expire four months and one day from the date of closing of the Offering. The Offering is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, receipt of all necessary approvals, including approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.</p><p>The Company also announces that at its Annual General Meeting held on February 25, 2026, shareholders approved all matters brought before the meeting, including the election of three new directors:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><p>Raymond Jannas</p></li><li><p>Hunter Scharfe</p></li><li><p>Enrico Gay</p></li></ul><p>The appointments follow the Company's previously announced board strengthening initiatives (see news release dated February 11, 2026).</p><p>Certain directors of the Company (the \"Insiders\") subscribed for an aggregate of 77,155 Shares for aggregate gross proceeds of <money>$50,150.75</money> in the Offering. The Insiders' participation constitutes a \"related party transaction\" within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - <i>Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions</i> (\"MI 61-101\"). The Company is relying on the exemption from the valuation requirements and minority shareholder approvals in MI 61-101 pursuant to subsections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101, respectively, as the value of the Insiders' participation in the Offering does not represent more than <percent>25%</percent> of the Company's market capitalization, as determined in accordance with MI 61-101.</p><p>This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities in the United States. The securities have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"U.S. Securities Act\"), or any state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons unless registered under the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or an exemption from such registration is available.</p><p><strong>About Algo Grande Copper Corp.</strong><br/>Algo Grande Copper Corp. is a growth-focused mineral exploration company advancing the Adelita Project, a district-scale, multi-system copper-gold-silver opportunity positioned in the prolific Arizona-Sonora copper belt.</p><p>The company is dedicated to unlocking the full potential of this under-explored corridor through disciplined data-driven exploration, technical excellence, and a firm commitment to value creation for shareholders. The 5,895-hectare Adelita Project is anchored by the high-grade Cerro Grande Cu-Au-Ag skarn discovery, which exhibits strong continuity along a defined corridor extending over 6 kilometers. Reprocessing of legacy geophysical data and field mapping indicate the presence of a potential porphyry system at depth, suggesting a classic skarn-porphyry mineralization model similar to major deposits found throughout northwestern Mexico.</p><p>ON BEHALF OF ALGO GRANDE COPPER CORP.</p><p>Enrico Gay<br/>Chief Executive Officer</p><p>For more information, please contact:</p><p>E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:info@algo-grande.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">info@algo-grande.com</a></p><p>Website: <a href=\"https://pr.report/j58y\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.algo-grande.com</a></p><p><strong>Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information</strong></p><p><i>NEITHER THE TSX VENTURE EXCHANGE NOR ITS REGULATION SERVICES PROVIDER (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN THE POLICIES OF THE TSX VENTURE EXCHANGE) ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS RELEASE.</i></p><p><i>This news release contains statements and information that, to the extent that they are not historical fact, constitute \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable securities legislation.

The decrease in gross profit is driven by lower revenue and higher product cost due to price increases by certain vendors and the reduction in gross profit margin was the result of a different product and customer mix in this quarter compared to same quarter last year.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><b>Expenses including selling, general and administrative (\"SG&amp;A\") expenses and excluding non-cash items</b>: In the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company reported expenses of <money>$1,391</money> as compared to <money>$1,544</money> in the same period last year, representing a <money>$153</money> or <percent>10%</percent> decrease. The decrease was mainly driven by lower investments in marketing campaigns and digital marketing programs of <money>$182</money> or <percent>32%</percent>, offset by a slight increase in general and administrative costs of <money>$29</money> or <percent>3%</percent> mainly driven by increased investments in investor relation programs. </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><b>Adjusted EBITDA</b><sup><b>(1)</b></sup><b>:</b> In the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company reported Adjusted EBITDA of <money>$(369)</money> as compared to <money>$(194)</money> in the same period last year.

Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of the Company's loss from operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and adjusted for share-based compensation, common shares issued for services, fair value effects of accounting for biological assets and inventories, asset impairment and write-downs, and other non-cash items, and is a non-IFRS measure.</p><p>This measure can be used to analyze and compare profitability among companies and industries, as it eliminates the effects of financing and capital expenditures. It is often used in valuation ratios and can be compared to enterprise value and revenue. This measure does not have any standardized meaning according to IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.</p><p>There are no comparable IFRS financial measures presented in Delivra Health's financial statements. Reconciliations of the supplemental non-IFRS measure are presented in the Company's management discussion and analysis for the three and six months ended December 31, 2025 (the \"<b>Q2 2026 MD&amp;A</b>\"). This non-IFRS financial measure is presented because management has evaluated the financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items and believes that the non-IFRS financial measure presented provides additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the business. The Company believes that the supplemental measure provides information which is useful to shareholders and investors in understanding the Company's performance and may assist in the evaluation of the Company's business relative to that of its peers.</p><p>The non-IFRS financial measure should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with the IFRS financial measures presented in the Company's financial statements. For more information, please see \"Adjusted EBITDA (non-IFRS measure)\"  and \"Non-IFRS Measures\" in the Q2 2026 MD&amp;A, which is available under the Company's SEDAR+ profile on <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/N3KpqSPxRw\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.sedarplus.ca</a>.</p><p><b><font style=\"font-size: 11px;\">Notes:</font></b></p><ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11px;\"><li>This is a non-IFRS reporting measure.
