(Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/NUAI/\" title=\"View NUAI stock overview\">NUAI</a>) (“New Era” or the “Company”), a developer and operator of next-generation digital infrastructure and integrated power assets in the Permian Basin, today announced it has entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent (\"LOI\") to acquire approximately 54 acres of strategically located land adjacent to its Texas Critical Data Centers (“TCDC”) campus in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.ector\">Ector County, Texas</location>.</p><div id=\"bwbodyimg\" style=\"width: 150px; float:left; padding-left:0px; padding-right:20px; padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;\"><img alt=\"Site Overview\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20260226055146/en/2732622/4/New_Era.jpg\"/><p style=\"font-size:85%;\">Site Overview</p></div><p>The contemplated acquisition was undertaken as part of ongoing lease negotiations with a leading hyperscale tenant and partners, where securing the additional acreage emerged as a key milestone in advancing discussions. This development is accompanied by continued site advancement, including initial land clearing, removal of out-of-service and abandoned pipeline infrastructure, relocation of active lines, and subsurface soil sampling to support civil engineering design. These activities are intended to optimize the developable footprint and maximize usable acreage for data center deployment.</p><p>By seeking to consolidate this corridor, New Era is looking to enhance its ability to structure direct power solutions and optimize interconnection design as it advances development of its now 438-acre, master-planned TCDC campus, which is designed to scale to more than 1 gigawatt over time.</p><p>The additional acreage would expand New Era’s capacity to:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Directly on next for major power offtake arrangements with nearby energy generation and transport infrastructure</li><li>Negotiate more efficient and flexible interconnection structures</li><li>Reduce exposure to broader grid congestion and transmission constraints; and</li><li>Enhance redundancy, reliability, and long-term expansion flexibility</li></ul><p>The Company expects control of the corridor between operating generation assets and its campus footprint may potentially increase New Era’s negotiating leverage with power producers while improving development sequencing. It also expands the Company’s options for transmission access and energy integration, which are critical for hyperscale and high-performance computing tenants requiring scalable, resilient power infrastructure.</p><p>E. Will Gray II, CEO of New Era Energy &amp; Digital commented: “By taking the first step to secure this additional 54 acres, we are seeking to strengthen our strategic land position between major power generation and transmission assets and take a pivotal step toward finalizing a definitive lease agreement with our end tenant. This transaction would further reinforce TCDC’s positioning as an integrated power and digital infrastructure platform designed for long-term expansion and operational reliability.”</p><p><b>About New Era Energy &amp; Digital, Inc.<br/></b>New Era Energy &amp; Digital, Inc.

December 3, 2025, the day prior to Land and Buildings’ public presentation. Performance of the Proxy Peer Group Companies represents weighted average of Proxy Peer Group Companies in the 2025 Proxy Statement.</p></td></tr></table><p>FR has underperformed its proxy compensation peers by <percent>17%</percent> over the trailing four-year period and <percent>4%</percent> over the trailing three-year period. These are meaningful shortfalls against the very peer group selected by the Board’s Compensation Committee. Yet management continues to receive peer-level compensation for disappointing results. This is not a portfolio problem, FR’s same-store NOI and FFO growth have been comparable to Prologis and EastGroup. It is clear to us that FR’s underperformance is a governance and communication failure.</p><p>We strongly believe that a Board that has overseen this level of underperformance has no business resisting refreshment. Shockingly, no director has been added to the FR Board in the past five years. If the incumbent Board could not consistently deliver superior returns over 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, why should shareholders trust them to realize the ~<percent>20%</percent> upside to NAV going forward and close the valuation discount to its closest peers?</p><p><b>Steps to Generate Value<br/></b>We urge the Board to take the following actions immediately:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Publicly commit to a plan to close the NAV discount with specific milestones and timelines.</li><li>Initiate a <money>$500M</money>–<money>$1B</money> asset disposition program with proceeds returned to shareholders.</li><li>Schedule an investor day with property tours within 90 days.</li><li>Authorize a formal exploration of strategic alternatives if the discount does not narrow within six months.</li><li>Immediately refresh the Board: Mr. Dominski and Mr. Hackett should not stand for re-election, and their seats, along with the vacancy created following Mr. Rau’s passing, must be filled with directors experienced in capital allocation and REIT value creation.</li></ul><p>Constructive engagement requires a willing partner and to date, we have not found one in FR.

These early performance indicators reflect strong initial audience engagement and highlight the continued market appeal of Mist Theatre’s premium crime content.</p> <p align=\"justify\">As iQIYI’s flagship suspense and crime content label, Mist Theatre is widely recognized for its emphasis on realism, genre execution, and high production standards. <em>The Devil Between Us</em> continues this creative direction by exploring moral dilemmas and social realities within close-knit communities. Through a restrained and grounded narrative lens, the series portrays the cascading impact of crime on ordinary families, interpersonal relationships, and small-town ecosystems—extending beyond conventional crime storytelling toward deeper reflections on human choice and social dynamics. This creative approach places elevated demands on atmospheric consistency, narrative pacing, and overall visual quality.</p> <p align=\"justify\">In alignment with the series’ thematic focus and Mist Theatre’s premium production standards, Mofy VFX supported key visual objectives, including atmospheric enhancement, environmental realism, and narrative rhythm reinforcement. Given the project’s multi-character structure, diverse locations, and interwoven storylines, the team emphasized visual consistency and viewing continuity across complex sequences. Rather than prioritizing speed alone, Mofy VFX focused on delivering stable, controllable, and reusable production capabilities through standardized workflows and mature collaboration processes—providing reliable quality output while maintaining delivery discipline for large-scale projects.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Mrs. Wenjun Jiang, CTO of Global Mofy, commented: “<em>The Devil Between Us</em> is a crime drama that balances genre intensity with grounded social expression, placing high demands on visual atmosphere, narrative pacing, and emotional delivery. Mist Theatre’s premium positioning also requires strong consistency in style, image quality, and delivery stability. The successful completion of this project represents a meaningful milestone for our team’s professional execution, collaborative efficiency, and quality control systems. Looking ahead, we will continue to leverage our experience in complex productions and our stable cross-functional workflows to support creative teams with disciplined production methodologies and rigorous quality standards—delivering visually compelling content while providing reliable, scalable VFX support for future premium projects.”</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>About Global Mofy AI Limited</strong><br/>Global Mofy AI Limited (Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/GMM/\" title=\"View GMM stock overview\">GMM</a>) is a generative AI-driven technology solutions provider engaged in virtual content production, and the development of digital assets for the digital content industry.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 26, 2026) - <b>Minaurum Silver Inc. (TSXV: MGG) (OTCQX: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/MMRGF/\" title=\"View MMRGF stock overview\">MMRGF</a>) (FSE: 78M0) (\"Minaurum\" or the \"Company\")</b> is pleased to report that <b>six drill rigs</b> are now operating at its <b>Alamos Silver Project</b> as part of the <b>Phase II - 50,000-metre resource expansion drill program</b>.  Minaurum will continue step-out drilling on vein zones with established resources at <b>Europa</b> and <b>Promontorio-Travesia</b>, while initiating resource-definition drilling on several additional veins, including <b>San Jose</b>, <b>Quintera, Cotera-Pulpito</b>, and <b>Minas Nuevas</b>.</p><p>Recent step-out drilling at Europa has returned multiple high-grade silver intercepts, including: <b>0.50 m of 524 g/t silver equivalent (\"AgEq\")</b> in hole AL25-172, <b>0.30 m of 1,032 g/t AgEq</b> in hole AL25-174 and <b>1.40 m of 290 g/t AgEq</b> in hole AL25-175.  At Travesía-Quintera, step-out drilling returned <b>2.55 m of 197 g/t AgEq</b>, including <b>0.40 m grading 567 g/t AgEq</b> in hole AL25-173 (see Table 1).</p><p><b>\"With the continued success of our step-out drilling at the Europa vein zone, we are pleased to have expanded our drill fleet from four to six rigs,\" </b>stated Darrell Rader, President and CEO of Minaurum Silver.<b> \"Supported by an inferred resource of 55 million ounces AgEq at Alamos and a fully funded 50,000-metre resource expansion program currently underway, Minaurum is well positioned to deliver an updated mineral resource estimate in the second half of 2026.  We anticipate a steady increase in drill results as the expanded fleet advances the program.\"</b></p><p>Mineralization at the Europa and Travesia-Quintera zones has intersected high-grade silver over narrower widths that clearly define the margins of the robust silver shoots.  The vein system displays a well-developed pinch-and-swell geometry along strike and down-dip, characterized by variations in vein thickness and grade.  This continuity is exemplified by Hole AL25-163 at Europa, which returned 12.35 metres grading 408 g/t AgEq, including 3.20 metres of 1,277 g/t AgEq, in a 250-metre step-out (see Minaurum news release dated February 10, 2026), demonstrating a potentially large expansion of the mineralized envelope.</p><p>At Quintera, drilling continues to intersect mineralization within and surrounding historic underground workings, as well as in parallel hanging-wall veins and along strike.  </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/3455/285489_8c7cd3810420b91b_003full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

Maynard, Vice President of Exploration of Minaurum and a Qualified Person (QP) as defined by National Instrument 43-101, reviewed and verified the assay data, and has approved the disclosure in this news release. Verification was done by visual inspection of core samples and comparison to assay results. Assay results have not been checked by re-analysis. No factors were identified that could materially affect the accuracy or reliability of the data presented in this news release.</font></i></p><p><i><font style=\"font-size: 11px;\"><b>Analytical Procedures and Quality Assurance/Quality Control: </b>Preparation and assaying of drilling samples from Minaurum's Alamos project are done with strict adherence to a Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) protocol. Core samples are sawed in half and then bagged in a secure facility near the site and then shipped either by a licensed courior by Company personnel to ALS Minerals' preparation facility in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. ALS prepares the samples, crushing them to <percent>70%</percent> less than 2mm, splitting off 250g, and pulverizing the split to more than <percent>85%</percent> passing 75 microns. The resulting sample pulps are prepared in Hermosillo and then shipped to Vancouver for chemical analysis by ALS Minerals. In Vancouver, the pulps are analyzed for gold by fire assay and ICP/AES on a 30-gram charge. In addition, analyses are done for silver, copper, lead, and zinc using 4-acid digestion and ICP analysis. Samples with silver values greater than 100 g/t; and copper, lead, or zinc values greater than 10,000 ppm (<percent>1%</percent>) are re-analyzed using 4-acid digestion and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). </font></i></p><p><i><font style=\"font-size: 11px;\">Quality-control (QC) samples are inserted in the sample stream every 20 samples on average, and thus represent <percent>5%</percent> of the total samples. QC samples include standards, blanks, and duplicate samples. Standards are pulps that have been prepared by a third-party laboratory; they have gold, silver, and base-metal values that are established by an extensive analytical process in which several commercial labs (including ALS Minerals) participate. Standards test the calibration of the analytical equipment. Blanks are rock material known from prior sampling to contain less than 0.005 ppm gold; they test the sample preparation procedure for cross-sample contamination.  In the case of duplicates, the sample interval is cut in half and then quartered. The first quarter is the original sample, the second becomes the duplicate. Duplicate samples provide a test of the reproducibility of assays in the same drilled interval. When final assays are received, QC sample results are inspected for deviation from accepted values. To date, QC sample analytical results have fallen in acceptable ranges on the Alamos project.</font></i></p><p><i><font style=\"font-size: 11px;\">When final assays are received, QC sample results are inspected for deviation from accepted values by the QP.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><b>Vertical Structural Continuity Emerging in DDH-26-01<br/>Nova Scotia Introduces Purpose-Built Natural Hydrogen Legislation</b></p><p>Montreal, Quebec--(Newsfile Corp. - February 26, 2026) - Québec Innovative Materials Corp.  (CSE: QIMC) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/QIMCF/\" title=\"View QIMCF stock overview\">QIMCF</a>) (FSE: 7FJ) (\"QIMC\" or the \"Company\") reports that drill hole DDH-26-01 has intersected a second hydrogen-associated structural zone at approximately 313 metres depth at its West Advocate Project, Nova Scotia. This interval from approximately 313 metres to 330 metres depth is distinct from the previously reported 40-metre hydrogen-bearing fault corridor encountered between 142 and 191 metres.</p><p>The identification of two vertically separated hydrogen-associated structural zones within a single borehole supports the interpretation of a structurally controlled, multi-zone natural hydrogen system and further strengthens QIMC's H2 geological model. Drilling at DDH-26-01 remains ongoing toward the planned total depth of 650 metres.</p><p>This development coincides with the Government of Nova Scotia's introduction of the Powering the Economy Act (Bill No. 193), proposed legislation that regulates natural hydrogen as a subsurface energy resource within the Province. This legislative development directly enhances investment certainty and long-term planning capability and demonstrates the Province's and Premier Houston's commitment to establishing Nova Scotia as a hub for responsible clean energy development. The Company's exploration at West Advocate involves no hydraulic fracturing and no reservoir stimulation.</p><p><b>What This Means for Investors</b></p><p>DDH-26-01 has now intersected hydrogen-associated structural intervals at approximately 142 metres and 313 metres depth within a single borehole, supporting the interpretation of a multi-zone, structurally controlled natural hydrogen system rather than an isolated occurrence. In natural hydrogen exploration, structural repetition across depth is a recognized indicator of system continuity and scale. This result further strengthens QIMC's working geological model and provides a defined, systematic, data-driven pathway for the next phases of its Nova Scotia natural hydrogen exploration program.</p><p><b>CEO Commentary</b></p><p>John Karagiannidis, President &amp; CEO of QIMC, stated:</p><p>\"Intersecting a second hydrogen-associated structural zone at 320 metres while Hole 1 continues drilling toward 650 metres significantly strengthens our geological interpretation of West Advocate as a structurally controlled, multi-zone system. We are observing vertically separated brecciated intervals within a single borehole that exhibit geochemical characteristics consistent with hydrogen-bearing environments.</p><p>The Province of Nova Scotia's introduced regulatory framework provides the clarity necessary to responsibly advance multi-well exploration strategies and support long-term planning and investment. As we continue defining structural continuity through drilling and logging, this regulatory certainty underpins our disciplined, systematic approach and we commend the Province for its proactive clean energy leadership.\"</p><p><b>Project Geologist Commentary</b></p><p>Edward Procyshyn, Project Geologist, commented:</p><p>\"Drill logging has identified within the second structural fault zone three separate brecciated shear zones that are progressively more altered and sheared downhole. With progressive alteration, the breccia fragments become more completely replaced by finely crystalline massive dark carbon-graphite and dark mica. Each underlying shear zone is more highly altered than the overlying shear zone. The middle and lower altered shear zones were most highly altered and develop dark, very finely granular, massive carbon-rich intervals 0.5 to 1 metre thick. These highly altered core intervals contain the highest measured hydrogen gas values.</p><p>The host rock within the structural fault zone is also progressively altered as the intensity of shear deformation increases downhole. Thinly bedded, finely granular siltstone, dark carbonaceous mudstone, and fanglomerate are progressively recrystallized to form, within the structural fault zone, massive white, very fine-grained porcelain-like units cut by darker web to lenticular fractures. As shear fracturing and alteration increase in intensity downhole, the intervening porcellanite-like host changes colour from white to pale green and finally to darker greenish grey, indicating mineralogical changes due to increasing conditions of alteration.\"</p><p>Edward Procyshyn continued:</p><p>\"The progressive hydrothermal alteration of this structural fault shear zone supports the model that white native hydrogen is being increasingly generated at lower crustal levels by degassing of a magmatic system and being transported by advective hydrothermal fluids into the fault-related shear structures. This suggests that the degassing may be generated by injection of mantle plumes into the upper crust within the West Advocate area and that this process may have contributed significant amounts of white hydrogen gas that was and is presently being measured in the intersected structural zones and at surface in the soil-gas samples.</p><p>The very low to absent quantities of methane contained in the measured gases support the concept that hydrogen is being generated from crustal sources in a naturally occurring hydrogen system rather than from a conventional hydrocarbon occurrence.\"</p><p><b>Gas Monitoring Observations at 313m</b></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align: start; width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"width: 50%;\">Parameter<br/><br/></td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Observation</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 50%;\">Hydrogen (H₂)<br/><br/></td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Elevated concentrations detected</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 50%;\">Oxygen (O₂)<br/><br/></td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Depleted relative to atmospheric levels</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 50%;\">Methane (CH₄)<br/><br/></td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">None detected</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 50%;\">Hydraulic fracturing / stimulation<br/></td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Not conducted</td></tr></tbody></table><p> <br/>Measurements were collected in ambient atmospheric air near the borehole collar and during core handling and are subject to atmospheric dilution.</p><p><b>2026 Drill Program: Five-Hole Campaign</b></p><p>DDH-26-01 is the first hole in a planned five-hole 2026 drill program designed to systematically evaluate structural hydrogen corridors at West Advocate and adjacent targets.</p><ul><li>Hole 1 (DDH-26-01): Drilling continues toward planned 650 metres depth.<br/><br/></li><li>Hole 2 (DDH-26-02): Planned from same pad; oriented N297° with 55° plunge to the northwest.<br/><br/></li><li>Hole 3 (DDH-26-03): Eatonville Road area along the Reid Line; planned to 700 metres depth.<br/><br/></li><li>Holes 4 &amp; 5 (DDH-26-04 and DDH-26-05): Bennett Hill targets testing the broader regional structural hydrogen corridor.</li></ul><p><b>Nova Scotia Legislation</b></p><p>Nova Scotia's proposed legislation reflects a broader recognition by governments that natural hydrogen warrants a dedicated regulatory framework, a development that directly benefits companies with active exploration programs in the province.

Features like auto-enrollment and auto-escalation can further boost retirement readiness for small business employees.</li><li><b>Social Security: Expectations vs. reality.</b> While many workers expect to retire at 65, the actual median retirement age is 62, often due to unforeseen circumstances. Claiming Social Security at 62 leads to a permanent reduction to <percent>70%</percent> of the full benefit, while waiting until 70 increases monthly payments by <percent>24%</percent> compared to claiming at full retirement age. These trade-offs may be complicated by misconceptions about the future of the program.</li><li><b>Tax-smart savings: Make every dollar count.</b> Choosing the right account type can help you keep more of your retirement savings. For example, diversifying across traditional and tax-free Roth accounts and being strategic about Roth conversions can provide flexibility and control over your tax bill and Medicare premiums in retirement.</li><li><b>The silent risks to retirement spending.</b> Retirement spending often faces overlooked risks, with six in ten new retirees experiencing significant spending volatility in their first three years. Households with more guaranteed income spend up to <percent>44%</percent> more in retirement, highlighting the importance of dependable income and flexible strategies to manage market volatility and unexpected health care costs that may impact long-term financial security.</li></ul><p>J.P.
