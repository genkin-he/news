Approximately <percent>86%</percent> of assets sold to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> buyers, including <percent>39%</percent> purchased by Floridians, with the remaining <percent>14%</percent> purchased by international buyers as far away as <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/vn\">Vietnam</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/sa\">Saudi Arabia</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location>.</p><p>With assets sold through live onsite bidding, online participation and Timed Auction formats, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.orlndo\">Orlando</location> reflected broad global demand early in the year. Cross-border participation and category depth provided a clear snapshot of pricing and buyer appetite as the 2026 market gains momentum. The auction also showcased the broader capabilities of the Ritchie Bros. marketplace, with financing, shipping and other services available to help customers transact with confidence.</p><p>“Orlando continues to deliver scale and visibility that no other event in our industry can match,” said Jake Lawson, President and Head of Ritchie Bros.

On day two, major equipment crossed the ramp for live bidding, marking a single-day revival of a format not seen in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.orlndo\">Orlando</location> since 2019. Then on day four, auctioneers called bids from the sound truck for one day only, bringing a familiar tradition back to the yard. Both moments added energy to the week while reinforcing how <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.orlndo\">Orlando</location> blends long-standing auction heritage with a global digital marketplace. The company also introduced its first invite-only Creator Day, offering digital creators behind-the-scenes access to the auction and extending the event’s reach to new online audiences through social and digital channels.</p><p>“We appreciate the customers who participated onsite and online, along with the creators who helped extend visibility beyond the yard,” Lawson said. “Their engagement reflects the confidence the industry places in our marketplace and in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.orlndo\">Orlando</location> as a key moment on the equipment calendar.”</p><p>For more information about upcoming Ritchie Bros. auctions, visit <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rbauction.com%2F&amp;esheet=54434664&amp;newsitemid=20260226865545&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=rbauction.com&amp;index=1&amp;md5=501a63977cff22b4b66843cb3e2cf081\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">rbauction.com</a>.</p><p><b>About RB Global</b></p><p>RB Global, Inc.

Revenues for Q3-FY26 decreased <percent>25%</percent> from <money><money>$1.3 million</money></money> of revenue in Q3-FY25, primarily due to a decline in software and subscription services revenue from two previously disclosed non-renewals in Fiscal 2025.</li><li>Annual Recurring Revenue (\"ARR\"), a non-IFRS measure, at December 31, 2025 was <money><money>$3.8 million</money></money>.

The world's largest social media company renewed its services agreement for another year, extending the partnership and expanding the scope of work. A large global multinational IT services firm, both a customer and partner, also expanded its engagement. A leading global chemical manufacturer continues to expand its use of Unity Central to improve supply chain visibility and enhance AI-driven information management.</li></ul><p><b>Subsequent to Q3-FY26 Operational Highlights:</b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>On January 6, 2026, the Company announces the expansion and extension of its contract with a leading global IT services firm to support a top‑five <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> financial institution. Boardwalktech and the global IT services firm have been jointly servicing this marquee <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> bank since 2024, transforming manual workflows and processes into automated and compliant solutions running on the Boardwalktech Velocity platform</li><li>On January 20, 2026, the Company announced the launch of Boardwalk Verity™, its next‑generation Intelligent Controls Platform. Purpose‑built for highly regulated organizations, including banks, insurers, and global financial institutions, Verity leverages Generative AI and Agentic AI for controls automation, execution, validation, testing, and continuous monitoring across thousands of business controls.</li></ul><p><b>Management Commentary </b></p><p>\"We continue to see existing customers expand deployments across Velocity and our Digital Ledger platform,\" said Andrew T. Duncan, CEO of Boardwalktech. \"Recent upgrade initiatives and new opportunities are expected to drive incremental professional services revenue and increase high-margin ARR. During the quarter, we enhanced Velocity with AI capabilities and subsequent to quarter-end we formally launched Verity, our first purpose-built AI product focused on automating internal controls testing and monitoring for financial institutions. Early traction with large banks and global partners reinforces our confidence in Verity as a meaningful growth driver. Unity Central also continues to gain momentum with AI enhancements improving enterprise data management and one supply chain customer already live and expanding usage based on measurable ROI. With previous cost reductions now taking effect and improved operating efficiency, we remain focused on accelerating revenue growth and moving toward Adjusted EBITDA breakeven in the near term. We believe the combination of Verity's launch, Velocity expansion, partner leverage, and continued cost discipline sets the stage for improved year-over-year performance and organic growth into Fiscal 2027 and beyond.\"</p><p><b>About Boardwalktech Software Corp.</b></p><p>Boardwalktech has developed a patented Digital Ledger Technology Platform currently used by Fortune 500 companies running mission-critical applications worldwide.

These results capped a productive year for <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/RLJ/\" title=\"View RLJ stock overview\">RLJ</a> in which we advanced a number of our strategic initiatives,\" commented Leslie D.

Against this backdrop, we believe our favorable footprint positions us to capture benefits from unique catalysts including the FIFA World Cup and America's 250th Anniversary celebrations in addition to the continued momentum of business and leisure demand in Urban markets, as well as the ongoing ramp from our recent conversions and renovations.

These Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income or loss as a measure of its operating performance. FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDA<i>re</i>, Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel EBITDA, and Hotel EBITDA Margin, as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company defines such terms.</p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">Funds From Operations (“FFO”)</span></b></p><p>The Company calculates Funds from Operations (“FFO”) in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which defines FFO as net income or loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus depreciation and amortization, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have instead historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most real estate industry investors consider FFO to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company’s operations. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), even though FFO does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders.</p><p>The Company’s calculation of FFO may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use NAREIT's definition of FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. Additionally, FFO may not be helpful when comparing the Company to non-REITs. The Company presents FFO attributable to common shareholders, which includes unitholders of limited partnership interest (“OP units”) in RLJ Lodging Trust, L.P., the Company’s operating partnership, because the OP units may be redeemed for common shares of the Company. The Company believes it is meaningful for the investor to understand FFO attributable to all common shares and OP units.</p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">EBITDA and EBITDA<i>re</i></span></b></p><p>Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is defined as net income or loss excluding: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sales of assets; and (3) depreciation and amortization expense. The Company considers EBITDA useful to an investor in evaluating and facilitating comparisons of its operating performance between periods and between REITs by removing the impact of its capital structure (primarily interest expense) and asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense) from its operating results. In addition, EBITDA is used as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions.</p><p>In addition to EBITDA, the Company presents EBITDA<i>re</i> in accordance with NAREIT guidelines, which defines EBITDA<i>re </i>as net income or loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax benefit or expense, depreciation and amortization expense, gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. The Company believes that the presentation of EBITDA<i>re</i> provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs.</p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">Adjustments to FFO and EBITDA</span></b></p><p>The Company adjusts FFO, EBITDA, and EBITDA<i>re</i> for certain items that the Company considers outside the normal course of operations. The Company believes that Adjusted FFO, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding its ongoing operating performance that, when considered with net income or loss, FFO, EBITDA, and EBITDA<i>re</i>, are beneficial to an investor’s understanding of the Company's operating performance. The Company adjusts FFO, EBITDA, and EBITDA<i>re</i> for the following items:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li><i>Transaction Costs:</i> The Company excludes transaction costs expensed during the period</li><li><i>Pre-Opening Costs:</i> The Company excludes certain costs related to pre-opening of hotels</li><li><i>Non-Cash Expenses:</i> The Company excludes the effect of certain non-cash items such as the amortization of share-based compensation, non-cash income tax expense or benefit, and non-cash interest expense related to discontinued interest rate hedges</li><li><i>Other Non-Operational Expenses:</i> The Company excludes the effect of certain non-operational expenses representing income and expenses outside the normal course of operations</li></ul><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">Hotel EBITDA and Hotel EBITDA Margin</span></b></p><p>With respect to Consolidated Hotel EBITDA, the Company believes that excluding the effect of corporate-level expenses and certain non-cash items provides a more complete understanding of the operating results over which individual hotels and operators have direct control. The Company believes property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operational performance of the Company’s hotels and the effectiveness of third-party management companies.</p><p>Comparable Hotel EBITDA and Comparable Hotel EBITDA margin include prior ownership information provided by the sellers of the hotels for periods prior to our acquisition of the hotels and excludes results from sold hotels as applicable.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related costs, gains or losses on early retirement of debt, separation transaction costs, and equity in earnings or losses from unconsolidated subsidiaries. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue.

Across our portfolio, we delivered double-digit revenue growth and significant margin expansion highlighting the strength of our operating model.</p><p>“Within Construction Products, the successful integration of Stavola accelerated growth and was highly accretive to segment margin, reflecting its premier financial attributes and exposure to lower volatility infrastructure-led end-markets in the nation's largest MSA. Growth in Engineered Structures was driven by organic expansion in our utility structures business, which benefited from elevated customer investment in grid modernization, along with increased wind tower production at our recently opened plant in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nm\">New Mexico</location>. Our portfolio also benefited from solid execution in the barge business throughout the year, highlighted by strong revenue and margin expansion.”</p><p>Carrillo continued, “We have continued to streamline our portfolio and strengthen our balance sheet, through earnings growth, margin expansion and disciplined capital management, achieving our target leverage ratio two quarters ahead of plan. We will continue to take a balanced approach toward capital allocation, investing in our businesses, both organically and inorganically, to further position our portfolio for sustainable long-term growth.”</p><p><b>Barge Business Divestiture</b></p><p>On February 24, 2026, Arcosa announced that it has entered into an agreement with Wynnchurch Capital L.P. to sell its barge business, Arcosa Marine Products, Inc., for <money><money>$450 million</money></money> in cash, subject to customary transaction adjustments. The divestiture is expected to close in the second quarter of 2026, after regulatory approval and satisfying customary closing conditions.</p><p><b>2026 Outlook and Guidance</b></p><p>Arcosa announced the following total Company guidance for full year 2026, excluding any potential impact related to the barge divestiture:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Consolidated revenues range of <money><money>$2.95 billion</money></money> to <money><money>$3.10 billion</money></money>, compared to <money><money>$2.88 billion</money></money> in 2025.</li><li>Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA range of <money><money>$590 million</money></money> to <money><money>$640 million</money></money>, compared to <money><money>$583.3 million</money></money> in 2025.</li><li>Included in the total Company guidance is full year revenues of <money><money>$410 million</money></money> to <money><money>$430 million</money></money> and full year Adjusted EBITDA of <money><money>$70 million</money></money> to <money><money>$75 million</money></money> from the inland barge business.</li></ul><p>Carrillo concluded, “We enter 2026 in our most resilient position to date, supported by the attractive fundamentals underlying our infrastructure-led businesses and the success of the strategic actions we have executed to transform our portfolio.</p><p>“Our consolidated guidance for 2026 reflects double-digit combined Adjusted EBITDA expansion for our growth businesses and additional margin uplift, led by robust demand in utility structures and positive construction market activity. Based on our current backlog, we anticipate lower volume and profitability in our wind towers business in 2026, with a recovery in 2027.</p><p>“The announcement to divest our barge business marks a pivotal step in the Company’s evolution, centering our focus on our key growth businesses, construction materials and engineered structures. The divestiture positions us to move from portfolio transformation to optimization, as we remain focused on creating value for our shareholders.”</p><p><b>Fourth Quarter 2025 Results and Commentary</b></p><p><i>All comparisons are versus the prior year quarter unless noted otherwise.</i></p><p><b>Construction Products</b></p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Revenues decreased <percent>2%</percent> to <money><money>$305.4 million</money></money> primarily due to lower freight revenues largely for Stavola.

is defined as net income plus interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, and amortization. “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain items that are not reflective of the normal earnings of our business. GAAP does not define EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA and they should not be considered as alternatives to earnings measures defined by GAAP, including net income. We use Adjusted EBITDA to assess the operating performance of our consolidated business, as a metric for incentive-based compensation, as a measure within our lending arrangements, and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting as we believe that it closely correlates to long-term shareholder value. As a widely used metric by analysts, investors, and competitors in our industry, we believe Adjusted EBITDA also assists investors in comparing a company's performance on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation, depletion, amortization, and other items which can vary significantly depending on many factors. “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenues.</p></td></tr></table><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl bwwidth100\"><tr><td class=\"bwvertalignb bwpadl0 bwwidth35\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p

defined as segment operating profit plus depreciation, depletion, and amortization. “Adjusted Segment EBITDA” is defined as Segment EBITDA adjusted for certain items that are not reflective of the normal earnings of our business. GAAP does not define Segment EBITDA or Adjusted Segment EBITDA and they should not be considered as alternatives to earnings measures defined by GAAP, including segment operating profit. We use Adjusted Segment EBITDA to assess the operating performance of our businesses, as a metric for incentive-based compensation, and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting as we believe that it closely correlates to long-term shareholder value. As a widely used metric by analysts, investors, and competitors in our industry we believe Adjusted Segment EBITDA also assists investors in comparing a company's performance on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation, depletion, amortization, and other items, which can vary significantly depending on many factors. “Adjusted Segment EBITDA Margin” is defined as Adjusted Segment EBITDA divided by Revenues.</p></td></tr></table><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl bwwidth100\"><tr><td class=\"bwvertalignb bwpadl0 bwwidth49\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p

We use this metric to calculate “Aggregates Freight-Adjusted Average Sales Price”, which is Aggregates Freight-Adjusted Revenues divided by shipments. “Aggregates Adjusted Cash Gross Profit” is defined as aggregates gross profit plus depreciation, depletion, and amortization and adjusted for certain items that are not reflective of the normal earnings of our business. “Aggregates Adjusted Cash Gross Profit Per Ton” is Aggregates Adjusted Cash Gross Profit divided by shipments. GAAP does not define these metrics and they should not be considered as alternatives to earnings measures defined by GAAP, including aggregates revenues and aggregates gross profit. We believe that this presentation is consistent with our competitors. These metrics are used by analysts and investors in comparing a company's performance on a consistent basis.</p></td></tr></table><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl

Revenues from commercial, state and local and international government clients increased <percent>16%</percent> and accounted for <percent>62%</percent> of fourth quarter revenues. This performance served to offset a large portion of the year-on-year reduction in federal government revenues, which was amplified by the direct and indirect impacts of the six-week federal government shutdown.</p><p>\"ICF continued to experience robust demand from our commercial energy clients, driving revenue growth in this client category of <percent>23%</percent> in the fourth quarter and <percent>24%</percent> for the full year. Approximately <percent>80%</percent> of our 2025 commercial energy revenues were related to our market-leading programs for utility clients on energy efficiency, flexible load management, electrification and grid optimization. These are critical areas for our utility clients as they address increasing electricity demand and the need for grid resilience and energy affordability.</p><p>\"We succeeded in maintaining full year 2025 margins that were similar to those of 2024, despite the revenue decline. Year-on-year gross margins expanded by more than 60 basis points and Adjusted EBITDA margin on total revenues was <percent>11.1%</percent> in 2025 compared to <percent>11.2%</percent> in 2024, benefitting from the increased contribution of higher-margin commercial energy revenues and cost management initiatives, while we continued to invest in growth initiatives and emerging technologies including our AI service offerings. Additionally, fixed price and time and materials contracts accounted for approximately <percent>93%</percent> of 2025 revenues compared to <percent>89%</percent> in 2024, while cost reimbursement contracts declined to <percent>7%</percent>.</p><p>\"ICF ended 2025 with a firm backlog, a healthy book-to-bill ratio of 1.19 and a business development pipeline of <money><money>$8.6 billion</money></money>, reflecting effective execution on existing contracts and our agility in capturing new business opportunities with capabilities that support our expectations for future growth.

Our 2025 revenues were firmly within the guidance framework we provided one year ago despite the six-week government shutdown, we maintained our margins, and we built the foundation for a return to growth in 2026. This performance underscores ICF's competitive strengths, namely our diversified business model, deep domain expertise and cross-cutting technology offerings that are primarily provided under outcome-based contracts.</p><p>\"We expect our 2026 revenues to range from <money><money>$1.89 billion</money></money> to <money><money>$1.96 billion</money></money>, representing <percent>3%</percent> growth at the midpoint, GAAP EPS to range from <money><money>$5.95</money></money> to <money><money>$6.25</money></money>, and Non-GAAP EPS to range from <money><money>$6.95</money></money> to <money><money>$7.25</money></money>, or <percent>5%</percent> growth at the midpoint. These expectations anticipate another year of double-digit revenue growth from our non-federal government clients, which we estimate will account for more than <percent>60%</percent> of our total 2026 revenues, and a return to year-on-year growth in certain parts of our federal government business. Full-year operating cash flow is estimated to range from <money><money>$135 million</money></money> to <money><money>$150 million</money></money>.</p><p>\"With respect to the cadence of the year, we generally expect sequential improvement in federal revenues from the first quarter through the third quarter of 2026, returning to year-on-year growth by the fourth quarter. Our first-quarter comparisons will be down as we will be comparing against a quarter that included federal government contract work that was cancelled between February and May of last year. For the first quarter of 2026, we expect total revenues of approximately <money><money>$450 million</money></money>, GAAP EPS of approximately <money><money>$1.20</money></money>, and Non-GAAP EPS of approximately <money><money>$1.55</money></money>.</p><p>\"We appreciate the tremendous contributions made by our professional staff, whose commitment to excellent client work was critical to our ability to navigate 2025 and whose dedication to ICF supports our confidence in a return to growth in 2026,\" Mr. Wasson concluded.</p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"prnbcc\"><tr><td class=\"prnpr2 prnpl2 prnvab prnsbtb0 prnrbrb0 prnsbbb0 prnsblb0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><sup>1</sup> Non-GAAP EPS, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measurements.

A reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures for sales-led subscription revenue, operating margin and net earnings/(loss) per share is not available without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, many of the costs and expenses that may be incurred in the future.

Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements are included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2025 and subsequent quarterly and current reports filed with the SEC. SEC filings are available on the Investor Relations section of Elastic’s website at ir.elastic.co and the SEC’s website at <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&amp;esheet=54434271&amp;newsitemid=20260226919094&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.sec.gov&amp;index=1&amp;md5=c135fce54a1d075eb4678d08e2da0686\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">www.sec.gov</a>. Elastic assumes no obligation to, and does not currently intend to, update any such forward-looking statements, except as required by law.</p><p><b>Statement Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures</b></p><p>In addition to our results determined in accordance with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we believe the non-GAAP measures discussed below are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. Investors are cautioned that there are a number of limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics as analytical tools. Investors are encouraged to review the differences between GAAP financial measures and the corresponding non-GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business and financial results.</p><p>Reconciliations of historical GAAP financial measures to their respective historical non-GAAP financial measures are included below. In relation to constant currency non-GAAP financial measures, the only reconciling item between GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures is the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Further details on how we calculate such effects can be found in the definition of “Constant Currency” below.</p><p><b>Sales-led Subscription Revenue</b></p><p>Sales-led subscription revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as total subscription revenue excluding Monthly Elastic Cloud. We believe sales-led subscription revenue provides management and our investors with a consistent metric with which to measure the health of our business.</p><p><b>Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin</b></p><p>We define non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin as GAAP gross profit and GAAP gross margin, respectively, excluding stock-based compensation expense and related employer taxes, and amortization of acquired intangible assets. We believe non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations, as these metrics generally eliminate the effects of certain variables from period to period for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.</p><p><b>Non-GAAP Operating Income and Non-GAAP Operating Margin</b></p><p>We define non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin as GAAP operating income/(loss) and GAAP operating margin, respectively, excluding stock-based compensation expense and related employer taxes, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses, and restructuring and other related charges. We believe non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations, as these metrics generally eliminate the effects of certain variables from period to period for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.</p><p><b>Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share</b></p><p>We define non-GAAP net income as GAAP income/(loss), excluding stock-based compensation expense and related employer taxes, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses, and restructuring and other related charges. Additionally, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are adjusted for an assumed provision for income taxes based on a projected non-GAAP annual effective tax rate of <percent>13%</percent>. We define non-GAAP earnings per share, basic, as non-GAAP net income divided by weighted average shares outstanding and non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted, as non-GAAP net income divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding, which includes the potentially dilutive effect of the company’s employee equity incentive plan awards. We believe non-GAAP earnings per share provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as this metric generally eliminates the effects of certain variables from period to period for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.</p><p><b>Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin</b></p><p>Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for cash paid for interest on long-term debt less cash used for investing activities for purchases of property and equipment. Adjusted free cash flow margin is calculated as adjusted free cash flow divided by total revenue. Adjusted free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since, among other things, we have mandatory debt service requirements.</p><p><b>Constant Currency</b></p><p>We compare the percent change in certain results from one period to another period using constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. In presenting this information, current and comparative prior period results are converted into <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location> dollars at the exchange rates in effect on the last day of our prior fiscal year, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods.</p><p><b>Contact Information</b></p><p>Elastic Investor Relations<br/><a

We believe this approach provides investors with a more consistent view of our underlying operating performance. Our annual projected non-GAAP tax rate excludes the impact from stock-based compensation expense and related employer taxes, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses, restructuring and other related charges, discrete tax items, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, and other non-recurring tax adjustments, which may vary in size and frequency. Our annual projected non-GAAP tax rate may change due to factors such as new tax legislation, shifts in the geographic mix of earnings, or other significant business developments. We assess this rate as needed to ensure it reflects current conditions. Applying a consistent annual rate improves comparability across reporting periods by excluding the effects of discrete or non-recurring tax items.</p></td></tr></table><table cellspacing=\"0\"
