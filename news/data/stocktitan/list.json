Continued approval for this indication, which was based on an improvement in annualized growth velocity (AGV), may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).</p> <p>Achondroplasia is a rare genetic condition causing skeletal dysplasia and, for many affected individuals, an increased risk of muscular, neurological, and cardiorespiratory complications. YUVIWEL is a prodrug of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) administered once weekly, designed to provide continuous exposure of active CNP to receptors on tissues throughout the body to counteract the overactive FGFR3 signaling in achondroplasia.</p> <p>“The approval of once-weekly YUVIWEL is a major step forward in the treatment of children with achondroplasia, giving physicians for the first time the option of prescribing a once-weekly medicine backed by compelling efficacy and excellent tolerability data from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials,” said Carlos A. Bacino, MD, FACMG, Professor of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children’s Hospital. “My goal is to help children and parents develop care plans tailored to their individual needs and objectives, and I look forward to adding YUVIWEL to my discussions with them.”</p> <p>“Little People of America, the largest national advocacy and support organization for people with dwarfism, is committed to ensuring that the voices of people with dwarfism remain central in conversations about research and medical options such as YUVIWEL,” said the Board of Directors of Little People of America. “We champion dwarf and disability pride, advocate for inclusion and respect, and foster open dialogue across diverse perspectives. Our goal is to empower individuals and families to make healthcare decisions that reflect their own values and experiences, while pushing for research efforts and new treatment options such as this that could have the potential to support outcomes that truly matter to our community.”</p> <p>The FDA based its approval of YUVIWEL on their review of the clinical package for TransCon CNP submitted with the Company’s New Drug Application, which included safety and efficacy data from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials and up to three years of open-label extension data. The pivotal ApproaCH Trial data is available in <em>JAMA Pediatrics</em>.<sup>i</sup></p> <p>“We are confident in YUVIWEL’s potential to transform the treatment of achondroplasia and are deeply grateful to patients, clinicians, and advocates for their many contributions to this important milestone,” said Jan Mikkelsen, President and Chief Executive Officer at Ascendis Pharma. “We have listened to advocacy groups for people with dwarfism to ensure we address what the community actually cares about. This reflects our ongoing commitment to pursue outcomes that patient communities have told us are important to them, and gives the achondroplasia community a new way to look at the promise of pharmacological treatment options.”</p> <p>Ascendis expects to make YUVIWEL available through prescribing physicians in the United States during the early part of the second quarter of 2026. Ascendis plans to offer a suite of patient services for YUVIWEL through its U.S. Ascendis Signature Access Program (A.S.A.P.), including support navigating the treatment journey and financial assistance programs for eligible patients.</p> <p>With this approval, the FDA also issued a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV), which confers priority review to a subsequent drug application that would not otherwise qualify for priority review. This program is designed to encourage development of new drugs and biologics for the prevention or treatment of rare pediatric diseases.</p> <p><strong>Conference Call and Webcast Information</strong><br/>Ascendis will host a call to review the FDA approval of YUVIWEL on Monday, March 2, 2026, at 8:00 am ET.

While historically considered a bone growth disorder, the FGFR3 variant seen in achondroplasia is expressed in tissues throughout the body, and is associated with an increased risk of muscular, neurological, and cardiorespiratory complications in addition to skeletal dysplasia. Medical complications of achondroplasia can vary from individual to individual and across different stages of life. Throughout infancy and childhood, observed complications include spinal abnormalities, enlarged brain ventricles, impaired muscle strength and reduced stamina, hearing deficits and chronic ear infections, upper airway obstructions, sleep-disordered breathing, hip problems, leg bowing, and chronic pain; some of which persist or worsen in adulthood. These medical complications can affect quality of life, physical well-being, influenced by a range of clinical, social, and individual factors. Some individuals with achondroplasia require multiple procedures and surgeries to address specific functional or anatomical concerns.</p> <p><strong>About Ascendis Pharma A/S</strong><br/>Ascendis Pharma is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on applying our innovative TransCon technology platform to make a meaningful difference for patients.

(\"Algo Grande\") (TSXV:ALGR)(OTC:<a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/KNDYF/\" title=\"View KNDYF stock overview\">KNDYF</a>)(FRA:KM00) announces the closing of its previously announced non-brokered private placement and the election of three new directors at its Annual General Meeting held on February 25, 2026.</p><p>Pursuant to its news releases dated February 11, 2026 and February 19, 2026, the Company has closed its previously announced non-brokered private placement (the \"Offering\") of common shares in the capital of the Company (the \"Shares\"), at a deemed price of <money>$0.65</money> per Share. The Offering consisted of 10,037,020 Shares for aggregate gross proceeds of <money>$6,524,063.</money></p><p>The Offering will fund the next phase of exploration at the Company's <percent>100%</percent>-owned Adelita Project in Sonora, Mexico, focused on a Phase II drill program. Phase I drilling at the Cerro Grande skarn intersected multiple stacked Cu-Au-Ag skarn horizons at depth, including skarn zones that had not been identified by historic drilling. The upcoming program will target expansion drilling at Cerro Grande and first-pass drilling along an approximately 6-kilometre prospective limestone corridor hosting multiple, undrilled, outcropping skarn targets. Proceeds from the Offering will also be used for additional operating costs and general working capital requirements.</p><p>Commenting on the opportunity at Adelita, newly elected Director Raymond Jannas stated: \"The Adelita Project exhibits many of the characteristics we look for in emerging district-scale systems, high-grade skarn mineralization with clear geological vectors toward a deeper potential porphyry source. What excites me most is the combination of compelling geology and a focused, determined team that is executing with discipline. With capital in place and a clear exploration roadmap, Algo Grande is well positioned to unlock the broader potential of this system.\"</p><p>In connection with the closing of the Offering, the Company paid certain eligible finders (each, a \"Finder\") aggregate cash commissions of <money>$169,605.44</money>, being equal to <percent>7%</percent> of the aggregate gross proceeds raised from those purchasers introduced by such Finder, and issued 355,863 common share purchase warrants (each, a \"Finder Warrant\") being equal to <percent>7%</percent> of the number of Shares purchased by those purchasers introduced by such Finder. Each Finder Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire a Share (each, a \"Finder's Warrant Share\") at an exercise price of <money>$0.65</money> per Finder's Warrant Share until the date that is three years after issuance.</p><p>Additionally, Canaccord Genuity Corp. (\"Canaccord\") acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Offering. The Company paid Canaccord a corporate finance fee of <money>$50,000</money> (the \"Corporate Finance Fee\"). The Corporate Finance Fee was settled through the issuance of 76,923 Shares at a deemed price of <money>$0.65</money> per Share.</p><p>Securities issued in the Offering are subject to a four-month hold period in accordance with applicable securities laws, which will expire four months and one day from the date of closing of the Offering. The Offering is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, receipt of all necessary approvals, including approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.</p><p>The Company also announces that at its Annual General Meeting held on February 25, 2026, shareholders approved all matters brought before the meeting, including the election of three new directors:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><p>Raymond Jannas</p></li><li><p>Hunter Scharfe</p></li><li><p>Enrico Gay</p></li></ul><p>The appointments follow the Company's previously announced board strengthening initiatives (see news release dated February 11, 2026).</p><p>Certain directors of the Company (the \"Insiders\") subscribed for an aggregate of 77,155 Shares for aggregate gross proceeds of <money>$50,150.75</money> in the Offering. The Insiders' participation constitutes a \"related party transaction\" within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - <i>Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions</i> (\"MI 61-101\"). The Company is relying on the exemption from the valuation requirements and minority shareholder approvals in MI 61-101 pursuant to subsections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101, respectively, as the value of the Insiders' participation in the Offering does not represent more than <percent>25%</percent> of the Company's market capitalization, as determined in accordance with MI 61-101.</p><p>This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities in the United States. The securities have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"U.S. Securities Act\"), or any state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons unless registered under the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or an exemption from such registration is available.</p><p><strong>About Algo Grande Copper Corp.</strong><br/>Algo Grande Copper Corp. is a growth-focused mineral exploration company advancing the Adelita Project, a district-scale, multi-system copper-gold-silver opportunity positioned in the prolific Arizona-Sonora copper belt.</p><p>The company is dedicated to unlocking the full potential of this under-explored corridor through disciplined data-driven exploration, technical excellence, and a firm commitment to value creation for shareholders. The 5,895-hectare Adelita Project is anchored by the high-grade Cerro Grande Cu-Au-Ag skarn discovery, which exhibits strong continuity along a defined corridor extending over 6 kilometers. Reprocessing of legacy geophysical data and field mapping indicate the presence of a potential porphyry system at depth, suggesting a classic skarn-porphyry mineralization model similar to major deposits found throughout northwestern Mexico.</p><p>ON BEHALF OF ALGO GRANDE COPPER CORP.</p><p>Enrico Gay<br/>Chief Executive Officer</p><p>For more information, please contact:</p><p>E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:info@algo-grande.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">info@algo-grande.com</a></p><p>Website: <a href=\"https://pr.report/j58y\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.algo-grande.com</a></p><p><strong>Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information</strong></p><p><i>NEITHER THE TSX VENTURE EXCHANGE NOR ITS REGULATION SERVICES PROVIDER (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN THE POLICIES OF THE TSX VENTURE EXCHANGE) ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS RELEASE.</i></p><p><i>This news release contains statements and information that, to the extent that they are not historical fact, constitute \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable securities legislation.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Year to date sales growth of Dream Water® E-commerce of <percent>26%</percent> offset by a decline of Dream Water® Retail of <percent>4%</percent> compared to same period last year</i></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Year to date sales growth of LivRelief™ E-commerce of 28 % offset by a decline in LivRelief™ Retail of <percent>29%</percent> compared to same period last year</i></p><p>Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 27, 2026) - Delivra Health Brands Inc. (TSXV: DHB) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/DHBUF/\" title=\"View DHBUF stock overview\">DHBUF</a>) (\"<b>Delivra Health</b>\" or the \"<b>Company</b>\"), a consumer packaged goods company uniquely positioned in the health and wellness sector, is pleased to announce its financial and operating results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2025 (\"<b>Q2 2026</b>\"). The Delivra Health portfolio features innovative brands Dream Water® and LivRelief™, which deliver relief from common health issues such as sleeplessness, chronic pain and anxiety.</p><p>During the first half of fiscal 2026, the Company has seen encouraging momentum in its targeted e-commerce strategy and continued growth within the Dream Water® brand. Year-to-date e-commerce sales increased <percent>26%</percent> for Dream Water® and <percent>28%</percent> for LivRelief™, reflecting strong consumer engagement and repeat purchasing behavior. At the same time, overall revenue has been impacted by temporary shifts in customer ordering patterns across certain retail markets, along with the transition of our licensed LivRelief™ Infused distribution channel. While these factors have created near-term variability in reported results, underlying consumer demand for the Company's core brands remains solid, and management is actively addressing fluctuations in distribution timing and engaging in channel optimization to stabilize and accelerate growth in the second half of fiscal 2026.</p><p><b>Management Commentary</b></p><p>\"While our results this quarter reflect temporary timing variability in certain retail markets, we are encouraged by the strength of our core business fundamentals. Our targeted e-commerce strategy continues to deliver measurable growth, our U.S. expansion remains a key driver, and consumer demand for both Dream Water® and LivRelief™ continues to develop,\" said Gord Davey, President and Chief Executive Officer of Delivra Health Brands Inc. \"We are focused on disciplined execution — strengthening distribution, optimizing customer mix, advancing innovation, and investing in scalable revenue channels. As we move through the second half of fiscal 2026, our priority remains clear: stabilize retail ordering patterns, reignite growth in licensed markets, and continue expanding high-margin direct-to-consumer and U.S. retail opportunities. We believe these initiatives position us well to return to consistent revenue growth while maintaining financial responsibility.\"</p><p><b>Financial Highlights for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2025</b><br/><i>(<b>Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)</b></i></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><b>Net revenue:</b> In the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company reported total net revenue of <money>$2,433</money> as compared to <money>$2,754</money> in same period last year, representing approximately a <money>$321</money> or <percent>12%</percent> decrease. This net decrease was primarily due to lower sales of Dream Water® in the U.S. and Canada by <money>$183</money>, lower sales of LivRelief™ OTC by <money>$93</money> impacted by the timing of customer ordering patterns and partially, offset by growing ecommerce LivRelief™ OTC sales, and finally lower sales of LivRelief™ Infused topical creams by <money>$45</money> due to the transition to a new licensed distribution partner. </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><b>Gross profit and gross profit margin:</b> In the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company reported gross profit of <money>$972</money> and a gross profit margin of <percent>40%</percent> as compared to <money>$1,294</money> and <percent>47%</percent> in the same period last year. The decrease in gross profit is driven by lower revenue and higher product cost due to price increases by certain vendors and the reduction in gross profit margin was the result of a different product and customer mix in this quarter compared to same quarter last year.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><b>Expenses including selling, general and administrative (\"SG&amp;A\") expenses and excluding non-cash items</b>: In the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company reported expenses of <money>$1,391</money> as compared to <money>$1,544</money> in the same period last year, representing a <money>$153</money> or <percent>10%</percent> decrease. The decrease was mainly driven by lower investments in marketing campaigns and digital marketing programs of <money>$182</money> or <percent>32%</percent>, offset by a slight increase in general and administrative costs of <money>$29</money> or <percent>3%</percent> mainly driven by increased investments in investor relation programs. </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><b>Adjusted EBITDA</b><sup><b>(1)</b></sup><b>:</b> In the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company reported Adjusted EBITDA of <money>$(369)</money> as compared to <money>$(194)</money> in the same period last year. This reduction in Adjusted EBITDA is the result of lower sales volume and gross profit as explained above. </p><p><b>Financial Highlights for the Six Months Ended December 31, 2025</b><br/><i>(<b>Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)</b></i></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><b>Net revenue:</b> In the six months ended December 31, 2025, the Company reported total net revenue of <money>$5,640</money> compared to <money>$5,917</money> in same period last year, representing a <money>$277</money> or <percent>5%</percent> decrease. This decrease was due to higher sales of Dream Water® in the U.S and Canada by <money>$29</money> offset by lower sales of LivRelief™ OTC of <money>$61</money> impacted by the timing of customer ordering patterns and finally lower sales of <money>$245</money> of LivRelief™ Infused topical creams due to the transition to a new distribution channel in Canada. These declines were partially offset by increased e-commerce sales of LivRelief™ OTC by <percent>28%</percent> and Dream Water® products in Canada and USA by <percent>26%</percent> driven by strong consumer demand and online marketing. The Company is currently reviewing its market distribution strategy for licensed LivRelief™ Infused products and intends to resume its growth strategy in the second half of fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><b>Gross profit and gross profit margin:</b> In the six months ended December 31, 2025, the Company reported year-to-date gross profit of <money>$2,473</money> and a gross profit margin of <percent>44%</percent> as compared to <money>$2,891</money> and <percent>49%</percent> in same period last year. The reduction in gross profit and gross profit margin was the result of a change in customer mix and product cost and mix.  </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><b>Expenses including selling, general and administrative (\"SG&amp;A\") expenses and excluding non-cash items</b>: In the six months ended December 31, 2025, the Company reported expenses of <money>$2,838</money> compared to <money>$3,149</money> in the same period last year, representing a <percent>10%</percent> decrease. Prior year fiscal 2025 first half sales and marketing expenses were higher than the first half of fiscal 2026 sales and marketing expenses by <money>$426</money> or <percent>34%</percent> given that the Company released in November 2024 two major marketing campaigns, 'Shush Your Mind' for Dream Water® and 'Quiets Chronic Pain' for LivRelief™. General and administrative costs were higher in the first half of fiscal 2026 compared with same period last year by <money>$115</money> or <percent>6%</percent> mainly as a result of higher investor relation programs and higher professional and consulting services offset by lower salaries costs. </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><b>Adjusted EBITDA</b><sup><b>(1)</b></sup><b>:</b> In the six months ended December 31, 2025, the Company reported Adjusted EBITDA of <money>$(313)</money> compared to <money>$(176)</money> in the same period last year, representing a <money>$(137)</money> year-over-year reduction.

Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of the Company's loss from operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and adjusted for share-based compensation, common shares issued for services, fair value effects of accounting for biological assets and inventories, asset impairment and write-downs, and other non-cash items, and is a non-IFRS measure.</p><p>This measure can be used to analyze and compare profitability among companies and industries, as it eliminates the effects of financing and capital expenditures. It is often used in valuation ratios and can be compared to enterprise value and revenue. This measure does not have any standardized meaning according to IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.</p><p>There are no comparable IFRS financial measures presented in Delivra Health's financial statements. Reconciliations of the supplemental non-IFRS measure are presented in the Company's management discussion and analysis for the three and six months ended December 31, 2025 (the \"<b>Q2 2026 MD&amp;A</b>\"). This non-IFRS financial measure is presented because management has evaluated the financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items and believes that the non-IFRS financial measure presented provides additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the business. The Company believes that the supplemental measure provides information which is useful to shareholders and investors in understanding the Company's performance and may assist in the evaluation of the Company's business relative to that of its peers.</p><p>The non-IFRS financial measure should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with the IFRS financial measures presented in the Company's financial statements. For more information, please see \"Adjusted EBITDA (non-IFRS measure)\"  and \"Non-IFRS Measures\" in the Q2 2026 MD&amp;A, which is available under the Company's SEDAR+ profile on <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/N3KpqSPxRw\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.sedarplus.ca</a>.</p><p><b><font style=\"font-size: 11px;\">Notes:</font></b></p><ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11px;\"><li>This is a non-IFRS reporting measure.

The PAH enzyme is required for the metabolism of Phe, an essential amino acid found in most protein-containing foods. If functional enzyme is not present in sufficient quantities, Phe accumulates to abnormally high levels in the blood and becomes toxic to the brain, resulting in a variety of complications including severe intellectual disability, seizures, tremors, behavioral problems and psychiatric symptoms.</p><p>As a result of newborn screening efforts implemented in the 1960s and early 1970s, virtually all individuals with PKU born after this period in countries with newborn screening programs are diagnosed at birth and treatment is implemented soon after.</p><p>PKU can be managed with a severe Phe-restricted diet, supplemented by low-protein modified foods and Phe-free medical foods; however, it is difficult for most individuals to adhere to this strict diet to the extent needed to achieve adequate control of blood Phe levels. Dietary control of Phe in childhood can prevent major developmental issues and neurological consequences, but poor Phe control in adolescence and adulthood is associated with a range of neuropsychological deficits and functional impairment.</p><p><b>PALYNZIQ <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Indication and Important Safety Information</b></p><p>PALYNZIQ<sup>®</sup> (pegvaliase-pqpz) is a phenylalanine (Phe)-metabolizing enzyme indicated to reduce blood Phe concentrations in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with phenylketonuria (PKU) who have uncontrolled blood Phe concentrations greater than 600 micromol/L (10 mg/dL) on existing management.</p><p><b>BOXED WARNING: ANAPHYLAXIS</b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>Anaphylaxis has been reported after administration of PALYNZIQ and may occur at any time during treatment.</li><li>Administer the initial dose of PALYNZIQ under the supervision of a healthcare provider equipped to manage anaphylaxis, and closely observe patients for at least 60 minutes following injection.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><strong id=\"dateline\">VANCOUVER, BC / <a href=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ACCESS Newswire</a> / February 27, 2026 / </strong>Empress Royalty Corp. (TSXV:EMPR)(OTCQX:EMPYF) (\"<strong>Empress</strong>\" or the \"<strong>Company</strong>\") is pleased to announce its audited financial and operating results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2025. The Company concluded the year with record-breaking revenue.</p><p><i>\"2025 was a transformational year for Empress, we doubled revenue, generated strong cash flow, and strengthened our balance sheet,\" </i>stated Alexandra Woodyer Sherron<i>, </i>CEO and President of Empress Royalty<i>. \"We executed our strategy with discipline and focus, and our model delivered. With rising production and strong gold and silver prices, we enter 2026 from a position of strength - ready to redeploy capital with precision and continue building durable, value-accretive growth for our shareholders.\"</i></p><p><strong>Key Financial and Operating Highlights for the year ended December 31, 2025</strong></p><ul><li><p>Record Revenue: Empress generated royalty and streaming revenue of US<money>$17.2M</money>, resulting in a gross profit of US<money>$12.1M</money>.</p></li><li><p>Strong Cash Generation: The Company maintained its focus on liquidity, achieving positive operating cash flow of US<money>$3.7M</money>.</p></li><li><p>Substantial Earnings Growth: Empress reported a net income of US<money>$7.4M</money> for the year, representing a significant increase over the US<money>$1.0M</money> reported in fiscal year 2024.</p></li><li><p>Operational Efficiency: Adjusted EBITDA for the full year stood at US<money>$13.9M</money>, reflecting the high-margin nature of the Company's streaming and royalty interests.</p></li></ul><p>These annual results highlight the strength of the Company's portfolio and its commitment to building long-term, sustainable value through selective, high-quality investments.</p><p>The financial statements and accompanying management's discussion and analysis have been filed on <strong>Sedar+ </strong>(<a href=\"https://pr.report/j5hq\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.sedarplus.ca</a>) and are also available on the Company's website at <a href=\"https://pr.report/j5hr\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.empressroyalty.com</a>.</p><p>Empress provides the following guidance as part of its annual financial statement filing, reflecting management's current expectations for fiscal 2026 based on the performance of its existing royalty and streaming portfolio, information provided from operators, and prevailing market conditions.</p><p><strong>Key Guidance Metrics for Fiscal 2026</strong></p><p>Empress anticipates meaningful growth in its attributable production in 2026, supported by continued contributions from key assets with potential optimization initiatives and steady performance with its portfolio holdings. Guidance incorporates assumptions of stable or improving operator performance and no major disruptions, consistent with disclosure standards under NI 51-102 and, where applicable, National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") for technical information.</p><p><strong>Attributable Gold Equivalent Ounces (GEOs)</strong></p><p>As a royalty and streaming company focused on precious metals, the Company's performance is inherently tied to production volumes and metal prices, which are volatile; accordingly, emphasis is placed on attributable gold equivalent ounces (\"GEOs\") sales as a primary metric to reflect production exposure. For streams, guidance reflects GEOs that have been delivered from the operators of our assets. Our GEO deliveries may differ from operators' production based on timing of deliveries and due to recovery and payability factors. GEO sales may differ from GEO deliveries based on the timing of the sales. For royalties, GEO guidance reflects the timing of royalty payments or accruals.</p><p>Empress expects attributable GEOs of 7,045 to 7,430 for fiscal 2026. This range represents the Company's diversified exposure across gold and silver calculated using conservative conversion ratios based on assumed commodity prices of <money>$4,000</money>/oz gold and <money>$70</money>/oz silver. GEOs are emphasized as the core metric, as they directly reflect the underlying production from operators and reduce dependency on volatile spot prices for performance evaluation.</p><p><strong>Assumptions and Basis for Guidance</strong></p><p>The 2026 Guidance is based on public and non-public forecasts, other disclosure by the owners and operators of our assets, internal analysis of historical performance, and management's understanding of the underlying producing assets. Additionally, the Company may receive information from the owners and operators of the properties, which the Company is not permitted to disclose to the public pursuant to the underlying agreement.</p><p>Key assumptions include:</p><ul><li><p>Annual increases in revenue if metals prices continue to be in the range of <money>$4,000</money>oz gold and <money>$70</money>/oz silver, and/or operating improvements are made at the underlying assets, and/or additional assets are added to the stream and royalty portfolio;</p></li><li><p>Production estimates reliant on operator guidance under NI 43-101-compliant reports and other non-public technical information and no material production interruptions;</p></li><li><p>No major new acquisitions or divestitures beyond those already announced, though the Company continues to actively evaluate opportunities; and</p></li><li><p>Currency exchange rates and tax considerations consistent with current levels.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Sensitivity</strong></p><p>The success of the Company in 2025 was based on a small number of investments and a significant increasing trend in gold and silver prices. There is no guarantee that this trend will continue in 2026. Given the volatile nature of gold and silver markets, an increase or decrease in gold or silver prices could impact attributable GEO values and related revenue considerably.</p><p><strong>Risks and Uncertainties</strong></p><p>Achievement of this guidance is subject to various risks, including but not limited to commodity price volatility (a primary concern given the small number of investments), operator-specific challenges (e.g., production delays), geopolitical factors, and environmental considerations. These could result in actual GEOs and revenues varying from the provided guidance, potentially materially. Investors should refer to the cautionary statements contained at the end of this news release, and the full discussion of risks in the Company's 2025 Annual Information Form filed on <a href=\"https://pr.report/j5hs\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.sedarplus.ca</a>.</p><p><strong>Conclusion and Updates</strong></p><p>Empress continues to implement its stated strategy of building a diversified, cash-flowing portfolio to deliver sustainable value to shareholders. The Company will review and update this outlook quarterly or as material events occur, such as new acquisitions, significant operator announcements, or commodity price shifts. Management remains focused on disciplined growth and capital allocation in the streaming and royalty sector.</p><p><strong>ABOUT EMPRESS ROYALTY CORP.</strong></p><p>Empress is a global royalty and streaming creation company providing investors with a diversified portfolio of gold and silver investments. Empress has built a portfolio of precious metal investments and is actively investing in mining companies with development and production stage projects who require additional non-dilutive capital. The Company has a strategic partnership with Endeavour Financial which allows Empress to not only access global investment opportunities but also bring unique mining finance expertise and deal structuring.

            "title": "Railtown AI Technologies Inc. Clarifies Certain Disclosure | RLAIF Stock News",
            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 27, 2026) - <b>Railtown AI Technologies Inc. (CSE: RAIL) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/RLAIF/\" title=\"View RLAIF stock overview\">RLAIF</a>) </b>(\"<b>Railtown</b>\" or the \"<b>Company</b>\") is issuing the following news release to clarify its disclosure pursuant to a recent review of the Company's continuous disclosure record by the British Columbia Securities Commission (the \"<b>BCSC</b>\").</p><p><u>October 8, 2025 News Release</u></p><p>In this news release, Railtown announced that it had entered into a memorandum of understanding (\"<b>MOU</b>\") with Uniserve Communications Corporation (TSXV: USS) (\"<b>Uniserve</b>\") regarding a strategic partnership. The Company would like to clarify that the MOU is non-binding, is for a term of 12 months beginning on September 23, 2025 but subject to mutually agreeable extensions, and that either party has the right to terminate the MOU upon 30 days' written notice. The primary purpose of the partnership is to allow Uniserve to integrate Railtown's AI frameworks, tools and solutions into Uniserve's offerings, thereby enabling Uniserve's internal sales team to promote and sell AI capabilities to Uniserve's customers.</p><p>Each of Railtown and Uniserve has certain defined obligations under the MOU, pursuant to which the parties have agreed to negotiate and execute separate commercial agreements, statements of work or service orders, as the case may be, in connection with, among other things, customer engagements, revenue sharing and pricing. Neither party is required to pay any fees to the other under the MOU, and Company and Uniserve are currently in the process of modelling their revenue sharing strategy.</p><p>Railtown is capable of readily deploying its technologies to Uniserve's customers, and expects to conclude one or more definitive agreements with Uniserve in the coming months.</p><p><u>September 23, 2022 News Release</u></p><p>In this news release, Railtown announced that it had entered into a service provider license agreement (the \"<b>SPLA</b>\") with Quisitive Technology Solutions Inc. (\"<b>Quisitive</b>\") pursuant to which the Company agreed to provide a white-label version of its technology to Quisitive to be branded and sold as Velocity Insights. The Company would like to clarify that the SPLA was technically an interim agreement with a term of six (6) months and was intended to be superseded by a longer-term definitive license agreement that has yet to be negotiated. In addition, each party had the ability to terminate the SPLA prior to the completion of the term by providing 30 days' written notice to the other party, with certain support obligations of Railtown continuing for a transition period of four (4) months following the effective date of termination.</p><p>The SLPA required the Company to provide a license to the technology and related support services to Quisitive at no cost, and the primary purpose of the agreement was to confirm the viability of the technology for use and integration with Quisitive's products and services, and to test the technology with up to 10 customers of Quisitive.  Despite the expiry of the SPLA and the acquisition of Quisitive by H.I.G. Capital in early 2025, the testing is ongoing and Quisitive continues to offer the technology to its customers.</p><p>Although Railtown has not generated any revenue from Quisitive or its customers to date, the Company anticipates entering into a revenue sharing agreement with Quisitive upon the adoption of any Quisitive technology that includes a version of the company's platform. In the meantime, the Velocity Insights product suite remains available for purchase on a stand-alone basis on Microsoft Marketplace.</p><p><u>June 28, 2024 News Release</u></p><p>In this news release, Railtown announced a strategic partnership with Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute (\"<b>Mila</b>\"). The Company would like to clarify that, under the partnership agreement governing the relationship between the parties, Railtown paid Mila the sum of <money>$10,000</money> plus applicable taxes - Mila's standard fee for new partners - in exchange for certain privileges typically provided to Mila's partners including having the Company's name or logo appear on Mila's website and certain promotional documents, and the ability to access and use certain of Mila's resources, including research, talent and intellectual property (such as, for example, Mila's expertise on advanced computing technologies, Mila's students for internship purposes, and a presence for Railtown in Mila's artificial intelligence \"hub\").  </p><p>The partnership agreement was for a term of 12 months and automatically terminated on June 19, 2025; however, the Company continues to engage with Mila and anticipates partnering again with Mila in the future.</p><p><u>July 23, 2024 News Release</u></p><p>In this news release, the Company announce that it had entered into a co-development agreement with the Alberta Machine Learning Institute (\"<b>Amii</b>\") pursuant to which the parties agreed to partner on a specific project and build related to Railtown's core technology. The Company would like to clarify that the relationship was governed by Amii's customary services contract and an accompanying statement of work (\"<b>SOW</b>\"), and that the term of the relationship was the longer of 14 months or one (1) month following the final day of employment of the Amii machine learning resident dedicated to the project (the \"<b>ML Resident</b>\").</p><p>In consideration for the services of both Amii and the ML Resident under the program covered by the agreement and SOW, Railtown paid Amii an aggregate of <money>$100,000</money> plus GST, being Amii's standard fee for programs of this nature. Although the Company no longer has access to Amii's resources following the automatic termination of the relationship in July 2025, the ML Resident was hired by Railtown following the completion of the program and is currently a full time employee.</p><p><u>June 9, 2025 News Release</u></p><p>In this news release, the Company announced a strategic partnership with ESGAI Technologies Inc. (\"<b>ESGAI</b>\") to co-develop an advanced suite of intelligent ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) software agents. The Company would like to clarify that the partnership is structured as a MOU between the parties that anticipates the execution and delivery of a formal license agreement (the \"<b>License Agreement</b>\") whereby ESGAI will license certain software technology owned and developed by Railtown in connection with the development of the agents.</p><p>The effective date of the MOU is June 6, 2025, and it automatically terminates upon the earlier of (a) the execution of the License Agreement, (b) the mutual written agreement of the parties, and (c) 180 days from the effective date. The Company complied with each of its obligations under the MOU; however, the parties were unable to negotiate the terms of the License Agreement prior to the automatic termination of the MOU on December 3, 2025, largely because such terms were predicated on ESGAI establishing a market for the agents first.</p><p>Regardless, Railtown remains committed to developing the ESG agent suite with ESGAI as circumstances allow. </p><p><u>July 28, 2025 News Release</u></p><p>In this news release, Railtown announced a strategic joint partnership with Braiyt AI Inc. (\"<b>Braiyt</b>\") to deliver AI technologies to Dubai and the broader Middle East region. The Company would like to retract the overly promotional disclosure in the news release and confirm that the partnership is structured as a MOU between Braiyt, Railtown and AIP, pursuant to which Braiyt agreed, for a term of three years, to promote the products and services of each of the Company, AIP and any affiliates of AIP in the Middle East as opportunities arise. In exchange, Braiyt is entitled to enter into a finder's fee arrangement with the relevant selling party on terms to be negotiated between the parties.</p><p><u>General</u></p><p>In certain of Railtown's previously filed continuous disclosure documents, the Company has used phrases such as \"<i>selling its AI services and solutions</i>\" that the BCSC believes may potentially be misleading given the lack of revenue reflected in the Company's financial statements at the time. While the Company acknowledges that the language may have been less than perfect and that a phrase such as \"<i>the AI services and solutions are available for sale</i>\" may technically have been more accurate, the Company would like to clarify that it has in fact generated nominal (i.e., non-material) sales revenue from paying customers.</p><p>In addition, the BCSC has expressed its concern over the accuracy of phrases such as \"<i>the platform is fully trained on clients' applications</i>\" (from Railtown's news release dated December 6, 2023), and that the system \"<i>continually trains on a client's application</i>\" and \"<i>automates a wide range of tasks associated with the client's application</i>\" (from Railtown's management discussion and analysis for the period ended June 30, 2025), because the Company either had no customers or a limited number of customers at the relevant time. The Company would like to clarify that it was using the word \"client\" in a general sense in this disclosure - that is, as a substitute for \"user\" and not in relation to a specific customer - and that the language was intended to convey how the Company's technology works once a customer downloads and connects to the platform. More specifically, once a customer downloads the Company's Railtracks agentic framework and connects to Conductr, the platform runs on the customer's own cloud infrastructure or on the customer's local computers or servers, with the result that the AI agent is able to access to the customer's data stored in those locations and learn by ingesting the data in real time.</p><p>Finally, Railtown would like to take this opportunity to confirm that the Company's primary focus for 2026 will be the building out of its Canadian agent development and deployment ecosystem with the Company's Canadian partners.</p><p><b>About Railtown</b></p><p>Railtown AI Technologies Inc. builds AI developer tools and agentic frameworks that power the next generation of intelligent applications. Its Platform - including real-time ingestion (Railengine), agent development frameworks (Railtracks ADK), and advanced observability (Conductr) - helps teams build, deploy, and operate AI agents with confidence and at scale.</p><p>For more information, visit <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/jNY0DHOLGV\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.railtown.ai</a>.</p><p><b>Follow us on social media</b></p><ul><li>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/vEzGBTojL1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/railtown-ai/</a> </li></ul><p><b>SUBSCRIBE FOR INVESTOR NEWS</b></p><p><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/JkYOjC7OXn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Click here</a> to receive our latest investor news alerts.</p><p><b>ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD</b></p><p>\"Cory Brandolini\" <br/>Cory Brandolini, Chief Executive Officer</p><p><b>INVESTOR CONTACT</b></p><div id=\"contactInfo\"><p>Rebecca Kerswell<br/>Investor Relations Contact<br/>Email: <a href=\"mailto:investors@railtown.ai\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">investors@railtown.ai</a> <br/>Phone: 1-604-417-4440</p></div><p><i>This news release contains forward-looking statements relating to the future operations of the Company and other statements that are not historical facts.

L3Harris is investing billions of dollars into modernizing and expanding its sites across the nation to significantly increase solid rocket motor production, including for Munitions Acceleration Council programs.</p><p>“Thank you for being the backbone of our department and our great nation, for having the backs of our warfighters because what you build right here in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ar.camden\">Camden</location> is absolutely central to the 21st Century Arsenal of Freedom,” Secretary Hegseth said. “You are the patriots ensuring that our warriors are never, ever in a fair fight. The more than 115,000 solid rocket motors that you’re building every single year can’t be matched.”</p><p>“Industrial capacity has become a strategic element of deterrence; the ability to deliver at scale, with speed and reliability, directly impacts how effectively <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> can deter threats and project peace through strength,” said Christopher Kubasik, Chairman and CEO, L3Harris. “Thank you, Secretary Hegseth, for reinforcing to our <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ar.camden\">Camden</location> team that what L3Harris builds here directly contributes to the safety of our warfighters and our homeland.”</p><p>During the visit, Secretary Hegseth engaged employees who produce the propulsion systems that power the PAC-3 air and missile defense system and met with the teams who manufacture the large solid rocket motors for strategic deterrence, interceptors, hypersonic systems and target missiles. He also reviewed construction progress on the company’s new Arkansas Advanced Propulsion Facilities (AAPF).</p><p>The AAPF facilities are an expansive new campus that will support medium and large solid rocket motor production. The 110-acre campus will include more than 20 new buildings and increase large solid rocket motor manufacturing capacity sixfold. The expansion incorporates advanced manufacturing technologies, automation and digital process controls L3Harris designed to improve safety, efficiency and throughput while providing long-term, domestic surge capacity.</p><p>The <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ar.camden\">Camden</location> site produces thousands of solid rocket motors a year that support a wide range of Department of War programs. L3Harris is investing billions in this competitive market to deliver at the scale and speed the Department of War demands. The company’s 2,000-acre <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ar.camden\">Camden</location> site is one of the nation’s largest solid rocket motor manufacturing centers and has supported national and allied defense missions for more than four decades.</p><p>L3Harris acquired the solid rocket motor business in 2023 and has transformed and grown its production operations to align with the Department of War’s increasing demand for missile programs. L3Harris intends to pursue an initial public offering of the solid rocket motor business in the second half of the year.</p><p><b>About L3Harris Technologies</b></p><p>L3Harris is the Trusted Disruptor in defense tech.
