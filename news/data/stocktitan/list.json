            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><strong>Recognized expert in cancer biology, RNA biology and translational therapeutics with 20 years of experience in preclinical oncology drug discovery and development</strong></p><p align=\"justify\">TAMPA, Fla. and LONDON, Feb.  26, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Akari Therapeutics, Plc (Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/AKTX/\" title=\"View AKTX stock overview\">AKTX</a>), an oncology biotechnology company developing antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) with novel immuno-oncology payloads, today announced the appointment of Prafulla Gokhale, Ph.D., Director of the Experimental Therapeutics Core and the Lurie Family Imaging Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, to its Scientific Advisory Board.</p> <p align=\"justify\">“Dr. Gokhale’s expertise in experimental therapeutics, RNA biology and translational oncology comes at a pivotal time as we advance AKTX-101 toward the clinic,” commented Abizer Gaslightwala, President and CEO of Akari Therapeutics. “His proven track record to develop novel translational experiments/data that lead to well-designed and high-impact clinical strategies will strengthen our development approach as we advance AKTX-101 to clinical trials. As we move closer to first-in-human studies, his insight will help ensure that AKTX-101 and our novel PH1 spliceosome-modulating payload enter the clinic with a focused, data-driven high-impact program to optimize results.”</p> <p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Prafulla Gokhale, Ph.D.\" data-caption=\"Prafulla Gokhale, Ph.D.\" data-dpi=\"220\" data-filename=\"image1.png\" height=\"519\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/244fe78c-84c8-430c-b605-1cfd5de83a63/image1.png\" width=\"371\"/><br/></p> <p align=\"justify\">Dr. Gokhale has over 20 years of experience in preclinical oncology drug discovery and development. He began his career as a faculty member in the Radiation Medicine Department at Georgetown University before moving to the pharmaceutical industry, where he led <em>in vivo</em> pharmacology teams with increasing responsibility at OSI Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer, and Verastem. He currently heads the Experimental Therapeutics Core at Dana-Farber, overseeing translational research programs that integrate genomics, molecular biology, patient-derived models, imaging and preclinical studies to advance novel therapeutic strategies.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Dr. Gokhale commented, “I am excited to join Akari’s Scientific Advisory Board and work alongside a team advancing a truly differentiated approach to ADC development. Unlike conventional payload strategies that rely on tubulin inhibitors or DNA-damaging agents, PH1 targets RNA splicing, a fundamental regulator of cancer cell biology. This novel mechanism offers the potential to disrupt tumor survival pathways while also drive unique innate and adaptive immune system engagement. I look forward to collaborating closely with the team to further refine the translational strategy and support the advancement of AKTX-101 into the clinic.”</p> <p align=\"justify\">Dr. Gokhale’s work has been widely published and funded, reflecting his leadership in transforming fundamental discoveries into clinical innovations for cancer and related diseases.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>About Akari Therapeutics </strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">Akari Therapeutics is an oncology biotechnology company developing next-generation antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) with a unique payload, PH1, which targets RNA splicing. Utilizing its innovative ADC discovery platform, the Company has the ability to generate ADC candidates and optimize them based on the desired application to any antigen target of interest. Akari’s lead candidate, AKTX-101, targets the Trop2 receptor on cancer cells and with a proprietary linker, enabling it to deliver its novel PH1 payload directly into the tumor with minimal off-target effects. Unlike current ADCs that use tubulin inhibitors and DNA damaging agents as their payloads, PH1 is a novel payload that is a spliceosome modulator designed to disrupt RNA splicing within cancer cells. This splicing modulation has been shown in preclinical animal models to induce cancer cell death while activating both the innate and adaptive immune system to drive robust and durable activity. In preclinical studies, AKTX-101 has shown to have significant activity and prolonged survival relative to ADCs with traditional payloads. Additionally, AKTX-101 has the potential to be synergistic with checkpoint inhibitors and has demonstrated prolonged survival as both a single agent and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. The PH1 payload has also been demonstrated to be very active against cancer cells with key oncogenic drivers such as KRAS, BRAF, ARV7, FGFR3 fusions, and others. The Company has initiated IND enabling studies for AKTX-101 with a goal of starting its First-In-Human trial by late 2026/early 2027. Akari is also developing AKTX-102, an ADC candidate targeting CEACAM5 (Carcinoembryonic Antigen-related Cell Adhesion Molecule-5), a well-validated tumor antigen broadly expressed across multiple solid tumors. AKTX-102 is designed to leverage Akari’s proprietary PH1 spliceosome-modulating payload and novel antibody construct to enable differentiated tumor cell killing and immune activation.</p> <p align=\"justify\">For more information about the Company, please visit <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ZBbqhES2PJnXlUs79ASX5UyKlEWVB8yY4Na9DctxihCZrY7QiefMwU5hrFWWjAw-YvWdjIxGzswifoU0ghJwkvnrKnwIv1NjG5SH4cBdtJ0=\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.akaritx.com</a> and connect on <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=165fpgLsKT2iW0UGbSRXojI7CCQGoM_Wnb54etgyNdJNUY30Zzj_qalJHNTYQ6yilwsCBMr4hSdWxqJe-i47PQ==\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">X</a> and <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=dtRnHe45SLNXeCj8Ukt1z56bqtNF1XRTlhFd2XSx7NGTYzrBCsd7JbTx1gBp981lX737Y5EvNSrXFp0vg9IFHwJfsFC7ykIQihvtziHbHWU=\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a>.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements </strong><br/><br/>This press release includes express or implied forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, about the Company that involve risks and uncertainties relating to future events and the future performance of the Company.

Rock-chip channel results there returned up to 6 meters at 2.3 grams per tonne gold and 70.9 ppm silver and individual rock-chip assays returned a maximum of 6.1 grams per tonne gold and 165 ppm silver (gold minimum 0.01 and mean 0.2 grams per tonne; silver minimum 0.01 and mean: 6.2 ppm). RC drilling intersected elevated bismuth, silver and tellurium over 10-15-meter intervals but did not replicate the surface gold grades. The Company interprets this geochemical signature as potentially indicative of a deeper intrusion-related gold system beneath the exposed vein array, warranting further evaluation.</p><p><b>Strategic Outlook</b></p><p>This phase of exploratory drilling has confirmed the potential of both gold-dominant sheeted vein systems and zinc-polymetallic skarn-style mineralization within the Jabal Sahabiyah project area.</p><p>The Company is currently reviewing strategic options for advancing the project. Given the distinct geological styles identified, Royal Road is evaluating pathways that could optimize value creation, including the potential introduction of a partner with specific expertise in zinc-polymetallic systems, while maintaining meaningful exposure to the gold exploration upside across the broader project area.</p><p>\"These results further confirm the presence of two distinct mineral systems at Jabal Sahabiyah,\" said Tim Coughlin, Royal Road's President and CEO. \"Through disciplined, low-cost exploration we have efficiently tested multiple targets and demonstrated meaningful gold continuity at Ash Shajjah and down-plunge zinc-polymetallic grades at Hanash North. The project now warrants focused follow-up. We are assessing the most effective pathway to advance Jabal Sahabiyah, potentially alongside a partner with specific zinc expertise while ensuring we retain meaningful exposure to the broader gold upside. Our approach remains grounded in technical rigor and disciplined capital allocation.\"</p><p><i><b>About Royal Road Minerals:</b></i></p><p><i>Royal Road Minerals is a mineral exploration and development company with its head office and technical-operations center located in Jersey, Channel Islands.

estimate or predict with reasonable certainty certain discrete tax items, which could significantly impact that financial measure. </p><p><b>Operational and Financial Metrics</b></p><p><b><i>Adjusted EBITDA </i></b>is net income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, net interest expense, other income (expense), income tax (expense) benefit, (gain) loss on foreign currency, (gain) loss on transfer of assets, reorganization costs, and other supplemental adjustments. Other supplemental adjustments include certain non-operating items such as stock-based compensation, executive severance costs, debt refinancing costs, acquisition-related expenses and other non-recurring charges. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when considered along with other performance measures, is a useful measure as it reflects certain operating drivers of the business, such as sales growth, operating costs, selling and administrative expense, and other operating income and expense. We believe Adjusted EBITDA helps provide a more complete understanding of the underlying operating results and trends and an enhanced overall understanding of our financial performance and prospects for the future. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements, such as unearned passenger revenues, capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments, and tax payments. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other companies within the industry.</p><p>The following metrics apply to the Lindblad segment:</p><p><b><i>Adjusted Net Cruise Cost </i></b>represents Net Cruise Cost adjusted for Non-GAAP other supplemental adjustments which include certain non-operating items such as stock-based compensation, reorganization costs and acquisition-related expenses.</p><p><b><i>Available Guest Nights </i></b>is a measurement of capacity available for sale and represents double occupancy per cabin (except single occupancy for a single capacity cabin) multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period.

(NYSE: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/VLN/\" title=\"View VLN stock overview\">VLN</a>). Valens Semiconductor posted 4Q25      revenue of <money>$19.4M</money>, significantly above guidance of <money>$18.2</money>-<money>$18.9M</money>, marking its seventh consecutive quarter of growth and up from <money>$17.3M</money> in 3Q25 and <money>$16.7M</money> in 4Q24.

            "title": "Antelope Enterprise Holdings Limited Launches “Genius Plan”，a Structured Digital Asset Management Strategy Amid BTC Market | AEHL Stock News",
            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p align=\"justify\">NEW YORK, NY, Feb.  26, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Antelope Enterprise Holdings Limited (NASDAQ: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/AEHL/\" title=\"View AEHL stock overview\">AEHL</a>, or the “Company”), today announced the launch of a structured digital asset management strategy - the “Genius Plan”, designed to establish a disciplined Bitcoin (BTC) allocation and capital recycling framework, as global markets focus on Bitcoin’s sharp decline and investor sentiment rapidly shifts toward fear, which clears the way for AEHL’s BTC deployment.</p> <p align=\"justify\">With BTC retreating from recent highs to nearly half its peak value, the Company views the current market zone as a strategically compelling entry opportunity. The “Genius Plan” represents not only an evolution of AEHL’s strategic treasury reserves and capital management framework, but also the potential emergence of a new crypto-equity linkage model between Wall Street and the digital asset ecosystem. The Company believes this initiative may inject renewed confidence into the currently subdued BTC market and serve as a guiding beacon for traditional capital entering the digital asset space.</p> <p align=\"justify\">AEHL believes that during periods of extreme market volatility, long-term outcomes are not determined by short-term emotional reactions, but by rigorous data analysis and structured execution systems.</p> <p>The “Genius Plan” will be implemented in five core phases:</p> <p><b>Step One: Establish Strategic Positioning</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">The Company will initiate its strategy with a <money>$1 million</money> BTC purchase as its starting position, executing an initial one-time acquisition. Subsequent purchases will be conducted in tranches rather than through a single concentrated allocation, gradually building a structured BTC holding framework.</p> <p align=\"justify\">On February 27, the Company will announce the first objective approved by its Board of Directors. Through phased accumulation, each tranche will create an independent cost anchor, providing a clear and disciplined basis for future strategic execution.</p> <p><b>Step Two: Activate the “Genius Harvester” Mechanism</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">When the market price rises <percent>1%</percent> relative to a specific cost anchor, the system will trigger a predefined partial-sale mechanism. For example, if a <money>$1 million</money> position appreciates to <money>$1.01 million</money>, the Company would sell <money>$10,000</money> worth of BTC.</p> <p align=\"justify\">This mechanism is designed to break down consolidation phases and high-volatility environments into quantifiable and executable trading units. By repeatedly capturing small wave movements, the Company aims to accumulate incremental gains — building layer upon layer — rather than passively waiting for a single “tsunami” move.</p> <p><b>Step Three: Launch the “Genius Recycler” Mechanism</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">Fifty percent of realized gains generated through the “Genius Harvester” will be specifically allocated toward the Company’s share repurchase program. Subject to Board authorization and applicable regulatory frameworks, the repurchase program will serve as a core pathway in AEHL’s shareholder return structure.</p> <p align=\"justify\">AEHL believes that if realized gains do not ultimately return to and reinforce shareholder value, capital strategy loses its fundamental meaning.</p> <p><b>Step Four: From “Zombie Holding” to Dynamic Management</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">AEHL emphasizes that it does not intend to become a passive holder that fails to realize gains during upswings and simply absorbs losses during downturns. Long-term conviction does not conflict with phased realization. Discipline does not contradict strategic vision.</p> <p>The Company chooses to rely on data-driven models rather than emotion-driven decision-making.</p> <p><b>Step Five: Real-Time Transparency</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">Management stated that relevant holdings and strategy execution data will be disclosed in real time through official channels including X, Momo, Tiger Trade, Snowball, LinkedIn, Weibo, and Rednote, ensuring transparency and timely communication with global investors.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Ms. <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TPCUEDcSsNg-8ByeOEucIgbCI6GN757aQSKa0IQKMqVKbgpUHvpzBCoEpht61bD9i3OEnH1WpiIoNSZupQDopt8y3PssZSKAv_niNxwWqd0q69fkNI-hz3Xqwt2RAZOA63eTXzQ_4MbaBf-UVbg4rVviGbA-4xioqyh18MaAmXJi58ow-1WskOp8peXTmtxnYOq2QnHkSqzJLR4OPDnN2dTzsSPVliuD0oulzhzyTlcdftrUEBpWYQysLxM30E6CIIbhYYzE3K_mY5vHCac-uL4-jAJezAsf_vGACVj_DZq14b1Wcg9_VJcxYG3vyTPcFPq_Mf__RdUzonxA1TGAjgncyy9OOmnskMt2dMo7PPmePcsDZaPk1RKvK33y879wKPiwOkc454EJTfuBx8Vbp4NquDjTwNsAukpE0zUYTShOe2Ex3bFIQAkxRaynB4vorQuORhrj-46iJG8MfR6KTDeNHghwkGwb_bOKdaYDCBF5xNAF1PjE5wwL2Yy4gSOB8UJNguAqU-kVbkoS-u-J5pmBRcAemBPriLgB7EGDVttU6NfgkDSW99ZB5UPFVIYAF8Ctr7eRS_gUWXQfqW_x0LTR0CbCxjg4ON8QK8d-0ctbKgSp92QQPtisgQmZYMMN0mOAO9xSiam13pvr2Pq5_BFWG-0Tt7TJEHkcVKqVzYBK7Nh0dqIEbNdOQkn8HoZR947P_Pil7c99Dh3XKWpiVg==\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tingting Zhang</a>, Chief Executive Officer of Antelope Enterprise Holdings Limited, commented: “We are committed to building a structured capital loop connecting digital assets and equity markets: Financing → Digital Asset Allocation → Profit Realization → Share Repurchase → Enterprise Value Enhancement → Refinancing.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Markets may swing violently, but companies must maintain structural clarity.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Tel Aviv, Israel, Feb.  26, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Jeffs' Brands Ltd (“Jeffs’ Brands” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/JFBR/\" title=\"View JFBR stock overview\">JFBR</a>, <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/JFBRW/\" title=\"View JFBRW stock overview\">JFBRW</a>), a data-driven e-commerce company operating on the Amazon Marketplace expanding into the global homeland security sector through advanced artificial intelligence (“AI”) – driven solutions, today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, KeepZone AI Inc. (“KeepZone”), has entered into a Channel Partner Agreement (the “Agreement”) with SENSORZTECH Ltd.,(“Sensorz”) an Israeli-based innovator in AI-native radio Frequency (“RF”) spectrum intelligence technology.</p> <p>Under the terms of the Agreement, KeepZone was granted non-exclusive rights to promote, market and resell Sensorz’s SWORD AI Spectrum Intelligence Platform and related systems to approved customers in Mexico, subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, including customer approval and acceptance of purchase orders.</p> <p>The SWORD platform delivers real-time, wideband RF spectrum monitoring, automated signal detection and classification, and precision geolocation across dense and contested electromagnetic environments. Built for government, defense, and homeland security operations, the system is designed to enable rapid identification of unauthorized or potentially malicious wireless activity - including tactical communications, SATCOM devices, autonomous systems, jamming sources, private cellular infrastructure, and other emerging RF-based threats.</p> <p>The Agreement is intended to support Mexican government agencies, military units, national guard forces, and critical infrastructure operators seeking to modernize spectrum awareness capabilities and strengthen operational readiness in an increasingly dynamic wireless landscape, subject to customer approvals, procurement processes, and execution of purchase orders.</p> <p>\"This Agreement marks a significant step in KeepZone's expansion into advanced RF monitoring solutions, aligning with our mission to deliver cutting-edge AI-driven security technologies to high-stakes markets,\" said Alon Dayan, CEO of KeepZone. “As wireless-enabled risks continue to evolve, governments are seeking intelligent, automated tools that provide real-time spectrum visibility and actionable insights. Collaborating with Sensorz positions us to offer advanced AI-driven RF intelligence capabilities to Mexico, enhancing protection of national assets and critical infrastructure. We look forward to driving adoption and creating value for our stakeholders through this collaboration.\"</p> <p>Meir Friedland, CEO of Sensorz, added: “Mexico is facing escalating security challenges, including the ongoing fight against organized crime and drug trafficking networks, alongside preparations for major international events such as the FIFA World Cup. These factors significantly heighten the sensitivity of the electromagnetic domain. Sensorz’s AI-native architecture is designed to adapt to newly introduced and evolving signal types, while substantially reducing the level of specialized expertise traditionally required to operate advanced spectrum intelligence systems. Through our collaboration with KeepZone, we are committed to helping customers maintain airwave integrity, rapidly identify anomalous activity, and respond decisively to RF-based risks.”</p> <p>As wireless proliferation accelerates and spectrum congestion intensifies, the electromagnetic domain has become a critical pillar of national security. The KeepZone–Sensorz collaboration is intended to facilitate potential deployment of advanced RF intelligence capabilities across Mexico, strengthening resilience, operational control, and public safety.</p> <p><b>About Jeffs’ Brands</b></p> <p>Jeffs’ Brands is a data-driven company that has recently pivoted into the global homeland security sector through its wholly-owned subsidiary, KeepZone AI Inc., following the entry into the definitive distribution agreement with Scanary Ltd., in December 2025.

Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe the Company’s future plans, strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as “believe,” “expect,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “seek,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “estimate,” “anticipate” or other comparable terms. For example, the Company is using forward-looking statements when discussing the anticipated benefits of the Agreement, the potential distribution of Sensorz’s products in Mexico, the expected demand for RF spectrum intelligence solutions, potential customer engagements, and the Company’s strategy to expand into the global homeland security market. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company’s control.

Attendees visiting meeting room 2L8MR in Hall 2 will see demonstrations of how MaxLinear’s Sierra single-chip radio SoC helps OEMs develop new innovative Open RAN Radio Units (O-RUs) addressing the key challenges faced by Mobile Network Operators (MNO). MaxLinear will showcase how Sierra’s embedded Passive Intermodulation (PIM) cancellation technology enables development of smaller and lighter Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) Massive MIMO O-RUs as well as several new highly compact and power-efficient O-RUs powered by Sierra.</p><div id=\"bwbodyimg\" style=\"width: 480px; float:left; padding-left:0px; padding-right:20px; padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;\"><img alt=\"Sierra Radio SoC Enables FDD mMIMO with Embedded Active PIM Cancellation\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20260226557346/en/2731965/4/MWC_FDD_mMIMO_PR-Linkedin1280_720.jpg\"/><p style=\"font-size:85%;\">Sierra Radio SoC Enables FDD mMIMO with Embedded Active PIM Cancellation</p></div><p>Uplink traffic is rapidly becoming the next major network bottleneck as user behavior shifts toward high-bandwidth uploads such as live video and social content. MNOs are pursuing FDD Massive MIMO as a targeted way to address uplink-constrained networks. However, FDD Massive MIMO radio unit size, weight, and cost have remained key barriers to deployment.</p><p>“Uplink traffic is growing faster than downlink traffic and will accelerate in the era of Physical AI. There’s a strong need for uplink capacity in the critical low bands where FDD mMIMO can make all kinds of devices work better. This integration makes FDD Massive MIMO more practical for real-world upgrades,” said Joe Madden, Principal Analyst at Mobile Experts.</p><p>Sierra helps address these challenges at the architecture level with embedded PIM cancellation. In FDD systems, downlink transmission generates PIM products that fall directly into the uplink receive band and reduce receiver throughput. Traditional FDD systems use high performance cavity filters to minimize PIM effects, but these filters are large, heavy, and expensive. By being able to cancel up to 20dB of PIM on each receive path with advanced signal processing, Sierra enables the use of smaller, lighter and cheaper ceramic filters instead of bulky cavity filters.</p><p>“Uplink demand is rising faster than network capacity, driving operators to look at FDD Massive MIMO as a practical way to relieve uplink congestion. But OEMs are challenged to deliver that capability without excessive cost and complexity,” said Puneet Sethi, Senior Vice President of MaxLinear’s Network Infrastructure &amp; Carrier BU. “Sierra is already a proven carrier grade solution for single- and multi-band macro radio units. Now, by using PIM cancellation to eliminate the need for bulky cavity filters, Sierra is enabling OEMs to build simpler, lighter FDD Massive MIMO radios that operators can deploy at scale to address the uplink demand challenge.”</p><p>At Mobile World Congress, MaxLinear will demonstrate these capabilities live, highlighting Sierra’s PIM cancellation performance and showcasing multiple Sierra-driven radios. The demonstrations will take place in Hall 2, meeting room 2L8MR.</p><p>For more information on Sierra, visit <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.maxlinear.com%2Fsierra&amp;esheet=54434359&amp;newsitemid=20260226557346&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.maxlinear.com%2Fsierra&amp;index=2&amp;md5=5d58a03617dc9c4d0c36ed586333c9b2\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">www.maxlinear.com/sierra</a>.</p><p><b>About MaxLinear, Inc.</b></p><p>MaxLinear, Inc.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>MINNEAPOLIS, Feb.  26, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OneMedNet Corporation (Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/ONMD/\" title=\"View ONMD stock overview\">ONMD</a>), a leading provider of regulatory-grade, AI-ready Real-World Data (RWD), today announced a strategic partnership with ViuHealth, a digital health company specializing in autoimmune disease populations.</p> <p>This partnership expands OneMedNet’s autoimmune clinical ontology, to the OneMedNet iRWD™ platform—powered by Palantir Foundry—further increasing the scale, diversity, and longitudinal depth of its regulatory-grade Real-World Data. Under the agreement, ViuHealth will provide ongoing, longitudinal autoimmune disease data, strengthening OneMedNet’s portfolio of high-value specialty datasets and supporting research, AI model development, HEOR initiatives, and regulatory-aligned use cases.</p> <p>Autoimmune Real-World Data is highly sought after by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies developing innovative therapies for these chronic conditions. The addition of ViuHealth’s longitudinal dataset—capturing patient journeys, treatment adherence, flares, and outcomes—enables pharma partners to accelerate drug discovery, support label expansions, demonstrate real-world effectiveness in competitive markets, and inform pricing or reimbursement strategies in a therapeutics segment projected to exceed <money>$166 billion</money> globally in 2026<sup>1</sup>.</p> <p><strong>Driving Recurring Revenue Growth</strong></p> <p>This partnership advances OneMedNet’s subscription revenue strategy by integrating high-value, disease-specific longitudinal data into the iRWD™ platform.</p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li><strong>Subscription License:</strong> Partnerships like this add high-value, disease-specific longitudinal data (e.g., autoimmune patient journeys from ViuHealth's virtual care), making the iRWD™ platform more attractive for ongoing subscriptions rather than one-time sales.</li><li><strong>Revenue Impact:</strong> Pharma/biotech companies (targeting the <money>$166B</money>+ autoimmune therapeutics market<sup>2</sup>) subscribe for access to enriched datasets to support drug development, HEOR, AI training, and regulatory evidence—creating predictable Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), higher retention, and upsell opportunities through expanded data feeds.</li><li><strong>Strategic Fit:</strong> Network expansion historically drives bookings and inbound demand as previously reported with the November 17, 2025 press release reporting <percent>815%</percent> YoY bookings growth and a 4.5X inbound increase.<br/></li></ul> <p>Autoimmune diseases affect an estimated ~<percent>8%</percent> of the U.S. population, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health<sup>2</sup>, representing tens of millions of individuals. These chronic conditions are often associated with long diagnostic timelines, complex disease progression, and significantly reduced quality of life—creating strong demand across life sciences, digital health, and AI markets for deeper, longitudinal real-world data for research into new products and solutions to help these patients live more comfortable longer lives.</p> <p>OneMedNet’s iRWD™ platform—powered by Palantir Foundry—enables rapid cohort identification, multimodal data curation, and secure delivery of de-identified, regulatory-grade datasets. This infrastructure allows OneMedNet to efficiently acquire new disease-specific data sources and quickly translate them into commercially relevant data products.</p> <p>“This partnership reflects our continued focus on expanding high-value, disease-specific data pipelines for subscription sales to fuel our long-term growth,” said Aaron Green, CEO and President of OneMedNet. “Autoimmune diseases impact millions of lives, and by integrating ViuHealth’s specialized, continuous data flows into our iRWD platform, we are enabling researchers, life sciences companies, and AI developers to generate actionable insights – while building durable, recurring revenue streams that deliver predictable value for our shareholders and partners.”</p> <p>“We partnered with OneMedNet because they offered the fastest and most scalable path to commercializing high-quality autoimmune data,” said Kwaku Owusu, CEO of ViuHealth. “The OneMedNet iRWD platform, powered by Palantir Foundry, allows researchers to quickly identify valuable autoimmune cohorts and deliver market-ready datasets without compromising privacy, quality, or compliance. This partnership accelerates our mission while creating meaningful value for the broader healthcare ecosystem.”</p> <p>This colloboration reinforces OneMedNet’s expanding role as a trusted data infrastructure provider in specialty disease areas, strengthening its position within the rapidly growing real-world data and AI-enabled healthcare markets. It further advances the Company’s strategy of building repeatable, subscription-oriented data partnerships that generate continuous data flows rather than one-time transactions, while enhancing its ability to deliver fit-for-purpose cohorts that reflect real-world patient journeys at scale.</p> <ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\"><li>https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/autoimmune-disease-therapeutics-market#:~:text=The%20global%20autoimmune%20disease%20therapeutics%20market%20is,to%20approximately%20USD%<percent>20226.2%</percent>20billion%20by%202035.</li><li>https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/autoimmune-diseasesHYPERLINK \"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/auto\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/auto<br/></li></ol> <p><strong>About OneMedNet Corporation</strong></p> <p>OneMedNet is revolutionizing how the world unlocks Real-World Data (RWD), harnessing the untapped potential of over 2,130 healthcare sites through its iRWD™ platform.
