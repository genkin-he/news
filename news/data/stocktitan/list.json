It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Further information on these and additional risks that could affect ContextLogic’s results is included in its filings with the SEC, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Annual Report on Form 10K/A, the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2025, June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2025 and other reports that ContextLogic files with the SEC from time to time, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations. Any forward-looking statement made by ContextLogic in this news release speaks only as of the day on which ContextLogic makes it. ContextLogic assumes no obligation to, and except as otherwise required by federal securities law, does not currently intend to, update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release. </p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Investor Relations:</strong> <br/>Lucy Simon, CLHI <br/><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TZeU0-Df7WPpqz7P47cM9LsyVgi10G5VQI6qqvOyLbGTdbyG8W-8kce0iDwxGc0qE4GKyIbBtSPUTB1yqlfZYa53oL99kDFDNryPQNW4e2A=\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ir@contextlogic.com</a> </p> <img alt=\"\" class=\"__GNW8366DE3E__IMG\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTY2MjUxNyM3NDU3NTE3IzIyMDQzMzE=\"/> <br/><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\" src=\"https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/OGVhY2NjY2MtOGUwNS00N2JiLWE1MGUtYmRmMmFkOTE2OTRiLTEyMTU4ODQtMjAyNi0wMi0yNi1lbg==/tiny/ContextLogic-Holdings-Inc-.png\"/></article>",

We believe the execution of our plan will improve our liquidity profile and support greater financial stability going forward.”</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Fourth Quarter Highlights</strong></p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">LMM commercial real estate originations of <money>$235 million</money></li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Small Business Lending (“SBL”) loan originations of <money>$140 million</money>, including <money>$84 million</money> of Small Business Administration 7(a) loans and <money>$18 million</money> of United States Department of Agriculture loans</li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Book value of <money>$8.79</money> per share of common stock as of December 31, 2025</li></ul> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Full Year Highlights</strong></p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Total originations of <money>$1.8 billion</money> across all products</li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Completed the acquisition of United Development Funding IV, a real estate investment trust providing capital solutions to residential real estate developers and regional homebuilders</li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Completed the sale of GMFS, our Residential Mortgage Banking business</li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Secured ownership and control of the Portland, OR mixed-use asset via a consensual deed-in-lieu arrangement</li></ul> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Subsequent Events</strong></p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Completed the sale of 34 loans with an unpaid principal balance of <money>$855.3 million</money></li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Retired the remaining outstanding amount on the <percent>5.75%</percent> Senior Unsecured Note due February 2026</li></ul> <p align=\"justify\"><strong><em>Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information</em></strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">In addition to the results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this press release includes distributable earnings, formerly referred to as core earnings, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. The Company defines distributable earnings as net income adjusted for unrealized gains and losses related to certain mortgage backed securities (“MBS”) not retained by us as part of our loan origination business, realized gains and losses on sales of certain MBS, unrealized changes in our current expected credit loss reserve and valuation allowance, unrealized gains or losses on de-designated cash flow hedges, unrealized gains or losses on foreign exchange hedges, unrealized gains or losses on certain unconsolidated joint ventures, non-cash compensation expense related to our stock-based incentive plan, unrealized gains or losses on preferred equity, at fair value, unrealized gain or losses or other non-cash items related to real estate owned and one-time non-recurring gains or losses, such as gains or losses on discontinued operations, bargain purchase gains, or merger related expenses.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The Company believes that this non-U.S. GAAP financial information, in addition to the related U.S. GAAP measures, provides investors greater transparency into the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, including the determination of dividends. However, because distributable earnings is an incomplete measure of the Company's financial performance and involves differences from net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, it should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, the Company's net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of the Company's financial performance. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of distributable earnings may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies.</p> <p align=\"justify\">In calculating distributable earnings, Net Income (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) is adjusted to exclude unrealized gains and losses on MBS acquired by the Company in the secondary market but is not adjusted to exclude unrealized gains and losses on MBS retained by Ready Capital as part of its loan origination businesses, where the Company transfers originated loans into an MBS securitization and the Company retains an interest in the securitization. In calculating distributable earnings, the Company does not adjust Net Income (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) to take into account unrealized gains and losses on MBS retained by us as part of the loan origination businesses because the unrealized gains and losses that are generated in the loan origination and securitization process are considered to be a fundamental part of this business and an indicator of the ongoing performance and credit quality of the Company’s historical loan originations. In calculating distributable earnings, Net Income (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) is adjusted to exclude realized gains and losses on certain MBS securities considered to be non-distributable. Certain MBS positions are considered to be non-distributable due to a variety of reasons which may include collateral type, duration, and size.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Servicing rights relating to the Company’s small business commercial business are accounted for under ASC 860,<em> Transfer and Servicing</em>. In calculating distributable earnings, the Company does not exclude realized gains or losses on commercial MSRs, as servicing income is a fundamental part of Ready Capital’s business and is an indicator of the ongoing performance.</p> <p align=\"justify\">To qualify as a REIT, the Company must distribute to its stockholders each calendar year at least <percent>90%</percent> of its REIT taxable income (including certain items of non-cash income), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. There are certain items, including net income generated from the creation of MSRs, that are included in distributable earnings but are not included in the calculation of the current year’s taxable income. These differences may result in certain items that are recognized in the current period’s calculation of distributable earnings not being included in taxable income, and thus not subject to the REIT dividend distribution requirement until future years.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The table below reconciles Net Income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP to Distributable Earnings.</p> <table style=\"border-bottom: solid black 1pt ;

Approximately <percent>86%</percent> of assets sold to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> buyers, including <percent>39%</percent> purchased by Floridians, with the remaining <percent>14%</percent> purchased by international buyers as far away as <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/vn\">Vietnam</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/sa\">Saudi Arabia</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location>.</p><p>With assets sold through live onsite bidding, online participation and Timed Auction formats, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.orlndo\">Orlando</location> reflected broad global demand early in the year.

Revenues for Q3-FY26 decreased <percent>25%</percent> from <money><money>$1.3 million</money></money> of revenue in Q3-FY25, primarily due to a decline in software and subscription services revenue from two previously disclosed non-renewals in Fiscal 2025.</li><li>Annual Recurring Revenue (\"ARR\"), a non-IFRS measure, at December 31, 2025 was <money><money>$3.8 million</money></money>.

The improvement over Q2-FY26 is due to a decrease in cost of sales, primarily hosting costs that are anticipated to continue at a lower rate.

This represented an <percent>18%</percent> sequential improvement over Q2-FY26 due to an increase in revenues and a decrease in costs. Total selling, general and administration (\"SG&amp;A\") expenses in Q3-FY26 totaled <money><money>$1.1 million</money></money>, a <money><money>$0.1 million</money></money> decrease from <money><money>$1.2 million</money></money> reported in Q2-FY26 and a <money><money>$0.3 million</money></money> decrease from the <money><money>$1.4 million</money></money> reported in Q3-FY25, as the Company continues to recognize savings from previously announced cost alignment efforts.</li><li>Non-IFRS net loss for Q3 Fiscal 2026 (as defined in the Non-IFRS Financial Measures section) totaled <money><money>$(0.3) million</money></money> (<money><money>$(0.00)</money></money> per basic and diluted share), versus <money><money>$(0.4) million</money></money> in Q2 Fiscal 2026 (<money><money>$(0.01</money></money>) per basic and diluted share) and <money><money>$(0.4) million</money></money> in Q3 Fiscal 2025 (<money><money>$(0.01</money></money>) per basic and diluted share).</li><li>Cash ending Q3-FY26 was <money><money>$0.1 million</money></money>, plus <money><money>$0.4 million</money></money> of accounts receivables, while cash burn from Operations decreased by <money><money>$0.9 million</money></money> in Q3-FY26 versus Q3-FY25, to a burn rate of <money><money>$33,000</money></money> per month.</li><li>Outstanding debt as at December 31, 2025 was <money><money>$2.5 million</money></money> which was drawn against the previously announced <money><money>$4 million</money></money> line of credit from Celtic Bank.

The world's largest social media company renewed its services agreement for another year, extending the partnership and expanding the scope of work. A large global multinational IT services firm, both a customer and partner, also expanded its engagement. A leading global chemical manufacturer continues to expand its use of Unity Central to improve supply chain visibility and enhance AI-driven information management.</li></ul><p><b>Subsequent to Q3-FY26 Operational Highlights:</b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>On January 6, 2026, the Company announces the expansion and extension of its contract with a leading global IT services firm to support a top‑five <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> financial institution. Boardwalktech and the global IT services firm have been jointly servicing this marquee <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> bank since 2024, transforming manual workflows and processes into automated and compliant solutions running on the Boardwalktech Velocity platform</li><li>On January 20, 2026, the Company announced the launch of Boardwalk Verity™, its next‑generation Intelligent Controls Platform. Purpose‑built for highly regulated organizations, including banks, insurers, and global financial institutions, Verity leverages Generative AI and Agentic AI for controls automation, execution, validation, testing, and continuous monitoring across thousands of business controls.</li></ul><p><b>Management Commentary </b></p><p>\"We continue to see existing customers expand deployments across Velocity and our Digital Ledger platform,\" said Andrew T. Duncan, CEO of Boardwalktech. \"Recent upgrade initiatives and new opportunities are expected to drive incremental professional services revenue and increase high-margin ARR. During the quarter, we enhanced Velocity with AI capabilities and subsequent to quarter-end we formally launched Verity, our first purpose-built AI product focused on automating internal controls testing and monitoring for financial institutions. Early traction with large banks and global partners reinforces our confidence in Verity as a meaningful growth driver. Unity Central also continues to gain momentum with AI enhancements improving enterprise data management and one supply chain customer already live and expanding usage based on measurable ROI. With previous cost reductions now taking effect and improved operating efficiency, we remain focused on accelerating revenue growth and moving toward Adjusted EBITDA breakeven in the near term. We believe the combination of Verity's launch, Velocity expansion, partner leverage, and continued cost discipline sets the stage for improved year-over-year performance and organic growth into Fiscal 2027 and beyond.\"</p><p><b>About Boardwalktech Software Corp.</b></p><p>Boardwalktech has developed a patented Digital Ledger Technology Platform currently used by Fortune 500 companies running mission-critical applications worldwide.

Our hotels are geographically diverse and concentrated in major urban markets that provide multiple demand generators from business, leisure, and other travelers.</p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">Forward-Looking Statements</span></b></p><p><i>This information contains certain statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to the Company’s business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, that are “forward looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the use of the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “will continue,” “intend,” “should,” “may,” or similar expressions.

The Company cautions investors not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and urges investors to carefully review the disclosures the Company makes concerning risks and uncertainties in the sections entitled “Risk Factors,” “Forward- Looking Statements,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025, which will be filed on February 27, 2026, as well as risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in other documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</i></p><p class=\"bwalignc\"><i>For additional information or to receive press releases via email, please visit our website:</i></p><p class=\"bwalignc\"><i><a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rljlodgingtrust.com&amp;esheet=54434770&amp;newsitemid=20260226156144&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rljlodgingtrust.com&amp;index=2&amp;md5=f3e72d26215f676fa97962eef6e4d1c8\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">http://www.rljlodgingtrust.com</a></i></p><p class=\"bwalignc\"><b>RLJ Lodging Trust</b></p><p class=\"bwalignc\"><b>Non-GAAP and Accounting Commentary</b></p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“Non-GAAP”) Financial Measures</span></b></p><p>The Company considers the following non-GAAP financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of its performance: (1) FFO, (2) Adjusted FFO, (3) EBITDA, (4) EBITDA<i>re, </i>(5)<i> </i>Adjusted EBITDA, (6) Hotel EBITDA, and (7) Hotel EBITDA Margin. These Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income or loss as a measure of its operating performance. FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDA<i>re</i>, Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel EBITDA, and Hotel EBITDA Margin, as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company defines such terms.</p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">Funds From Operations (“FFO”)</span></b></p><p>The Company calculates Funds from Operations (“FFO”) in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which defines FFO as net income or loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus depreciation and amortization, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have instead historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most real estate industry investors consider FFO to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company’s operations. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), even though FFO does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders.</p><p>The Company’s calculation of FFO may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use NAREIT's definition of FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. Additionally, FFO may not be helpful when comparing the Company to non-REITs. The Company presents FFO attributable to common shareholders, which includes unitholders of limited partnership interest (“OP units”) in RLJ Lodging Trust, L.P., the Company’s operating partnership, because the OP units may be redeemed for common shares of the Company. The Company believes it is meaningful for the investor to understand FFO attributable to all common shares and OP units.</p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">EBITDA and EBITDA<i>re</i></span></b></p><p>Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is defined as net income or loss excluding: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sales of assets; and (3) depreciation and amortization expense. The Company considers EBITDA useful to an investor in evaluating and facilitating comparisons of its operating performance between periods and between REITs by removing the impact of its capital structure (primarily interest expense) and asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense) from its operating results. In addition, EBITDA is used as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions.</p><p>In addition to EBITDA, the Company presents EBITDA<i>re</i> in accordance with NAREIT guidelines, which defines EBITDA<i>re </i>as net income or loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax benefit or expense, depreciation and amortization expense, gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. The Company believes that the presentation of EBITDA<i>re</i> provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs.</p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">Adjustments to FFO and EBITDA</span></b></p><p>The Company adjusts FFO, EBITDA, and EBITDA<i>re</i> for certain items that the Company considers outside the normal course of operations. The Company believes that Adjusted FFO, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding its ongoing operating performance that, when considered with net income or loss, FFO, EBITDA, and EBITDA<i>re</i>, are beneficial to an investor’s understanding of the Company's operating performance. The Company adjusts FFO, EBITDA, and EBITDA<i>re</i> for the following items:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li><i>Transaction Costs:</i> The Company excludes transaction costs expensed during the period</li><li><i>Pre-Opening Costs:</i> The Company excludes certain costs related to pre-opening of hotels</li><li><i>Non-Cash Expenses:</i> The Company excludes the effect of certain non-cash items such as the amortization of share-based compensation, non-cash income tax expense or benefit, and non-cash interest expense related to discontinued interest rate hedges</li><li><i>Other Non-Operational Expenses:</i> The Company excludes the effect of certain non-operational expenses representing income and expenses outside the normal course of operations</li></ul><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">Hotel EBITDA and Hotel EBITDA Margin</span></b></p><p>With respect to Consolidated Hotel EBITDA, the Company believes that excluding the effect of corporate-level expenses and certain non-cash items provides a more complete understanding of the operating results over which individual hotels and operators have direct control. The Company believes property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operational performance of the Company’s hotels and the effectiveness of third-party management companies.</p><p>Comparable Hotel EBITDA and Comparable Hotel EBITDA margin include prior ownership information provided by the sellers of the hotels for periods prior to our acquisition of the hotels and excludes results from sold hotels as applicable. The following is a summary of Comparable hotel adjustments:</p><p><i><span class=\"bwuline\">Comparable adjustments: Acquired hotel</span></i></p><p>For the three and twelve months ended December 31,

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related costs, gains or losses on early retirement of debt, separation transaction costs, and equity in earnings or losses from unconsolidated subsidiaries. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue.

He began his career at Citigroup working within Citibank’s affordable housing department. Mr. Scali holds a B.A. from Columbia University.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Additionally, the Company elevated David Cohen to the position of Co-President of ReadyCap Commercial, LLC.
