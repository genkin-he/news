Barzolvolimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody with a completely novel mechanism of action that uniquely targets the root cause of CSU, ColdU and SD—the mast cell. The data were presented today at the 2026 Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology's (AAAAI) Annual Meeting being held in Philadelphia, PA.</p> <p>“Barzolvolimab’s novel mechanism of action uniquely targets the root cause of chronic urticarias—the mast cell—and is driving the unparalleled efficacy we are seeing across our studies in chronic spontaneous urticaria, cold urticaria and symptomatic dermographism,” said Diane Young, MD, Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Celldex. “The data presented at AAAAI continue to demonstrate that barzolvolimab has the potential to transform the treatment landscape by providing rapid, profound and durable efficacy, including symptom free complete control and dramatic improvements in quality of life and angioedema—offering new hope for the patients suffering from these often severe and debilitating diseases.”</p> <p><strong>Summary of Friday, February 27</strong><sup><strong>rd</strong></sup><strong> Presentations:</strong></p> <p><strong><em>Prolonged Off-Treatment Efficacy of Barzolvolimab in Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria; presented by Martin Metz, M.D., Professor, Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Head of Translational Research and Deputy Head of Clinical Trials at Charité – Universitätsmedizin in Berlin</em></strong></p> <p><em>Data from the abstract associated with this presentation were also highlighted by AAAAI in a </em><em>press release </em><em>issued in early February.</em></p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li>As previously reported in the <a href=\"https://ir.celldex.com/news-releases/news-release-details/celldex-presents-unprecedented-76-week-results-barzolvolimab\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Phase 2 CSU study</a>, up to <percent>51%</percent> of patients on study experienced symptom free complete response (UAS7=0; no itch/no hives) at 12 weeks, which continued to deepen over 52 weeks of active therapy to up to <percent>71%</percent> of patients.

UCT≥12 is well controlled and UCT=16 is complete control.<br/><sup>2</sup>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) consists of ten questions (on a scale of 0–3, total 0–30) used to measure the impact of skin disease on patient quality of life related to symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. DLQI 0–1 indicates no effect on a patient’s life.<br/><sup>3</sup>Angioedema Activity Score for 7 days (AAS7) assesses the severity of disease activity in patients with recurrent angioedema or urticaria. It sums daily scores (0-15) over one week (total: 0 -105), evaluating frequency, duration, severity, disfigurement, and impact on daily life.<br/><br/><strong>About Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU)</strong><br/>CSU is an underdiagnosed disease of misery marked by spontaneous hives, unbearable itch, and unpredictable episodes of disfiguring swelling (angioedema) that causes substantial mental health burden, profound impact on quality of life and is associated with a 1.7-fold increase in all cause mortality at 5 years. Mast cell activation plays a central role in the onset and progression of CSU. While the goal of CSU treatment is the complete absence of symptoms, the vast majority of patients today, even those receiving the most advanced approved and available therapies, continue to suffer from itch, hives, swelling, sleep disruption, and unrelenting anxiety about when the next flare up will occur.</p> <p><strong>About Chronic Inducible Urticaria (CIndU), Cold Urticaria (ColdU), Symptomatic Dermographism (SD)</strong><br/>CIndU is characterized by the occurrence of hives or wheals that have an attributable trigger associated with them. ColdU symptoms include itching, burning wheals/hives and angioedema when skin is exposed to cold temperatures. SD symptoms include the development of wheals in response to stroking, scratching or rubbing of the skin. For these diseases, mast cell activation leading to release of soluble mediators is thought to be the driving mechanism leading to the wheals and other symptoms. There are currently no approved therapies for chronic inducible urticarias other than antihistamines and patients attempt to manage symptoms associated with their disease through avoidance of triggers.</p> <p><strong>About Barzolvolimab</strong><br/>Barzolvolimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody with a completely novel mechanism of action that targets mast cells by binding with high specificity to a unique part of the KIT receptor and potently inhibiting its activity. The KIT receptor is abundantly expressed by mast cells and critical for their function and survival. Mast cells are drivers of inflammatory responses such as hypersensitivity and allergic reactions and, in certain inflammatory diseases, such as chronic urticarias, mast cell activation plays a central role in the onset and progression of the disease. Based on data from robust, randomized, placebo controlled Phase 2 studies, barzolvolimab has significant potential as a first-in-class and best-in-disease treatment option for patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), cold urticaria (ColdU) and symptomatic dermographism (SD). Barzolvolimab is currently being studied in Phase 3 studies in CSU and ColdU/SD and Phase 2 studies in prurigo nodularis (PN) and atopic dermatitis (AD), with additional indications planned for the future.</p> <p><strong>About Celldex </strong><br/>Celldex is pioneering new horizons in immunology to deliver life-changing therapies.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements include failure to obtain necessary approvals, unsuccessful exploration results, unsuccessful operations, changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined, results of future resource estimates, future metal prices, availability of capital and financing on acceptable terms, general economic, market or business conditions, risks associated with regulatory changes, defects in title, availability of personnel, materials and equipment on a timely basis, accidents or equipment breakdowns, uninsured risks, delays in receiving government approvals, unanticipated environmental impacts on operations and costs to remedy same and other exploration or other risks detailed herein and from time to time in the filings made by the Company with securities regulators. Readers are cautioned that mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

If consummated, the proposed transaction could expand Tevogen’s clinical development capabilities and could support the Company’s evolution into a revenue-generating healthcare enterprise.</p> <p>Dr. Ryan Saadi, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Tevogen, stated, “The potential acquisition of a CRO could introduce revenue-generating service capabilities while allowing us to optimize trial execution internally. We believe this combination of operational control and service revenue may strengthen earnings visibility, support a more capital-efficient growth model, and enhance patient affordability.”</p> <p>The proposed transaction remains subject to, among other things, completion of due diligence, negotiation and execution of definitive documentation, required approvals, and satisfaction of customary closing conditions.</p> <p>Tevogen is also actively considering other transactions with a focus on life sciences-related businesses; however, there can be no assurance that any such transaction will be consummated.</p> <p><strong>About Tevogen</strong></p> <p>Tevogen is a socially integrated healthcare enterprise built on the principles of affordability, efficiency, and scientific rigor.

As part of the initial wind-down, the Company recognized all necessary impairments associated with Crown, and no further adjustments are required to the December 31, 2025 financial statements; however, the Company cannot estimate the total financial impact of the filing at the time due to its nature and timing. While the voluntary filing is considered an Event of Default under the current lending arrangements, BHI has proactively received a formal waiver from its banking group, ensuring continued operational stability and overall financial flexibility for its other active subsidiaries as the organization streamlines its legacy exposure.</p><p>This restructuring aligns with BHI's broader transformation into a leaner, more efficient organization. The Company remains focused on its Center of Excellence for its high-efficiency boiler products and its expanding commercial service platforms, which continue to see strong market demand.</p><p>\"We remain focused on delivering long-term value for our shareholders, customers, and employees,\" added Drew. \"By resolving these legacy liabilities and concentrating on our core boiler and service offerings, we are reinforcing our foundation for sustainable growth and positioning the company to capitalize on evolving market demand.\"</p><p>BHI and Crown Boiler are working with legal and financial advisors throughout the Chapter 11 process.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><strong>RECX’s manufacturer’s representative agreement supports nationwide dealer onboarding and disciplined, milestone-driven growth</strong></p><p>BRADENTON, Fla., Feb.  27, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Recreatives Industries, Inc. (OTC: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/RECX/\" title=\"View RECX stock overview\">RECX</a>) (“Recreatives” or the “Company”), manufacturer of the legendary MAX 6x6 Amphibious All-Terrain Vehicles, today announced that it has entered into a manufacturer’s representative agreement with TRL Outdoors LLC, doing business as Muddog Amphibious Vehicles, to accelerate dealer network expansion and support the Company’s continued entry into utility, industrial, and commercial markets.</p> <p>Under the agreement, TRL Outdoors represents the full MAX ATV product lineup on a nationwide basis. The appointment strengthens MAX’s nationwide coverage while supporting structured, sustainable dealer growth across the platform.</p> <p>TRL Outdoors brings substantial industry experience, having previously represented Hydra-Trek and Land Tamer, manufacturers of industrial-grade amphibious vehicles with pricing that typically began above <money>$100,000</money> and frequently exceeded <money>$150,000. T</money>his experience positions TRL Outdoors to introduce MAX vehicles to customers historically served by significantly higher-priced industrial platforms.</p> <p>As part of the agreement, the Company and TRL Outdoors have established quarterly performance milestones focused on measurable dealer onboarding, market penetration, and brand expansion. Management believes this milestone-based structure supports meaningful expansion while maintaining operational discipline and long-term sustainability.</p> <p>“This agreement aligns with our strategy of expanding deliberately and building a high-quality dealer network,” said Andrew Lapp, CEO of Recreatives Industries. “TRL Outdoors has firsthand experience selling premium amphibious vehicles into demanding commercial environments. Their understanding of dealer development, combined with MAX’s proven designs and compelling value proposition, positions us well as we expand into new regions and applications.”</p> <p>The Company expects TRL Outdoors to assist in expanding MAX’s presence in utility, industrial, and commercial sectors as the MAX 4 and Buffalo models become available. Management believes MAX vehicles offer a compelling value proposition for these markets by delivering capable amphibious performance at a substantially lower cost than many legacy industrial platforms.</p> <p>This appointment supports Recreatives Industries’ broader strategy of strengthening its dealer network, expanding into new market segments, and positioning the MAX brand for disciplined long-term growth.</p> <p>To receive frequent updates, follow Recreatives Industries, Inc.:</p> <p>On Facebook: facebook.com/maxatv</p> <p>On X (formerly Twitter): x.com/recreativesind</p> <p>MAX Mailing List: maxatvs.com</p> <p>To learn more about MAX ATVs and for general inquiries, visit www.maxatvs.com or contact 1-800-255-2511.</p> <p><strong>About Recreatives Industries, Inc.</strong></p> <p>RECREATIVES INDUSTRIES, INC. (\"<a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/RECX/\" title=\"View RECX stock overview\">RECX</a>\") is the manufacturer of MAX amphibious six-wheel-drive (6x6) all-terrain vehicles (www.maxatvs.com), originally manufactured by Recreatives Industries Inc. of Buffalo, NY, from 1970 to 2013. <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/RECX/\" title=\"View RECX stock overview\">RECX</a> is continuing MAX's brand legacy of 53 years by relaunching the entire MAX ATV product line from existing, proven designs, which will ensure a rapid re-entry into the global ATV and UTV. Beyond traditional MAX ATV production, RECX plans to diversify its product line by introducing new vehicles and products to market in a compressed timeframe. The company's planned diversification includes larger eight-wheeled vehicles (8x8) as well as electric vehicle (EV) drivetrains to draw on recent advancements in battery and drive motor technology, which make fitment in smaller vehicles possible. RECX management believes that electric vehicles can ultimately offer performance that exceeds that of the traditional mechanical transmissions that most all-terrain vehicles employ.</p> <p><strong>Safe Harbor</strong></p> <p>This news release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, intended to be covered by the \"safe harbor\" created by those sections.
