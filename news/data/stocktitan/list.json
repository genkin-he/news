Importantly, absent a one-time, non-cash charge related to stock-based compensation for employees, the Company would have more than doubled its profitability compared to fiscal 2024.</p><p>During fiscal 2025, in addition to our sales directly with customers, we continued to strengthen our distribution sales channel and sales through subcontractors who manufacture on behalf of our customers. By deepening these channels, we effectively open the door to a broad base of end customers. Challenge Electronics has developed numerous new products that will be introduced through its newly formed distribution sales channel, reinforcing our commitment to innovation and long-term growth.</p><p>We are also actively expanding our global reach. The Surge division’s European sales operation is performing quite well, and we are optimistic about continued growth in that market in fiscal 2026. At the same time, our Challenge Electronics sales division is establishing a sales presence in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/eur\">Europe</location>.</p><p>We are also positioning the Company to participate in sales to high-growth markets. During the year, we initiated efforts to explore opportunities within the AI ecosystem, targeting potential customers whose applications require the types of electronic components we supply.</p><p>Lastly, in response to geopolitical considerations, many customers across the industry have requested production capabilities outside of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>. As a result, several of our manufacturing partners have established secondary facilities outside of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>.</p><p>We believe our strategic initiatives, combined with our strong financial performance, position us well for continued growth and value creation in the year ahead.”</p><p><b>Results of Operations for the fiscal year Ended November 30, 2025</b></p><p>Consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2025 increased by <money><money>$5,108,966</money></money> or <percent>16.4%</percent>, to <money><money>$36,320,105</money></money> as compared to net sales of <money><money>$31,211,139</money></money> for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2024. We attribute the increase to an increase in business with new customers as well as an increase in business with existing customers. We can also attribute the increase to an increase in business from the Company’s distribution channels. Net sales for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2025 and November 30, 2024 reflect <money><money>$941,564</money></money> and <money><money>$549,564</money></money>, respectively of tariff costs that the Company was able to pass on to its customers.</p><p>Our gross profit for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2025 increased by <money><money>$1,551,477</money></money> to <money><money>$10,455,171</money></money> or <percent>17.4%</percent>, as compared to <money><money>$8,903,694</money></money> for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2024. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to <percent>28.8%</percent> for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2025 compared to <percent>28.5%</percent> for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2024. The increase can be attributed to the increase in sales to certain customers whose sales are at a higher gross profit margin. We work with electronic manufacturing service subcontractor customers who manufacture products for other customers who do not have their own manufacturing operations. The Company has agreements with these subcontractor customers to provide periodic cost reductions through rebates in the amount of <percent>5%</percent>. These reductions only affect future shipments of our products, and do not affect existing orders. These reductions can have a negative impact on our profit margins since they reduce the amount of commissions we can earn. Even though this rebate can impact the Company’s gross profit margin, these subcontractor customers represent very significant potential growth for the Company, because they can help the Company become an approved supplier at the customers they manufacture for, and they purchase our components for these customers. We believe it would be very difficult for the Company to achieve business at these customers without the help of these subcontractor customers. During Fiscal 2025, the Company was impacted by tariff costs on certain products imported from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>. The Company has been able to pass along a portion of these costs to its customers and will do so under potential tariffs imposed upon us. The Company has also moved some customer deliveries directly to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong</location> in order to mitigate some of these costs.</p><p>Selling and shipping expenses for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2025 was <money><money>$2,906,782</money></money>, an increase of <money><money>$166,788</money></money>, or <percent>6.1%</percent>, as compared to <money><money>$2,739,994</money></money> for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2024. We attribute the increase to increases in sales and the resulting selling expenses such as commission expenses, the hiring of new salespeople which increased sales payroll, travel and entertainment and auto expenses, offset by decreases in freight out and printing expenses.</p><p>General and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2025 was <money><money>$6,223,384</money></money>, an increase of <money><money>$1,034,015</money></money>, or <percent>19.9%</percent>, as compared to <money><money>$5,189,369</money></money> for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2025. The increase is due primarily to non cash stock based compensation of <money><money>$538,361</money></money> during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2025. As well as increases in officer salaries, other salaries and related payroll taxes, general insurance expenses as well as health insurance expenses, utilities and office expenses and professional fees, computer expenses and consulting expenses and pension expenses as well as increases in bank charges and bad debt expenses, offset by decreases in rent, directors fees and public company expenses.</p><p>This press release should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, which can be found at <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.surgecomponents.com&amp;esheet=54434606&amp;newsitemid=20260227271339&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.surgecomponents.com&amp;index=1&amp;md5=4a72cf161666d104ea7b8630c8f00a68\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">www.surgecomponents.com</a> and at <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&amp;esheet=54434606&amp;newsitemid=20260227271339&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.sec.gov&amp;index=2&amp;md5=fbc02cc877f943868f6b636e4226ff28\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">www.sec.gov</a>.</p><p><b>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements</b></p><p>This press release contains forward-looking statements.

During the summit's Make-a-Thon competitions, engineers will develop and present new software products designed to enhance company and hotel operations and guest experiences. Winning teams will earn cash prizes, with top innovations considered for company-wide deployment.</p><p>\"At its core, Mastery is about designing technical capabilities that will shape the next chapter of hospitality,\" said Brian Kirkland, Chief Information Officer, Choice Hotels International.  \"By engaging associates across the organization—not just engineers—we're unlocking new opportunities to apply AI and emerging technologies to real business challenges. That collective investment in talent and expertise is accelerating innovation across the Choice Hotels system and translating into dependable, practical tools that help franchisees operate more efficiently, make smarter decisions, and grow their businesses with confidence.\"</p><p>A winning project from last year's Mastery event demonstrated how emerging technologies can deliver tangible business impact. In 2025, Choice Hotels' technology organization faced a major initiative to modernize  Hotel Suite, a legacy, web‑based system used across the company's entire property portfolio. The effort focused on updating and reimagining a critical platform that had become increasingly complex to maintain and evolve. Initial estimates projected the Hotel Suite modernization would take more than a year using traditional development approaches. Instead, a cross‑functional engineering team applied lessons from Mastery 2025, leveraging generative AI and a \"vibe coding\" development approach to fully reimagine the application. The team not only dramatically accelerated the delivery, but also modernized the user interface and delivered the first business‑critical, end‑user‑facing application at Choice Hotels to reach production using an AI‑assisted development model — cutting timelines by months, and saving more than <money><money>$750,000</money></money> in projected investment.</p><p><b><i>History of Innovation</i></b><br/>Choice Hotels brings a decades-long legacy of innovation to the hospitality industry, from introducing the first hotel website with real-time rates and availability and launching the first hotel app for the iPhone, to creating the first mobile-friendly rate management tool for operators and fully migrating its platforms to the cloud. Through Mastery, that innovation is put into practice—leveraging technology to give owners tools that simplify operations, strengthen competitiveness, and allow them to focus on delivering great stays for guests.</p><p>Choice Hotels has built and introduced industry-first, owner-facing technologies, including:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>In 1995, Choice launched the first hotel website with real-time rate and availability information.</li><li>In 2003, Choice launched the first cloud-based property management system (PMS), choiceADVANTAGE.</li><li>In 2009, Choice released the first hotel app for iOS.</li><li>In 2014, Choice became the first hotel company to offer instant booking on TripAdvisor.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><strong>Acquisition Expected to Contribute Over <money>$20 Million</money> in 2026 Revenue</strong></p><p>LONDON, Feb.  27, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sports Entertainment Gaming Global Corporation (NASDAQ: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/SEGG/\" title=\"View SEGG stock overview\">SEGG</a>, LTRYW) (the “Company” or “SEGG Media”) today provided an investor update highlighting the diverse and growing revenue streams resulting from its <money>$61million</money> acquisition of a controlling supermajority interest in Veloce Media Group (“Veloce”).</p> <p>The acquisition materially expands <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/SEGG/\" title=\"View SEGG stock overview\">SEGG</a> Media’s top line, strengthens its international footprint, and accelerates its transition into a scaled, revenue-generating global sports and digital media platform. Based on current operating performance and contracted partnerships, management expects Veloce and its subsidiary Quadrant to generate in excess of <money>$20 million</money> in revenue during 2026.</p> <p><strong>Multi-Pillar Revenue Model with Immediate Scale</strong></p> <p>Veloce operates a diversified revenue model across five core verticals:</p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"margin-top:5pt; margin-bottom:5pt;\">Digital advertising and media</li><li style=\"margin-top:5pt; margin-bottom:5pt;\">Creator representation and brand partnerships</li><li style=\"margin-top:5pt; margin-bottom:5pt;\">Esports and sim racing services</li><li style=\"margin-top:5pt; margin-bottom:5pt;\">Sustainable motorsport operations</li><li style=\"margin-top:5pt; margin-bottom:5pt;\">Direct-to-consumer and lifestyle commerce through its growing wholly-owned subsidiary, Quadrant, co-founded by 2025 Formula One World Champion Lando Norris.<br/></li></ul> <p>This multi-pillar structure reduces single-stream dependency while creating cross-selling and recurring monetization opportunities across audiences, brands, and commercial partners.</p> <p><strong>Expansive Digital Media Network &amp; Creator Agency Division</strong></p> <p>Veloce’s owned and operated media network spans more than 45 racing and gaming channels globally. In 2025, the platform generated:</p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"margin-top:5pt; margin-bottom:5pt;\"><strong><money>$2.17 million</money> in digital advertising revenue</strong> <ul type=\"circle\"><li style=\"margin-top:5pt; margin-bottom:5pt;\">Hundreds of millions of views across motorsport and gaming content</li></ul> </li></ul> <p>In addition, Veloce’s creator agency division, which was launched in 2025, represents 15 high-profile racing and automotive creators and has generated:</p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"margin-top:5pt; margin-bottom:5pt;\"><strong><money>$620,000</money> in revenue since inception</strong> <ul type=\"circle\"><li style=\"margin-top:5pt; margin-bottom:5pt;\">Commercial partnerships with Audi, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, Rolex, Peroni, and Lego</li></ul> </li></ul> <p>The creator agency model provides scalable margin expansion through brand brokerage and commercial representation agreements. This media reach also acts as a strategic marketing funnel for Veloce and Quadrant products, including merchandise and a forthcoming VISA-branded card, enhancing direct-to-consumer engagement and recurring revenue opportunities.</p> <p><strong>Quadrant Expansion </strong></p> <p>A key growth driver has been the expansion of Quadrant, acquired in July 2025. Leveraging Norris-related commercial assets and a vast creator network, in 2025, Quadrant delivered:</p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"margin-top:5pt; margin-bottom:5pt;\"><strong>1 billion brand impressions</strong></li><li style=\"margin-top:5pt; margin-bottom:5pt;\"><strong><money>$2.45 million</money> in partnership and digital revenue (H2 2025; the portion of 2025 owned by Veloce)</strong></li><li style=\"margin-top:5pt; margin-bottom:5pt;\"><strong><money>$675,000</money> in merchandise, product and B2B activations in the second half of 2025</strong>, including T-Mobile collaborations at the Las Vegas Grand Prix<br/></li></ul> <p>Quadrant’s hybrid model which combines athlete-led brand equity, digital engagement, merchandise, and live activation, provides both sponsorship-driven and consumer-driven revenue streams.</p> <p><strong>Leadership in Esports, Sim Racing and Sustainable Motorsport</strong></p> <p>The Veloce Group maintains a leadership position in competitive sim racing and esports, providing official Formula 1 team esports services, global league and sim racing activations, and operating its own professional team and development academy. This division generated <money>$3.36 million</money> in fee-for-service and sponsorship revenue in 2025.</p> <p>Beyond digital competition, Veloce has established strong credentials in sustainable motorsport, previously operating a championship-leading Extreme E team supported by title partner E.ON. While it did not take part in Extreme E in 2025, for 2024 sponsorship revenue was <money>$2.27 million</money>. Veloce has a confirmed entry into the FIA Hydrogen World Cup in 2026, positioning the Group at the forefront of next-generation racing innovation.</p> <p>These combined pillars and results demonstrate the scale and balance of Veloce’s diversified revenue model across advertising, esports services, sponsorship, digital partnerships, and commerce, delivering immediate and significant revenue for <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/SEGG/\" title=\"View SEGG stock overview\">SEGG</a> Media, instantly improving shareholder value. Revenue for 2026 from Veloce and Quadrant is expected to exceed <money>$20 million</money>.</p> <p><strong>CEO Statement</strong></p> <p><strong><em>Daniel Bailey, Chief Executive Officer of Veloce Media Group, said</em></strong><em>: \"The last two years have been transformational for Veloce. We have built a complementary and diversified platform spanning digital media, esports, sustainable motorsport, and lifestyle commerce. </em></p> <p><em>Our <money>$61 million</money> valuation reflects both what we have achieved and the strength of our foundation.

The data demonstrated that OPGx-BEST1 was well tolerated with no ocular inflammation, no ocular or treatment-related adverse events, and no dose limiting toxicities. Early signals of functional vision improvement were observed, including an equivalent 12-letter gain in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) in the treated study eye. In addition, structural improvement in central subfield thickness (CST) was observed with a <percent>23%</percent> decrease in the study eye. Resolution of intraretinal fluid was also seen as early as 1-month in areas with less atrophy.</p> <p>“We are encouraged by these results from our sentinel participant, showing OPGx-BEST1 was well-tolerated and demonstrated promising initial efficacy at three months,” said George Magrath, M.D., Chief Executive Officer, Opus Genetics. Although early, this data represents an important milestone for our OPGx-BEST1 program and for patients with BEST1-related retinal diseases.”</p> <p>“BEST1-related retinal diseases represent a significant unmet medical need, with no approved treatments currently available,” said Mark Pennesi, M.D., Ph.D., study investigator at the Retina Foundation of the Southwest in Dallas, Texas. “The preliminary results from this study, including the early favorable safety profile and initial signals of functional and structural improvement, are encouraging and support continued evaluation of OPGx-BEST1 as a gene augmentation approach for patients with BEST1-associated disease.”</p> <p>Recruitment in the Phase 1/2 study is ongoing at two clinical sites in the U.S., with additional sites expected to open in Florida, Cincinnati and New York. Two participants have been enrolled to date, with 3-month results from the full Cohort 1 expected in mid-year 2026.</p> <p>The full presentation and video recording will be available on the Opus Genetics website in the <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=f0bFStFTGQbq1zSNfuUI6K_Ty13dzjBay7__iO8jdVSpy2nL8WIofPtnZ7ssWhUAXssuPHAh6GRW_IppxzDbqw==\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Events</a> section.</p> <p><strong>About OPGx-BEST1 and the Phase 1/2 Trial</strong></p> <p>OPGx-BEST1 leverages Opus Genetics’ proprietary AAV-based gene therapy platform, designed to deliver a functional copy of the BEST1 gene directly to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells where the defective gene resides. The program builds on extensive preclinical work demonstrating restoration of BEST1 protein expression and improved retinal function in relevant disease models.</p> <p>By restoring BEST1 function, the therapy aims to address the underlying genetic cause of retinal degeneration and support preservation of photoreceptor health and visual function. BEST1-associated IRDs affect an estimated 22,000 patients worldwide and currently have no approved treatments.</p> <p>The ongoing adaptive, open-label Phase 1/2 study is evaluating single-eye subretinal administration of OPGx-BEST1 up to two dose levels in adult participants with Best Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy (BVMD) or Autosomal-Recessive Bestrophinopathy (ARB). Treatment will be administered via a single subretinal injection in one eye of each participant with two dosing cohorts.</p> <p>The primary objective is to assess safety and tolerability and identify the most appropriate dose for further clinical development, with participants followed longitudinally for long-term outcomes. The trial will also explore biological activity through functional and anatomical endpoints, including changes in visual function and retinal structure.</p> <p><strong>About Opus Genetics</strong></p> <p>Opus Genetics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing gene therapies to restore vision and prevent blindness in patients with inherited retinal diseases (IRDs).
