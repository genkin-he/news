(NYSE: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/RQI/\" title=\"View RQI stock overview\">RQI</a>) (the \"Fund\") with information regarding the sources of the distribution to be paid on February 27, 2026 and cumulative distributions paid fiscal year-to-date.</p><p>In December 2012, the Fund implemented a managed distribution policy in accordance with exemptive relief issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The managed distribution policy seeks to deliver the Fund's long-term total return potential through regular monthly distributions declared at a fixed rate per common share. The policy gives the Fund greater flexibility to realize long-term capital gains throughout the year and to distribute those gains on a regular monthly basis to shareholders. The Board of Directors of the Fund may amend, terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares. </p><p>The Fund's monthly distributions may include long-term capital gains, short-term capital gains, net investment income and/or return of capital for federal income tax purposes. Return of capital includes distributions paid by the Fund in excess of its net investment income and net realized capital gains and such excess is distributed from the Fund's assets. A return of capital is not taxable; rather, it reduces a shareholder's tax basis in his or her shares of the Fund. In addition, distributions from the Fund's investments in real estate investment trusts (REITs) may later be characterized as capital gains and/or a return of capital, depending on the character of the dividends reported to the Fund after year end by REITs held by the Fund. The amount of monthly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors, including changes in portfolio and market conditions.</p><p>At the time of each monthly distribution, information will be posted to cohenandsteers.com and mailed to shareholders in a concurrent notice. However, this information may change at the end of the year because the final tax characteristics of the Fund's distributions cannot be determined with certainty until after the end of the calendar year. Final tax characteristics of all of the Fund's distributions will be provided on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year.</p><p>The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year-to-date from the sources indicated. All amounts are expressed per common share.</p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"prnbcc\"><tr><td class=\"prnpr2 prnpl2 prnvab prncbts prnrbrb1 prnbbbs prnbsbls\"

the terms of the Fund's managed distribution policy. The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only estimates, are likely to change over time, and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for accounting and tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations.

The Fund's NAV is calculated as the total market value of all the securities and other assets held by the Fund minus the total liabilities, divided by the total number of shares outstanding. While NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund's investment performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder's individual investment in the Fund.

Mesoblast expects to see reduction in net cash spend over the remainder of the fiscal period based on projected receipts from quarterly revenues.</li><li style=\"margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify;\">Period-end cash balance of US<money>$130.0 million</money>. Mesoblast entered into a US<money>$125.0 million</money> five-year non-dilutive credit-line facility.

The final protocol design for the Phase 3 trial of Ryoncil<sup>®</sup> as part of the second-line treatment regimen in adults with steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease (SR-aGvHD), a population approximately three times the size of the pediatric SR-aGvHD population, is locked down following a recent meeting with FDA and will be provided to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) in March for site initiation.</li></ul> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Mesoblast’s second generation product rexlemestrocel-L to create multiple revenue streams in blockbuster indications</strong></p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify;\">Mesoblast will seek to use its data from large randomized controlled trials in chronic discogenic low back pain (CLBP) and inflammatory chronic heart failure with low ejection fraction to support approvals for rexlemestrocel-L, aligning with recent announcements by the FDA that a single pivotal trial is the new default option for FDA approval.<sup>5</sup></li><li style=\"margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify;\"><strong>Confirmatory Phase 3 trial for chronic discogenic low back pain (CLBP):</strong> During the period, Mesoblast received positive feedback from FDA on potential filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) confirming that a clinically meaningful reduction in pain intensity in the active arm versus placebo at 12 months can support product efficacy and stated that the robust results on opioid reduction from at least one adequate and well controlled trial could be included in the Clinical Studies section of product labeling. Mesoblast’s second randomized controlled Phase 3 trial in CLBP is on track to complete its 300-patient enrollment target in March/April this year with the trial actively recruiting across 40 sites in the U.S.</li><li style=\"margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify;\"><strong>BLA filing for end-stage patients with chronic heart failure with low ejection fraction (HFrEF):</strong> Mesoblast has generated new data showing that a single administration of rexlemestrocel-L at the time of open heart surgery and device implantation to support the left ventricle in end-stage patients with HFrEF, reduces right heart failure hospitalizations, mortality from right heart failure, and portal hypertension with major bleeding events. With these new data, existing Orphan Drug designation for treating this group of patients, and FDA’s stated preference for randomized controlled trials, Mesoblast is moving from filing for accelerated approval to filing for full FDA approval next quarter. A confirmatory study would no longer be needed, if approved.</li><li style=\"margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify;\"><strong>Commercial manufacturing:</strong> scale-up work for rexlemestrocel-L is well progressed to support BLA filings for both CLBP and, in the first instance, for end-stage HFrEF patients with LVADs.</li></ul> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>FY2026 Net Revenue Guidance </strong><br/>Mesoblast anticipates full-year fiscal 2026 Ryoncil<sup>®</sup> net revenue to range between US<money>$110 million</money> and US<money>$120 million</money>.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Commentary</strong><br/>Mesoblast Chief Executive Dr. Silviu Itescu, commented on the result: “Today we report strong operational and financial performance for the first half of FY2026, a period that marks an important inflection point in Mesoblast’s evolution from clinical development to sustainable commercial execution. Sales momentum for Ryoncil<sup>®</sup> continued to build, driving meaningful revenue and reinforcing the product’s value in addressing significant unmet medical need and the strength of our commercial strategy.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Importantly, we have improved the Company’s financial position with positive cash flow generated from Ryoncil<sup>®</sup> sales, disciplined cost management, and a strategic refinancing, providing greater flexibility to support expansion and late-stage clinical programs.</p> <p align=\"justify\">As we enter the second half of FY2026, we remain focused on accelerating commercial uptake, advancing regulatory and label expansion opportunities, and maintaining financial discipline to deliver sustainable long-term shareholder value.”</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Conference Call</strong><br/>There will be a webcast today, beginning at 5.00pm EST (Thursday, February 26); 9.00am AEDT (Friday, February 27).

We're moving quickly – and with purpose – to strengthen the advantages of being with REMAX. And we're doubling down on the winning culture that defines this brand,\" CEO Erik Carlson told affiliates at the opening general session. \"Based on what we see and hear from you, you're leaning into this fresh new direction. Because you see the value in staying ahead of competitors.\"</p><p>Part of that quicker new direction – shaped by Carlson and his team of senior leaders, many of whom the Company welcomed since the beginning of last year – is an across-the-board modernization of the 53-year-old brand.</p><p>From refreshed branding to AI-powered services to data-driven, storytelling upgrades of the flagship remax.com and remax.ca websites, REMAX is providing its agents with programs and resources to compete – and win – in the ever-fierce battle for listings and clients.</p><p>New programs and services include:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li><b>SkyView – </b>a purpose-built REMAX AI assistant that leverages brand data to help agents operate, market, and grow their business more efficiently.</li><li><b>BOSSCAT –</b> an innovative new offering designed to streamline the home inspection process with fast, accurate repair estimates, creating added value for both agents and clients.</li><li><b>REMAX Golf Lifestyles</b> – a new initiative that will connect REMAX agents with buyers and sellers in golf communities – tapping into one of the world's most engaged and loyal niche markets.</li><li>A new <b>partnership with INDYCAR team Meyer Shank Racing</b> – amplifying the visibility of REMAX within one of the world's fastest sports in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LB/nam\">North America</location>.</li><li><b>Marketing Studio</b> advancements, featuring expanded integrations with Canva, realtor.com and Zillow.

During his opening address, Carlson revealed that REMAX agents around the world have closed more than 10 million transaction sides since January 1, 2020. And no competing brand comes close to that mark.</p><p><span>\"REMAX is winning the race,\" Carlson said. \"Behind each of those 10 million (transaction sides) is a family, a life moment, a dream realized – and a REMAX professional who made it come true. We're focused on delivering the absolute best for buyers and sellers. REMAX is winning the decade, and nobody in the world sells more real estate than REMAX<sup>4</sup>.\"</span><span> </span></p><p><b>Celebrating Excellence Across the Global Network </b></p><p>During the event's opening general session, REMAX also honored top-performing agents, teams, and Broker/Owners within residential, luxury and commercial.  </p><p>REMAX also presented the prestigious Distinguished Service Award to REMAX Co-Founder and Chairman of the Board Dave Liniger for his enduring leadership and impact on the industry. </p><p>The brand further spotlighted its decades-long commitment to Children's Miracle Network, recognizing the top 2025 Miracle Makers for their extraordinary generosity.

This was especially evident in the MarketPlace, where attendees learned about new products and services available from REMAX and a host of high-quality vendors and partners.</p><p>They could test-drive the many new REMAX innovations, find professional services, explore technology solutions, consider insurance options, sign up for classes, purchase marketing materials, lean into The REMAX Collection<sup>®</sup> and REMAX Commercial<sup>®</sup> brands, and discover other resources to help build their businesses.</p><p>Raising money for Children's Miracle Network, they could enter the REMAX Lifestyles golf simulator and swing against REMAX agent Brandon Holtz of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.il\">Illinois</location>, who will play – sponsored by REMAX – in The Masters next month in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ga.agusta\">Augusta, Georgia</location>.

This deep molecular foundation enables Caris' AI models to identify subtle biological signals associated with early-stage cancers with unprecedented resolution. </p><p>Achieve 1 is evaluating Caris Detect across a broad population of patients, assessing its ability to detect multiple cancer types at early stages using a blood draw. For the undiagnosed cohort, which consisted of 1,505 samples, we utilized blood draws from subjects who had screening or symptomatic screening, a population reflecting a higher likelihood of cancer than the general population. We followed <percent>22.5%</percent> of the subjects for approximately one year following their blood draw. Of these, 121 subjects had no symptoms of cancer, no significant risk factors of cancer and were not subsequently diagnosed with cancer, representing a healthy population.</p><p>The first phase of Achieve 1 utilized a cross-validation approach, with approximately 865 samples held out for a blinded validation that is in process. Caris expects to report those results later in the first quarter of 2026.</p><p>Study highlights and key performance data from the interim readout include:</p><ul

Our uranium revenue is ramping up, and we signed two new long-term contracts with major utilities that are expected to increase our portfolio pricing in the coming years. In addition, we are investing significantly in our industry-leading <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> assets, as we expect to remain the country's uranium leader for many years to come.</p><p>\"Equally impressive has been our progress in rare earth processing and production. Energy Fuels' rare earth products have been confirmed, qualified, and used by manufacturers for EVs and hybrid EVs. In 2025, we made considerable investments in our rare earth segment. We strongly believe now is the time to capture opportunities, as vertical integration and access to low-cost 'molecules' are the key to higher margins, increased market share, and overall competitiveness in the space. In years past, we invested 'upstream' by securing low-cost rare earth feedstock at our Donald joint venture in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location>, Vara Mada project in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/mg\">Madagascar</location>, and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/br.ba\">Bahia</location> project in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/br\">Brazil</location>. Now, we are investing 'downstream', including our recently announced proposed acquisition of Australian Strategic Materials (\"<b>ASM</b>\"), which upon completion, will expand our reach into highly coveted rare earth metals and alloys. The proposed acquisition of ASM will also bring another potential material source of feedstock from the Dubbo project located in NSW, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location>.</p><p>Ross Bhappu, President of Energy Fuels, added \"We recently released feasibility studies for several of our development projects, including the proposed Phase 2 Circuit expansion of our rare earth processing at the White Mesa Mill in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ut\">Utah</location> and our Vara Mada project in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/mg\">Madagascar</location>, demonstrating impressive net present values and future cashflows. The combined NPV of the Phase 2 Circuit and the Vara Mada project is <money><money>$3.7 billion</money></money>, or <money><money>$15.26</money></money> per share (based on current shares outstanding), with expected EBITDA of <money><money>$765 million</money></money> for the first 15 years when the Phase 2 Circuit is combined with the expected EBITDA from the Vara Mada project over those years. </p><p>\"With an estimated capital cost of <money>$410 million</money> for the Phase 2 Circuit and an estimated all-in production cost of <money>$29.39</money>/kg NdPr equivalent produced from our Vara Mada project, <i>we believe our REE oxide production ranks among the lowest capital and operating costs globally.</i></p><p>Mr. Bhappu continued, \"We believe interest in Energy Fuels is accelerating as customers, governments, and investors favor companies like us that deliver on promises. We think we are turning a corner, as past investments could generate substantial cashflows and profits across several segments by decade's end.\"</p><p><b>Succession Planning Update:</b></p><p>The Company's succession plans are proceeding as expected and, in accordance with existing employment agreements, it is anticipated that Mr. Ross Bhappu, the President of the Company, will be appointed to the role of President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company on April 15, 2026, and Mr. Mark Chalmers,  the current CEO, will be retiring at the same time which is his planned retirement date. Upon his retirement, Mr. Chalmers will continue as a consultant to the Company exclusively for two years to support, as required, Mr. Bhappu and others in the Company with current and future growth initiatives.</p><p><b><u>2025 Highlights</u></b></p><p>Unless noted otherwise, all dollar amounts are in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> dollars.</p><p><b>Financial Highlights:</b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li><b>Robust Balance Sheet with Over <money><money>$900 million</money></money> of Liquidity:</b> As of December 31, 2025, the Company had <money><money>$927.4 million</money></money> of working capital, including <money><money>$64.7 million</money></money> of cash and cash equivalents, <money><money>$797.1 million</money></money> of marketable securities (short-term, interest-bearing securities and uranium equities), <money><money>$18.0 million</money></money> of trade and other receivables, and <money><money>$73.5 million</money></money> of inventory, which puts the Company in a strong position to continue to advance its projects.</li><li><b>Completed Upsized <money><money>$700 Million</money></money> Convertible Senior Notes Offering:</b> On October 3, 2025, the Company closed its upsized offering of <percent>0.75%</percent> Convertible Senior Notes due in 2031 for an aggregate principal amount of <money><money>$700.0 million</money></money>, including the exercise in full by the initial purchasers of their option to purchase an additional <money><money>$100.0 million</money></money> of notes, on a deal led by Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.

As MREC or similar intermediate REE products would not need to utilize the Phase 1 Circuit's crack and leach circuits, it is expected that such products could be separated into NdPr and heavy REEs separately from uranium production, thereby allowing such feedstocks to be separated into REE oxides through the Phase 1 Circuit's SX circuits without interfering with normal Mill conventional uranium ore processing. These enhancements are expected to be made, and the Phase 1 Circuit operational to accept MREC and similar intermediary REE products in 2027.

Based on the FS, the project is expected to have a modeled mine life of approximately 38 years and is projected to generate a post-tax, pre-debt net present value (<percent>10%</percent> discount rate) of approximately <money><money>$1.8 billion</money></money> and a post-tax internal rate of return of approximately <percent>25%</percent>, with the potential to ramp up to over <money><money>$500 million</money></money> of annual EBITDA and generate average annual free cash flow of approximately <money><money>$264 million</money></money> over the modeled mine life. Advancement of the Vara Mada Project remains subject to a positive FID, regulatory approvals and the resolution of outstanding fiscal and permitting matters with the Government of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/mg\">Madagascar</location>.<br/><br/>Since acquiring the Project, the Company has been in discussions with the Government of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/mg\">Madagascar</location> to establish the necessary legal regime to support development of the Project, which will be required before a positive FID can be made. These discussions have been focused on, among other things, mechanisms for achieving legal and fiscal stability, select tax and custom benefits, necessary adjustments to foreign exchange rules, protections from expropriation and access to international arbitration for dispute resolution. The Company has also been seeking clarification of existing procedures for adding monazite to the Project's mining permit, which currently allows for the production of ilmenite, rutile, and zircon. Recent discussions with the Government have focused on addressing these issues through an investment agreement to be approved by Parliament or through revisions to existing Malagasy law applicable to large-scale mining investments.<br/><br/>On October 17, 2025, a new President of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/mg\">Madagascar</location> was sworn in by the Country's High Constitutional Court following a period of social unrest and political instability that resulted in the removal of the Country's prior President. On October 20, 2025, a new Prime Minister was appointed, and on October 28, 2025, a new cabinet was announced. At this time, it is too early to determine whether and to what extent recent social and political developments in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/mg\">Madagascar</location> may impact the Vara Mada Project, whether positively or negatively, including with respect to the Project's development prospects or timelines, the ability to achieve suitable fiscal or other terms applicable to the Project or the ability to achieve a positive FID. These developments have not had an impact on the financial results of the Company at this time. The Company will continue to monitor events as they unfold.<br/><br/>There can be no assurance of achieving sufficient legal and fiscal stability or the timing thereof, or obtaining approval of the addition of monazite to the mining permit or the timing thereof. If such approvals are not obtained, or obtained on terms less favorable than expected, this could delay any FID in relation to the Vara Mada Project or prevent or otherwise have a significant effect on the development of the Vara Mada Project or ability to recover monazite from the Vara Mada Project.</li></ul><ul type=\"disc\"><li><b>Donald Project: </b>The Company continued to advance the Donald Project, a large monazite-rich HMS project in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location>, pursuant to its joint venture with Astron Corporation Limited.

(“MMLC”). The Merger was accounted for as an asset acquisition in accordance with ASC 805-50, Business Combinations — Related Issues. The consideration paid to MMLC’s shareholders was less than the aggregate fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the “purchase discount”). The purchase discount was allocated to the cost of MMLC investments acquired by us on a pro-rata basis based on their relative fair values as of the closing date. Immediately following the Merger with MMLC, we marked the investments to their respective fair values and, as a result, the purchase discount allocated to the cost basis of the investments acquired was immediately recognized as unrealized appreciation on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The purchase discount allocated to the loan investments acquired will amortize over the life of each respective loan through interest income, with a corresponding adjustment recorded as unrealized appreciation on such loan acquired through its ultimate disposition. The purchase discount allocated to equity investments acquired will not amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, we will recognize a realized gain with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"bwpadl0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"></td><td class=\"bwpadl0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> </td></tr><tr><td class=\"bwpadl0 bwvertalignt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"></td><td class=\"bwvertalignt bwpadl1\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">As a supplement to our financial results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States of America</location> (“GAAP”), we have provided, as detailed below, certain non-GAAP financial measures to our operating results that exclude the aforementioned purchase discount and the ongoing amortization thereof, as determined in accordance with GAAP.

Fosun International received the \"Certificate of Excellence in Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting\", underscoring the company's outstanding performance in ESG strategy, environmental protection, social responsibility, corporate governance and information disclosure, and its continued recognition by industry authorities.</p><p>Since its inception in 1973, the HKMA Best Annual Reports Awards has become a highly regarded benchmark in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong's</location> information disclosure landscape. It aims to award and recognize organizations for their achievement in annual report preparation.</p><p>A total of nine enterprises received the \"Certificate of Excellence in Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting\". Other award-winning companies include CLP Holdings, CK Hutchison Holdings, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, MTR Corporation, Swire Properties, Chow Tai Fook Jewellery, S.F. Holding, Lenovo Group, and The Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, all of which are prominent blue-chip listed companies.</p><p>HKMA pointed out that the award-winning companies have significantly enhanced ESG governance by incorporating ESG into their long-term development strategies and key future initiatives. They also align with international climate-related information disclosure standards such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), while demonstrating management's active engagement and strong commitment to ecosystems and biodiversity.</p><p>In 2023, Fosun established the \"Create IMPACT\" sustainable development strategy, built on six key pillars: Innovation-driven, Mindful Operation, People and Partner Oriented, Advanced Governance, Climate and Planet Positive and Transparency, to systematically integrate ESG principles into its business strategy.</p><p>I: Innovation-driven</p><p>M: Mindful Operation</p><p>P: People and Partner Oriented</p><p>A: Advanced Governance</p><p>C: Climate and Planet Positive</p><p>T: Transparency</p><p>Since its establishment in 1992, Fosun has developed into a global innovation-driven consumer group with businesses in more than 40 countries and regions. With the original aspiration of \"Self-improvement, Teamwork, Performance, and Contribution to Society\", Fosun remains committed to developing business for good. While advancing robust business development, Fosun continuously optimizes its sustainable development strategy to address profound shifts in the global economy, society, and environment, ensuring long-term competitiveness alongside social value creation.</p><p><b>Actively responding to climate change and promoting low-carbon transformation</b></p><p>In response to climate change challenges, the Group has transitioned from passive adaptation to proactive participation and innovation. At top-level governance, under the coordination of the Board of Directors (the \"Board\") and the Carbon Neutrality Committee, Fosun has achieved several key milestones, such as incorporating carbon neutrality indicators into the performance appraisal of the management, establishing a carbon emission management system and audit standards, and conducting greenhouse gas inventory training across the Group. In terms of technology-driven low-carbon transformation, the Group has accelerated the adoption of low-carbon technologies, leveraging innovative approaches to drive green transformation across its industrial chain and continuously provide sustainable products and services to consumers. In terms of financial innovation, In September 2025, Fosun held the signing ceremony in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong</location> for its three-year sustainability-linked syndicated loan. The total syndicated amount was further increased to <money>USD990 million</money> equivalent, setting a new record for the largest offshore syndicated loan by a Chinese private enterprise in 2025. This achievement has effectively supported the implementation of the Group's sustainable development strategy.</p><p>Fosun actively responds to the national \"dual carbon\" goals by promoting carbon neutrality, energy conservation and emission reduction. In 2021, Fosun made a commitment to society – \"strive to peak carbon emissions by 2028 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050\". Fosun has formulated strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation in support of the <i>Paris Agreement's</i> global temperature control framework. As Hong Kong Stock Exchange's New Climate Requirements came into effect in 2025, Fosun International further aligned with the International Financial Reporting Standards S2 Climate-related Disclosures Requirements (IFRS S2) and TCFD recommendations, and released its third Climate Information Disclosures Report, continuously enhancing the transparency of its climate initiatives and demonstrating its steadfast long-term commitment.</p><p>The Group also actively encourages its member companies to carry out climate actions. In 2022, the Bund Finance Center (BFC), Fosun's base in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..shangh\">Shanghai</location>, was awarded the LEED Platinum certification, which is hailed as the \"Oscar Award\" in the green building industry, with a score of 97 points to set a new world record. In August 2024, BFC was successfully included in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..shangh\">Shanghai's</location> first batch of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality pilot demonstration projects, making it the only large-scale commercial complex exceeding 200,000 square meters on the list.</p><p>During the 29th session of the Conference of the Parties (<money>COP29</money>), Fosun Insurance Portugal (Fidelidade), a member company of Fosun, launched the Impact Center for Climate Change (ICCC), a platform for the study, research and sharing of knowledge with society, to drive innovation in climate risk knowledge and enhance the insurance industry's climate resilience. In February 2026, the ICCC held its annual Climate Research and Industry Exchange Conference, unveiling <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/pt\">Portugal's</location> first innovative study on forest fire risks to translate climate science into practical insurance risk management.</p><p><b>Actively driving global sustainable development and achieving outstanding ESG ratings</b></p><p>With a focus on core business development, Fosun leverages its comprehensive global industrial ecosystem to conduct responsible operations across more than 40 countries and regions, continuously contributing to public welfare and creating sustainable value worldwide. In addition, Fosun has long been committed to philanthropy in areas such as rural revitalization, healthcare, educational equity, community building, culture and art, steadily expanding its community impact and striving to build a more responsible, inclusive and sustainable future.</p><p>As a responsible global citizen, Fosun officially joined the United Nations Global Compact (\"UN Global Compact\") in 2014. It fully supports the ten principles of the UN Global Compact on human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption, and has deeply integrated these principles into the Group's sustainable development strategy and code of conduct. Despite persistent global macroeconomic uncertainties, Fosun remains steadfast in advancing its sustainable development, fulfilling its long-term commitments on key issues and earning continued international recognition.</p><p>Fosun International's ongoing efforts have earned growing recognition from international rating agencies for its ESG management. Fosun has been included in the FTSE4Good Index Series for five consecutive years and has maintained its HSI ESG rating at AA-. In 2025, Fosun's FTSE Russell ESG score rose to 4.2. It also ranked in the top <percent>5%</percent> among global peers in S&amp;P Global's Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA), was included in S&amp;P Global's Sustainability Yearbook 2025 (Global Edition), and was selected as the top <percent>1%</percent> in S&amp;P Global's Sustainability Yearbook (China Edition).</p><p>SOURCE Fosun</p></div></article>",
