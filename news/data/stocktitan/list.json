            "title": "Worksport Is \"Showing Its Work\" as 2026 Momentum Targets Record-Setting Performance | WKSP Stock News",
            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><strong id=\"dateline\">WEST SENECA, NY / <a href=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ACCESS Newswire</a> / February 27, 2026 / </strong>Projections often capture attention. Measurable progress builds confidence.</p><p>At Worksport Ltd. (\"Worksport\" or the \"Company\") <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3h3\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">(NASDAQ:<u>WKSP</u>)</a>, the sequence of developments extending back through Q4 2025 reflects the latter principle. This is not a company relying on narrative alone. It's increasingly demonstrating execution alongside opportunity. As 2026 begins, the emphasis is clear: documented milestones and operational advancement are taking precedence over distant ambition.</p><p>That tone was established before the new year even turned. In December 2025, Worksport reported that November <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3h4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>revenue</u></a> marked the highest monthly total in Company history, creating a record baseline entering 2026. A single month does not define a trajectory, but it can reveal acceleration. When revenue peaks within a compressed timeframe, it often signals traction building beneath the surface, which can show up in broader quarterly performances.</p><p>Against that backdrop, the early 2026 announcements read less like routine updates and more like coordinated steps within a structured expansion.</p><p><strong>Growth Through Intention</strong></p><p>On January 27, Worksport's subsidiary <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3h5\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>Terravis Energy</u></a> selected a major Asian manufacturing partner for its Aetherlux heat pump platform with Zerofrost anti-frosting technology. The move was less about headlines and more about infrastructure. Clean energy hardware does not scale on concept alone. It requires supply chain alignment, cost discipline, and production readiness. By securing manufacturing capacity ahead of broader commercialization, Worksport signaled preparation and a willingness to lay foundational infrastructure before expanding market visibility.</p><p>Then, on February 3, the Company announced a strategic <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3h6\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>partnership</u></a> with Potomac International Partners to accelerate federal government and commercial market engagement for its clean energy ecosystem. Federal procurement is structured, compliance-driven, and relationship-based. Rather than attempting to navigate that terrain independently, Worksport aligned with a partner designed to open institutional doors. The SOLIS solar system, COR portable energy platform, and Aetherlux heat pump technology are now positioned within structured procurement conversations.</p><p>Momentum is far more compelling when numbers support it.</p><p><strong>Record-Setting Revenues Posted</strong></p><p>On February 11, Worksport <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3h7\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>reported</u></a> Q4 revenue growth of <percent>65%</percent> year over year, with gross profit increasing <percent>380%</percent>. Full-year revenue climbed <percent>91%</percent> to approximately <money>$16.2 million</money>, and gross margins expanded into the low <percent>30%</percent> range. Revenue growth draws attention. Margin expansion commands respect. Together, they indicate that scaling efforts are not occurring at the expense of discipline. In other words, operational leverage appears to be emerging alongside expansion.</p><p>The next development added another layer. On February 12, Worksport <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3h8\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>confirmed</u></a> that a government entity is evaluating its Aetherlux Pro heat pump, with AHRI and ENERGY STAR certification processes continuing to advance. Government evaluation is not casual engagement. It involves technical scrutiny, regulatory review, and structured assessment. While outcomes remain subject to process, the engagement itself signals that the technology is being tested within serious institutional channels.</p><p>That momentum carried forward on February 19, when Worksport secured key <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3h9\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>certifications</u></a> for its COR portable energy system, including transport and federal compliance approvals. The Company indicated that final UL and CSA certifications are expected within the first quarter of 2026. Those certifications are often prerequisites for large-scale retail and enterprise distribution, again showing that commercialization gates are being addressed in accretive sequence.</p><p>Viewed collectively, the pattern becomes harder to dismiss. Revenue momentum. Manufacturing readiness. Federal channel access. Certification advancement. Margin expansion. These are not disconnected headlines. They represent synchronized movement across production, distribution, compliance, and financial performance.</p><p>Worksport's broader 2026 business <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3ha\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>update</u></a> reinforces that alignment. Management has stated that clean energy products are shipping, that OEM and major distribution discussions are progressing, and that growth is expected to continue in 2026 - language that reflects forward movement supported by visible operational steps.</p><p><strong>Summing The Parts</strong></p><p>It's also important to remember the foundation beneath this expansion. Worksport's core automotive accessory business, particularly tonneau covers, continues to contribute revenue stability. The SOLIS solar integration platform, COR portable energy system, and Aetherlux heat pump portfolio are not replacements. They are extensions. The Company is layering clean energy capabilities onto an existing operational base rather than attempting to build from scratch.</p><p>Market opportunity narratives, including references to multibillion-dollar industry segments, only carry weight when paired with tangible advancement. What distinguishes Worksport's current phase is that incremental barriers are being addressed methodically. Production alignment reduces supply risk. Certifications reduce compliance friction. Institutional evaluation adds credibility. Margin expansion suggests scalability.</p><p>Taken together, the progression suggests coordination between strategy and execution. Moreover, Worksport's updates show it's not merely outlining where it intends to go in 2026. It's describing the intermediate steps designed to support that trajectory. For observers evaluating emerging clean energy participants within the small-cap landscape, the distinction between aspiration and implementation matters.</p><p>As importantly, Worksport's first-quarter developments continue to reflect a company intent on showing its work as it provides answers to serve multiple market opportunities. In a market environment that increasingly values operational clarity and disciplined advancement, that distinction could prove meaningful.</p><p><strong>About Worksport</strong></p><p>Worksport Ltd. (Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/WKSP/\" title=\"View WKSP stock overview\">WKSP</a>), through its subsidiaries, designs, develops, manufactures, and owns the intellectual property on a variety of tonneau covers, solar integrations, portable power systems, and clean heating &amp; cooling solutions.

Hole PGC-25-006 is important, as it suggests Moosehead may be part of a broader mineralized system rather than an isolated zone. We are still in the early stages, but the combination of high-grade intercepts and new zone discovery gives us real confidence in the scale potential at Treasure Island. In exploration, sometimes you intersect broad zones and sometimes you intersect narrow high-grade veins that point you toward something much larger. Both are important, and these first holes confirm we have a gold-bearing system and a structural model that is working. We are excited about what the coming weeks and months of drilling may deliver,\" said Denis Laviolette, Executive Chairman &amp; CEO.</i></p><p>Greg Matheson, VP Exploration, added:</p><p><i>\"Step-out drilling along the Moosehead Eastern and Western trends has yielded strong high-grade assay results as we continue to expand the footprint of these sub-parallel structures. Five of the first six holes reported from Moosehead intersected high-grade gold, confirming both the strength and continuity of the system. These intercepts remain relatively shallow for an orogenic gold environment, and we see significant room for growth along both fault structures. The announcement last week of a newly discovered vein linking the Eastern and Western trends is important and adds a new element to the potential for additional new zones as the drilling continues.</i></p><p><i>\"While much of the drilling to date has focused on expanding the known Moosehead trends, we believe the broader opportunity lies in testing near-surface geophysical targets across the property. We're truly excited by the success in drill hole PGC-25-006 and plan to not only further define this new zone but continue the hunt for additional new discoveries. With more than 50 kilometres of comparable geology and structural setting across Treasure Island North, we believe we are only beginning to unlock the district-scale potential of this system.\" </i></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/6079/285609_829c944b24f7ead5_001full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

This represents a new discovery and remains wide open as additional follow up drilling is underway.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/6079/285609_829c944b24f7ead5_002full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

The European Commission's decision is expected in the next one to two months.</p><p>The positive CHMP opinion is supported by 36-week data from the Phase 3 BRAVE-AA-PEDS study evaluating the safety and efficacy of once-daily, oral Olumiant compared with placebo in the cohort of patients ages 12 to under 18.

The increase in total revenue was due primarily to performance bonuses earned during the fourth quarter of 2025, as well as higher wholesale capacity services revenue resulting from additional service fees associated with the reimbursement of network-related costs.</p><p>Revenue was also impacted favorably by (1) an increase in Commercial IoT related revenue due to higher average subscribers and device sales, which was offset partially by a decline in Duplex and SPOT driven revenue due to subscriber churn; and (2) revenue recognized under our service agreement with Parsons Corporation as we moved beyond the proof of concept phase during 2025, which was offset by a decrease in revenue from XCOM RAN sales.</p><p><i>Loss from Operations</i></p><p>Loss from operations was <money><money>$0.4 million</money></money> during the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to a loss from operations of <money><money>$4.2 million</money></money> during the prior year's fourth quarter. This improvement was due to higher revenue (as discussed above) offset partially by an increase in operating expenses (as discussed below).</p><p>During the fourth quarter of 2025, higher cost of services, marketing, general and administrative (\"MG&amp;A\") expenses and cost of subscriber equipment sales were offset partially by lower stock-based compensation expenses. Higher cost of services resulted primarily from network operating costs to support the build out of our next-generation satellite and ground network infrastructure, a significant portion of which are reimbursed to us, and this consideration is recognized as revenue. Additionally, costs increased to support the development of XCOM RAN technology and new MSS products. MG&amp;A expense was higher than the prior year's fourth quarter due primarily to legal and professional fees.</p><p>The cost of subscriber equipment sales increased during the fourth quarter of 2025 due to higher hardware sales as well as <money><money>$1.1 million</money></money> in expense related to tariffs on equipment imported and re-exported to foreign subsidiaries. These tariffs were previously recorded as recoverable duty drawbacks but are no longer deemed probable of being refunded.</p><p><i>Net Loss</i></p><p>Net loss was <money><money>$11.6 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to net loss of <money><money>$50.2 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2024. This improvement was due primarily to a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the paydown of the 2023 <percent>13%</percent> Notes recorded during the fourth quarter of 2024. Favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to the remeasurement of intercompany balances as well as a non-cash gain on the quarterly mark-to-market adjustment of our derivative asset gain were offset by higher interest expense resulting from our recognition of non-cash imputed interest related to the 2024 Prepayment Agreement (as defined in our periodic reports).</p><p><i>Adjusted EBITDA</i></p><p>Adjusted EBITDA increased to <money><money>$32.4 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to <money><money>$30.4 million</money></money> for the same period in 2024. This <percent>7%</percent> increase was due to an increase in revenue of <money><money>$10.8 million</money></money> offset partially by a <money><money>$8.8 million</money></money> increase in operating expenses (excluding adjustments for non-cash or non-recurring items).</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information, refer to “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA.”</p><p><b>ANNUAL FINANCIAL REVIEW</b></p><p><i>Revenue</i></p><p>Total revenue was <money><money>$273.0 million</money></money> during the twelve months ended December 31, 2025, including <money><money>$257.3 million</money></money> of service revenue and <money><money>$15.7 million</money></money> of revenue generated from subscriber equipment sales. Total revenue increased <percent>9%</percent> from 2024, reaching a record high for the fourth consecutive year. This increase was due to higher service revenue and higher revenue from subscriber equipment sales.</p><p>Service revenue increased <money><money>$19.6 million</money></money>, or <percent>8%</percent>, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024 due to increases in wholesale capacity services. Revenue from subscriber equipment sales increased <money><money>$3.0 million</money></money>, or <percent>24%</percent>, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024 due to a higher volume of Commercial IoT device sales.</p><p><i>Income (Loss) from Operations</i></p><p>Income from operations was <money><money>$7.4 million</money></money> during 2025 compared to loss from operations of <money><money>$0.9 million</money></money> during 2024 due to higher revenue (as discussed above) offset partially by higher operating expenses (as discussed below).</p><p>Higher cost of services, MG&amp;A expense and cost of subscriber equipment sales were offset partially by lower stock-based compensation expenses. A non-cash loss on disposal of assets during the first quarter of 2025 also increased operating expenses. The drivers of higher cost of services, MG&amp;A expense and cost of subscriber equipment sales for the full year 2025 compared to 2024 are generally consistent with the quarterly increases noted above. Costs incurred to enhance and develop our XCOM RAN product and service offerings were also impacted by our recognition of certain non-cash amortized costs beginning in May 2024.</p><p>Operating expenses were partially offset by employee retention credits received in 2025 as a result of our eligibility under the provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act for 2021. The total credits of <money><money>$3.9 million</money></money> reduced operating expenses during 2025, of which <money><money>$2.7 million</money></money> was allocated to cost of services and <money><money>$1.2 million</money></money> was allocated to MG&amp;A expense, based on the employee costs incurred during the eligible period.</p><p><i>Net Loss</i></p><p>Net loss was <money><money>$8.7 million</money></money> for 2025 compared to <money><money>$63.2 million</money></money> for 2024. This improvement was due primarily to higher revenue (discussed above), net foreign currency gains due to the remeasurement of intercompany balances and non-cash gains on the quarterly mark-to-market adjustment of our derivative asset. This improvement was also due to a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the paydown of the 2023 <percent>13%</percent> Notes recorded during the fourth quarter of 2024. These favorable items were offset partially by higher operating expenses (discussed above) as well as higher interest expense resulting from our recognition of non-cash imputed interest related to the 2024 Prepayment Agreement.</p><p><i>Adjusted EBITDA</i></p><p>Adjusted EBITDA was <money><money>$136.1 million</money></money> in 2025, reaching a record high for the Company and representing a margin of <percent>50%</percent>. This increase from 2024 was due to a <money><money>$22.6 million</money></money> increase in total revenue (for reasons previously discussed), offset partially by a <money><money>$21.9 million</money></money> increase in operating expenses (excluding adjustments for non-cash or non-recurring items) primarily due to investment in growth opportunities. Specifically, while we continue to enhance and develop our XCOM RAN product and service offerings, we incur costs, primarily for personnel, in advance of significant revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information, refer to “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA.\"</p><p><i>Liquidity</i></p><p>As of December 31, 2025, we held cash and cash equivalents of <money><money>$447.5 million</money></money>, compared to <money><money>$391.2 million</money></money> as of December 31, 2024.</p><p>During 2025, net cash flows generated from operations were <money><money>$621.7 million</money></money>, capital expenditures were <money><money>$550.4 million</money></money> and net cash flows used in financing activities were <money><money>$16.2 million</money></money>. Cash and cash equivalents were also positively impacted by a <money><money>$1.2 million</money></money> change in foreign currency exchange rates. Operating cash flows during 2025 included <money><money>$430.6 million</money></money> received in connection with the Infrastructure Prepayment and other cash flows generated from the business. Capital expenditures were primarily associated with our commitments under the Updated Services Agreements related to the deployment of the replacement satellites and Extended MSS Network.</p><p>Adjusted free cash flow during 2025 was <money><money>$171.5 million</money></money> compared to <money><money>$131.9 million</money></money> during 2024. This increase primarily includes <money><money>$45.0 million</money></money> in accelerated service payments received during 2025 as well as higher service payments received pursuant to the Updated Services Agreements, offset partially by higher operating costs (as discussed above). Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information, refer to \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted Free Cash Flow\".</p><p>The principal amount of our debt was <money><money>$410.0 million</money></money> at December 31, 2025, compared to <money><money>$417.5 million</money></money> at December 31, 2024. This decrease was due to scheduled recoupments of <money><money>$34.6 million</money></money> under the 2021 Funding Agreement, offset partially by the issuance of <money><money>$27.1 million</money></money> of debt under the 2023 Funding Agreement in August 2025.</p><p>(Capitalized terms not defined in this release have the meanings ascribed to them in our periodic reports)</p><p><b>FINANCIAL GUIDANCE</b></p><p>Our financial guidance for 2026 is as follows:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Total revenue between <money><money>$280 million</money></money> and <money><money>$305 million</money></money></li><li>Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately <percent>50%</percent></li></ul><p><b>CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION</b></p><p>The Company will host a conference call to discuss its results at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) on Friday, February 27, 2026.

These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” \"might,\" \"could,\" “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that could cause or contribute to such differences include, without limitation, those described under Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as may be further updated by subsequent filings with the SEC. Further, new risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risk factors, nor can we accurately assess the ultimate impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to amounts reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are provided in this press release. For forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA margin, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable effort because estimating such GAAP measures and providing a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and requires a level of precision that is unavailable for these future periods and the information needed to reconcile these measures is dependent upon future events, many of which are outside of our control as described above.

before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, accretion and derivative (gains)/losses. Adjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash compensation expense, reduction in the value of assets, foreign exchange (gains)/losses, and certain other non-cash or non-recurring charges as applicable. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to manage the Company's business and to compare its results more closely to the results of its peers. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measurements, such as net loss. These terms, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.</p><p class=\"bwcellpmargin\"> </p><p class=\"bwcellpmargin\">The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measurement of its operating performance. The Company believes it best reflects changes across time in the Company's performance, including the effects of pricing, cost control and other operational decisions. The Company's management uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of its annual operating budget. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA also is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies in similar industries. As indicated, Adjusted EBITDA does not include interest expense on borrowed money or depreciation expense on our capital assets or the payment of income taxes, which are necessary elements of the Company's operations. Because Adjusted EBITDA does not account for these expenses, its utility as a measure of the Company's operating performance has material limitations. Because of these limitations, the Company's management does not view Adjusted EBITDA in isolation and also uses other measurements, such as revenues and operating profit, to measure operating performance.</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"bwpadl0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"></td><td class=\"bwpadl0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"></td><td class=\"bwpadl0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> </td></tr><tr><td class=\"bwpadl0 bwpadr0 bwvertalignt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"bwalignr bwcellpmargin\">(2)</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"></td><td class=\"bwvertalignt bwpadl0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"bwcellpmargin\">In connection with the License Agreement with XCOM, the Company entered into a Support Services Agreement (the “SSA”).

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 27, 2026) - Couloir Capital is pleased to announce that it has updated its research coverage on North Peak Resources Ltd.  (TSXV: NPR) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/NPRLF/\" title=\"View NPRLF stock overview\">NPRLF</a>) (or \"Company\").   Couloir Capital's Senior Mining analyst, Ron Wortel, MBA, P.Eng., QP, crafted a report titled \"Drilling targeting resource development and regional consolidation, driving interest in this Nevada explorer.\"   </p><p>Report excerpt: \"We are updating our coverage of North Peak Resources as it is systematically advancing its flagship Prospect Mountain project toward an initial, near-surface gold resource by expanding and linking mineralization northward between known high-grade trends. Recent results from the first six holes (807 m) of the Wabash/Industry Tunnel drill program demonstrate this strategy in action, with encouraging halo mineralization intersected between the Wabash and Williams lodes, including 42.67 m @ 0.82 g/t Gold and 99.06 m @ 0.56 g/t Gold and the discovery of a new gold-bearing zone along the Silver Connor fault. These results not only extend the mineralized envelope northward but also illustrate that the Company is expanding a continuous mineralized system with both depth and strike potential, rather than merely chasing isolated high-grade hits.</p><p>Beyond the northern area, North Peak has identified a second near-surface resource opportunity at Lower PME, located at the base of the mountain and interpreted to host the Hamburg/Dunderberg contact under cover. This structure corresponds to the same fault zone that McEwen Mining is actively advancing, targeting a resource in H1 2026.  McEwen's regional consolidation, most recently involving Golden Lake Exploration, now places North Peak between McEwen and i-80 Gold, both of whom are investing heavily in delineation and development across the camp. Importantly, North Peak's Lower PME target represents a down-dip extension of the system that remains open at depth.\"</p><p>The report can be accessed through Couloir Capital's portal:  <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/y4vJOHbZGX\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.couloircapital.com/research-portal</a>.  </p><p><b>About Couloir Capital Ltd.</b></p><p>Couloir Capital Ltd. is an investment research firm with a team of experienced investment professionals providing institutional-quality research coverage for small-cap equities.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p> <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.wakefi\">WAKEFIELD, Mass.</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Franklin Street Properties Corp. (the “Company”, “FSP”, “our” or “we”) (NYSE American: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/FSP/\" title=\"View FSP stock overview\">FSP</a>) announced today that it has closed a <money><money>$320 million</money></money> secured credit facility (the “Facility”) with an affiliate of TPG Credit (the “Lender”). The Company repaid in full all of its outstanding <money><money>$248.9 million</money></money> aggregate principal amount of indebtedness in an initial drawdown of <money><money>$258.5 million</money></money> under the Facility, net of original issue discount of <money><money>$16.5 million</money></money> (the “Initial Term Loans”). The Facility includes up to <money><money>$45 million</money></money> of delayed draw term loans, which, subject to certain conditions, will be used to fund tenant improvements, leasing commissions, building improvements and other uses approved by the Lender (“Delayed Draw Term Loans”) and contains customary covenants. Alter Domus (US) LLC will act as administrative agent for the Facility.</p><p>A summary of key terms is below:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Aggregate principal amount <money><money>$320 million</money></money> (including both the Initial Term Loans and the Delayed Draw Term Loans).</li><li>Original stated maturity of February 26, 2029.</li><li>Initial coupon rate of <percent>9.0%</percent>.</li><li>An exit fee of <percent>4.0%</percent> of the funded amount of the loans due upon repayment.</li><li>The maturity date is subject to potential extension of up to one year at the option of the Company, subject to certain conditions.</li><li>Collateral consisting of a first priority lien on substantially all assets of the Company.</li></ul><p><a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/FSP/\" title=\"View FSP stock overview\">FSP</a> was represented by Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP and Stifel.

Carter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/FSP/\" title=\"View FSP stock overview\">FSP</a>, said, “After considering a number of different potential strategic alternatives in consultation with our professional advisors, we concluded that refinancing our outstanding indebtedness was the best alternative available to us at this time. In addition, the Delayed Draw Term Loan feature of the Facility provides additional flexibility to allow us to lease additional space in our existing portfolio, which could enhance future value. We are pleased to have TPG as a strategic lending partner and look forward to building a long-term relationship with them.</p><p>However, now that our near-term debt maturity has been addressed, we are continuing our review of potential strategic alternatives. Our Board of Directors and management team remain deeply committed to continuing to explore ways to maximize shareholder value. We believe that having successfully addressed our near-term debt maturities has reduced a significant source of near-term uncertainty and avoided having to make forced or suboptimal decisions, enabling us to focus on executing property-level initiatives in what continues to be an uneven office market environment. We believe this approach best positions the Company to navigate current market conditions while preserving maximum strategic flexibility. We look forward to continuing to update the market as and when appropriate.”</p><p>David Busker, Managing Director and Head of Commercial Real Estate Debt, TPG Credit, said “We are pleased to partner with Franklin Street Properties to provide a tailored capital solution that provides the financial flexibility needed to navigate the current market.

            "title": "Restart Life Sciences Closes Acquisition of Holy Crap Foods | NMLSF Stock News",
            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 27, 2026) - Restart Life Sciences Corp. (CSE: HEAL) (FSE: HN30) (OTC Pink: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/NMLSF/\" title=\"View NMLSF stock overview\">NMLSF</a>) (\"Restart Life\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that it has successfully closed the previously announced acquisition of <percent>100%</percent> of the issued and outstanding shares of Holy Crap Foods Inc. (\"Holy Crap\") pursuant to the deﬁnitive agreement dated February 12, 2026, among the Company, Happy Belly Coffee Inc., a subsidiary of Happy Belly Food Group Inc. (CSE: HBFG), and Holy Crap (the \"Acquisition\").</p><p>Effective as of the closing date of the transaction, the Acquisition adds in excess of <money>$1 million</money> in annualized revenue to Restart Life, marking a signiﬁcant milestone in the Company's evolution and immediately establishing Restart Life as a revenue-producing organization.</p><p>This milestone transaction represents a strategic inﬂection point for Restart Life, providing a foundational operating platform from which to execute its broader growth strategy within the health and wellness sector.</p><p>The Acquisition represents a comprehensive transfer of the entire Holy Crap business ecosystem. It includes the full Holy Crap portfolio of brands and product lines, together with all associated trademarks, proprietary formulations, trade secrets, intellectual property, packaging designs, marketing assets, digital infrastructure, and established goodwill. The transaction also encompasses longstanding retail and distributor relationships, direct-to-consumer channels, customer data, supplier agreements, and all ﬁnished goods, raw materials, packaging components, and work-in-progress inventory, ensuring operational continuity from day one.</p><p>Central to the Acquisition is Holy Crap's dedicated manufacturing operation located in Gibsons, British Columbia. The Gibsons facility, which operates under a lease agreement, serves as the primary production and fulﬁllment hub for the brand's product lines. The site includes established blending and batching systems, production lines, packaging infrastructure, warehousing capacity, food safety and quality assurance programs, and trained operational personnel. Management believes this turnkey manufacturing platform provides immediate production stability with proven throughput capacity and built-in scalability to support distribution expansion and future product innovation. By acquiring a fully functioning manufacturing footprint, Restart Life minimizes near-term capital expenditure requirements, reduces integration risk, and preserves ﬁnancial ﬂexibility while maintaining the operational backbone necessary to execute its strategic growth initiatives.</p><p>Founded in 2009, Holy Crap was originally launched under the name \"Hapi Food\" with a mission to address food allergies and provide clean, simple ingredient nutrition. The brand achieved national recognition after appearing on CBC's Dragon's Den in 2010, where overwhelming consumer demand generated approximately <money>$1 million</money> in sales virtually overnight, ﬁrmly establishing Holy Crap as a breakout success story in the natural foods space.</p><p>The brand's rapid rise continued later that year when its products were featured during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. In a milestone few food brands can claim, Holy Crap cereal was also selected to be enjoyed by astronauts aboard the International Space Station, a testament to its nutritional proﬁle, quality standards, and broad appeal.</p><p>Effective upon closing, Holy Crap now operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of Restart Life. The Company intends to maintain existing operations at the Gibsons facility and work collaboratively with the current management and production team to ensure seamless continuity while identifying operational efﬁciencies and measured expansion opportunities.</p><p>Members of the Restart Life team conducted an in-person visit and operational tour of the Gibsons manufacturing facility, meeting directly with management and staff to review operations and discuss next phase growth initiatives. The Company extends its sincere appreciation to the Holy Crap team for their professionalism, experience, and continued dedication to the brand, which has been instrumental in building its loyal customer base and strong market reputation.</p><p>With the transaction complete, Restart Life is actively executing on a disciplined strategic growth plan focused on expanding distribution channels, enhancing operational efﬁciencies, and evaluating new product development opportunities. The Company intends to leverage Holy Crap's established revenue base, embedded customer relationships, and in-house manufacturing capabilities as the cornerstone of its expansion strategy, supporting both organic growth and potential future brand development initiatives.</p><p>Consumers and investors are encouraged to visit HolyCrap.com to learn more about the product line and experience ﬁrsthand the functional cereal that has built a loyal following across North America. For a limited time, customers will receive a free bag with every order, providing an opportunity to get familiar with a product that truly delivers on its promise of simple ingredients and real results.</p><p>Steve Loutskou, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer of Restart Life, commented, \"We are excited to ofﬁcially welcome Holy Crap to Restart Life. Over the past several weeks, our team has been working diligently behind the scenes on product research and development from every angle, from formulation and nutrition science to operations and scalability. What we have acquired is not just a brand, but a fully integrated operating business with strong infrastructure and signiﬁcant growth potential. We are energized to work alongside Holy Crap's passionate and dedicated team to enhance, expand, and elevate the brand to new levels. With closing complete, our focus now turns to disciplined execution and strategic growth from this solid foundation.\"</p><p>Restart Life would like to thank its shareholders for their ongoing support as the Company advances its mission and continues to execute on its strategy.</p><p><b>About Holy Crap Foods Inc.</b><br/>Holy Crap Cereal, a Holy Crap brand, is a premium breakfast brand known for its delicious, nutrient-dense cereals made with simple, wholesome ingredients.

Viewed more broadly, approximately <percent>91%</percent> of the NAV reduction was tied to investments that were underwritten in 2021 or earlier. Certain of these businesses benefited from high levels of pandemic-era demand but have since seen results soften. In addition, because these investments were originated in a low base-rate environment, several have struggled to adapt to a period of sustained higher interest rates.</p><p>The Company’s highest near-term priority is to improve portfolio credit quality by working diligently to resolve challenged credits. At the same time, it continues to execute on the refined investment strategy described last year, including deploying capital selectively into senior-secured, first-lien loans, maintaining a well-diversified portfolio, and fully leveraging the resources of BlackRock’s platform.</p><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwwidth100 bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl\"><tr><td class=\"bwpadl0\"

On March 18, 2024, the Company completed its previously announced merger with BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation (\"Merger\"). The Merger has been accounted for as an asset acquisition of BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation (\"BCIC\") by the Company in accordance with the asset acquisition method of accounting as detailed in ASC 805-50 (\"ASC 805\"), Business Combinations-Related Issues. The Company determined the fair value of the shares of the Company's common stock that were issued to former BCIC shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement plus transaction costs to be the consideration paid in connection with the Merger under ASC 805. The consideration paid to BCIC shareholders was less than the aggregate fair values of the BCIC assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the “purchase discount”). The consideration paid was allocated to the individual BCIC assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair values of net identifiable assets acquired other than “non-qualifying” assets and liabilities (for example, cash) and did not give rise to goodwill. As a result, the purchase discount was allocated to the cost basis of the BCIC investments acquired by the Company on a pro-rata basis based on their relative fair values as of the effective time of the Merger. Immediately following the Merger, the investments were marked to their respective fair values in accordance with ASC 820 which resulted in immediate recognition of net unrealized appreciation in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a result of the Merger. The purchase discount allocated to the BCIC debt investments acquired will amortize over the remaining life of each respective debt investment through interest income, with a corresponding adjustment recorded to unrealized appreciation or depreciation on such investment acquired through its ultimate disposition. The purchase discount allocated to BCIC equity investments acquired will not amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, the Company may recognize a realized gain or loss with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired.</p></td></tr></table><p>As a supplement to the Company’s reported GAAP financial measures, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>“Adjusted net investment income” – excludes the amortization of purchase accounting discount from net investment income calculated in accordance with GAAP;</li><li>“Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss)” – excludes the unrealized appreciation resulting from the purchase discount and the corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation from the amortization of the purchase discount from the determination of net realized and unrealized gain (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP; and</li><li>“Adjusted net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations” – calculates net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations based on Adjusted net investment income and Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss).</li></ul><p>We believe that the adjustment to exclude the full effect of purchase discount accounting under ASC 805 from these financial measures is meaningful because of the potential impact on the comparability of these financial measures that we and investors use to assess our financial condition and results of operations period over period. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are intended to enhance investors’ understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP.

For the three months ended December 31, 2025, approximately <money><money>$0.4 million</money></money> of cash distributions were reinvested for electing participants through purchase of shares in the open market in accordance with the terms of the DRIP.</p><p>On April 29, 2025, our Board of Directors re-approved our stock repurchase plan to acquire up to <money><money>$50.0 million</money></money>
