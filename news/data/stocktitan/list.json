Marcus, chief executive officer of Marcus Corporation. “During the fourth quarter, our theatre division benefitted from strong performances from family films and several blockbusters across genres that performed well in our markets. Consumers continued to show demand for out-of-home entertainment experiences, with a wide variety of great movies bringing audiences to the big screen at Marcus Theatres during the holiday season. We are excited for a 2026 film slate that includes several family films and some of the biggest movie franchises. In our hotel division, stable leisure demand and strong group bookings contributed to a year of record revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, with our newly renovated properties driving our outperformance in both the fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2025. The positive impact of the strategic reinvestments made over the past few years will continue to position Marcus Hotels &amp; Resorts well for both the near- and long-term, as our renovated assets continue to win in their markets. As we look ahead to fiscal 2026 and beyond, we expect the building momentum in both businesses to be sustained by our long-standing commitment to operational excellence, the resiliency of our balance sheet, and the unwavering dedication of our valued associates.”</p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2025 Highlights</span></b></p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Total revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 were <money><money>$193.5 million</money></money>, a <percent>2.8%</percent> increase from total revenues of <money><money>$188.3 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.

Evans, president of Marcus Hotels &amp; Resorts. “Our newly renovated assets contributed meaningfully to our outperformance in both the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2025 thanks to stable leisure demand and continued strong group bookings.

The company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) attributable to Marcus Corporation before investment income or loss, interest expense, other expense, gain or loss on disposition of property, equipment and other assets, equity earnings or losses from unconsolidated joint ventures, net earnings or losses attributable to noncontrolling interests, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and non-cash share-based compensation expense, adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the company does not consider indicative of its core operating performance. A reconciliation of this measure to the equivalent measure under GAAP, along with reconciliations of this measure for each of our operating segments, are set forth in the attached table.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management and the company’s board of directors to assess the company’s financial performance and enterprise value. The company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure, as it eliminates certain expenses and gains that are not indicative of the company’s core operating performance and facilitates a comparison of the company’s core operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period. The company also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a basis to determine certain annual cash bonuses and long-term incentive awards, to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, and to compare its performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by analysts, investors and other interested parties as a performance measure to evaluate industry competitors.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure of the company’s financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings (loss) as a measure of financial performance, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and it should not be construed as an inference that the company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or free cash flow for management’s discretionary use. In addition, this non-GAAP measure excludes certain non-recurring and other charges and has its limitations as an analytical tool. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company’s results as reported under GAAP. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the company will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the items eliminated in the adjustments made to determine Adjusted EBITDA, such as acquisition expenses, preopening expenses, accelerated depreciation, impairment charges and other adjustments. The company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that the company’s future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Definitions and calculations of Adjusted EBITDA differ among companies in our industries, and therefore Adjusted EBITDA disclosed by the company may not be comparable to the measures disclosed by other companies.</p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">About Marcus Corporation</span></b></p><p>Headquartered in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.milkee\">Milwaukee</location>, <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marcuscorp.com%2Foverview%2Fdefault.aspx&amp;esheet=54434096&amp;newsitemid=20260225045975&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Marcus+Corporation&amp;index=5&amp;md5=bc2637c0f934c6ed7c3ba776d2436d88\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">Marcus Corporation </a>is a leader in the entertainment and hospitality industries, with significant company-owned real estate assets.

(TSXV: RLYG) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/RLYGF/\" title=\"View RLYGF stock overview\">RLYGF</a>)</b> (\"<b>Riley Gold</b>\" or the \"<b>Company</b>\") is pleased to provide an exciting exploration update for the Company's Pipeline West/Clipper Gold Project (\"<b>PWC</b>\") located in the Cortez mining district of the Battle Mountain - Eureka Trend.  PWC is operated by Kinross Gold U.S.A., Inc. (\"<b>Kinross</b>\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Kinross Gold Corporation (TSX: K) (NYSE: KGC), under an exploration earn-in agreement executed in March 2024</p><p><b>PWC 2026 Exploration Program</b> - In addition to the new successful geochemical soil survey results highlighting a new gold in soil anomalies being announced today, there are other exploration and drill targeting tools being deployed. A seismic survey is planned to aid in structural identification of high angle faults that could be the source of the gold at surface from the previous and new geochemical surveys. New surface geochemistry and geophysical datasets will be integrated to inform drill targeting and is expected to begin in the Spring as part of Kinross' committed next phase of exploration at PWC for 2026. </p><p>Mr. Todd Hilditch, CEO of Riley Gold commented \"We are pleased with the iterative successful steps our partner Kinross is taking in order to find another gold deposit in this District. The drilling results announced in November (2025), have confirmed a source for the surface Carlin-type gold and trace element soil anomalies. There is also evidence in the upper plate of leakage of Carlin-type hydrothermal fluids along high-angle brittle faults and confirmation of disseminated Carlin-type mineralization in lower plate carbonate rocks at depth. Today's news of a successful and additional 2 km extension of surface gold in soils further confirms an even more robust structural system and setting for these Carlin-type fluids being present at PWC. This geologic setting is consistent to what is observed peripheral to the Fourmile deposits where surface gold in soils were present and were extremely useful in their discovery\".</p><p><u><b>New Successful Geochemical Soil Survey Results   </b></u></p><p>The new geochemical soil survey was completed after the 2025 drill campaign, expanding the previous soil survey coverage to the north, west and more significantly to the south and southwest. The survey was designed in order to fully delineate the previous and existing +3km open gold and pathfinder element soil anomaly and to test new areas not previously sampled.

That study, which demonstrated robust project economics at a uranium price of US<money>$65</money> per pound U₃O₈, is now considered outdated pursuant to Securities Exchange guidance. The updated economic study is targeted for completion in the first half of 2026.</p><p>Since 2016, uranium market fundamentals have strengthened materially, with long-term consensus pricing well above levels used in the prior study. Over the same period, Laramide has meaningfully expanded the Westmoreland Mineral Resource, which now comprises 48.1 million pounds U₃O₈ in the Indicated category at an average grade of 770 ppm and 17.7 million pounds U₃O₈ in the Inferred category at an average grade of 680 ppm<sup>2</sup>. The Company has also secured a Mining Development Licence (MDL), representing a significantly advanced stage of tenure and project title within Queensland.</p><p>The updated PEA will reflect current uranium pricing assumptions, revised capital and operating cost inputs, and the expanded resource base. The study is expected to evaluate potential production rates of approximately 4 to 5 million pounds U₃O₈ per annum.</p><p>Advancement of Westmoreland toward development will ultimately depend on policy clarity in Queensland. The Company remains prepared to move expeditiously and responsibly when regulatory conditions align.</p><p>Marc Henderson, President and CEO, commented:</p><p>\"Westmoreland's economics were robust at US<money>$65</money> per pound in 2016, when uranium was in a prolonged bear market. Today's uranium market presents a fundamentally different pricing environment as nuclear energy growth prospects re-emerge globally. Updating the study allows us to reframe the project's economic profile based on current market conditions and a materially expanded resource base.</p><p>\"It is also worth noting, that the broader district, including our very large adjoining tenement position in the Northern Territory remains underexplored. Our 2026 exploration program – to be carried out in the latter half of the year – will be designed to focus on this district potential in order to showcase that Westmoreland remains one of a few large scale, late stage, low technical risk, uranium development projects available to fill a growing future supply gap.\"</p><p>Rhys Davies, Vice President Exploration, added:</p><p>\"The resource growth potential around Westmoreland is significant. Beyond the known deposits, multiple satellite prospects exhibit geological characteristics consistent with Westmoreland-style mineralization. The addition of hyperspectral data has materially expanded our target pipeline. We believe the district remains materially underexplored.\"</p><p>This news release has been reviewed and approved on behalf of the Laramide Board by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.</p><p>To learn more about Laramide, please visit the Company's website at <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/KLp2jCJ45g\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.laramide.com</a> or contact:</p><div id=\"contactInfo\"><p>Marc Henderson, President and CEO<br/>Toronto, Canada    +1 (416) 599 7363</p><p>Ann Baines, Director, Investor Relations<br/>Toronto, Canada   +1 (647) 832-9904</p></div><p>Follow us on Twitter <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/A8qmEipwR8\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">@LaramideRes</a></p><p><b>About Laramide Resources Ltd.</b></p><p>Laramide is focused on exploring and developing high-quality uranium assets in Tier-1 uranium jurisdictions.

Earlier this week, the Company announced a second drill rig had arrived at the Project and commenced drilling on the Kasie Ridge epithermal gold-copper target while the first drill rig remains focused on Sinivit and Kavasuki.</p><p>The Kavasuki target is an epithermal vein system approximately 1 km north of Sinivit with high-grade gold mineralization identified by historic drilling and exploration work over 900 metres of strike length.

The next phase at Sinivit involves integrated geological and structural modelling incorporating:</p><ul><li>High-grade shoot geometries</li><li>Multi-element geochemical data</li><li>Alteration zonation and sulphide distribution</li><li>Fault architecture and potential vein displacement</li></ul><p>Recent drilling has intersected several fault zones, and modelling will focus on understanding their impact on shoot continuity and displacement. This work will refine depth potential and assist in defining more precise step-out targets along strike and at depth, particularly beneath the Southern Oxide, Central Oxide and Northern Sulphide zones.</p><p>Future drilling at Sinivit will be guided by this integrated structural framework rather than solely by historic intercept spacing.</p><p>Kavasuki is located approximately 1 kilometre north of Sinivit along the same principal Wild Dog structural corridor and forms part of a continuous ~3-kilometre mineralized trend within the broader 15-kilometre Wild Dog system.</p><p>Historic exploration between 1990 and 2012 comprised 46 drill holes (2,894 metres) and approximately 3.5 kilometres of trenching. Reported intercepts include:</p><ul><li>Hole 10KVD017: 15.15 metres at 2.6 g/t Au (from 32 metres)</li><li>Hole 11KVD025: 8.15 metres at 18.77 g/t Au (from 12.3 metres)</li></ul><p>Trenching returned up to 28 metres at 4.48 g/t Au, with isolated samples returning up to 23.5 g/t Au.</p><p>Despite these results, historic drilling was largely shallow and inconsistently oriented, with limited systematic testing of down-dip continuity or structural controls. Some areas were locally over-drilled while others remain sparsely tested.</p><p>Recent reinterpretation of historic drilling and trench data suggests the principal Kavasuki vein may dip approximately 55 degrees to the east, rather than west as previously assumed. This hypothesis is based on the distribution of broader intercepts in holes drilled from the west and inconsistencies observed in historic drill orientations.</p><p>The current drilling program is specifically designed to test this structural hypothesis. Should drilling not support the east-dipping model, the data generated will allow refinement of vein geometry and improve targeting of subsequent holes.</p><p>Importantly, a coherent induced polarisation (IP) chargeability anomaly measuring approximately 300 metres by 200 metres coincides with the interpreted vein system. The anomaly (6-10 ms) is comparable in scale and character to the Northern Sulphide Zone at Sinivit and supports the presence of sulphide-bearing mineralization beneath the oxide profile.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/11018/285437_8c020165145eda6f_003full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

All assay batches received to date have passed QA/QC review and fall within acceptable tolerance limits.</p><p>Core recoveries were within acceptable ranges, and sampling procedures were carefully managed in areas of variable ground conditions.</p><p><b>About Great Pacific Gold</b></p><p>Great Pacific Gold's vision is to become the leading gold-copper development company in Papua New Guinea (\"PNG\").  The Company has a portfolio of exploration-stage projects in PNG, as follows:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li><p><b>Wild Dog Project: </b>the Company's flagship project is located in the East New Britain Province of PNG.  The project consists of a large-scale epithermal target, the Wild Dog structural corridor, stretching 15 km in strike length and potentially over 1,000 metres deep based on a recent MobileMT geophysics survey.  The survey also highlighted the Magiabe porphyry target, adjacent to the epithermal target and potentially 1,000 metres in diameter and over 2,000 metres deep.  Drilling of the epithermal structure on the Sinivit target has yielded high-grade results, including WDG-08 which intercepted 8.4 metres at 50 g/t AuEq from 154 metres.  The current drilling program will extend into 2026 with two drills currently operating on site.</p></li><li><p><b>Kesar Project: </b>located in the Eastern Highlands Province of PNG and contiguous with the mine tenements of K92 Mining Inc. (\"K92\"), the Kesar Project is a greenfield exploration project with several high-priority targets in close proximity to the property boundary with K92. Multiple epithermal veins at Kesar are on strike and have the same orientation as key K92 deposits, such as Kora. Exploration work to date by the Company at the Kesar Project has shown that these veins have high grades of gold present in outcrop and very elevated gold in soil grades, coincident with aeromagnetic highs. The Company conducted a diamond drill program on key target areas at the Kesar Project from November 2024 to May 2025 and have developed a follow-up Phase 2 program for 2026.</p></li></ul><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li><b>Arau Project: </b>also located in the Eastern Highlands Province of PNG, the Arau Project is south of and contiguous to the mine tenements of K92.  Arau contains the highly prospective Mt. Victor exploration target with potential for a high sulphidation epithermal gold-base metal deposit. A Phase 1 Reverse Circulation drilling program was completed at Mt. Victor in August 2024, with encouraging results. The Arau Project includes the Elandora licence, which also contains various epithermal and copper-gold porphyry targets.</li></ul><p>The Company also holds the Tinga Valley Project in PNG.</p><p><b>Forward-Looking Statements</b></p><p><i>Information set forth in this news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on assumptions as of the date of this news release.

We achieved record net revenue for both the fourth quarter and the full year, driven by strong consumer demand for our leading brands, the completion of the expansion at Cronos GrowCo, and the increasing contribution from our international markets,” said Mike Gorenstein, Chairman, President and CEO of Cronos.</p> <p align=\"justify\">“Looking ahead, we are excited about the opportunities in front of us as we enter 2026,” continued Gorenstein. “Once completed, our pending acquisition of CanAdelaar will establish a strategic footprint in Europe and enable us to leverage our borderless product strategy in the Netherlands’ legal adult-use cannabis market. Outside the Netherlands, with the scale benefits expected from Cronos GrowCo’s expansion, continued growth in our proprietary products, and the strength of our international presence, we believe Cronos is well-positioned to deliver sustainable net revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth and to create long-term shareholder value.”<br/></p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong><u>Consolidated Financial Results</u></strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">On June 20, 2024 the Company made an additional investment (the “Cronos GrowCo Transaction”) in Cronos Growing Company Inc. (“Cronos GrowCo”) to fund the expansion of cultivation operations. Cronos also obtained majority control of the board of directors of Cronos GrowCo and began consolidating Cronos GrowCo's results from July 1, 2024. Prior to this date, the Company's investment in Cronos GrowCo consisted of an investment accounted for under the equity method and loans receivable from Cronos GrowCo.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The tables below set forth our condensed consolidated results of continuing operations, expressed in thousands of United States (“U.S.”) dollars for the periods presented.

The brand established a leadership position in vape cartridges, which reached the #1 rank in Canada in Q4 2025 with <percent>10.6%</percent> share of that sub-category. The Pink Lemonade vape cartridge remained the top‑selling 1.2g cartridge nationally in each quarter of the year, and four Spinach<sup>®</sup> vape cartridges ranked in the top 10 nationally across all vape sub-categories in Q4 2025. To complement this leadership in vape cartridges, we are very excited about the growth potential of our recently launched Spinach<sup>®</sup> PUFFERZ™ all-in-one vape line.</p> <p align=\"left\">Overall, 2025 demonstrated strong brand momentum for Spinach<sup>®</sup> and SOURZ by Spinach<sup>®</sup>, with sustained consumer demand, multiple category‑leading SKUs, and continued innovation across edibles and vapes.</p> <p align=\"left\"><em><u>PEACE NATURALS</u></em><sup><em>®</em></sup><sup><em>3</em></sup></p> <p align=\"justify\">The PEACE NATURALS<sup>®</sup> brand delivered exceptional performance throughout 2025, consistently holding its position as the top‑performing cannabis brand in Israel and achieving record net revenue and sales volume in Israel each successive quarter of the year. Strong demand for Cronos’ proprietary genetics, highlighted by best‑sellers such as Wedding CK and GMO, continued to fuel the brand’s leadership in the Israeli medical market. New launches, including strain‑specific oils and limited‑edition premium flower series, further strengthened the brand’s portfolio and patient appeal.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Internationally, the PEACE NATURALS<sup>®</sup> brand expanded its global footprint significantly in 2025, entering the medical cannabis markets in Australia and Malta in Q2 2025, and launching in Switzerland in Q3 2025. The brand’s presence now spans six key international medical markets: Israel, Germany, the United Kingdom (“U.K”), Australia, Switzerland, and Malta. Cronos net revenue in international markets outside Israel grew <percent>68%</percent> year-over-year in the fourth quarter as shipment timing normalized and demand remained strong.</p> <p align=\"justify\">We look forward to building upon the brand's momentum, bolstered by the recently completed expansion at Cronos GrowCo, as well as by continued product innovation and sustained demand for Cronos’ high‑quality genetics and cultivation expertise.</p> <p align=\"left\"><em><u>LIT</u></em><em>™</em></p> <p align=\"left\">LIT™, the Company's value-focused medical brand, experienced strong growth in 2025, led by performance in Israel and its introduction to the German and U.K. markets during the year.

(“CanAdelaar”), one of ten licensed cannabis producers in the Dutch controlled cannabis supply chain experiment (the “Wietexperiment”). Cronos will acquire all outstanding shares of CanAdelaar for <money>€57.5 million</money>, or approximately <money>$67 million</money>,<sup>4</sup> up-front cash consideration, subject to certain customary adjustments, with additional contingent cash consideration of 0.5x CanAdelaar’s Normalized EBITDA (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) in 2026 and 2027 (the “Transaction”). The up-front consideration represents approximately 1.4x CanAdelaar net revenue and 2.4x EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2025.<sup>5</sup></p> <p align=\"justify\">CanAdelaar operates a 540,000‑square‑foot greenhouse facility in the southern Dutch municipality of Voorne aan Zee, and is the only industrial-scale greenhouse cultivator among the ten licensed producers supplying the <em>Wietexperiment</em>. CanAdelaar supplies nearly all 72 coffee shops participating in the<em> Wietexperiment</em> with flower, pre‑rolls, hash and edibles under its C.O.G. brand.

While we believe that the assumptions and expectations reflected in the Forward-Looking Statements are reasonable based on information currently available to management, there is no assurance that such assumptions and expectations will prove to have been correct. Forward-Looking Statements are made as of the date they are made and are based on the beliefs, estimates, expectations and opinions of management on that date.

This press release refers to measures not recognized under U.S. GAAP (“non-GAAP measures”). These non-GAAP measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these non-GAAP measures are provided as a supplement to corresponding U.S. GAAP measures to provide additional information regarding our results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. All non-GAAP measures presented in this press release are reconciled to their closest reported U.S. GAAP measure. Reconciliations of historical adjusted financial measures to corresponding U.S. GAAP measures are provided below.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><em>Adjusted EBITDA</em></p> <p align=\"justify\">Management reviews Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, which excludes non-cash items and items that do not reflect management’s assessment of ongoing business performance. Management defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization adjusted for: share of (income) loss from equity method investments; impairment loss on goodwill and intangible assets; impairment loss on long-lived assets; (gain) loss on revaluation of derivative liabilities; (gain) loss on revaluation of financial instruments; gain on revaluation of loan receivable; gain on revaluation of equity method investment; transaction costs related to strategic projects; loss on held-for-sale assets; impairment loss on other investments; foreign currency transaction (gain) loss; other, net; loss from discontinued operations; change in allowance for credit loss on non-operating loan; restructuring costs; inventory write-downs resulting from restructuring actions; share-based compensation; costs related to the Israel Ministry of Economy and Industry dumping inquiry; purchase accounting adjustment-related inventory step-up adjustments recorded through cost of sales; and financial statement review costs and reserves related to the restatements of our 2019 and 2021 interim financial statements (the “Restatements”), including the costs related to the settlement of the SEC’s and the OSC’s investigations of the Restatements and legal costs of defending shareholder class action complaints brought against us as a result of the 2019 restatement (see Note 12(b) “<em>Contingencies</em>,” to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of our Annual Report for a discussion of the shareholder class action complaints relating to the restatement of the 2019 interim financial statements and the settlement of the SEC’s and the OSC’s investigations of the Restatements). Results are reported as total consolidated results, reflecting our reporting structure of one reportable segment.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides the most useful insight into underlying business trends and results and provides a more meaningful comparison of period-over-period results. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Beginning in 2025, the Company modified the composition of Adjusted EBITDA to exclude the impact of the provision for expected credit losses recognized under ASC 326 solely with respect to the High Tide Loan (see Note 6 “<em>Loans Receivable, net</em>” to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of our Annual Report for further information). Management determined that excluding this non-cash provision provides investors with additional insight into period-over-period operating performance by isolating credit-risk movements unrelated to the Company’s core operations.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Management believes that this change provides additional information regarding the Company’s ongoing operational results and enhances comparability with peers that do not routinely extend credit to third parties. This change does not affect the Company’s GAAP financial statements.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The following tables set forth a reconciliation of Net income (loss) as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated:</p> <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

For the year ended December 31, 2025, net revenue on a constant currency basis was <money>$145.4 million</money>, representing a <percent>24%</percent> increase from the year ended December 31, 2024. For the three months ended December 31, 2025, net revenue increased on a constant currency basis primarily due to higher cannabis flower sales in Israel and other countries, which carry no excise taxes and higher cannabis flower and extract sales in the Canadian market. For the year ended December 31, 2025, net revenue increased on a constant currency basis primarily due to higher cannabis flower sales in Israel and other countries, which carry no excise taxes, the inclusion of a year of Cronos GrowCo sales in the current period, and higher cannabis extract sales in the Canadian market, partially offset by a decrease in cannabis flower sales in the Canadian market due to supply constraints. Due to the consolidation of Cronos GrowCo’s results of operations in our financial statements beginning July 1, 2024, Cronos GrowCo contributed <money>$10.5 million</money> of cannabis flower sales to third parties in the year ended December 31, 2025, on a constant currency basis, compared to <money>$6.4 million</money> of cannabis flower sales to third parties in the year ended December 31, 2024.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><em>Gross profit</em></p> <p align=\"justify\">For the three months ended December 31, 2025, gross profit on a constant currency basis was <money>$15.3 million</money>, representing a <percent>41%</percent> increase from the three months ended December 31, 2024.

For the three months ended December 31, 2025, gross profit increased on a constant currency basis primarily due to higher average sales prices driven primarily by a mix shift to Israel and other countries, higher sales volumes and production efficiencies. Gross profit was also positively impacted by <money>$1.8 million</money> in the fourth quarter of 2024 in connection with the finalization of the purchase accounting for the Cronos GrowCo Transaction, which resulted in the reduction of the fair value of the inventory acquired from Cronos GrowCo and the corresponding inventory step-up previously recorded into cost of sales in Q3 2024. No such costs were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2025. For the year ended December 31, 2025, gross profit increased on a constant currency basis primarily due to lower amounts of inventory step-up from the Cronos GrowCo Transaction recognized into cost of sales, the consolidation of Cronos GrowCo, higher average sales prices driven primarily by a mix shift to Israel and other countries, higher sales volumes, and production efficiencies. For 2025 and 2024, gross profit on a constant currency basis was reduced <money>$0.6 million</money> and <money>$5.3 million</money>, respectively, as a result of the impact of the inventory step-up from the Cronos GrowCo Transaction that was recorded into cost of sales.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><em>Operating expenses</em></p> <p align=\"justify\">For the three months ended December 31, 2025, operating expenses on a constant currency basis were <money>$23.2 million</money>, representing a <percent>5%</percent> increase from the three months ended December 31, 2024.

For the three months ended December 31, 2025, operating expenses on a constant currency basis increased primarily due to higher restructuring costs, transaction costs and impairment loss on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, partially offset by lower share-based compensation expense. For the year ended December 31, 2025 operating expenses decreased on a constant currency basis primarily due to the impairment of Ginkgo exclusive licenses in 2024, lower salaries and benefits, lower expected credit losses on loans receivable, lower depreciation and amortization and lower share-based compensation expense, partially offset by higher restructuring costs, transaction costs and impairment loss on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2025.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><em>Net income (loss)</em></p> <p align=\"justify\">For the three months ended December 31, 2025, net loss on a constant currency basis was <money>$0.8 million</money>, compared to net income of <money>$44.7 million</money> for the three months ended December 31, 2024.

narrowed full year guidance provided in November.  PSEG's full year results were achieved while facing multiple severe storms and extreme weather events throughout the year that stressed our electric and gas systems, during which PSE&amp;G demonstrated excellent operating performance in safety, reliability and customer satisfaction measures.  Furthermore, on the customer front, we implemented the Summer Relief Initiative in cooperation with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location> regulators and policymakers to help our customers manage the impact of last summer's rise in PJM-related electric supply costs.  On the generating side, PSEG Nuclear posted a <percent>91.2%</percent> capacity factor for the full year, producing 24x7, carbon-free baseload power for the grid during the intense June 2025 heatwave when <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location> needed it most,\" said Ralph LaRossa, chair, president and CEO of PSEG.  </p><p>LaRossa added, \"As we begin 2026, I am proud of the work PSEG is doing in support of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey's</location> efforts to minimize utility rate increases.  The latest example of these efforts occurred on February 1, when PSE&amp;G held its residential gas rate flat for the remainder of the 2025/2026 winter heating season.  Extending the stability of our gas rates further highlights PSE&amp;G's favorable residential gas bill profile, which is not only the lowest cost in the state but in the region.  We are also continuing to work with policymakers to address the resource adequacy imbalance in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location> and are confident in our ability to maintain system reliability as we invest in critical energy infrastructure to deliver value to our customers and meet our shareholder growth expectations. </p><p>Consistent with delivering on expectations, PSEG's full year 2025 financial results mark the 21<sup>st</sup> consecutive year that the company has delivered non-GAAP Operating Earnings at or above management's earnings guidance.  Our solid balance sheet supports the continued execution of PSEG's strategy to grow our businesses without the need to issue new equity or sell assets, while providing the opportunity for consistent and sustainable dividend growth.  Earlier today, PSEG reported that our Board of Directors raised the 2026 common dividend – by <money><money>$0.16</money></money> per share, or approximately <percent>6%</percent> – to the indicative annual rate of <money><money>$2.68</money></money> per share.  This increase reflects our confidence in PSEG's growth opportunities and is the 15<sup>th</sup> consecutive year that PSEG has raised its dividend, extending our track record of providing a shareholder dividend to 119 years.\"</p><p><b>2025 Highlights</b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>PSE&amp;G

Namely, we are not able to reliably project without unreasonable effort MTM and NDT gains (losses), for future periods due to market volatility.

Payoneer empowers millions of businesses with the financial tools and services they need to grow and transact globally with confidence. We make it easier for SMBs, particularly in emerging markets, to connect to the global economy, pay and get paid across borders, manage their funds across multiple currencies, and grow their businesses. </p><p><b>Forward-Looking Statements</b></p><p>This press release includes, and oral statements made from time to time by representatives of Payoneer, may be considered \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or Payoneer's future financial or operating performance. For example, projections of future revenue, transaction costs and adjusted EBITDA are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as \"may,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"will,\" \"estimate,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"predict,\" \"potential\" or \"continue,\" or the negatives of these terms or variations of them or similar terminology. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by Payoneer and its management, as the case may be, are inherently uncertain. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: (1) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (2) the possibility that Payoneer may be adversely affected by geopolitical events and conflicts, such as <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/il\">Israel's</location> conflicts in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/mde\">Middle East</location>, and other economic, business and/or competitive factors, such as changes in global trade policies (including the imposition of tariffs); (3) changes in the assumptions underlying our financial estimates; (4) the outcome of any known and/or unknown legal or regulatory proceedings; and (5) other risks and uncertainties set forth in Payoneer's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2025 and future reports that Payoneer may file with the SEC from time to time. Nothing in this press release should be regarded as a representation by any person that the forward-looking statements set forth herein will be achieved or that any of the contemplated results of such forward-looking statements will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Payoneer does not undertake any duty to update these forward-looking statements.</p><p><b>Financial Information; Non-GAAP Financial Measures</b></p><p>Some of the financial information and data contained in this press release, such as adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, have not been prepared in accordance with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location> generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Payoneer uses certain non-GAAP measures to compare Payoneer's performance to that of prior periods for budgeting and planning purposes. Payoneer believes these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to Payoneer's results of operations. Payoneer's method of determining these non-GAAP measures may be different from other companies' methods and, therefore, may not be comparable to those used by other companies and Payoneer does not recommend the sole use of these non-GAAP measures to assess its financial performance. Payoneer management does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in Payoneer's financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expense and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents non-GAAP financial measures in connection with GAAP results. You should review Payoneer's financial statements, which are included in Payoneer's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025 and its subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Payoneer's business.  </p><p>Non-GAAP measures include the following items:</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA: We provide adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income (loss) adjusted to exclude, as applicable: M&amp;A related expense (income), stock-based compensation expenses, restructuring charges, share in losses (gain) of associated company, loss (gain) from change in fair value of warrants and warrant repurchase/redemption, other financial expense (income), net, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA ex. Interest: represents Adjusted EBITDA excluding interest income.  </p><p>Free Cash Flow: represents net cash provided by operating activities, less purchase of property, equipment and software, and capitalization of internal use software.</p><p>Other companies may calculate the above measure differently, and therefore Payoneer's measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.</p><p><b>Additional Information and Definitions</b></p><p>In this earnings release, we reference volume, which is an operational metric. Volume refers to the total dollar value of transactions successfully completed or enabled by our platform, not including orchestration transactions. For a customer that both receives and later sends payments, we count the volume only once. Note: orchestration transactions ceased in 2023 and were related to our 2020 acquisition of optile GmbH.</p><p>We also reference ARPU (Average Revenue Per User), which is defined as the Revenue from Active Customers divided by the number of Active Customers over the period in which the Revenue was earned. Active Customers for these purposes are defined as Payoneer accountholders with at least 1 financial transaction over the period. Revenue from Active Customers represents revenue attributed to Active Customers based on their use of the Payoneer platform, including interest income earned from their balances, and excluding revenues unrelated to their activities. </p><p>For revenues from SMBs that sell on marketplaces and from B2B SMBs referenced in the fourth quarter and full year 2025 highlights, note that 2024 revenues used for comparison were restated. Certain non-volume revenues, including those related to banking partnerships and FX, which were previously allocated to SMBs that sell on marketplaces have been re-classified to B2B SMBs to better reflect the customers generating those revenues. Accordingly, the year-over-year change is calculated on a restated comparative basis. This change had no impact on total revenue or volumes.</p><p><b>Investor Contact:<br/></b>Michelle Wang<br/><a href=\"mailto:investor@payoneer.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"

estimate or predict with reasonable certainty certain discrete tax items, which could significantly impact that financial measure. </p><p><b>Operational and Financial Metrics</b></p><p><b><i>Adjusted EBITDA </i></b>is net income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, net interest expense, other income (expense), income tax (expense) benefit, (gain) loss on foreign currency, (gain) loss on transfer of assets, reorganization costs, and other supplemental adjustments. Other supplemental adjustments include certain non-operating items such as stock-based compensation, executive severance costs, debt refinancing costs, acquisition-related expenses and other non-recurring charges. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when considered along with other performance measures, is a useful measure as it reflects certain operating drivers of the business, such as sales growth, operating costs, selling and administrative expense, and other operating income and expense. We believe Adjusted EBITDA helps provide a more complete understanding of the underlying operating results and trends and an enhanced overall understanding of our financial performance and prospects for the future. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements, such as unearned passenger revenues, capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments, and tax payments. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other companies within the industry.</p><p>The following metrics apply to the Lindblad segment:</p><p><b><i>Adjusted Net Cruise Cost </i></b>represents Net Cruise Cost adjusted for Non-GAAP other supplemental adjustments which include certain non-operating items such as stock-based compensation, reorganization costs and acquisition-related expenses.</p><p><b><i>Available Guest Nights </i></b>is a measurement of capacity available for sale and represents double occupancy per cabin (except single occupancy for a single capacity cabin) multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period. We also record the number of guest nights available on our limited land programs in this definition.</p><p><b><i>Gross Cruise Cost</i></b> represents the sum of cost of tours plus selling and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses.</p><p><b><i>Gross Yield per Available Guest Night</i></b> represents tour revenues divided by Available Guest Nights.</p><p><b><i>Guest Nights Sold </i></b>represents the number of guests carried for the period multiplied by the number of nights sailed within the period.</p><p><b><i>Maximum Guests </i></b>is a measure of capacity and represents the maximum number of guests in a period and is based on double occupancy per cabin (except single occupancy for a single capacity cabin).</p><p><b><i>Net Cruise Cost </i></b>represents Gross Cruise Cost excluding commissions and certain other direct costs of guest ticket revenues and other tour revenues.</p><p><b><i>Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel </i></b>represents Net Cruise Cost excluding fuel costs.</p><p><b><i>Net Yield </i></b>represents tour revenues less commissions and direct costs of other tour revenues.</p><p><b><i>Net Yield per Available Guest Night </i></b>represents Net Yield divided by Available Guest Nights.</p><p><b><i>Number of Guests </i></b>represents the number of guests that travel with us in a period.</p><p><b><i>Occupancy </i></b>is calculated by dividing Guest Nights Sold by Available Guest Nights.</p><p><b><i>Voyages </i></b>represent the number of ship expeditions completed during the period.</p><p> </p><p>SOURCE Lindblad Expeditions Holdings, Inc.</p></div></article>",

The increase in management fees was primarily attributable to the increase in the management fee base rate from <percent>0.75%</percent> to <percent>1.00%</percent>, effective March 31, 2025, pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement. Additionally, effective March 31, 2025, the Adviser's waiver of incentive fees on income and on capital gains expired pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement.

The net realized loss for the year ended December 31, 2025 was primarily driven by the restructuring of an underperforming debt position, partially offset by realized gains from full or partial repayments and sales of investments in portfolio companies. The Company recorded a net change in unrealized loss of <money><money>$(21.6) million</money></money> for the year ended December 31, 2025, compared to a net change in unrealized gain of <money><money>$7.3 million</money></money> for the year ended December 31, 2024. The increase in total net change in unrealized loss for the year ended December 31, 2025, compared to the total net change in unrealized gain for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily resulted from decreases in fair value of certain underperforming portfolio companies, partially offset by the reversal of unrealized loss on a debt position that was restructured during the year.</p><p>For the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded a net realized gain on investments of <money><money>$2.1 million</money></money> compared to a net realized loss of <money><money>$(11.7) million</money></money> for the three months ended December 31, 2024.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - February 26, 2026) - Libra Energy Materials Inc. (CSE: LIBR) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/LIBRF/\" title=\"View LIBRF stock overview\">LIBRF</a>) (FSE: W0R0) (\"<b>Libra</b>\" or the \"<b>Company</b>\") is pleased to provide an update on its <percent>100%</percent>-owned Penelope Project (\"<b>Penelope</b>\" or the \"<b>Project</b>\"), located within the Minas Gerais District in Brazil. Following a comprehensive review of historical data and recent geochemical sampling, the Company announces a strategic pivot in its exploration focus at Penelope, upgrading the Project's prospectivity for Rare Earth Elements (REEs), Niobium, Tantalum, and Gallium (Ga), while downgrading its priority as a primary lithium target.</p><p><i>\"Exploration is about listening to what the rocks are telling you, not forcing a model that doesn't fit,\" said Koby Kushner, Chief Executive Officer of Libra. \"While Penelope was originally acquired as part of our wider lithium portfolio, our technical team has identified a distinct geochemical signature that sets it apart. The ratios we are seeing suggest we are looking at a highly fractionated system with significant REE potential, rather than a lithium-bearing pegmatite. Given our focus as a primary lithium explorer, we intend to monetize or option out Penelope to another party with a dedicated focus on REEs.\"</i></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9331/285413_ebbe27af545f2bdc_001full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

Soil sampling across the property has returned consistent anomalies average 230 parts per million (ppm) total REE, indicative of regolith enrichment in a subtropical weathering environment favourable for IAC (Ionic Absorption Clay) style mineralization where REEs can absorb onto clays in deeper horizons. Elevated Gallium is also observed on the Project with returned values of up to <b>65.2 ppm</b> Ga in rock chip samples (Selene target), <b>62 ppm</b> Ga in chip panel samples (Elena target), and <b>43 ppm</b> Ga in soil samples (Nice target). </p><p>Geologically, this signature is characteristic of NYF-type (Niobium-Yttrium-Fluorine) pegmatites or similar REE-enriched systems, rather than the LCT-type (Lithium-Cesium-Tantalum) systems typically associated with bulk spodumene mineralization. As a result, the Company will be deprioritizing lithium-specific workstreams at Penelope. </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9331/285413_ebbe27af545f2bdc_002full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?
