This historic shift highlights a new era in the persistent global talent crisis, with <percent>72%</percent> of employers reporting hiring difficulty—down modestly from <percent>74%</percent> last year—according to the <a href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4627893-1&amp;h=1012117242&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manpowergroup.com%2Fen%2Finsights%2F2026-global-talent-shortage&amp;a=2026+Talent+Shortage+Survey\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2026 Talent Shortage Survey</a> released today by ManpowerGroup.</p><p>\"The rise of AI skills to the top of the shortage list reflects how quickly the talent landscape is evolving,\" said Jonas Prising, ManpowerGroup Chair &amp; CEO. \"Companies are responding with upskilling and more flexible workforce models, recognizing they will need to hire for potential; while building AI literacy across their workforce so people can apply new technology with judgment and confidence. AI is not replacing jobs, it is reshaping work, and companies that connect productivity gains with opportunity and career growth will be best positioned to compete in a talent-scarce world.\"</p><p>The research, spanning more than 39,000 employers in 41 countries, reveals that modest relief in overall hiring has been offset by fierce competition for AI capabilities.</p><p class=\"prntac\"><b>2026 TALENT SHORTAGE SURVEY KEY FINDINGS</b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li><b>AI Creates a New Hierarchy of Technical Demand<br/></b>AI Model &amp; Application Development (<percent>20%</percent>) and AI Literacy (<percent>19%</percent>) now lead the global ranking of hard-to-find skills, followed by Engineering (<percent>19%</percent>), Sales &amp; Marketing (<percent>18%</percent>), and Manufacturing &amp; Production (<percent>17%</percent>). Together, these AI capabilities displace traditional IT &amp; Data skills, which fell to seventh place (<percent>17%</percent>), signaling a rapid realignment of strategic talent investment toward AI-driven capabilities.<br/><br/></li><li><b>The Human Edge Becomes More Valuable<br/></b>Even amid the surge in demand for AI, core human skills remain in-demand. Communication, Collaboration &amp; Teamwork are the most sought-after attributes at <percent>39%</percent>, followed by Professionalism &amp; Work Ethic (<percent>36%</percent>) and Adaptability &amp; Willingness to Learn (<percent>34%</percent>), reinforcing the enduring value of interpersonal skills.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Geography Defines the Scarcity Experience<br/></b>The pressure to find talent is universal, yet its intensity varies dramatically by location. Employers in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/de\">Germany</location> (<percent>83%</percent>), <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/fr\">France</location> (<percent>74%</percent>), and the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">U.K.</location> (<percent>73%</percent>) face significant shortages, while the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> (<percent>69%</percent>) tracks slightly below the global average. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> (<percent>48%</percent>) stands out as the least constrained major market, revealing a fragmented global landscape where local conditions dictate competitive strategy.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Scarcity Is a Cross-Industry Phenomenon<br/></b>While the Information industry faces the highest shortage (<percent>75%</percent>), critical service sectors like Hospitality (<percent>74%</percent>) and Public Sector, Health &amp; Social Services (<percent>74%</percent>) report nearly identical levels of strain. This widespread challenge extends across Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services (<percent>73%</percent>), Manufacturing (<percent>72%</percent>), and Finance and Insurance (<percent>71%</percent>), indicating a broad-based constraint on economic growth and service delivery.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Employer Strategy: Invest, Adapt, and Compete<br/></b>Faced with structural scarcity, <percent>91%</percent> of employers are deploying a mix of strategies. The primary focus is on internal development and flexibility: Upskilling/Reskilling (<percent>27%</percent>) leads, followed by offering more Schedule Flexibility (<percent>20%</percent>) and Location Flexibility (<percent>18%</percent>). To compete externally, Increasing Wages (<percent>19%</percent>) and Targeting New Talent Pools (<percent>18%</percent>) are critical levers.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Scale Exacerbates the Challenge<br/></b>Organizational size significantly impacts hiring success. The largest companies—those with 1,000-4,999 employees—report the highest shortage rate (<percent>75%</percent>).

Additionally, AM Best has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of “a-” (Excellent) of Primerica, Inc. (Primerica) (headquartered in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ga.duluth\">Duluth, GA</location>) [NYSE: PRI], which is the holding company for the group’s insurance and non-insurance operating companies. AM Best also has affirmed the Long-Term Issue Credit Rating of “a-” (Excellent) on <money><money>$600 million</money></money>, <percent>2.8%</percent> senior unsecured notes, due 2031, of Primerica. The outlook of all these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.</p><p>The ratings reflect Primerica Group’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its very strong operating performance, favorable business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management.</p><p>Primerica’s credit ratings continue to recognize the group’s strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). The company’s balance sheet remains a core strength, characterized by strong liquidity and financial flexibility. Primerica has an investment profile that focuses on fixed-income assets, while maintaining only modest exposure to commercial mortgage-backed securities. However, the company’s business model does rely heavily on the use of reinsurance.</p><p>Primerica reinforced its position as an industry leader, consistently reporting high levels of earnings and top-tier return-on-equity measures among its peers. Steady premium growth, fueled by a vast and geographically diversified distribution system spanning the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> and Canadian marketplaces, continues to improve the company's operational strength. Primerica has extensive agent recruitment and a well-established monitoring system to ensure compliance and steady premium growth. Primerica’s use of highly rated reinsurance partners mitigates term life insurance mortality risk, a core component of its strong balance sheet management.</p><p>The group’s business profile is focused on its core term life insurance offering, particularly the investments made in its simplified issue product. Beyond the Primerica Group, Primerica also offers the distribution of primarily third-party investment and savings products and other non-life products.</p><p><b>This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

Drilling in the West Zone intersected broad levels of gold mineralization in multiple holes, with long intervals of gold mineralization encountered in two of the six holes completed during the program, complementing the spring 2023 discovery hole of 48.5m of 0.85 g/t Au starting at 316.5m (see News Release dated 2023-Jun-06).</p><p><b>Highlights:</b></p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li>IMGW-25-06 returned 0.424 g/t gold over 278.35 metres from 45.1 to 323.45 metres, which included several sub-intervals, including:<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\"><li><b>1.019 g/t gold over 7.4 metres</b> from 118.75 to 126.15 metres</li><li><b>0.566 g/t over 80 metres</b> from 154 to 234 metres</li><li><b>0.610 g/t gold over 62.45</b> <b>metres</b> from 261 to 323.45 metres, including<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\"><li><b>1.239 g/t gold over 16.65 metres</b> from 289.35 to 306 metres</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>IMGW-25-01 returned <b>0.419 g/t gold over 65.75</b> <b>metres </b>from 276.7 to 342.45 metres, including<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\"><li><b>0.868 g/t gold over 8 metres</b> from 296.5 to 304 metres</li><li><b>0.786 g/t gold over 5.8 metres</b> from 315.95 to 321.75 metres</li></ul></li><li>IMGW-25-03 returned <b>1.116 g/t gold over 6.2 metres</b> from 342.75 to 348.95 metres</li><li>McFarlane Lake Mining Limited, contiguous to the northwest has identifed a parallel zone to it's Juby Zone within the regional Ridout-Tyrrell Deformation Zone, the 826 Zone, which appears to trend into the West Zone.</li></ul><p>\"These results continue to expand the gold system at Gowganda West and demonstrate both broad mineralization and higher-grade internal intervals,\" stated Saf Dhillon, President &amp; CEO of iMetal. \"The scale of the mineralized envelope, combined with its proximity to the Juby Deposit and the emerging 826 Zone, reinforces the structural significance of this corridor. We look forward to incorporating these results into our ongoing geological model and planning the next phase of drilling!\" commented iMetal President &amp; CEO Saf Dhillon. </p><p>The drilling intersected the targeted host rocks that exhibited alteration patterns and mineralization similar to that which was intersected in the 2023 drill program. The dominant rock type intersected is a matrix supported greenish polymictic conglomerate composed of heterogenous centimetric to pluricentimetric round clasts with different colors. A percentage of the red clasts are magnetic but the matrix is not. Zones of moderate to pervasive hematization /potassic alteration, sericitization and silicification were noted in the drill holes. Mineralization included disseminated and clast-replacement controlled pyrite, while a few holes also intersected local chalcopyrite vein fractures or plurimillimetric clusters. Alteration intensity appears to be a control on elevated gold values. Pyrite content also shows a relationship with elevated gold values and intensity of alteration.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/7946/285465_table1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

Successive drill programs advancing to the southwest continued to intersect increasing alteration and gold values in suspected NW trending zones and lead directly to the IMGW23-04 discovery hole. The 48.5m gold interval is characterized by a coarse-grained to boulder-sized conglomerate, with moderate to pervasive silica alteration associated with a large intermediate-mafic dyke.

As development accelerates, becomes more automated, and relies more heavily on third-party components, risk is increasingly shaped by the software supply chain and the tools used to build and deploy applications - not just the code that runs in production.</p> <p>Key findings at a glance:</p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:12pt;\"><percent>87%</percent> of organizations have at least one known exploitable vulnerability in deployed services</li><li style=\"margin-top:10pt;\"><percent>42%</percent> of services rely on libraries that are no longer actively maintained</li><li style=\"margin-top:10pt;\">Services using end-of-life language versions face exploitable vulnerabilities in <percent>50%</percent> of cases, compared to <percent>31%</percent> for supported versions</li><li style=\"margin-top:10pt;\"><percent>50%</percent> of organizations adopt new library versions within 24 hours of release, increasing the risk of installing malicious or compromised software</li><li style=\"margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:12pt;\">Only <percent>4%</percent> of organizations pin all public GitHub Actions to a specific version using commit hashes, leaving CI/CD pipelines vulnerable to silent code changes<br/><br/></li></ul> <p><strong>Security Risk Increasing at Both Ends of the Lifecycle</strong></p> <p>On one end, software is aging faster than teams can keep it up to date. The median software dependency is now 278 days out of date - 63 days further behind than last year.</p> <p>At the same time, third-party software accelerates development but introduces risk when implicitly trusted. Datadog researchers found that half of organizations (<percent>50%</percent>) adopt new library versions within 24 hours of release, and only <percent>4%</percent> pin all public GitHub Actions to a specific version using commit hashes.</p> <p>As a result, build and deployment pipelines are increasingly exposed to silent changes in third-party code, making CI/CD systems a critical supply-chain risk.</p> <p>“The way software is built has fundamentally changed, but security practices haven’t kept up,” said Andrew Krug, Head of Security Advocacy at Datadog. “DevSecOps teams are caught between moving too slowly and moving too fast. Go slow, and outdated software accumulates known vulnerabilities. Go fast, and automation can introduce unvetted code. The real challenge, though, isn’t speed - it’s clarity. As environments grow more complex, AI-assisted workflows help ensure top priorities get attention first.”</p> <p><strong>Alert Volume Is Obscuring Real Risk</strong></p> <p>While vulnerability alerts continue to rise, the report also finds that most do not represent immediate business risk. Only <percent>18%</percent> of vulnerabilities labeled “critical” remain critical once runtime context is applied.</p> <p>“When almost everything is labeled ‘critical’, nothing is,” Krug added. “Teams get paged for noise while threats that pose real risk slip through. Without context, prioritization becomes harder - leading to burnout, slower response times and accumulated risk. Teams need better visibility into what <em>actually</em> requires action.”</p> <p>Read the full report, <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=UZ3UcXpxVfI9_CeA7JNfgIoxLXjDhx6WIfYpi4MXGURok8M-uScqRZiv7RcCvBRCyIR4d3wYNnJAuaHYdJigDM6jtHrddyaFkK8hfRTbTUsxPIBc_auStNStoPtmbJTq-qMuTvVKlpti6yDb-iamnA==\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>State of DevSecOps Report 2026</u></a>, to see how these findings are shaping modern approaches to detecting, prioritizing and remediating security risk.</p> <p><strong>Contact</strong><br/><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ofNna8sT1hFliTiZAJ9-ZpPpWWwuwFtuAF3yfXFT3AZn-wU4BYN2WB-p7euW6-s27Xi1qPSZZy79MmelrjbEgXcmcgWYhddYmx35Dsfjeis=\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>press@datadoghq.com</u></a></p> <p><strong>Report Methodology</strong></p> <p>Datadog analyzed telemetry from tens of thousands of applications to assess security risk across modern software environments, along with additional datasets used for specific findings.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><strong>Recognized expert in cancer biology, RNA biology and translational therapeutics with 20 years of experience in preclinical oncology drug discovery and development</strong></p><p align=\"justify\">TAMPA, Fla. and LONDON, Feb.  26, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Akari Therapeutics, Plc (Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/AKTX/\" title=\"View AKTX stock overview\">AKTX</a>), an oncology biotechnology company developing antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) with novel immuno-oncology payloads, today announced the appointment of Prafulla Gokhale, Ph.D., Director of the Experimental Therapeutics Core and the Lurie Family Imaging Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, to its Scientific Advisory Board.</p> <p align=\"justify\">“Dr. Gokhale’s expertise in experimental therapeutics, RNA biology and translational oncology comes at a pivotal time as we advance AKTX-101 toward the clinic,” commented Abizer Gaslightwala, President and CEO of Akari Therapeutics. “His proven track record to develop novel translational experiments/data that lead to well-designed and high-impact clinical strategies will strengthen our development approach as we advance AKTX-101 to clinical trials. As we move closer to first-in-human studies, his insight will help ensure that AKTX-101 and our novel PH1 spliceosome-modulating payload enter the clinic with a focused, data-driven high-impact program to optimize results.”</p> <p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Prafulla Gokhale, Ph.D.\" data-caption=\"Prafulla Gokhale, Ph.D.\" data-dpi=\"220\" data-filename=\"image1.png\" height=\"519\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/244fe78c-84c8-430c-b605-1cfd5de83a63/image1.png\" width=\"371\"/><br/></p> <p align=\"justify\">Dr. Gokhale has over 20 years of experience in preclinical oncology drug discovery and development. He began his career as a faculty member in the Radiation Medicine Department at Georgetown University before moving to the pharmaceutical industry, where he led <em>in vivo</em> pharmacology teams with increasing responsibility at OSI Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer, and Verastem. He currently heads the Experimental Therapeutics Core at Dana-Farber, overseeing translational research programs that integrate genomics, molecular biology, patient-derived models, imaging and preclinical studies to advance novel therapeutic strategies.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Dr. Gokhale commented, “I am excited to join Akari’s Scientific Advisory Board and work alongside a team advancing a truly differentiated approach to ADC development. Unlike conventional payload strategies that rely on tubulin inhibitors or DNA-damaging agents, PH1 targets RNA splicing, a fundamental regulator of cancer cell biology. This novel mechanism offers the potential to disrupt tumor survival pathways while also drive unique innate and adaptive immune system engagement. I look forward to collaborating closely with the team to further refine the translational strategy and support the advancement of AKTX-101 into the clinic.”</p> <p align=\"justify\">Dr. Gokhale’s work has been widely published and funded, reflecting his leadership in transforming fundamental discoveries into clinical innovations for cancer and related diseases.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>About Akari Therapeutics </strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">Akari Therapeutics is an oncology biotechnology company developing next-generation antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) with a unique payload, PH1, which targets RNA splicing. Utilizing its innovative ADC discovery platform, the Company has the ability to generate ADC candidates and optimize them based on the desired application to any antigen target of interest. Akari’s lead candidate, AKTX-101, targets the Trop2 receptor on cancer cells and with a proprietary linker, enabling it to deliver its novel PH1 payload directly into the tumor with minimal off-target effects. Unlike current ADCs that use tubulin inhibitors and DNA damaging agents as their payloads, PH1 is a novel payload that is a spliceosome modulator designed to disrupt RNA splicing within cancer cells. This splicing modulation has been shown in preclinical animal models to induce cancer cell death while activating both the innate and adaptive immune system to drive robust and durable activity. In preclinical studies, AKTX-101 has shown to have significant activity and prolonged survival relative to ADCs with traditional payloads. Additionally, AKTX-101 has the potential to be synergistic with checkpoint inhibitors and has demonstrated prolonged survival as both a single agent and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. The PH1 payload has also been demonstrated to be very active against cancer cells with key oncogenic drivers such as KRAS, BRAF, ARV7, FGFR3 fusions, and others. The Company has initiated IND enabling studies for AKTX-101 with a goal of starting its First-In-Human trial by late 2026/early 2027. Akari is also developing AKTX-102, an ADC candidate targeting CEACAM5 (Carcinoembryonic Antigen-related Cell Adhesion Molecule-5), a well-validated tumor antigen broadly expressed across multiple solid tumors. AKTX-102 is designed to leverage Akari’s proprietary PH1 spliceosome-modulating payload and novel antibody construct to enable differentiated tumor cell killing and immune activation.</p> <p align=\"justify\">For more information about the Company, please visit <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ZBbqhES2PJnXlUs79ASX5UyKlEWVB8yY4Na9DctxihCZrY7QiefMwU5hrFWWjAw-YvWdjIxGzswifoU0ghJwkvnrKnwIv1NjG5SH4cBdtJ0=\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.akaritx.com</a> and connect on <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=165fpgLsKT2iW0UGbSRXojI7CCQGoM_Wnb54etgyNdJNUY30Zzj_qalJHNTYQ6yilwsCBMr4hSdWxqJe-i47PQ==\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">X</a> and <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=dtRnHe45SLNXeCj8Ukt1z56bqtNF1XRTlhFd2XSx7NGTYzrBCsd7JbTx1gBp981lX737Y5EvNSrXFp0vg9IFHwJfsFC7ykIQihvtziHbHWU=\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a>.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements </strong><br/><br/>This press release includes express or implied forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, about the Company that involve risks and uncertainties relating to future events and the future performance of the Company.

The platform is optimized for a wide range of efficient and high-density workloads, including:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li><b>Cloud &amp; Virtualization:</b> Ideal for multi-tenant web hosting and small Virtual Private Server (VPS) instances.</li><li><b>Modern Infrastructure:</b> Kubernetes and microservices platforms, including API services and web front ends.</li><li><b>Enterprise &amp; Edge:</b> Departmental private clouds and edge deployments requiring high density in constrained spaces.</li><li><b>Data Services</b>: Object storage gateways and high-efficiency data processing.</li><li><b>Specialized Compute:</b> Job-splitting simulations, e-commerce platforms, and cybersecurity applications.</li></ul><p>Each node supports a single AMD EPYC 4005 series processor with two DDR5 ECC UDIMM slots operating at up to 5600 MT/s, along with two PCIe Gen5 E1.S SSDs and one M.2 SSD per node. Integrated networking features dual-port 25GbE via Broadcom BCM57414, with advanced security and manageability including TPM 2.0, signed firmware, hardware root of trust, IPMI 2.0, KVM over IP, and Redfish API support. The new MicroBlade system uniquely enables flexible mix-and-match configurations across single-wide and double-wide nodes further showcasing the versatility of the all-in-one Supermicro blade system. Connectivity further elevates its capabilities, with two integrated 25G Ethernet switches with 100G uplinks in the back of the enclosure, ensuring reliable, high-speed networking while lowering the TCO through cable reduction.</p><p>The MicroBlade chassis management module (CMM) provides total remote control of individual server blades, power supplies, cooling fans, and networking switches remotely. System administrators can control the maximum power consumption per server through power capping and manage the power allocation in the MicroBlade CMM for each blade server. Remote power control capabilities to reboot and/or reset the server are available as well as remote access to the BIOS configuration and operating system console information via SOL (Serial over LAN) or embedded KVM capabilities. Because the controller is a separate processor, all monitoring and control functions operate flawlessly regardless of CPU operation or system power-on status.</p><p><b>About Super Micro Computer, Inc.</b></p><p>Supermicro (NASDAQ: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/SMCI/\" title=\"View SMCI stock overview\">SMCI</a>) is a global leader in Application-Optimized Total IT Solutions.
