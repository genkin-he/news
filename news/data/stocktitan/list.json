The outcome supports our belief that TORM is well positioned as we move into 2026. Our culture, strategic focus, and integrated platform remain a competitive advantage ensuring we are in the best place to make the most of any opportunities or future disruption.</p><p>In 2025, TORM generated time charter equivalent earnings (TCE) of <money>USD 910m</money> (2024: <money>USD 1,135m</money>).

The introduction of US tariffs and subsequent uncertainty around USTR-related port fees set the tone early in the year. As months passed, Houthi attacks and the unpredictability surrounding Suez Canal transits continued to affect shipping routes and schedules. At the same time, tightened sanctions on <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ru\">Russia</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ir\">Iran</location>, and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ve\">Venezuela</location> reshaped energy flows, while a brief but intense conflict between <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/il\">Israel</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ir\">Iran</location>, alongside stepped-up Ukrainian strikes on Russian infrastructure and shadow tankers, added further tension to an already complex landscape.</p><p>Against this challenging environment, we kept our focus at TORM on operational excellence and agility. Our scalable platform and disciplined commercial approach enabled us to navigate market fluctuations and strengthen our standing as a dependable, resilient leader in the product tanker industry.</p><p>In this market, TORM achieved TCE fleet-wide rates of USD/day 28,783 on average (2024: USD/day 36,061), and available earning days increased to 31,840 (2024: 31,287). Our vessel class LR2 achieved TCE rates of USD/day 35,850, the LR1 vessels achieved TCE rates of USD/day 28,262, and the MR vessels achieved TCE rates of USD/day 26,374.</p><p>Key

</sup>Excludes unrealized gains/losses on derivatives.</p><p>For the full-year 2025, Return on Invested Capital was <percent>11.5%</percent> (2024: <percent>24.3%</percent>), a level that remains solid and satisfactory even as it reflects the expected normalization in freight rates and the corresponding impact on earnings.</p><p>During the year, the weighted average number of outstanding shares increased to 98.2m shares (2024: 93.6m shares) which combined with the net profit led to basic EPS of <money>USD 2.91</money> (2024: <money>USD 6.54</money>).</p><p>In the fourth quarter of 2025, TORM achieved TCE of <money>USD 251m</money> (2024, same period: <money>USD 215m</money>). Adjusted EBITDA amounted to <money>USD 151.5m</money> including unrealized gains on derivatives of <money>USD 5m</money> (2024, same period: <money>USD 135.0m</money> including unrealized gains on derivatives of <money>USD 7m</money>) and a net profit of <money>USD 87m</money> (2024, same period: <money>USD 77m</money>), underscoring the improved market dynamics for the product tanker industry compared to the same quarter last year. In this market, TORM achieved TCE rates of USD/day 30,658 on average (2024, same period: USD/day 25,775), while available earning days were broadly unchanged at 8,032 (2024, same period: 8,054).</p><p>Vessel Transactions</p><p>Throughout 2025, TORM continued its disciplined fleet renewal strategy, balancing the divestment of older tonnage with targeted acquisitions to strengthen fleet quality and efficiency. The fourth quarter stood out as the most active period of the year, with TORM agreeing to acquire eight product tankers, the majority of which were delivered before year-end. These additions further enhanced the fleet profile and underscored our commitment to maintaining a high-quality, competitive fleet. During the same period, TORM also completed the divestment of one older LR2 tanker, with delivery scheduled for early 2026.</p><p>Over the full year, TORM acquired nine second-hand vessels as part of our ongoing optimization efforts. In addition, we exercised purchase options on 14 leaseback vessels, transitioning them to full ownership and strengthening both operational and financial flexibility.</p><p>Together, these actions reflect TORM's sustained commitment to maintaining a modern, efficient fleet and to a capital allocation strategy designed to support long-term competitiveness.</p><p>By the end of December 2025, TORM had 93 owned and leased vessels in the LR2, LR1, and MR vessel classes.</p><p>Distribution of Dividend for the Fourth Quarter of 2025</p><p>TORM's Board of Directors has approved an interim dividend for the fourth quarter of <money>USD 0.70</money> per share to be paid to the shareholders, corresponding to an expected total dividend payment of <money>USD 70.9</money> m. The distribution for the quarter is equivalent to <percent>82%</percent> of net profit and reflects the Distribution Policy. The payment date is 25 March 2026 to all shareholders on record as of 12 March 2026, and the ex-dividend date is 11 March 2026 for the shares listed on Nasdaq OMX Copenhagen and 12 March 2026 for the shares listed on Nasdaq New York.</p><p>Financial Outlook 2026 (INSIDE INFORMATION)</p><p>TORM's financial outlook is based on our current product tanker market expectations. We do, however, have limited visibility on TCE rates that are not yet fixed with our customers; hence these rates may be significantly lower or significantly higher than our current expectations.</p><p>For the full-year 2026, TCE earnings are expected to be in the range of <money>USD 850</money> - 1,250m (2025: <money>USD 910m</money>), and EBITDA is expected to be in the range of <money>USD 500</money> - 900m (2025: <money>USD 571m</money>) based on the current fleet size, including published acquisitions and divestment of vessels.</p><p>As of 17 February 2026, <percent>70%</percent> of the Q1 2026 earning days were covered at USD/day 34,926. For the individual vessel classes, the Q1 2026 coverage was <percent>69%</percent> at USD/day 44,943 for LR2, <percent>53%</percent> at USD/day 46,803 for LR1 and <percent>74%</percent> at USD/day 30,411 for MR.</p><p>Further, as of 17 February 2026, TORM had covered <percent>23%</percent> of the 2026 full-year earning days at USD/day 34,462.

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor protections for forward-looking statements in order to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their business. Forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance and may include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are statements other than statements of historical facts. The Company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is including this cautionary statement in connection with this safe harbor legislation. Words such as, but not limited to, \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"targets,\" \"projects,\" \"forecasts,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"possible,\" \"likely,\" \"may,\" \"could,\" \"should\" and similar expressions or phrases may identify forward-looking statements.</p><p>The forward-looking statements in this release are based upon various assumptions, many of which are, in turn, based upon further assumptions, including without limitation, management's examination of historical operating trends, data contained in our records and other data available from third parties. Although the Company believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies that are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond our control, the Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs, or projections.</p><p>Important factors that, in our view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, our future operating or financial results; changes in governmental rules and regulations or actions taken by regulatory authorities; inflationary pressure and central bank policies intended to combat overall inflation and rising interest rates and foreign exchange rates; general domestic and international political conditions or events, including \"trade wars\" and the war between <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ru\">Russia</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ua\">Ukraine</location>, the developments in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/mde\">Middle East</location>, including the war in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/il\">Israel</location> and the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ps\">Gaza Strip</location>, and the conflict regarding the Houthis' attacks in the Red Sea; international sanctions against Russian oil and oil products; changes in economic and competitive conditions affecting our business, including market fluctuations in charter rates and charterers' abilities to perform under existing time charters; changes in the supply and demand for vessels comparable to ours and the number of newbuildings under construction; the highly cyclical nature of the industry that we operate in; the loss of a large customer or significant business relationship; changes in worldwide oil production and consumption and storage; risks associated with any future vessel construction; our expectations regarding the availability of vessel acquisitions and our ability to complete acquisition transactions planned; availability of skilled crew members other employees and the related labor costs; work stoppages or other labor disruptions by our employees or the employees of other companies in related industries;  effects of new products and new technology in our industry;  new environmental regulations and restrictions; the impact of an interruption in or failure of our information technology and communications systems, including the impact of cyber-attacks, upon our ability to operate; potential conflicts of interest involving members of our Board of Directors and Senior Management; the failure of counterparties to fully perform their contracts with us; changes in credit risk with respect to our counterparties on contracts; adequacy of insurance coverage; our ability to obtain indemnities from customers; changes in laws, treaties or regulations; our incorporation under the laws of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/gb.eng\">England</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/gb.wal\">Wales</location> and the different rights to relief that may be available compared to other countries, including <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>; government requisition of our vessels during a period of war or emergency; the arrest of our vessels by maritime claimants; any further changes in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> trade policy that could trigger retaliatory actions by the affected countries; the impact of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> presidential and congressional election results affecting the economy, future government laws and regulations and trade policy matters, such as the imposition of tariffs and other import restrictions; potential disruption of shipping routes due to accidents, climate-related incidents, adverse weather and natural disasters, environmental factors, political events, public health threats, acts by terrorists or acts of piracy on ocean-going vessels; damage to storage and receiving facilities; potential liability from future litigation and potential costs due to environmental damage and vessel collisions; and the length and number of off-hire periods and dependence on third-party managers.</p><p>In the light of these risks and uncertainties, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements contained in this release because they are statements about events that are not certain to occur as described or at all.

Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, including but not limited to the following: iQIYI’s strategies; iQIYI’s future business development, financial condition and results of operations; iQIYI’s ability to retain and increase the number of users, members and advertising customers, and expand its service offerings; competition in the online entertainment industry; changes in iQIYI's revenues, costs or expenditures; Chinese governmental policies and regulations relating to the online entertainment industry, general economic and business conditions globally and in China and assumptions underlying or related to any of the foregoing.

All information provided in this press release and in the attachments is as of the date of the press release, and iQIYI undertakes no duty to update such information, except as required under applicable law.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">To supplement iQIYI’s consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, iQIYI uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income/(loss), non-GAAP operating income/(loss) margin, non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to iQIYI, non-GAAP diluted net income/(loss) attributable to iQIYI per ADS and free cash flow. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.</p> <p align=\"justify\">iQIYI believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its operating performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of its business operating results, such as operating performance excluding non-cash charges or non-operating in nature. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to the non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to iQIYI’s historical operating performance. The Company believes the non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that the non-GAAP measures exclude certain items that have been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant component in the Company’s results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to the Company’s data.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Non-GAAP operating income/(loss) represents operating income/(loss) excluding share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from business combinations.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to iQIYI, Inc. represents net income/(loss) attributable to iQIYI, Inc. excluding share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from business combinations, disposal gain or loss, impairment of long-term investments, fair value change of long-term investments, adjusted for related income tax effects. iQIYI’s share of equity method investments for these non-GAAP reconciling items, primarily amortization and impairment of intangible assets not on the investees’ books, accretion of their redeemable non-controlling interests, and the gain or loss associated with the issuance of shares by the investees at a price higher or lower than the carrying value per share, adjusted for related income tax effects, are also excluded.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Non-GAAP diluted net income/(loss) per ADS represents diluted net income/(loss) per ADS calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to iQIYI, Inc, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares expressed in ADS.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.</p> <p align=\"justify\">For more information, please contact:</p> <p align=\"justify\">Investor Relations<br/>iQIYI, Inc.<br/><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=c7-SLfUfvb3rgvo7lhbdd-I__c5gQ4IAcJ8WRZQlCeIUQEm949L7pR5N9bGIG-Z4hvfhXfAHJzXhx2YzUZeGJA==\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ir@qiyi.com</a></p> <table align=\"center\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

Baidu is a leading AI company with strong Internet foundation, trading on NASDAQ under \"<a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/BIDU/\" title=\"View BIDU stock overview\">BIDU</a>\" and HKEX under \"9888\".

Statements that are not historical facts, including but not limited to statements about Baidu's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements.

The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.</p><p>Baidu believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of its recurring core business operating results, such as operating performance excluding non-cash charges or non-operating in nature. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Baidu's historical performance and liquidity. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that these non-GAAP measures exclude certain items that have been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant component in the Company's results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to the Company's data.</p><p>Non-GAAP operating income represents operating income excluding share-based compensation expenses, amortization and impairment of intangible assets resulting from business combinations, impairment of long-lived assets, and one-time employee severance costs.</p><p>Non-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu represents net income attributable to Baidu excluding share-based compensation expenses, amortization and impairment of intangible assets resulting from business combinations, impairment of long-lived assets, one-time employee severance costs, disposal gain or loss, impairment of long-term investments, and fair value gain or loss of long-term investments and exchangeable bonds, adjusted for related income tax effects. Baidu's share of equity method investments for these non-GAAP reconciling items, amortization and impairment of intangible assets not on the investees' books, accretion of their redeemable non-controlling interests, and the gain or loss associated with the issuance of shares by the investees at a price higher or lower than the carrying value per share, adjusted for related income tax effects, are also excluded.</p><p>Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS represents diluted earnings per ADS calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares expressed in ADS. Adjusted EBITDA represents non-GAAP operating income excluding depreciation of fixed assets, and amortization of intangible assets excluding those resulting from business combinations. Adjusted long-term investments represent long-term investments, net, with publicly listed equity method investments adjusted to fair value based on quoted market prices.</p><p>For more information on non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned \"Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measure.\"</p><p> </p><div><table border=\"0\"

T</money>his historical exploration dataset includes 16 drill logs, drill core assays, surface sampling and radiometric surveys that were completed by BlueRock Resources Inc. (\"Bluerock\") during its 2006-2007 exploration program at what is now the Cross Bones Project.  During that time, Bluerock held an option to acquire an interest in the project from Energy Metals Corporation in what was then known as the Skull Creek Project.</p><p>Included in the data package is the location of dozens of historical drill holes completed on the Cross Bones Property in 1978 by Ashland Minerals. Homeland had already acquired the geological and wireline logs for many of these holes during a previous data purchase (see the Company's news release dated December 10, 2024).</p><p>Roger Lemaitre, President and Chief Executive Officer of Homeland Uranium, stated, \"<i>This data acquisition is a key step in our process of evaluating and developing the Cross Bones Property and will help us move this project forward on a much quicker timeframe than we previously anticipated. Once consolidated with our existing data and the entire package re-interpreted, this data will likely save the Company considerable future exploration costs, as we anticipate much of the historical drilling will not have to be redone.\"</i></p><p>The Company will be reviewing this new data, compiling it with the previously acquired data and will be undertaking a new interpretation of the Cross Bones Property over the next few months, with the objective of permitting, planning and executing a mapping, sampling and initial drilling program at the Cross Bones Property prior to the end of 2026.</p><p>The Cross Bones Property is located in northwestern Colorado, near the communities of Rangely and Dinosaur, within the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau. The Colorado Plateau is a regionally significant uranium province that spans Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico and hosts numerous sandstone-hosted uranium deposits.</p><p><b>Homeland at the PDAC</b></p><p>The Company is pleased to announce that it will be attending the 2026 Prospectors and Developers of Canada Convention from March 1<sup>st</sup> through March 4<sup>th</sup> in Toronto, Ontario.  Homeland is excited for the opportunity to meet shareholders and investors at our booth (#2623) on the Investors Exchange during all four days of the Convention.</p><p><b>Company Announces Milestone Payment</b></p><p>The Company announces the issuance of 4,500,000 common shares (the \"Milestone Payment Shares\") of the Company and the cash payment of US<money>$500,000 t</money>o former shareholders of Shift Rare Metals Inc.

These statements are made under the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as \"will,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"future,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" and similar statements. Among other things, the business outlook and quotations from management in this announcement, as well as Vipshop's strategic and operational plans, contain forward-looking statements. Vipshop may also make written or oral forward-looking statements in its periodic reports to the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), in its annual report to shareholders, in press releases and other written materials, and in oral statements made by its officers, directors, or employees to third parties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about Vipshop's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, including but not limited to the following: Vipshop's goals and strategies; Vipshop's future business development, results of operations and financial condition; the expected growth of the online discount retail market in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>; Vipshop's ability to attract customers and brand partners and further enhance its brand recognition; Vipshop's expectations regarding needs for and market acceptance of flash sales products and services; competition in the discount retail industry; fluctuations in general economic and business conditions in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> and assumptions underlying or related to any of the foregoing. Further information regarding these and other risks is included in Vipshop's filings with the SEC. All information provided in this press release is as of the date of this press release, and Vipshop does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required under applicable law.</p><p><b>Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures</b></p><p>The condensed consolidated financial information is derived from the Company's unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States of America</location> (\"<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> GAAP\"), except that comparative consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the period presented and the detailed footnote disclosures required by Accounting Standards Codification 270, Interim Reporting (\"ASC270\") have been omitted. Vipshop uses non-GAAP net income attributable to Vipshop's shareholders, non-GAAP net income attributable to Vipshop's shareholders per diluted ADS, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net margin attributable to Vipshop's shareholders, and free cash flow, each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure. For the periods presented in this press release, non-GAAP net income attributable to Vipshop's shareholders is net income attributable to Vipshop's shareholders excluding (i) share-based compensation expenses, (ii) impairment loss of investments, (iii) investment gain and revaluation of investments excluding dividends, (iv) reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, and (v) tax effects on non-GAAP adjustments. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Vipshop's shareholders per diluted ADS is computed using non-GAAP net income attributable to Vipshop's shareholders divided by weighted average number of diluted ADS outstanding for computing diluted earnings per ADS. Non-GAAP income from operations is income from operations excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP operating margin is non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of total net revenues. Non-GAAP net margin attributable to Vipshop's shareholders is non-GAAP net income attributable to Vipshop's shareholders as a percentage of total net revenues. Free cash flow is net cash from operating activities adding back the impact from internet financing activities and less capital expenditures, which include purchase and deposits of property and equipment and land use rights. Impact from internet financing activities added back or deducted from free cash flow contains changes in the balances of financial products, which are primarily consumer financing and supplier financing that the Company provides to customers and suppliers. The Company believes that separate analysis and exclusion of the non-cash impact of (i) share-based compensation expenses, (ii) impairment loss of investments, (iii) investment gain and revaluation of investments excluding dividends, (iv) reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, and (v) tax effects on non-GAAP adjustments add clarity to the constituent parts of its performance. The Company reviews these non-GAAP financial measures together with GAAP financial measures to obtain a better understanding of its operating performance. It uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning, forecasting, and measuring results against the forecast. The Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures are useful supplemental information for investors and analysts to assess its operating performance without the effect of (i) share-based compensation expenses, (ii) impairment loss of investments, (iii) investment gain and revaluation of investments excluding dividends, (iv) reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, and (v) tax effects on non-GAAP adjustments. Free cash flow enables the Company to assess liquidity and cash flow, taking into account the impact from internet financing activities and the financial resources needed for the expansion of fulfillment infrastructure, technology platform, and Shan Shan Outlets. Share-based compensation expenses have been and will continue to be significant recurring expenses in its business. However, the use of non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations as an analytical tool. One of the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not include all items that impact the Company's net income for the period. In addition, because non-GAAP financial measures are not measured in the same manner by all companies, they may not be comparable to other similar titled measures used by other companies. One of the key limitations of free cash flow is that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.</p><p>The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> GAAP.

As a result, solar product market prices rebounded from the third quarter onward, with the polysilicon sector posting the most notable gains. Following with this trend, our utilization rate increased from <percent>33%</percent> in Q1 to <percent>55%</percent> in Q4, bringing our annual production volume to 123,652 MT in line with our guidance of 121,000 MT to 124,000 MT, representing a <percent>39.7%</percent> year-over-year decrease from 205,068 MT in 2024. Furthermore, our 2025 sales volume reached 126,707 MT, exceeding production volume and reducing year-end inventory to a reasonable level.</p><p>\"In the second half of 2025, we strategically ramped up sales efforts to capitalize on favorable pricing dynamics. The strong market response highlighted growing customer confidence in our product quality and their continued preference for our brand in this new pricing environment. However, polysilicon ASPs decreased <percent>7.2%</percent> from <money><money>$5.66</money></money>/kg in 2024 to <money><money>$5.25</money></money>/kg in 2025. This lower pricing, combined with reduced sales volumes, resulted in revenue of <money><money>$665 million</money></money> in 2025, compared to <money><money>$1.0 billion</money></money> in 2024. Despite the decline in our top-line, we significantly narrowed our losses during the year as compared to 2024. In particular, EBITDA swung to a positive <money><money>$1.7 million</money></money> in 2025, compared to negative <money><money>$337.4 million</money></money> in 2024, while net loss attributable to Daqo New Energy Corp. shareholders narrowed to <money><money>$170.5 million</money></money> from <money><money>$345.2 million</money></money> in 2024. Moreover, we generated a <money><money>$56.1 million</money></money> in positive operating cash flow in 2025, marking a notable turnaround from the <money><money>$435 million</money></money> outflow recorded in 2024.\"</p><p>\"We continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and ample cash reserves. At the end of 2025, we had a cash balance of <money><money>$980 million</money></money>, short-term investments of <money><money>$114 million</money></money>, bank notes receivable of <money><money>$136 million</money></money>, and a fixed term bank deposit balance of <money><money>$1.0 billion</money></money>. In total, these highly liquid assets stood at <money><money>$2.27 billion</money></money>, representing an increase of <money><money>$57 million</money></money> compared to the end of the previous quarter. This solid financial foundation provides us with confidence and strategic flexibility to navigate the ongoing market recovery and capitalize on long-term opportunities.\"</p><p>\"Operationally, we continued to implement proactive measures in Q4 to mitigate market oversupply, including operating at a nameplate capacity utilization rate of <percent>55%</percent>. Total polysilicon production for the fourth quarter was 42,181 MT, in line with our guidance range of 39,500 to 42,500 MT, and our sales volume for the quarter reached 38,167 MT. In addition, we comprehensively reduced our production costs through process improvements, manufacturing efficiency gains, and raw material cost optimization. Extending our ongoing cost reduction initiatives, total production costs declined by <percent>9%</percent> to <money><money>$5.83</money></money>/kg in Q4 2025 from <money><money>$6.38</money></money>/kg in Q3 2025. Total idle facility-related costs, which consist primarily of non-cash depreciation expenses alongside approximately <money><money>$0.10</money></money>/kg in cash costs for maintenance, also fell to <money><money>$0.74</money></money>/kg in Q4 from <money><money>$1.18</money></money>/kg in Q3, driven by higher production levels. Notably, cash costs decreased by <percent>2%</percent> from <money><money>$4.54</money></money>/kg in Q3 to a new record low of <money><money>$4.46</money></money>/kg in Q4.\"</p><p>\"In light of current market conditions, we expect our total polysilicon production volume in the first quarter of 2026 to be approximately 35,000 MT to 40,000 MT, and our full year 2026 production volume to be in the range of 140,000 MT to 170,000 MT.\"</p><p>\"Chinese authorities demonstrated strong resolve in tackling irrational competition and industry overcapacity, formally designating anti-involution as a national priority within <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China's</location> 15th Five-Year Plan, and the solar PV industry was a key focus of these efforts. These initiatives have driven a structural shift from price-based competition to value-driven differentiation. To advance industry governance, authorities deployed targeted measures including standards guidance, quality supervision, price enforcement, and promotion of technological progress. Specifically, this involved updating legislative frameworks, such as the revised Anti-Unfair Competition Law and the draft amendment to the Price Law, which mandate that sales shall not be below cost. Furthermore, a new mandatory national standard was drafted to set strict energy consumption limits for polysilicon production on a per unit basis.\"</p><p>\"Led by the China Photovoltaic Industry Association, major polysilicon manufacturers have proactively responded to these initiatives, enforcing self-discipline and exploring innovative, market-oriented approaches to combat excess capacity and pricing violations. These coordinated efforts have yielded measurable results in curbing overcapacity. The overall production volumes fell by <percent>28.4%</percent> to 1.32 million MT in 2025, and market prices surged more than <percent>50%</percent> from the mid-2025 lows to RMB50–56/kg by year-end. Looking ahead, we expect anti-involution initiatives will remain a central theme for the solar PV industry, supporting a more balanced supply and demand dynamic and driving higher-quality growth through 2026.\"</p><p>\"More broadly, the solar PV industry continues to exhibit compelling long-term growth prospects. In 2025, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China's</location> newly installed solar PV capacity grew <percent>14%</percent> year-over-year to 317 GW, setting yet another record high and proving that market potential continues to exceed expectations. As the global AI industry scales rapidly, space-based solar power is increasingly viewed as a vital solution to the immense and expanding energy demands of AI data centers, creating a significant new growth engine for the sector. Looking ahead, as one of the world's lowest-cost producers of the highest-quality N-type polysilicon with a strong balance sheet and no debt, we remain optimistic about the sector and believe we are ideally positioned to capitalize on the market recovery and these long-term growth opportunities. We will continue to strengthen our competitive edge through advancements in high-efficiency N-type technology and cost optimization via digital transformation and AI adoption. As the world accelerates its transition to clean energy, we are confident in our ability to play a leading role in powering that future.\"</p><p><b><i>Outlook and guidance</i></b></p><p>The Company expects to produce approximately 35,000 MT to 40,000 MT of polysilicon during the first quarter of 2026. The Company expects to produce approximately 140,000 MT to 170,000 MT of polysilicon for the full year of 2026, inclusive of the impact of the Company's annual facility maintenance.</p><p>This outlook reflects Daqo New Energy's current and preliminary view as of the date of this press release and may be subject to changes.

Our management believes that each of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors, enabling them to better assess changes in key element of the Company's results of operations across different reporting periods on a consistent basis, independent of certain items as described below. Thus, our management believes that, used in conjunction with US GAAP financial measures, these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with meaningful supplemental information to assess the Company's operating results in a manner that is focused on its ongoing, core operating performance. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to assess the business, its financial performance, current and historical results, as well as for strategic decision-making and forecasting future results. Given our management's use of these non-GAAP measures, the Company believes these measures are important to investors in understanding the Company's operating results as seen through the eyes of our management. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with US GAAP or intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with US GAAP; the non-GAAP measures should be reviewed together with the US GAAP measures, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.</p><p>The Company uses EBITDA, which represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and EBITDA margin, which represents the proportion of EBITDA in revenues. Adjusted net income attributable to Daqo New Energy Corp. shareholders and adjusted earnings per basic and diluted ADS exclude costs related to share-based compensation. Share-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies from period to period. As a result, our management excludes this item from our internal operating forecasts and models. Our management believes that this adjustment for share-based compensation provides investors with a basis to measure the Company's core performance, including compared with the performance of other companies, without the period-to-period variability created by share-based compensation.</p><p>A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable US GAAP measures is presented later in this document.</p><p><b>Conference Call</b></p><p>The Company has scheduled a conference call to discuss the results at 8:00 AM <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Eastern Time on Thursday, February 26, 2026 (9:00 PM Beijing / Hong Kong time on the same day).</p><p>The dial-in details for the earnings conference call are as follows:</p><p>Participant dial in (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> toll free): +1-888-346-8982</p><p>Participant international dial in: +1-412-902-4272</p><p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> mainland toll free: 4001-201203</p><p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong</location> toll free: 800-905945</p><p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong</location> local toll: +852-301-84992</p><p>Please dial in 10 minutes before the call is scheduled to begin and ask to join the Daqo New Energy Corp. call.</p><p>Webcast link:</p><p><a href=\"https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=ba7I5r8H\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=ba7I5r8H</a></p><p>A replay of the call will be available 1 hour after the conclusion of the conference call through March 5, 2026.
