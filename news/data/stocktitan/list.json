We continue to work with Cullgen for approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, one of the closing conditions of the Merger. Pulmatrix and Cullgen agreed to waive the \"No Solicitation\" clause in the Merger Agreement to permit each party to explore transactions that may benefit our respective companies while still seeking approval from the CSRC. In conjunction with the proposed merger, Pulmatrix is currently in a process to license or partner its patent portfolio encompassing our iSPERSE™ technology, as well as three related clinical programs, including our Phase 2 ready acute migraine program.</p><p><b><i>Proposed Merger with Cullgen</i></b></p><p>As previously reported, on November 13, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Cullgen Inc. (\"Cullgen\"), as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto on April 7, 2025 (the \"Merger Agreement\" and such transaction, the \"Merger\"). If the proposed Merger is completed, the business of Cullgen will continue as the business of the combined company.</p><p>Additional information about the Merger Agreement and proposed Merger was previously disclosed in a registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-284993) initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") on February 14, 2025, as amended on April 17, 2025, and May 7, 2025, and declared effective on May 9, 2025.</p><p>On June 16, 2025, the Company held a special meeting in lieu of the 2025 annual meeting of Pulmatrix stockholders, at which the Company's stockholders approved the Merger and related proposals. The closing of the Merger is subject to other customary closing conditions, including Nasdaq's approval of the listing of the shares of Pulmatrix common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger and approval from the CSRC.</p><p>On December 17, 2025, the Company and Cullgen mutually agreed to waive the \"No Solicitation\" clause in the Merger Agreement in order to permit each party to explore alternate transactions while continuing to work toward merger approval from the CSRC.</p><p><b>Pulmatrix Currently Seeking License or Monetization of Clinical Assets and Proprietary iSPERSE™ Technology</b></p><p><b><i>iSPERSE™ Technology</i></b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>iSPERSE™, also licensed to MannKind Corporation and Cipla Technologies for certain fields of use, utilizes particles that are engineered with a small, dense and dispersible profile to exceed the performance of traditional dry powder particles as the iSPERSE™ particles have the dispersibility advantages of porous engineered particles. Pulmatrix believes this results in superior drug delivery compared to traditional oral and injectable forms of treatment for certain diseases.<br/><br/></li><li>As of December 31, 2025, Pulmatrix's patent portfolio related to iSPERSE™ included approximately 149 granted patents, 18 of which are <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location>-granted patents, plus approximately 48 pending patent applications in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> and other jurisdictions.</li></ul><p><b><i>PUR3100</i></b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>PUR3100, a Phase 2-ready asset, is an orally inhaled dihydroergotamine (\"DHE\") engineered with Pulmatrix's iSPERSE™ dry powder inhalation technology for the treatment of acute migraine has a Food and Drug Administration acceptance of an Investigational New Drug (\"IND\") application for PUR3100 and receipt of a \"study may proceed\" letter to proceed with a Phase 2 study. The IND includes a Phase 2 clinical protocol where safety and preliminary efficacy of PUR3100 will be investigated in patients with acute migraine.<br/><br/></li><li>The Phase 2 IND builds on the Phase 1 trial results of PUR3100, which were published in 2024 in the peer-reviewed publication, <i>Headache: The Journal of Head and Face Pain</i>. The study showed that PUR3100 achieved peak exposures in the targeted therapeutic range and time to maximum concentration occurred at five minutes after dosing at all dosing levels. The PUR3100 dose groups also showed a lower incidence of nausea and no vomiting compared to observations of nausea and vomiting in the intravenously (\"IV\") administered DHE dose group.</li></ul><p><b><i>PUR1800</i></b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>PUR1800 is a Narrow Spectrum Kinase Inhibitor (\"NSKI\"), engineered with our iSPERSE™ technology, for the treatment of acute exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (\"AECOPD\"). In 2023, Pulmatrix presented complete results from a Phase 1b study of PUR1800 for AECOPD, indicating PUR1800 was well-tolerated with no observed safety signals. The topline data, along with the results from chronic toxicology studies, support the continued development of PUR1800 for the treatment of AECOPD and other inflammatory respiratory diseases.<br/><br/></li><li>In 2024, Pulmatrix published an abstract titled \"<i>Ex vivo</i> evaluation of the potential for Narrow Spectrum Kinase inhibitors as a treatment for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis\".</li></ul><p><b><i>PUR1900</i></b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>PUR1900, approved to proceed to a Phase 3 in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/in\">India</location> conducted by our partner Cipla, is the Company's inhaled iSPERSE™ formulation of the antifungal drug itraconazole being investigated for various indications. The Company and its partner, Cipla, wound down a Phase 2b trial that the Company was operating in 2024. Cipla has continued clinical development outside <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>, and in 2025 completed their Phase 2 study in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/in\">India</location> and have been approved by <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/in\">India's</location> Central Drug Standard Control Organization to proceed with a Phase 3 clinical trial.<br/><br/></li><li>Pulmatrix will receive <percent>2%</percent> royalties on any potential future net sales by Cipla outside <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> should Cipla successfully market PUR1900 outside <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>. Within <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>, the Company and Cipla share the rights 50/50 and will seek to monetize PUR1900 for indications where an orally inhaled antifungal may provide a therapeutic benefit or fulfill an unmet medical need.</li></ul><p><b>Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2025 Financial Results</b></p><p>Revenues decreased to nil for the year ended December 31, 2025, compared to <money><money>$7.8 million</money></money> for the year ended December 31, 2024. Revenues recognized for the year ended December 31, 2024, were primarily generated from the Cipla Agreement as related to our PUR1900 program, for which wind down activities were completed during the year ended December 31, 2024.</p><p>Research and development expenses decreased approximately <money><money>$7.1 million</money></money> to less than <money><money>$0.1 million</money></money> for the year ended December 31, 2025, compared to <money><money>$7.2 million</money></money> for the year ended December 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the wind down of the PUR1900 Phase 2b clinical trial, disposal of the Company's lab and facilities lease and employee terminations.</p><p>General and administrative expenses decreased approximately <money><money>$2.7 million</money></money> to <money><money>$5.1 million</money></money> for the year ended December 31, 2025, compared to <money><money>$7.8 million</money></money> for the year ended December 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to decreased employment and other operating costs due to the previously mentioned wind down, partially offset by incurred costs related to the proposed Merger.</p><p>The Company's total cash and cash equivalents balance as of December 31, 2025, was <money><money>$4.1 million</money></money>, compared to 9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company anticipates that its cash position, based on current operational efficiencies and prioritization of spending, is sufficient to fund its operations into the first quarter of 2027.</p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"prnbcc\"><tr><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"9\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span

In addition, non-cash forgivable loan amortization, which is reflected as an expense when presenting EBITDA metrics, is expected to increase approximately <money><money>$15 million</money></money>, or more than <percent>30%</percent> year over year, in fiscal 2026 due to the increase in talent investments completed in fiscal 2025. Finally, as a reminder, fiscal 2026 returns to CRA’s typical 52-week year, whereas fiscal 2025 contained an extra week and resulted in a 53-week year. While we are pleased with CRA’s strong performance in 2025, we remain mindful that uncertain global macroeconomic, business, and political conditions can affect our business.”</p><p>CRA does not provide reconciliations of its annual non-GAAP EBITDA margin guidance to GAAP net income margin because the Company is unable to estimate with reasonable certainty unusual gains or charges, foreign currency exchange rates, and the resulting effect of these items, and of equity awards, on CRA’s taxes without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and may have a material effect on CRA’s results computed in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between the historical GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release is provided in the financial tables at the end of this press release.</p><p><b>Share Repurchase Expansion and Quarterly Dividend</b></p><p>On February 26, 2026, CRA’s Board of Directors authorized a <money><money>$55.0 million</money></money> expansion of the Company’s existing share repurchase program, in addition to the <money><money>$10.9 million</money></money> currently remaining under the program. CRA may repurchase shares of its common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations. The timing, amount and extent to which CRA repurchases shares will depend upon market conditions and other factors it may consider in its sole discretion.</p><p>The Board of Directors also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of <money><money>$0.57</money></money> per common share, payable on March 20, 2026 to shareholders of record as of March 10, 2026.

CRA believes that the non-GAAP financial measures described in this press release are important to management and investors because these measures supplement the understanding of CRA’s ongoing operating results and financial condition. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are used by CRA in its budgeting process, and the non-GAAP adjustments are made to the performance measures for some of CRA’s performance-based compensation.</p><p>As used herein, CRA defines non-GAAP EBITDA as net income before interest expense (net), provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization further adjusted for the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance, such as non-cash amounts relating to valuation changes in contingent consideration, acquisition-related costs, foreign currency (gains) losses, net, restructuring costs and related tax effects. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share also exclude non-cash amounts relating to valuation changes in contingent consideration, acquisition-related costs, foreign currency (gains) losses, net, restructuring costs and related tax effects. This press release also presents certain current fiscal period financial measures on a “constant currency” basis in order to isolate the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations can have on CRA’s financial results. These constant currency measures are determined by recalculating the current fiscal period local currency financial measure using the specified corresponding prior fiscal period’s foreign exchange rates.</p><p>All of the non-GAAP financial measures referred to above should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for, the GAAP financial information presented in this press release. The financial measures identified in this press release as “non-GAAP” are reconciled to their GAAP comparable measures in the financial tables appended to the end of this press release. In evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures, note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by CRA may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.</p><p><b>SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT</b></p><p><i>Statements in this press release concerning our future business, operating results and financial condition, including those concerning guidance on future revenue and non-GAAP EBITDA margin, the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results, our expectations regarding continued growth, our expectations regarding the payment of any future quarterly dividends and the level and extent of any purchases under our expanded share repurchase program, and statements using the terms “outlook,” “expect,” or similar expressions, are “forward-looking” statements as defined in Section 21 of the Exchange Act. These statements are based upon our current expectations and various underlying assumptions. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for these statements and assumptions, and these statements are expressed in good faith, these statements are subject to a number of additional factors and uncertainties. Our actual revenue and non-GAAP EBITDA margin in fiscal 2026 on a constant currency basis relative to fiscal 2025 could differ materially from the guidance presented herein, and our actual performance and results may differ materially from the performance and results contained in or implied by the forward-looking statements made herein, due to many important factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the possibility that the demand for our services may decline as a result of changes in general and industry specific economic conditions; the timing of engagements for our services; the effects of competitive services and pricing; the development and use of artificial intelligence; our ability to attract and retain key employee or non-employee experts; the inability to integrate and utilize existing consultants and personnel; the decline or reduction in project work or activity; global economic conditions including less stable political and economic environments; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; unanticipated expenses and liabilities; risks inherent in international operations; changes in tax law or accounting standards, rules, and regulations; our ability to collect on forgivable loans should any become due; and professional and other legal liability or settlements. Additional risks and uncertainties are discussed in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the heading “Risk Factors.” The inclusion of such forward-looking information should not be regarded as our representation that the future events, plans, or expectations contemplated will be achieved. Except as may be required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this press release, and we do not intend to do so.</i> </p><table

The Company believes that the presentation of these adjusted financial measures is useful to investors as they provide additional information on comparisons between periods by including certain items that affect overall comparability. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for business planning purposes and to consider underlying trends of its business. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our use of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures reported by other companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures.

Our growth is powered by four iconic brands with deep heritage in their communities and enduring guest loyalty, supported by exceptional franchisees and great talent around the world,\" said Josh Kobza, Chief Executive Officer of RBI. \"As we look toward 2028 and beyond, we see a highly franchised, asset-light business delivering consistent <percent>5%</percent>+ Net Restaurant Growth, predictable earnings growth, and strong double-digit total shareholder returns. The strength of our brands and the quality of our teams position us to compound value for all our stakeholders for many years to come.\"</p><p>Sami Siddiqui, Chief Financial Officer, commented: \"We're committed to becoming a simpler, <percent>99%</percent> franchised business over the next few years. Our business generates significant free cash flow, which gives us substantial capital allocation flexibility. We've always prioritized investing in our brands, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and returning excess cash to shareholders through our attractive dividend. We're resuming share repurchases in 2026, and we've made the decision to become an investment-grade company. We believe we're only two years away from achieving corporate investment-grade leverage, which, once achieved, will unlock meaningful long-term flexibility for our business.\"</p><p>Patrick Doyle, Executive Chairman, commented: \"When I invested in RBI three years ago, I saw a company with great brands, great food, great people, and great franchisees executing the fundamentals that drive long-term success in this business. Today, we're delivering on exactly what attracted me to invest in this company. RBI continues to make the right long-term decisions for the business. We allocate capital well and keep franchisee profitability at the center of our decision-making. I cannot imagine a more exciting time to be part of the RBI story.\"</p><p><b>CLEAR PATH TO <percent>5%</percent>+ NET RESTAURANT GROWTH </b></p><p>RBI outlined three building blocks to achieve <percent>5%</percent>+ Net Restaurant Growth by 2028, representing approximately 1,800 net new restaurants per year by 2028. Outside of Burger King China, RBI's Net Restaurant Growth has averaged <percent>4.0%</percent> over the past five years, underscoring the strength and diversity of the core development engine.</p><p><b><i>US and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location> (300-400 net new restaurants per year by 2028):</i></b> Growth in the US and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location> is expected to be driven by Firehouse Subs, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes. Firehouse Subs is expected to contribute approximately half of the net new units in the US and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location>, with 150-200 net new units per year, driven by improving brand awareness and strong unit economics, with paybacks under four years, on average. The remaining 150-200 net new units will be roughly split between Tim Hortons and Popeyes. Tim Hortons Canada growth is supported by opportunities in underpenetrated regions including <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Western Canada</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.qc\">Quebec</location>, as well as attractive paybacks, which are less than three years on average. In the US, the team is on track to continue accelerating development in both existing and new markets, like <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.de\">Delaware</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tn\">Tennessee</location>, New <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.york\">York, Michigan</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location>, and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location>. While Popeyes tempered development in 2025, the team is laying the operational groundwork to position the brand to reaccelerate in the years ahead.</p><p><b><i><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> (300-400 net new restaurants per year by 2028):</i></b> Burger King China's partnership with CPE, announced in November 2025, is on track to deliver over 200 net new units in 2028, with continued acceleration after 2028, as CPE executes on its commitment to double the brand's footprint to 2,500 restaurants within five years. CPE's <money><money>$350 million</money></money> primary capital investment is intended to fully fund this development. Popeyes China and Tim Hortons China are expected to contribute the remaining 100-200 combined net new units in 2028 as both businesses scale.</p><p><b><i>International Excluding China (approximately 1,100 net new restaurants per year by 2028):</i></b> Top 10 growth markets including <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/in\">India</location>, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/mx\">Mexico</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/fr\">France</location>, and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/jp\">Japan</location> are expected to deliver approximately 700 units per year by 2028, supported by strong unit economics, with paybacks under four and a half years, on average. The remaining international portfolio of around 175 brand-market combinations are expected to contribute approximately 400 new units per year.</p><p><b>BURGER KING RECLAIM THE FLAME GROWTH STRATEGY DELIVERING RESULTS</b></p><p>Tom Curtis, President of Burger King US and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location>, provided an update on <i>Reclaim the Flame</i>, the brand's comprehensive growth strategy, which has delivered four years of burger <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/QSR/\" title=\"View QSR stock overview\">QSR</a> industry Comparable Sales outperformance since launching in 2022. The brand has moved from 10th to 6th place in industry guest experience rankings, increased modern image penetration from <percent>37%</percent> in 2021 to <percent>58%</percent> in 2025, and improved franchisee profitability from a low of around <money><money>$125,000</money></money> to approximately <money><money>$205,000</money></money> in both 2023 and 2024. Looking through the impact of temporary beef inflation and ad fund transfers, franchisee profitability grew in 2025, demonstrating that actions within the brand's control are working to expand profitability even during a challenging environment.</p><p>In addition, Burger King franchisees have voted to continue their elevated ad fund contribution of <percent>4.5%</percent> of sales through at least 2027, with <percent>97%</percent> voting to support the continued advertising firepower. The ad fund rate will continue at this level in 2028 if the business achieves <money><money>$230,000</money></money> in franchisee profitability by the end of 2027 or if the franchisees vote to extend again. This continued investment supports sustained marketing share of voice and demonstrates strong franchisee confidence in the brand's trajectory.</p><p>Looking ahead, Burger King will elevate culinary quality, beginning with enhancements to the Whopper, including new glazed buns, creamier mayonnaise, and upgraded clamshell packaging. In 2026, the brand will also launch a major campaign reinforcing its commitment to listening to and acting on guest feedback. Additionally, Burger King sees meaningful opportunity to win with families and kids, who represent just <percent>10%</percent> of the brand's traffic today.</p><p>The Company also introduced BK Assistant, an AI-powered tool designed to streamline restaurant operations by providing managers and team members with instant access to operational guidelines, inventory management, and compliance tracking, enabling them to focus more on guest service and team leadership.</p><p><b>SIMPLIFICATION ROADMAP AND CAPITAL ALLOCATION UPDATE </b></p><p>Sami Siddiqui, Chief Financial Officer, outlined RBI's simplification roadmap and enhanced capital allocation framework, and emphasized the transition to a <percent>99%</percent> franchised model, corporate investment-grade leverage by 2028, and resumption of share repurchases, with around <money><money>$500 million</money></money> expected in 2026. Share repurchases are expected to grow over time as the Company uses the majority of annual excess free cash flow for buybacks, with capacity to accelerate further once investment grade is achieved. In addition, RBI committed to its durable and growing dividend, with a long-term target payout ratio of around <percent>60%</percent>.</p><p>RBI's algorithm of <percent>3%</percent>+ Comparable Sales and <percent>5%</percent>+ Net Restaurant Growth continues to support <percent>8%</percent>+ organic Adjusted Operating Income growth on average through 2028. Three core structural drivers underpin this outlook: first, ramping to <percent>5%</percent>+ Net Restaurant Growth by 2028; second, a structural tailwind in the royalty rate as international markets scale and contractual royalty step-ups take effect; and third, disciplined cost management, with annual Segment G&amp;A growth of approximately <percent>2%</percent>, excluding Restaurant Holdings, creating meaningful operating leverage as System-wide Sales grow faster.</p><p><b><i>Restaurant Holdings to Sunset:</i></b> RBI is actively working to refranchise the Burger King US company restaurant portfolio to a base of approximately 300-500 home market restaurants and to place Popeyes China and Firehouse Brazil with long-term local partners. Both objectives are expected to be accomplished by the end of 2027, at which point the Restaurant Holdings segment will wind down. The long-term steady-state Burger King US company portfolio will target 300 restaurants across a few strategic markets.</p><p><b><i>Refined Capital Expenditures Outlook:</i></b> Total Capex and Cash Inducements is expected to be approximately <money><money>$400 million</money></money> in 2026 and 2027, stepping down to approximately <money><money>$300 million</money></money> in 2028 and thereafter as the Company finds long-term partners for Popeyes China and Firehouse Brazil, refranchises the vast majority of the Burger King US company restaurants, and largely concludes <i>Reclaim the Flame</i>. This trajectory supports significant free cash flow growth from approximately <money><money>$1.6 billion</money></money> in 2025 to more than <money><money>$2 billion</money></money> annually by 2028.</p><p><b><i>Investment Grade by 2028:</i></b> RBI is targeting net leverage of approximately 4.0x in 2026 and a long-term target of low- to mid-3x, which the Company expects to achieve by 2028 through earnings growth. Investment grade provides tangible benefits including lower relative cost of debt, access to deeper pools of capital, and the ability to issue longer-duration debt.</p><p>Until RBI becomes investment grade, the Company does not intend to fund share repurchases with incremental leverage. Once investment grade is achieved, RBI fully intends to operate within investment-grade leverage parameters while stepping up the quantum of buybacks with incremental leverage capacity each year as EBITDA grows.</p><p><b>2026 INVESTOR DAY</b></p><p>RBI's 2026 Investor Day featured presentations from Chief Executive Officer, Josh Kobza, Chief Financial Officer, Sami Siddiqui, Executive Chairman, Patrick Doyle, and Business Unit Presidents including Tom Curtis (Burger King US and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location>), Axel Schwan (Tim Hortons Canada and US), Thiago Santelmo (International), Peter Perdue (Popeyes US and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location>), and Mike Hancock (Firehouse Subs US and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location>).

Codere Online, launched in 2014 as part of the renowned casino operator Codere Group, offers online sports betting and online casino through its state-of-the art website and mobile applications. Codere Online currently operates in its core markets of Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Panama and Argentina; this online business is complemented by Codere Group’s physical presence in Spain and throughout Latin America, forming the foundation of the leading omnichannel gaming and casino presence.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><b>About Codere Group</b><br/>Codere Group is a multinational group dedicated to entertainment and leisure. It is a leading player in the private gaming industry, with four decades of experience and with presence in seven countries in Europe (Spain and Italy) and Latin America (Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Panama, and Uruguay).</p> <p align=\"justify\"><b>Note on Rounding. </b>Due to decimal rounding, numbers presented throughout this report may not add up precisely to the totals and subtotals provided, and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><b>Forward-Looking Statements </b><br/>Certain statements in this document may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding Codere Online Luxembourg, S.A. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Codere Online”) or Codere Online’s or its management team’s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “would” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements in this document may include, for example, statements about Codere Online’s financial performance and, in particular, the potential evolution and distribution of its net gaming revenue; any prospective and illustrative financial information; and changes in Codere Online’s strategy, future operations and target addressable market, financial position, estimated revenues and losses, projected costs, prospects and plans.</p> <p align=\"justify\">These forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this document and current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Codere Online’s or its management team’s views as of any subsequent date, and Codere Online does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.</p> <p align=\"justify\">As a result of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, Codere Online’s actual results or performance may be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Codere Online does not presently know or that Codere Online currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include (i) changes in applicable laws or regulations, including online gaming, privacy, data use and data protection rules and regulations as well as consumers’ heightened expectations regarding proper safeguarding of their personal information, (ii) the impacts and ongoing uncertainties created by regulatory restrictions, changes in perceptions of the gaming industry, changes in policies and increased competition, and geopolitical events such as war, (iii) the ability to implement business plans, forecasts, and other expectations and identify and realize additional opportunities, (iv) the risk of downturns and the possibility of rapid change in the highly competitive industry in which Codere Online operates, (v) the risk that Codere Online and its current and future collaborators are unable to successfully develop and commercialize Codere Online’s services, or experience significant delays in doing so, (vi) the risk that Codere Online may never achieve or sustain profitability, (vii) the risk that Codere Online will need to raise additional capital to execute its business plan, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, (viii) the risk that Codere Online experiences difficulties in managing its growth and expanding operations, (ix) the risk that third-party providers, including the Codere Group, are not able to fully and timely meet their obligations, (x) the risk that the online gaming operations will not provide the expected benefits due to, among other things, the inability to obtain or maintain online gaming licenses in the anticipated time frame or at all, (xi) the risk that Codere Online is unable to secure or protect its intellectual property, (xii) the risk that Codere Online’s securities may be delisted from Nasdaq and (xiii) the possibility that Codere Online may be adversely affected by other political, economic, business, and/or competitive factors. Additional information concerning certain of these and other risk factors is contained in Codere Online’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning Codere Online or other matters and attributable to Codere Online or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><b>Financial Information and Non-GAAP Financial Measures</b><br/>Codere Online’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”), which can differ in certain significant respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).</p> <p align=\"justify\">This document includes certain financial measures not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS (“non-GAAP”), such as, without limitation, net gaming revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and constant currency information. These non-GAAP financial measures are not measures of financial performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS and may exclude items that are significant in understanding and assessing Codere Online’s financial results. Therefore, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to revenue, net income, cash flows from operations or other measures of profitability, liquidity or performance under U.S. GAAP or IFRS. You should be aware that Codere Online’s presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. In addition, the audit of Codere Online’s financial statements in accordance with PCAOB standards, may impact how Codere Online currently calculates its non-GAAP financial measures, and we cannot assure you that there would not be differences, and such differences could be material.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Codere Online believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends in comparing Codere Online’s financial measures with other similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. These non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expense and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable measure under IFRS are included herein.</p> <p align=\"justify\">This document may include certain projections of non-GAAP financial measures. Codere Online is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP or IFRS financial measures without unreasonable effort, due to the inherent difficulty and variability of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact of the various adjusting items necessary for such comparable measures or such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted, ascertained or assessed, which could have a material impact on its future IFRS financial results. Consequently, no disclosure of estimated comparable U.S. GAAP or IFRS measures is included and no reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures is included.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><b>Use of Projections </b><br/>This document contains financial forecasts with respect to Codere Online’s business and projected financial results, including net gaming revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Codere Online’s independent auditors have not audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the projections for the purpose of their inclusion in this document, and accordingly, they did not express an opinion or provide any other form of assurance with respect thereto for the purpose of this document. These projections should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results. The assumptions and estimates underlying the prospective financial information are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the prospective financial information. See “Forward-Looking Statements” above. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the prospective results are indicative of the future performance of Codere Online or that actual results will not differ materially from those presented in the prospective financial information. Inclusion of the prospective financial information in this document should not be regarded as a representation by any person that the results contained in the prospective financial information will be achieved.</p> <p align=\"justify\">For further information on the limitations and assumptions underlying these projections, please refer to Codere Online’s filings with the SEC.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><b>Preliminary Information</b><br/>This document contains figures, financial metrics, statistics and other information that is preliminary and subject to change (the “Preliminary Information”). The Preliminary Information has not been audited, reviewed, or compiled by any independent registered public accounting firm. This Preliminary Information is subject to ongoing review including, where applicable, by Codere Online’s independent auditors. Accordingly, no independent registered public accounting firm has expressed an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the Preliminary Information. During the course of finalizing such Preliminary Information, adjustments to such Preliminary Information presented herein may be identified, which may be material. Codere Online undertakes no obligation to update or revise the Preliminary Information set forth in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law. The Preliminary Information may differ from actual results. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance upon this Preliminary Information. The Preliminary Information is not a comprehensive statement of financial results, and should not be viewed as a substitute for full financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the Preliminary Information is not necessarily indicative of the results to be achieved in any future period.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><b>No Offer or Solicitation </b><br/>This document does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor will there be any sale of securities in any states or jurisdictions in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. No offering of securities will be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or an exemption therefrom.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><b>Trademarks</b><br/>This document may contain trademarks, service marks, trade names and copyrights of Codere Online or other companies, which are the property of their respective owners.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 26, 2026) - <b>Tinka Resources Limited (TSXV: TK) (OTCQB: TKRFD) </b>(\"<b>Tinka</b>\" or the \"<b>Company</b>\") is pleased to provide an exploration update on the Ayawilca zinc-silver-tin project including a review of a high priority silver exploration vein target at West Ayawilca, and the results of the initial 1,400 metre drill program at the Silvia copper-gold project in Peru.  </p><p><b>Silvia NW Copper-Gold Project Drilling Highlights:</b></p><ul style=\"list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;\"><li>Hole S25-001:  15.1 metres @ <percent>0.17%</percent> copper and 0.26 g/t gold from 18.5 metres depth, incl. 4.1 metres @ <percent>0.54%</percent> copper and 0.86 g/t gold.  </li><li>Hole S25-002:  38.2 metres @ <percent>0.17%</percent> copper and 0.06 g/t gold from 15.9 metres depth, incl. 2.5 metres @ <percent>0.93%</percent> copper and 0.43 g/t gold. </li><li>Hole S25-004:  23.2 metres @ <percent>0.20%</percent> copper and 0.05 g/t gold from 231.8 metres depth, incl.  4.2 metres @ <percent>0.37%</percent> copper and 0.11 g/t gold.  </li></ul><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li>Next steps:  A ground geophysical survey including magnetotellurics (MT) covering several targets over a much larger area at Silvia NW (~ 2 km<sup>2</sup>) is planned for May 2026. </li></ul><p>Dr. Graham Carman, President and CEO of Tinka, stated:<i> \"The initial drilling at Silvia NW has intersected relatively narrow copper - gold zones so far, however the strong skarn alteration and coincidence of copper and gold is encouraging and suggests that a significant mineralizing source could be nearby.  The footprint drill area tested was also restricted in size, being a small part of the overall target area at Silvia.  Multiple copper-gold targets exist at Silvia NW covering several square kilometres, and the most prospective areas will be covered by a ground geophysical survey following cessation of the current wet season in May.\" </i></p><p><i>\"At Ayawilca, good progress is being made with our active discussions with the local communities to extend our social licence at the project for an additional three years.  Tinka has been working with these same communities for over 10 years, and our relationship remains strong.  More details of a drilling program at Ayawilca, scheduled for early Q3 2026, will be forthcoming.\" </i></p><p><b>Discussion of Silvia Drilling Results </b></p><p>Four diamond drill holes were completed at Silvia NW Area A between late October 2025 and early January 2026.  Three of the holes (S25-001, 002 and 004) were drilled on one section line with holes inclined to the west.  A fourth hole, S25-003, was drilled on a separate section approximately 100 metres to the north. An east-west cross section of the holes is shown in Figure 1.   A summary of the drill intercepts is presented in Table 1.  True width for intersections at Silvia cannot be accurately determined as the geometry of the mineralization remains unknown.</p><p>As foreshadowed in the initial Silvia drilling news release on <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/B5LVMuPYKj\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">January 23, 2026</a>, the intervals of copper-gold mineralization in the drill holes are restricted to relatively narrow intervals at the contacts of intrusive monzonite dikes with the limestone.  Skarn alteration (mostly green and brown garnets with later chlorite and quartz-carbonate) is strongly developed within a few metres of the contact zones.  Sulphides (chalcopyrite, pyrite, and minor pyrrhotite) are typically restricted to narrow veins or minor disseminations within the skarn.  It is encouraging that the copper and gold occur together.  More exploration is required to target stronger concentrations, and it should be noted the footprint of the area tested was restricted in size (~ 0.05 km <sup>2</sup>).    Silvia NW has multiple exploration targets for skarn, and potentially porphyry style mineralization, covering a much wider area of approximately 3 km <sup>2</sup>.  Area B has the largest area of mapped skarn alteration which will be covered by an upcoming magnetotellurics (MT) survey, and possibly an Induced Polarization (IP) geophysical survey - Figure 2.  </p><p><b>Table 1.

Good progress is being made with the local communities and we anticipate having one or more new agreements in place by mid-year.  This will allow commencement of a drill program at Ayawilca, and potentially at Colquipucro, Q3 of this year.  </p><p>While the social engagement discussions are ongoing, the Company is actively engaged in reinterpreting the structural controls and other geological characteristics of the main zones at Ayawilca.  Combined with metallurgical test work, some of which will rely on fresh samples from the upcoming drill program, we anticipate being able to produce a more accurate modelling of metallurgical domains and, by extension, a more robust economic model for future studies.  </p><p>Other work being carried out by the Company's geological team is the development and implementation of a framework for the ranking of targets in preparation for the upcoming drilling program.  In addition to plans for testing the expansion potential of the high-grade Zn-(Pb-Ag) zones at West and South Ayawilca, we are also re-evaluating our nearby Colquipucro silver mineral resource (included in 2024 Technical Report<sup>1</sup>, but unmodified since 2016) which lies just 2 km north of Ayawilca, as well as an area of silver-rich veins in outcrop (West silver veins - see Figure 3).  Both Colquipucro and the West silver veins are potential silver targets for future drilling and will be considered for inclusion into any upcoming resource statements and economic studies.  </p><p>Of note, the West silver veins were not included in the most recent mineral resource estimation in 2024, and have only seen sparse drilling, albeit with highly promising results for silver including 10 metres @ 661 g/t silver with <percent>3.1%</percent> Pb+Zn from 264 metres depth, and 7.8 metres @ 183 g/t silver with <percent>13.2%</percent> Pb+Zn from 94 metres depth (downhole intercepts, not true width).  Some of the silver vein highlights are shown in the cross section in Figure 4 (down-hole intercepts only, not true width).  Mineralization remains open along strike, as well as up and down dip.  The extent of this vein system has not been fully assessed with the drilling to date, and there is undoubted exploration potential for significant extensions.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/2197/285433_4c646e483448fb2c_009full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

The drill core from Silvia was carried from the drill site approximately 3 km to a local village, where it was geologically logged, marked up and photographed. The cores were then transported to the Company's core storage facility in Huanuco, where it was cut with half-cores stored as a future reference. Half-core was then sampled on average over 1 to 2 metre composite intervals, and sample batches were then trucked to SGS laboratory in Lima for assay. Standards, blanks and duplicates were inserted by Tinka into each batch. At the laboratory samples were dried, crushed to <percent>100%</percent> passing 2mm, then 500 grams pulverized for multi-element analysis by ICPMS using multi-acid digestion. Gold was analysed by fire assay using 30 g aliquots with AAS finish.

Marcus, chief executive officer of Marcus Corporation. “During the fourth quarter, our theatre division benefitted from strong performances from family films and several blockbusters across genres that performed well in our markets. Consumers continued to show demand for out-of-home entertainment experiences, with a wide variety of great movies bringing audiences to the big screen at Marcus Theatres during the holiday season. We are excited for a 2026 film slate that includes several family films and some of the biggest movie franchises. In our hotel division, stable leisure demand and strong group bookings contributed to a year of record revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, with our newly renovated properties driving our outperformance in both the fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2025. The positive impact of the strategic reinvestments made over the past few years will continue to position Marcus Hotels &amp; Resorts well for both the near- and long-term, as our renovated assets continue to win in their markets. As we look ahead to fiscal 2026 and beyond, we expect the building momentum in both businesses to be sustained by our long-standing commitment to operational excellence, the resiliency of our balance sheet, and the unwavering dedication of our valued associates.”</p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2025 Highlights</span></b></p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Total revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 were <money><money>$193.5 million</money></money>, a <percent>2.8%</percent> increase from total revenues of <money><money>$188.3 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.

The company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) attributable to Marcus Corporation before investment income or loss, interest expense, other expense, gain or loss on disposition of property, equipment and other assets, equity earnings or losses from unconsolidated joint ventures, net earnings or losses attributable to noncontrolling interests, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and non-cash share-based compensation expense, adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the company does not consider indicative of its core operating performance. A reconciliation of this measure to the equivalent measure under GAAP, along with reconciliations of this measure for each of our operating segments, are set forth in the attached table.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management and the company’s board of directors to assess the company’s financial performance and enterprise value. The company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure, as it eliminates certain expenses and gains that are not indicative of the company’s core operating performance and facilitates a comparison of the company’s core operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period. The company also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a basis to determine certain annual cash bonuses and long-term incentive awards, to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, and to compare its performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by analysts, investors and other interested parties as a performance measure to evaluate industry competitors.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure of the company’s financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings (loss) as a measure of financial performance, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and it should not be construed as an inference that the company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or free cash flow for management’s discretionary use. In addition, this non-GAAP measure excludes certain non-recurring and other charges and has its limitations as an analytical tool. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company’s results as reported under GAAP. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the company will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the items eliminated in the adjustments made to determine Adjusted EBITDA, such as acquisition expenses, preopening expenses, accelerated depreciation, impairment charges and other adjustments. The company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that the company’s future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Definitions and calculations of Adjusted EBITDA differ among companies in our industries, and therefore Adjusted EBITDA disclosed by the company may not be comparable to the measures disclosed by other companies.</p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">About Marcus Corporation</span></b></p><p>Headquartered in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.milkee\">Milwaukee</location>, <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marcuscorp.com%2Foverview%2Fdefault.aspx&amp;esheet=54434096&amp;newsitemid=20260225045975&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Marcus+Corporation&amp;index=5&amp;md5=bc2637c0f934c6ed7c3ba776d2436d88\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">Marcus Corporation </a>is a leader in the entertainment and hospitality industries, with significant company-owned real estate assets.

(NEX:YAK.H, \"MGG\" or the \"<strong>Company</strong>\") today announced that its Board of Directors (the \"<strong>Board</strong>\") has determined to proceed with a transaction to be completed as a plan of arrangement (the \"<strong>Arrangement</strong>\") under the provisions of the <i>Business Corporations Act</i> (Alberta) pursuant to which shareholders of the Company will be entitled to receive (among other things) cash in the amount of <money>$1.28</money> per common share (a \"<strong>Common Share</strong>\").</p><p>Under the terms of the Arrangement, each issued and outstanding Common Share as at the close of business on the effective date of the Arrangement will be exchanged for: (i) one (1) new common share in the capital of the Company (a \"<strong>New Common Share</strong>\"); and (ii) one (1) redeemable preferred share in the capital of the Company (a \"<strong>Redeemable Preferred Share</strong>\"), which Redeemable Preferred Shares will be immediately redeemed by the Company for cash, in accordance with their terms, for <money>$1.28</money> per Redeemable Preferred Share (the \"<strong>Redemption Amount</strong>\"). As a result of the completion of the Arrangement (including the payment of the Redemption Amount), shareholders will receive, for each Common Share held, one New Common Share and <money>$1.28</money> in cash. The New Common Shares issued pursuant to the Arrangement are expected to be substantially similar to the currently outstanding Common Shares, provided that each New Common Share will entitle the holder thereof to two (2) votes per New Common Share.</p><p>The Company believes that the Arrangement represents an opportunity to return capital to shareholders in an effective and efficient manner and represents the best course of action in order to complete the same, consistent with the Company's previously stated intentions to return a substantial portion of the Company's cash assets to shareholders.</p><p>The Arrangement is subject to the approval by two-thirds of the votes cast by holders of Common Shares present or represented by proxy at a special meeting of holders of Common Shares (the \"<strong>Meeting</strong>\") to be held in May 2026.

If all approvals are received and other closing conditions are satisfied in a timely manner, the Arrangement is expected to be completed shortly after the Meeting.</p><p>The Arrangement is the result of a review process by the Board in connection with the Company's previously stated return of capital strategy. The Board, having undertaken a thorough review of, and having carefully considered, among other things, the terms of the Arrangement and its impact on the Company and all relevant stakeholders, other available courses of action and information concerning the Company and other relevant matters, has unanimously: (i) determined that the Arrangement is in the best interests of the Company and fair to shareholders; (ii) approved the Arrangement; and (iii) recommended that shareholders vote <u>FOR</u> the Arrangement.</p><p>Subsequent to the completion of the Arrangement, including the payment of the aggregate Redemption Amount, the Company will retain cash assets of approximately <money>$1 million</money> to fund ongoing costs and expenses, and expects to continue to be listed on the NEX and may consider and pursue new business opportunities which may be of a benefit to shareholders.</p><p>The Circular will be available for viewing under the Company's SEDAR+ profile at <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3aj\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><strong>www.sedarplus.ca</strong></a>.

(TSXV: RLYG) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/RLYGF/\" title=\"View RLYGF stock overview\">RLYGF</a>)</b> (\"<b>Riley Gold</b>\" or the \"<b>Company</b>\") is pleased to provide an exciting exploration update for the Company's Pipeline West/Clipper Gold Project (\"<b>PWC</b>\") located in the Cortez mining district of the Battle Mountain - Eureka Trend.  PWC is operated by Kinross Gold U.S.A., Inc. (\"<b>Kinross</b>\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Kinross Gold Corporation (TSX: K) (NYSE: KGC), under an exploration earn-in agreement executed in March 2024</p><p><b>PWC 2026 Exploration Program</b> - In addition to the new successful geochemical soil survey results highlighting a new gold in soil anomalies being announced today, there are other exploration and drill targeting tools being deployed. A seismic survey is planned to aid in structural identification of high angle faults that could be the source of the gold at surface from the previous and new geochemical surveys. New surface geochemistry and geophysical datasets will be integrated to inform drill targeting and is expected to begin in the Spring as part of Kinross' committed next phase of exploration at PWC for 2026. </p><p>Mr. Todd Hilditch, CEO of Riley Gold commented \"We are pleased with the iterative successful steps our partner Kinross is taking in order to find another gold deposit in this District. The drilling results announced in November (2025), have confirmed a source for the surface Carlin-type gold and trace element soil anomalies. There is also evidence in the upper plate of leakage of Carlin-type hydrothermal fluids along high-angle brittle faults and confirmation of disseminated Carlin-type mineralization in lower plate carbonate rocks at depth. Today's news of a successful and additional 2 km extension of surface gold in soils further confirms an even more robust structural system and setting for these Carlin-type fluids being present at PWC. This geologic setting is consistent to what is observed peripheral to the Fourmile deposits where surface gold in soils were present and were extremely useful in their discovery\".</p><p><u><b>New Successful Geochemical Soil Survey Results   </b></u></p><p>The new geochemical soil survey was completed after the 2025 drill campaign, expanding the previous soil survey coverage to the north, west and more significantly to the south and southwest. The survey was designed in order to fully delineate the previous and existing +3km open gold and pathfinder element soil anomaly and to test new areas not previously sampled. The extended soil survey covered an additional 5.4 sqkm (1,345 acres) and has successfully returned gold along a strong north/south structural feature.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/10015/285305_cb2f68ee946bd872_002full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

That study, which demonstrated robust project economics at a uranium price of US<money>$65</money> per pound U₃O₈, is now considered outdated pursuant to Securities Exchange guidance. The updated economic study is targeted for completion in the first half of 2026.</p><p>Since 2016, uranium market fundamentals have strengthened materially, with long-term consensus pricing well above levels used in the prior study. Over the same period, Laramide has meaningfully expanded the Westmoreland Mineral Resource, which now comprises 48.1 million pounds U₃O₈ in the Indicated category at an average grade of 770 ppm and 17.7 million pounds U₃O₈ in the Inferred category at an average grade of 680 ppm<sup>2</sup>. The Company has also secured a Mining Development Licence (MDL), representing a significantly advanced stage of tenure and project title within Queensland.</p><p>The updated PEA will reflect current uranium pricing assumptions, revised capital and operating cost inputs, and the expanded resource base. The study is expected to evaluate potential production rates of approximately 4 to 5 million pounds U₃O₈ per annum.</p><p>Advancement of Westmoreland toward development will ultimately depend on policy clarity in Queensland. The Company remains prepared to move expeditiously and responsibly when regulatory conditions align.</p><p>Marc Henderson, President and CEO, commented:</p><p>\"Westmoreland's economics were robust at US<money>$65</money> per pound in 2016, when uranium was in a prolonged bear market. Today's uranium market presents a fundamentally different pricing environment as nuclear energy growth prospects re-emerge globally. Updating the study allows us to reframe the project's economic profile based on current market conditions and a materially expanded resource base.</p><p>\"It is also worth noting, that the broader district, including our very large adjoining tenement position in the Northern Territory remains underexplored. Our 2026 exploration program – to be carried out in the latter half of the year – will be designed to focus on this district potential in order to showcase that Westmoreland remains one of a few large scale, late stage, low technical risk, uranium development projects available to fill a growing future supply gap.\"</p><p>Rhys Davies, Vice President Exploration, added:</p><p>\"The resource growth potential around Westmoreland is significant. Beyond the known deposits, multiple satellite prospects exhibit geological characteristics consistent with Westmoreland-style mineralization.

The next phase at Sinivit involves integrated geological and structural modelling incorporating:</p><ul><li>High-grade shoot geometries</li><li>Multi-element geochemical data</li><li>Alteration zonation and sulphide distribution</li><li>Fault architecture and potential vein displacement</li></ul><p>Recent drilling has intersected several fault zones, and modelling will focus on understanding their impact on shoot continuity and displacement. This work will refine depth potential and assist in defining more precise step-out targets along strike and at depth, particularly beneath the Southern Oxide, Central Oxide and Northern Sulphide zones.</p><p>Future drilling at Sinivit will be guided by this integrated structural framework rather than solely by historic intercept spacing.</p><p>Kavasuki is located approximately 1 kilometre north of Sinivit along the same principal Wild Dog structural corridor and forms part of a continuous ~3-kilometre mineralized trend within the broader 15-kilometre Wild Dog system.</p><p>Historic exploration between 1990 and 2012 comprised 46 drill holes (2,894 metres) and approximately 3.5 kilometres of trenching. Reported intercepts include:</p><ul><li>Hole 10KVD017: 15.15 metres at 2.6 g/t Au (from 32 metres)</li><li>Hole 11KVD025: 8.15 metres at 18.77 g/t Au (from 12.3 metres)</li></ul><p>Trenching returned up to 28 metres at 4.48 g/t Au, with isolated samples returning up to 23.5 g/t Au.</p><p>Despite these results, historic drilling was largely shallow and inconsistently oriented, with limited systematic testing of down-dip continuity or structural controls. Some areas were locally over-drilled while others remain sparsely tested.</p><p>Recent reinterpretation of historic drilling and trench data suggests the principal Kavasuki vein may dip approximately 55 degrees to the east, rather than west as previously assumed. This hypothesis is based on the distribution of broader intercepts in holes drilled from the west and inconsistencies observed in historic drill orientations.</p><p>The current drilling program is specifically designed to test this structural hypothesis. Should drilling not support the east-dipping model, the data generated will allow refinement of vein geometry and improve targeting of subsequent holes.</p><p>Importantly, a coherent induced polarisation (IP) chargeability anomaly measuring approximately 300 metres by 200 metres coincides with the interpreted vein system. The anomaly (6-10 ms) is comparable in scale and character to the Northern Sulphide Zone at Sinivit and supports the presence of sulphide-bearing mineralization beneath the oxide profile.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/11018/285437_8c020165145eda6f_003full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

KVH-01 intersected a broad hydrothermal quartz breccia zone from approximately 41.5 metres to 81.0 metres downhole. Sulphide mineralization occurs as clast-rimming sulphides and fracture infill, including pyrite, chalcopyrite and bornite. Below this interval, phyllic altered volcanics with minor quartz veining and locally disseminated chalcopyrite and bornite were observed. The style of alteration and sulphide development is consistent with a sulphide-bearing epithermal system.</p><p>Assays are pending.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/11018/285437_gpfig3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

Mr. Spink is responsible for the technical content of this news release.  Mr. Spink is not independent of the Company.</p><p><b>Quality Assurance / Quality Control (QAQC)</b></p><p>The Company follows industry-standard Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) procedures. Diamond drill core (HQ and PQ diameter) was sawn in half, with one-half submitted to Intertek Minerals Ltd. in Lae, Papua New Guinea, an ISO 9001-certified independent analytical laboratory with internationally recognized quality standards.</p><p>Gold analyses were completed by fire assay, with copper and silver initially determined by aqua regia digestion and atomic absorption and subsequently updated using four-acid digestion (MS48) multi-element analysis.</p><p>Certified reference materials (standards) and blanks were inserted into the sample stream at industry-standard frequencies, including routine insertion of blanks following mineralized intervals. All assay batches received to date have passed QA/QC review and fall within acceptable tolerance limits.</p><p>Core recoveries were within acceptable ranges, and sampling procedures were carefully managed in areas of variable ground conditions.</p><p><b>About Great Pacific Gold</b></p><p>Great Pacific Gold's vision is to become the leading gold-copper development company in Papua New Guinea (\"PNG\").  The Company has a portfolio of exploration-stage projects in PNG, as follows:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li><p><b>Wild Dog Project: </b>the Company's flagship project is located in the East New Britain Province of PNG.  The project consists of a large-scale epithermal target, the Wild Dog structural corridor, stretching 15 km in strike length and potentially over 1,000 metres deep based on a recent MobileMT geophysics survey.  The survey also highlighted the Magiabe porphyry target, adjacent to the epithermal target and potentially 1,000 metres in diameter and over 2,000 metres deep.  Drilling of the epithermal structure on the Sinivit target has yielded high-grade results, including WDG-08 which intercepted 8.4 metres at 50 g/t AuEq from 154 metres.  The current drilling program will extend into 2026 with two drills currently operating on site.</p></li><li><p><b>Kesar Project: </b>located in the Eastern Highlands Province of PNG and contiguous with the mine tenements of K92 Mining Inc. (\"K92\"), the Kesar Project is a greenfield exploration project with several high-priority targets in close proximity to the property boundary with K92. Multiple epithermal veins at Kesar are on strike and have the same orientation as key K92 deposits, such as Kora. Exploration work to date by the Company at the Kesar Project has shown that these veins have high grades of gold present in outcrop and very elevated gold in soil grades, coincident with aeromagnetic highs. The Company conducted a diamond drill program on key target areas at the Kesar Project from November 2024 to May 2025 and have developed a follow-up Phase 2 program for 2026.</p></li></ul><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li><b>Arau Project: </b>also located in the Eastern Highlands Province of PNG, the Arau Project is south of and contiguous to the mine tenements of K92.  Arau contains the highly prospective Mt. Victor exploration target with potential for a high sulphidation epithermal gold-base metal deposit. A Phase 1 Reverse Circulation drilling program was completed at Mt. Victor in August 2024, with encouraging results. The Arau Project includes the Elandora licence, which also contains various epithermal and copper-gold porphyry targets.</li></ul><p>The Company also holds the Tinga Valley Project in PNG.</p><p><b>Forward-Looking Statements</b></p><p><i>Information set forth in this news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on assumptions as of the date of this news release.
