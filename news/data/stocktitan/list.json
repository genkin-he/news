The findings highlight a widening confidence gap alongside a rapid rise in demand for AI-savvy leaders and persistent weaknesses in succession planning and clinician engagement.</p> <p>Conducted by B.E.

At the same time, the report highlights accelerating momentum for artificial intelligence (AI) leadership and capability-building alongside ongoing headwinds in leadership recruiting, clinician engagement, and succession readiness.</p> <p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li><strong>A widening confidence gap is emerging. </strong>Almost three-quarters of respondents expect their organization’s health to be better or the same as 2025, while <strong><percent>52%</percent></strong> forecast a worse year for the industry overall.</li><li><strong>AI leadership is surging in importance.</strong> AI roles moved to the top of leadership priorities for 2026, with leaders citing the need for developing a clear AI strategy (<strong><percent>63%</percent></strong>), engaging clinicians and staff to grow adoption (<strong><percent>48%</percent></strong>), and investing in data infrastructure (<strong><percent>41%</percent></strong>).</li><li><strong>Retention risk shows signs of cooling, but mobility remains.</strong> Among leaders considering leaving, <strong><percent>35%</percent></strong> would like to do so within one year. At the same time, the report notes signals of reduced urgency to move compared to prior years.</li><li><strong>Career advancement remains a friction point.</strong> Only <strong><percent>21%</percent></strong> of respondents consider themselves to be on promotion track, while <strong><percent>26%</percent></strong> feel they must leave their employer to advance often citing limited internal opportunities.</li><li><strong>Leadership recruiting is still difficult and organizations are expanding tactics.</strong> Four in ten respondents regard attracting quality leadership candidates as extremely or very challenging.</li><li><strong>Clinician engagement continues to lag.</strong> Leadership teams are perceived as highly engaged compared to physicians and nursing staff, continuing a multi-year pattern and highlighting ongoing workforce experience challenges.</li><li><strong>Succession planning remains underdeveloped.</strong> Fewer than half of responding organizations maintain formal succession planning for any leadership level, including the top echelon.<br/></li></ul> <p>B.E.

With a portfolio that includes reusable, industry-leading templates, clause libraries, KPI and SLA catalogs, real-time market benchmarks and a staged process that spans strategy, transition and ongoing governance, the ISG revenue cycle management framework can help healthcare providers reduce rework and staffing costs, ensure compliance and improve financial stability.</p><p>It also leverages AI-based platforms and services to manage administrative tasks and increase efficiency, which can save healthcare organizations nearly 50 percent of their operations costs and drive millions of dollars in increased net patient revenue. In recent client engagements, the ISG revenue cycle management framework saved a children’s healthcare system <money><money>$15 million</money></money> over a five-year IT services contract and delivered a Midwest hospital network 50 percent savings and <money><money>$45 million</money></money> in annual revenue uplift.</p><p>“U.S. healthcare providers are entering a period of intensified financial and operational pressure, making revenue cycle performance a must-have,” Burke said. “Properly structured, negotiated and governed revenue cycle transformation agreements have been proven to build structurally lower-cost enterprises that can fund transformation through self-generated savings.”</p><p>ISG is the world’s leading sourcing advisor and the industry pioneer.

In response to these proceedings, Biofrontera challenged the validity of Sun Pharma’s asserted claims by filing petitions for Inter Partes Review with the Board. The Board has now agreed with Biofrontera on all challenged claims of the ‘028 Patent.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Sun Pharma has the right to request a review of the decision or appeal it to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The decision does not affect the petition filed by the Company relating to the ‘512 patent, which was denied review by the Patent Office on administrative, rather than substantive, grounds.</p> <p align=\"justify\">“Biofrontera is pleased with the Board’s Final Written Decision.,” commented Hermann Luebbert, CEO and Chairman of Biofrontera. “We remain focused on clinical research and development in the PDT space to better serve clinicians and improve their patients’ lives.”</p> <p align=\"justify\"><b>About Biofrontera Inc.</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">Biofrontera is a U.S.-based biopharmaceutical company specializing in the treatment of dermatological conditions with a focus on PDT.

Together, these AI capabilities displace traditional IT &amp; Data skills, which fell to seventh place (<percent>17%</percent>), signaling a rapid realignment of strategic talent investment toward AI-driven capabilities.<br/><br/></li><li><b>The Human Edge Becomes More Valuable<br/></b>Even amid the surge in demand for AI, core human skills remain in-demand. Communication, Collaboration &amp; Teamwork are the most sought-after attributes at <percent>39%</percent>, followed by Professionalism &amp; Work Ethic (<percent>36%</percent>) and Adaptability &amp; Willingness to Learn (<percent>34%</percent>), reinforcing the enduring value of interpersonal skills.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Geography Defines the Scarcity Experience<br/></b>The pressure to find talent is universal, yet its intensity varies dramatically by location.

This widespread challenge extends across Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services (<percent>73%</percent>), Manufacturing (<percent>72%</percent>), and Finance and Insurance (<percent>71%</percent>), indicating a broad-based constraint on economic growth and service delivery.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Employer Strategy: Invest, Adapt, and Compete<br/></b>Faced with structural scarcity, <percent>91%</percent> of employers are deploying a mix of strategies. The primary focus is on internal development and flexibility: Upskilling/Reskilling (<percent>27%</percent>) leads, followed by offering more Schedule Flexibility (<percent>20%</percent>) and Location Flexibility (<percent>18%</percent>). To compete externally, Increasing Wages (<percent>19%</percent>) and Targeting New Talent Pools (<percent>18%</percent>) are critical levers.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Scale Exacerbates the Challenge<br/></b>Organizational size significantly impacts hiring success.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p> <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.oldick\">OLDWICK, N.J.</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--<b>AM Best </b>has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating of A+ (Superior) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of “aa-” (Superior) of Primerica Life Insurance Company (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tn.nashvl\">Nashville, TN</location>) and its affiliates, National Benefit Life Insurance Company (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.lonity\">Long Island City, NY</location>) and Primerica Life Insurance Company of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location> (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.on.misuga\">Mississauga, Ontario</location>), collectively referred to as Primerica Group. Additionally, AM Best has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of “a-” (Excellent) of Primerica, Inc. (Primerica) (headquartered in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ga.duluth\">Duluth, GA</location>) [NYSE: PRI], which is the holding company for the group’s insurance and non-insurance operating companies. AM Best also has affirmed the Long-Term Issue Credit Rating of “a-” (Excellent) on <money><money>$600 million</money></money>, <percent>2.8%</percent> senior unsecured notes, due 2031, of Primerica. The outlook of all these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.</p><p>The ratings reflect Primerica Group’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its very strong operating performance, favorable business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management.</p><p>Primerica’s credit ratings continue to recognize the group’s strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). The company’s balance sheet remains a core strength, characterized by strong liquidity and financial flexibility. Primerica has an investment profile that focuses on fixed-income assets, while maintaining only modest exposure to commercial mortgage-backed securities. However, the company’s business model does rely heavily on the use of reinsurance.</p><p>Primerica reinforced its position as an industry leader, consistently reporting high levels of earnings and top-tier return-on-equity measures among its peers. Steady premium growth, fueled by a vast and geographically diversified distribution system spanning the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> and Canadian marketplaces, continues to improve the company's operational strength. Primerica has extensive agent recruitment and a well-established monitoring system to ensure compliance and steady premium growth. Primerica’s use of highly rated reinsurance partners mitigates term life insurance mortality risk, a core component of its strong balance sheet management.</p><p>The group’s business profile is focused on its core term life insurance offering, particularly the investments made in its simplified issue product. Beyond the Primerica Group, Primerica also offers the distribution of primarily third-party investment and savings products and other non-life products.</p><p><b>This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

Drilling in the West Zone intersected broad levels of gold mineralization in multiple holes, with long intervals of gold mineralization encountered in two of the six holes completed during the program, complementing the spring 2023 discovery hole of 48.5m of 0.85 g/t Au starting at 316.5m (see News Release dated 2023-Jun-06).</p><p><b>Highlights:</b></p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li>IMGW-25-06 returned 0.424 g/t gold over 278.35 metres from 45.1 to 323.45 metres, which included several sub-intervals, including:<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\"><li><b>1.019 g/t gold over 7.4 metres</b> from 118.75 to 126.15 metres</li><li><b>0.566 g/t over 80 metres</b> from 154 to 234 metres</li><li><b>0.610 g/t gold over 62.45</b> <b>metres</b> from 261 to 323.45 metres, including<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\"><li><b>1.239 g/t gold over 16.65 metres</b> from 289.35 to 306 metres</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>IMGW-25-01 returned <b>0.419 g/t gold over 65.75</b> <b>metres </b>from 276.7 to 342.45 metres, including<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\"><li><b>0.868 g/t gold over 8 metres</b> from 296.5 to 304 metres</li><li><b>0.786 g/t gold over 5.8 metres</b> from 315.95 to 321.75 metres</li></ul></li><li>IMGW-25-03 returned <b>1.116 g/t gold over 6.2 metres</b> from 342.75 to 348.95 metres</li><li>McFarlane Lake Mining Limited, contiguous to the northwest has identifed a parallel zone to it's Juby Zone within the regional Ridout-Tyrrell Deformation Zone, the 826 Zone, which appears to trend into the West Zone.</li></ul><p>\"These results continue to expand the gold system at Gowganda West and demonstrate both broad mineralization and higher-grade internal intervals,\" stated Saf Dhillon, President &amp; CEO of iMetal. \"The scale of the mineralized envelope, combined with its proximity to the Juby Deposit and the emerging 826 Zone, reinforces the structural significance of this corridor. We look forward to incorporating these results into our ongoing geological model and planning the next phase of drilling!\" commented iMetal President &amp; CEO Saf Dhillon. </p><p>The drilling intersected the targeted host rocks that exhibited alteration patterns and mineralization similar to that which was intersected in the 2023 drill program. The dominant rock type intersected is a matrix supported greenish polymictic conglomerate composed of heterogenous centimetric to pluricentimetric round clasts with different colors. A percentage of the red clasts are magnetic but the matrix is not. Zones of moderate to pervasive hematization /potassic alteration, sericitization and silicification were noted in the drill holes. Mineralization included disseminated and clast-replacement controlled pyrite, while a few holes also intersected local chalcopyrite vein fractures or plurimillimetric clusters. Alteration intensity appears to be a control on elevated gold values. Pyrite content also shows a relationship with elevated gold values and intensity of alteration.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/7946/285465_table1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

The 48.5m gold interval is characterized by a coarse-grained to boulder-sized conglomerate, with moderate to pervasive silica alteration associated with a large intermediate-mafic dyke.

Datadog researchers found that half of organizations (<percent>50%</percent>) adopt new library versions within 24 hours of release, and only <percent>4%</percent> pin all public GitHub Actions to a specific version using commit hashes.</p> <p>As a result, build and deployment pipelines are increasingly exposed to silent changes in third-party code, making CI/CD systems a critical supply-chain risk.</p> <p>“The way software is built has fundamentally changed, but security practices haven’t kept up,” said Andrew Krug, Head of Security Advocacy at Datadog. “DevSecOps teams are caught between moving too slowly and moving too fast. Go slow, and outdated software accumulates known vulnerabilities. Go fast, and automation can introduce unvetted code. The real challenge, though, isn’t speed - it’s clarity. As environments grow more complex, AI-assisted workflows help ensure top priorities get attention first.”</p> <p><strong>Alert Volume Is Obscuring Real Risk</strong></p> <p>While vulnerability alerts continue to rise, the report also finds that most do not represent immediate business risk. Only <percent>18%</percent> of vulnerabilities labeled “critical” remain critical once runtime context is applied.</p> <p>“When almost everything is labeled ‘critical’, nothing is,” Krug added. “Teams get paged for noise while threats that pose real risk slip through. Without context, prioritization becomes harder - leading to burnout, slower response times and accumulated risk. Teams need better visibility into what <em>actually</em> requires action.”</p> <p>Read the full report, <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=UZ3UcXpxVfI9_CeA7JNfgIoxLXjDhx6WIfYpi4MXGURok8M-uScqRZiv7RcCvBRCyIR4d3wYNnJAuaHYdJigDM6jtHrddyaFkK8hfRTbTUsxPIBc_auStNStoPtmbJTq-qMuTvVKlpti6yDb-iamnA==\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>State of DevSecOps Report 2026</u></a>, to see how these findings are shaping modern approaches to detecting, prioritizing and remediating security risk.</p> <p><strong>Contact</strong><br/><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ofNna8sT1hFliTiZAJ9-ZpPpWWwuwFtuAF3yfXFT3AZn-wU4BYN2WB-p7euW6-s27Xi1qPSZZy79MmelrjbEgXcmcgWYhddYmx35Dsfjeis=\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>press@datadoghq.com</u></a></p> <p><strong>Report Methodology</strong></p> <p>Datadog analyzed telemetry from tens of thousands of applications to assess security risk across modern software environments, along with additional datasets used for specific findings.
