            "title": "Waste Energy Corp to Present at Clean Energy & Renewables Virtual Investor Conference on March 5th; Highlights Permian Basin Deployment and 2026 Operational Roadmap | WAST Stock News",
            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><strong id=\"dateline\">MIDLAND, TX / <a href=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ACCESS Newswire</a> / February 26, 2026 / </strong>Waste Energy Corp (OTCQB:WAST) (\"WEC\" or the \"Company\"), a clean-energy company converting non-recyclable waste into usable fuel and renewable energy products, today announced that is will present at the Clean Energy &amp; Renewables Virtual Investor Conference on March 5, 2026, hosted by OTC Markets Group. Management will walk through the Company's waste conversion model, its first facility in Midland, Texas, and the operational milestones it expects to hit as commissioning draws near.</p><p><strong>Permian Basin: A Deliberate Starting Point</strong></p><p>The Midland facility wasn't placed in the Permian Basin by accident. The region offers something most early-stage energy infrastructure companies spend years chasing established distribution networks, industrial-scale fuel demand, and a deep base of energy capital that understands long-cycle infrastructure investment. Waste tire feedstock is also concentrated in the area, reducing inbound logistics costs and simplifying supply chain management.</p><p>Management sees the Permian not just as a first market, but as a template. If the model works here, it travels.</p><p><strong>What the Facility Actually Does</strong></p><p>Running Phase 1 at full capacity 30 tons per day, 330 days a year, the Midland plant is designed to process around 10,000 tons of waste tires annually. That's north of 300,000 passenger tires, or roughly 140,000 heavy truck tires, every year. Beyond the headline fuel output, the process recovers carbon black, syngas to run the system and high grade steel, all of which have established regional buyers. Steel alone could represent 990 to 1,485 tons of recoverable material annually, based on typical tire composition.</p><p>The Company is also working with local partners on landfill diversion and tire stockpile remediation in the Permian Basin, a community angle that has drawn interest from regional stakeholders.</p><p><strong>Rethinking How Carbon Credits Get Made</strong></p><p>The voluntary carbon market has a credibility problem. Credits get challenged, methodologies get disputed, and human reporting introduces errors that undermine confidence in the underlying asset. Waste Energy Corp has filed a patent for a system designed to fix that at the source.</p><p>The Company's patent-pending carbon credit automation system uses on-site video monitoring and sensor data to capture the conversion process in real time. That data is then run through a carbon credit algorithm when a match is confirmed, a credit is created automatically, minted as an NFT, and deposited directly into a digital wallet. The credits will be tradeable on the Company's own blockchain-based platform.</p><p>The logic is straightforward: remove the human from the reporting chain, and you remove the most common source of error and dispute. The result is a carbon credit with a verifiable, immutable record of exactly how and when it was generated, something the market has struggled to produce consistently.</p><p>For investors, this matters beyond the environmental angle. A carbon credit with a clean chain of custody and blockchain-based provenance is a more defensible asset. It's also a potential competitive advantage as regulators and institutional buyers apply increasing scrutiny to voluntary market integrity.</p><p><strong>The Carbon Credit Opportunity</strong></p><p>Based on combustion-equivalent emission factors, full-capacity throughput at the Midland facility could translate to roughly 12,800 metric tons of CO₂e annually. Whether that supports a meaningful credit position still depends on third-party validation and registry methodology, a process that hasn't concluded. Conservative estimates put potential annual credits in the 7,000 to 17,000 range, with a theoretical ceiling around 22,000 to 28,000. Management isn't booking that revenue yet, but the automated issuance system is designed to make the validation process faster, cleaner, and more defensible when it does get there.</p><p><strong>Midland Facility Commissioning &amp; Timelines</strong></p><p>The Midland facility is approaching commissioning. Management has committed to regular updates tied to actual milestones production ramp, first revenue, and expansion decisions rather than forward-looking timelines that tend to slip.</p><p>\"We are building Waste Energy Corp around disciplined execution and measurable results,\" said Scott Gallagher, Chairman &amp; CEO. \"Our first priority is to demonstrate a model that works operationally and economically. The Permian Basin deployment is not simply a site launch, it is the foundation for a scalable environmental infrastructure platform designed to generate diversified revenue streams, including fuel, recovered materials, and carbon-linked assets.\"</p><p>Gallagher continued, \"As we move toward commissioning, transparency becomes increasingly important. During the March 5th presentation, I will provide a clear framework outlining our expected path to revenue for the Midland facility. Shareholder value is created through execution, consistency, and scale and our focus in 2026 is to deliver on each of those.\"</p><p>The broader context isn't lost on the Company either. U.S. electricity demand hit record highs in 2025 and is projected to keep climbing, driven largely by the data center and AI infrastructure buildout that shows no sign of slowing. Data center electricity demand has grown more than <percent>400%</percent> over the past decade. Carbon credits, and U.S. data center power demand is forecast to reach 134 gigawatts by 2030, nearly triple current levels. That kind of structural demand creates a sustained need for new domestic energy sources, particularly ones that don't require greenfield grid infrastructure. Waste Energy Corp's model, modular, deployable near existing waste streams, and producing fuel that can flow through established regional distribution networks is designed for exactly that environment.</p><p>At the same time, institutional capital continues its rotation toward ESG-aligned infrastructure. Corporate power purchase agreements for zero-carbon electricity reached 29.5 gigawatts in 2025, the highest annual total on record, a signal that large buyers are actively seeking credible, verifiable clean energy and carbon assets. The Company believes its combination of waste diversion, domestic fuel production, and blockchain-verified carbon credits positions it squarely in that flow of capital. The Midland facility will ultimately have to prove the model but the market conditions for doing so have rarely been better aligned.</p><p><strong>Conference Details</strong></p><p>Waste Energy Corp will present at the Clean Energy &amp; Renewables Virtual Investor Conference on March 5, 2026.

The RSUs aim at incentivizing the Participants to seek to improve the performance of TORM and thereby the TORM share price for the mutual benefit of themselves and the shareholders of TORM.</p><p>For 2025, the Participants will be granted a total of 1,356,087 RSUs and, subject to vesting, each RSU will entitle the holder to acquire one TORM A-share. The RSUs will vest over a three-year period, with one third of the grant amount vesting at each anniversary during the three-year period starting on 01 January 2027. The exercise price for each TORM A-share is <money>DKK 167.14</money>, corresponding to the average of 90 calendar days preceding the publication of TORM plc's 2025 Annual Report plus a <percent>15%</percent> premium. Vested RSUs may be exercised for a period of 360 days from each vesting date.</p><p>In addition to the RSUs granted to the Participants, Executive Director Jacob Meldgaard will be granted a total of 255,200 RSUs on similar terms as outlined above.</p><p>Holders of the RSUs will have no rights as a shareholder with respect to such RSUs until such time as the RSUs vest, are exercised and TORM A-shares are issued. The RSUs include certain adjustment and acceleration provisions, exercise conditions and other terms customary for restricted stock option programs of this nature.</p><p>The theoretical market value of the RSU allocation is calculated at <money>USD 10.9m</money> based on the Black-Scholes model. The key assumptions for the calculation of the market value are:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>The strike price is adjusted for future TORM dividends.</li><li>The volatility of the TORM share is estimated at <percent>40%</percent>.</li><li>The risk-free interest rate based upon expiry of the RSUs is based on Danish government bonds with maturity corresponding to the maturity of the individual RSUs. The interest rate is between <percent>1.78%</percent> - <percent>2.01%</percent> depending on maturity.</li><li>A share price of <money>DKK 174.35</money> per A-share at the time of allocation.</li></ul><p>The RSU allocation is expected to affect the P&amp;L statement as follows:</p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"prnbcc\"><tr><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">USDm                              </span></p></td><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">2026</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">2027</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">2028</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">Total                     </span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">Effect</span></p><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">                                   </span></p></td><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">6.2</span></p><p class=\"prnml4\"> </p></td><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">3.3</span></p><p class=\"prnml4\"> </p></td><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">1.4</span></p><p class=\"prnml4\"> </p></td><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">10.9</span></p><p class=\"prnml4\"> </p></td></tr></table></div><p><b>Contact</b></p><p>Mikael Bo Larsen, Head of Investor Relations<br/>Tel.: +45 5143 8002</p><p><b>About TORM</b></p><p>TORM is one of the world's leading carriers of refined oil products.

As she reaches the end of her second term as CEO, the Board of Directors unanimously supports her remaining as Chair to ensure strategic continuity and guide Viridien’s long-term vision. Since 2018, her leadership has repositioned Viridien as an asset-light, technology-driven company with a stronger financial foundation and a more diversified portfolio.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The Board also unanimously approved the appointment of Henning Berg as Viridien’s new CEO, effective June 3, 2026. Henning Berg brings more than 27 years of experience in the oil and gas services industry, including several senior global leadership roles at SLB. He will join the Group on March 3, 2026, as Chief Operating Officer, ensuring a structured and gradual transition to the CEO role. His appointment as Director will also be submitted for approval at the upcoming General Meeting</p> <p align=\"center\" style=\"padding-left:4pt;\"><b>OUTLOOK</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">While short-term energy price volatility may result in some industry caution and softer activity in the first half of 2026, we anticipate a recovery in the second half. Under an overall business environment comparable to last year, Viridien expects to deliver around <money>$100 million</money> of Net Cash Flow in FY26, with a seasonal profile similar to 2025 and full allocation to further deleveraging. This target incorporates the planned Phase 1 expansion of our US HPC infrastructure and assumes a normalization of working capital, including PEMEX.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Looking further ahead, the structural dynamics of global energy supply increasingly point toward a new exploration upcycle<sup>7</sup>.

There were two deaths due to bone marrow failure. For 7 of 13 patients treated with XOFIGO bone marrow failure was ongoing at the time of death. Among the 13 patients who experienced bone marrow failure, <percent>54%</percent> required blood transfusions. Four percent (<percent>4%</percent>) of patients in the XOFIGO arm and <percent>2%</percent> in the placebo arm permanently discontinued therapy due to bone marrow suppression. In the randomized trial, deaths related to vascular hemorrhage in association with myelosuppression were observed in <percent>1%</percent> of XOFIGO-treated patients compared to <percent>0.3%</percent> of patients treated with placebo. The incidence of infection-related deaths (<percent>2%</percent>), serious infections (<percent>10%</percent>), and febrile neutropenia (&lt;<percent>1%</percent>) was similar for patients treated with XOFIGO and placebo. Myelosuppression–notably thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, and leukopenia–has been reported in patients treated with XOFIGO.<br/><br/>Monitor patients with evidence of compromised bone marrow reserve closely and provide supportive care measures when clinically indicated. Discontinue XOFIGO in patients who experience life-threatening complications despite supportive care for bone marrow failure<br/><br/></li><li><b>Hematological Evaluation:</b> Monitor blood counts at baseline and prior to every dose of XOFIGO. Prior to first administering XOFIGO, the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be ≥1.5 × 109/L, the platelet count ≥100 × 109/L, and hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL. Prior to subsequent administrations, the ANC should be ≥1 × 109/L and the platelet count ≥50 × 109/L. Discontinue XOFIGO if hematologic values do not recover within 6 to 8 weeks after the last administration despite receiving supportive care<br/><br/></li><li><b>Concomitant Use With Chemotherapy:</b> Safety and efficacy of concomitant chemotherapy with XOFIGO have not been established. Outside of a clinical trial, concomitant use of XOFIGO in patients on chemotherapy is not recommended due to the potential for additive myelosuppression. If chemotherapy, other systemic radioisotopes, or hemibody external radiotherapy are administered during the treatment period, XOFIGO should be discontinued<br/><br/></li><li><b>Increased Fractures and Mortality in Combination With Abiraterone Plus Prednisone/Prednisolone:</b> XOFIGO is not recommended for use in combination with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone outside of clinical trials. At the primary analysis of the Phase 3 ERA-223 study that evaluated concurrent initiation of XOFIGO in combination with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone in 806 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic mCRPC patients, an increased incidence of fractures (<percent>28.6%</percent> vs <percent>11.4%</percent>) and deaths (<percent>38.5%</percent> vs <percent>35.5%</percent>) have been observed in patients who received XOFIGO in combination with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone compared to patients who received placebo in combination with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone. Safety and efficacy with the combination of XOFIGO and agents other than gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues have not been established<br/><br/></li><li><b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: </b>The safety and efficacy of XOFIGO have not been established in females. XOFIGO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female. Advise pregnant females and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise male patients to use condoms and their female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for 6 months after completing treatment with XOFIGO</li></ul><p><b>Administration and Radiation Protection:</b> XOFIGO should be received, used, and administered only by authorized persons in designated clinical settings. The administration of XOFIGO is associated with potential risks to other persons from radiation or contamination from spills of bodily fluids such as urine, feces, or vomit. Therefore, radiation protection precautions must be taken in accordance with national and local regulations</p><p><b>Fluid Status:</b> Dehydration occurred in <percent>3%</percent> of patients on XOFIGO and <percent>1%</percent> of patients on placebo. XOFIGO increases adverse reactions such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, which may result in dehydration. Monitor patients’ oral intake and fluid status carefully and promptly treat patients who display signs or symptoms of dehydration or hypovolemia</p><p><b>Injection Site Reactions:</b> Erythema, pain, and edema at the injection site were reported in <percent>1%</percent> of patients on XOFIGO</p><p><b>Secondary Malignant Neoplasms:</b> XOFIGO contributes to a patient’s overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure may be associated with an increased risk of cancer and hereditary defects. Due to its mechanism of action and neoplastic changes, including osteosarcomas, in rats following administration of radium-223 dichloride, XOFIGO may increase the risk of osteosarcoma or other secondary malignant neoplasms. However, the overall incidence of new malignancies in the randomized trial was lower on the XOFIGO arm compared to placebo (&lt;<percent>1%</percent> vs <percent>2%</percent>; respectively), but the expected latency period for the development of secondary malignancies exceeds the duration of follow-up for patients on the trial</p><p><b>Subsequent Treatment With Cytotoxic Chemotherapy:</b> In the randomized clinical trial, <percent>16%</percent> of patients in the XOFIGO group and <percent>18%</percent> of patients in the placebo group received cytotoxic chemotherapy after completion of study treatments. Adequate safety monitoring and laboratory testing was not performed to assess how patients treated with XOFIGO will tolerate subsequent cytotoxic chemotherapy</p><p><b>Adverse Reactions:</b> The most common adverse reactions (≥<percent>10%</percent>) in the XOFIGO arm vs the placebo arm, respectively, were nausea (<percent>36%</percent> vs <percent>35%</percent>), diarrhea (<percent>25%</percent> vs <percent>15%</percent>), vomiting (<percent>19%</percent> vs <percent>14%</percent>), and peripheral edema (<percent>13%</percent> vs <percent>10%</percent>). Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were reported in <percent>57%</percent> of XOFIGO-treated patients and <percent>63%</percent> of placebo-treated patients. The most common hematologic laboratory abnormalities in the XOFIGO arm (≥<percent>10%</percent>) vs the placebo arm, respectively, were anemia (<percent>93%</percent> vs <percent>88%</percent>), lymphocytopenia (<percent>72%</percent> vs <percent>53%</percent>), leukopenia (<percent>35%</percent> vs <percent>10%</percent>), thrombocytopenia (<percent>31%</percent> vs <percent>22%</percent>), and neutropenia (<percent>18%</percent> vs <percent>5%</percent>).</p><p>Please see the <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flabeling.bayerhealthcare.com%2Fhtml%2Fproducts%2Fpi%2FXofigo_PI.pdf&amp;esheet=54433531&amp;newsitemid=20260225000389&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=full+Prescribing+Information&amp;index=2&amp;md5=2ec60fd1a978ac9087891120683da216\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">full Prescribing Information</a> for XOFIGO (radium Ra 223 dichloride).</p><p><b>About Oncology at Bayer</b></p><p>Bayer is committed to delivering science for a better life by advancing a portfolio of innovative treatments.

systematically logged and photographed by Banyan geology personnel. All core samples (HTW and NTW diameter) were split on-site at Banyan's core processing facilities. Once split, half samples were placed back in the core boxes with the other half of split samples sealed in poly bags with one part of a three-part sample tag inserted within. Samples were delivered by Banyan personnel or a dedicated expediter to the Bureau Veritas, Whitehorse preparatory laboratory where samples are prepared and then shipped to Bureau Veritas's Analytical laboratory in Vancouver, B.C. for pulverization and final chemical analysis.</p><p>Core splits reported in this news release were analysed by Bureau Veritas of Vancouver, B.C., utilizing the four-acid digestion ICP-ES 35-element MA-300 or ICP-ES/MS 59-element MA-250 analytical package with FA-450 50-gram Fire Assay with AAS finish for gold on all samples. Samples returning &gt;10 g/t Au were reanalysed by fire assay with gravimetric finish on a 50g sample (FA-550). High-grade samples with documented visible gold are also analysed using metallic screen fire assay (FS-652). Bureau Veritas is an accredited lab following ISO/IEC 17025:2017 SCC File Number 15895. A robust system of standards, ¼ core duplicates and blanks has been implemented in the 2025 exploration drilling program and is monitored as chemical assay data becomes available.</p><p><strong><u>Qualified Persons</u></strong></p><p>Duncan Mackay, M.Sc., P.Geo., is a \"<strong>Qualified Person\"</strong> as ‎defined under National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"<strong>NI 43-101</strong>\"), and has reviewed and approved the content of this news release in respect of all disclosure other than the MRE.‎ Mr. Mackay is Vice President Exploration for Banyan and has verified the data disclosed in this news release, including the sampling, ‎‎analytical and test data underlying the information.</p><p><strong><u>Upcoming Events</u></strong></p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><p>Metals Investor Forum Toronto, February 27 - 28</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:circle;\"><li><p>Corporate Presentation: February 27, 6:00 PM ET</p></li></ul></li><li><p><i>Yukon in Global Focus: From Rocks to Riches</i> Breakfast - Fireside Chat - Toronto, March 2, 7 AM - 9 AM ET</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:circle;\"><li><p>7:00 AM to 9 AM ET</p></li></ul></li><li><p>PDAC, Toronto, March 1 - 4, 2026</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:circle;\"><li><p>Exhibitor Booth No. 2213, March 1 - 2</p></li><li><p>1x1 Meetings, Level 300, March 1-3</p></li></ul></li><li><p>SMI Zurich, Switzerland, March 18 -19</p></li><li><p>Italy Roadshow - Milan, Rome, March 23 - 27</p></li></ul><p><strong><u>About Banyan</u></strong></p><p>Banyan's primary asset, the AurMac Project is located in the Traditional Territory of First Nation of Na-Cho Nyäk Dun, in Canada's Yukon Territory.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Burlington, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - February 26, 2026) - Silver Bullet Mines Corp. (TSXV: SBMI) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/SBMCF/\" title=\"View SBMCF stock overview\">SBMCF</a>) (\"SBMI\" or \"the Company\") is pleased to provide historical technical information related to its two recent acquisitions, the Columbia Mine and the Gold Queen Mine. These past producing mines are contiguous to each other located in Gila County, Arizona, roughly 30 miles from the Company's mill in Globe, Arizona.</p><p>The Company has repeatedly spoken of its hub and spoke business model, commencing in 2020. This model envisions the hub being the Company's wholly-owned mill and the spokes of the wheel being whatever proximate mines it may own or from which mineralized material is provided to the mill to be processed. This has been a successful model for SBMI. The proximity of the Columbia Mine and the Gold Queen Mine to the mill supports the Company's hub and spoke thesis.</p><p>The Columbia Mine and the Gold Queen Mine were until recently owned by Phelps Dodge Corporation (now a subsidiary of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. as a result of a USD<money>$25.9 billion</money> acquisition in 2007). They have historically produced mainly copper with secondary production of gold, silver, zinc and lead. They are in the Dripping Springs District of Arizona, a district with well-documented mining production. </p><p>SBMI has not been able to locate any data related to these mines disseminated in accordance with <i>NI 43-101</i>. All data either predates <i>NI 43-101, </i>was created by entities not subject to <i>NI 43-101</i>, or was anecdotal from trusted sources. SBMI has not found any historical resource estimates in any category for these mines, and cannot state whether the work supporting the data was carried out under the supervision of, or approved by, a Qualified Person, or what QAQC measures were followed. SBMI does rely upon such data to inform its investment thesis and to provide guidance for possible future exploration and development.

Two of the Company's current contractors were part of the team working those assets in 2018, and therefore can attest to and have attested to their belief in the accuracy of the contents of the Presentation and its authorship. The author of the Presentation was a Canadian B.Sc., P.Geo. having the characteristics and qualities of a Qualified Person, and who in fact served as a Qualified Person for Canadian reporting issuers.</p><p><b>The reader should be made aware that in the paragraph below, the historical production figures and grades are anecdotal and not necessarily to be relied upon.</b></p><p>According to the Presentation, Dripping Spring Mines shipments including but not limited to the Columbia and Gold Queen Mines in the 1940's were reported to contain 2 - <percent>7%</percent> copper with 0.08 to 0.28 oz per ton gold.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><strong>Expands Digital Marketplace and Catering Access to Increase Consumer Touchpoints, Strengthen Unit Economics, and Support Data-Driven Growth</strong></p><p align=\"left\">DURANGO, Colo., Feb.  26, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc. (NASDAQ: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/RMCF/\" title=\"View RMCF stock overview\">RMCF</a>), America’s Chocolatier®, today announced the launch of its omnichannel growth strategy, marking the next phase of the company’s broader transformation initiative. Systemwide rollout is underway and expected to be substantially implemented over the next six weeks.</p> <p align=\"left\">For more than 40 years, the company has delivered a premium five-senses retail experience through handcrafted chocolates, live caramel apple dipping, in-store fudge making, and immersive confectionery theater. As Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory continues modernizing its store prototype and expanding into new territories, the omnichannel initiative extends that same craft-driven experience into the digital ecosystem, increasing accessibility while preserving brand integrity and operational discipline.</p> <p align=\"left\">Phase One includes implementation of a centralized order management system powered by Deliverect, enabling seamless integration between franchise locations and leading third-party marketplaces, including Uber Eats, DoorDash, Grubhub, and ezCater. The company will also expand availability through Instacart as part of its broader marketplace strategy.</p> <p align=\"left\">This integrated infrastructure represents a scalable digital foundation for the brand, routing marketplace orders directly into store systems where applicable, improving operational efficiency, maintaining pricing consistency, and enhancing real-time data visibility across the system.</p> <p align=\"left\">By expanding into high-frequency digital marketplaces, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory increases brand visibility and purchase frequency among new customer segments. Online consumers typically skew younger and demonstrate higher impulse purchasing behavior, creating incremental demand beyond traditional store traffic and supporting long-term brand relevance.</p> <p align=\"left\">“Our transformation is about honoring our heritage while building a modern, scalable platform for growth,” said Jeff Geygan, Interim Chief Executive Officer. “By pairing our immersive five-senses retail experience with a disciplined omnichannel infrastructure, we are expanding how consumers engage with our brand, strengthening unit-level economics for our franchisees, and positioning Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory for sustainable national expansion.”</p> <p align=\"left\">Through ezCater integration, the company expands into corporate catering and gifting channels, providing businesses with direct access to Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory products for meetings, employee recognition, and client gifting. This initiative is designed to drive incremental same-store sales, increase average order value potential, and diversify revenue streams in a capital-light manner.</p> <p align=\"left\">Integrated marketplace ordering enhances systemwide data capture, providing actionable insights into consumer behavior, product performance, and purchasing patterns. These insights support menu optimization, targeted marketing initiatives, improved forecasting, and more informed capital allocation decisions as the company continues executing its disciplined growth strategy.</p> <p align=\"left\">By modernizing revenue channels without materially increasing fixed store overhead, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory strengthens its franchise development proposition and long-term value creation strategy. The omnichannel launch represents another milestone in the company’s multi-year roadmap focused on operational excellence, scalable infrastructure, and sustained franchise and shareholder growth.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>About Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc.</strong></p> <p align=\"left\">Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc. is a leading franchiser of a premium chocolate and confectionary retail store concept. As America’s Chocolatier™, the Company has been producing an extensive line of premium chocolates and other confectionery products, including gourmet caramel apples since 1981. Headquartered in Durango, Colorado, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory is ranked among Entrepreneur’s Franchise 500® for 2026. The Company and its franchisees and licensees operate over 250 Rocky Mountain Chocolate stores across the United States, with several international locations.

The demonstration will showcase testing capabilities aligned with planned Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite deployments, including Starlink Direct to Cell.</p><p>As satellite connectivity becomes integral to 5G evolution and future 6G networks, chipset and device vendors must validate NR-NTN performance well in advance of large-scale deployment. Satellite systems in LEO introduce new challenges, including rapid motion, frequent handovers, dynamic link conditions, and stringent positioning requirements.
