With the addition of two renowned Bushveld and Platreef geologists to the team and strategic investments by Glencore plc, the Company is well positioned to advance the next phase of large-scale critical mineral supply from this world-class American district, building on past production of nickel, copper, and chromium, and the on-going production of platinum group, nickel, and other metals by neighboring Sibanye-Stillwater. An expanded NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate, released January 2023, positions Stillwater West with the largest nickel resource in an active U.S. mining district as part of a compelling suite of ten minerals now listed as critical in the USA.</p><p>Stillwater also holds a <percent>49%</percent> interest in the high-grade Drayton-Black Lake-gold project adjacent to Nexgold Mining's development-stage Goliath Gold Complex in northwest Ontario, currently under an earn-in agreement with Heritage Mining, and the Kluane PGE-Ni-Cu-Co critical minerals project on trend with Nickel Creek Platinum's Wellgreen deposit in Canada's Yukon Territory. The Company also holds the Duke Island Cu-Ni-PGE property in Alaska and maintains a back-in right on the high-grade past-producing Yankee-Dundee in BC, following its sale in 2013.</p><div id=\"contactInfo\"><p><b>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT:</b></p><p>Michael Rowley, President, CEO &amp; Director - Stillwater Critical Minerals<br/>Email: <a href=\"mailto:info@criticalminerals.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">info@criticalminerals.com</a> Phone: (604) 357 4790<br/>Web: <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/EZ2gOcjYpY\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://criticalminerals.com</a> Toll Free: (888) 432 0075</p></div><p><u><b>Forward-Looking Statements</b></u></p><p>This news release includes certain statements that may be deemed \"forward-looking statements\". In particular, this press release contains forward-looking information relating to, among other things, the Offering, the anticipated closing date of the Offering, the intended use of proceeds of the Offering, approval of the TSXV and the filing of the Amended Offering Document. All statements in this release, other than statements of historical facts including, without limitation, statements regarding potential mineralization, historic production, estimation of mineral resources, the realization of mineral resource estimates, interpretation of prior exploration and potential exploration results, the timing and success of exploration activities generally, the timing and results of future resource estimates, permitting time lines, metal prices and currency exchange rates, availability of capital, government regulation of exploration operations, environmental risks, reclamation, title, and future plans and objectives of the company are forward-looking statements that involve various risks and uncertainties. Although Stillwater Critical Minerals believes the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on a number of material factors and assumptions. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements include failure to obtain necessary approvals, unsuccessful exploration results, changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined, results of future resource estimates, future metal prices, availability of capital and financing on acceptable terms, general economic, market or business conditions, risks associated with regulatory changes, defects in title, availability of personnel, materials and equipment on a timely basis, accidents or equipment breakdowns, uninsured risks, delays in receiving government approvals, unanticipated environmental impacts on operations and costs to remedy same, and other exploration or other risks detailed herein and from time to time in the filings made by the companies with securities regulators. Readers are cautioned that mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Mineral exploration and development of mines is an inherently risky business. Accordingly, the actual events may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

Geochemical analysis certificates included in Assessment Report 31,834 comprise results from three laboratories: Pioneer Labs (Certificate 2102718, 2010), ALS (Certificate VA10144345, 2010), and SGS (Certificate CA02322, 2010). The SGS certificate reported three rare earth elements including La 10 percent, Pr 0.77 percent, and Ce 13.1 percent.</p><p>Sample AR-20 was taken from a shear zone at 2,270 meters elevation hosted in coarse grain syenite gneiss with elevated apatite and zircon. The historic Copeland Mine, at elevation 2,100 metres is located 1.2 km northwest of Mount Copeland. Review of the 2010 technical report identified a typographical transcription error in the summary table. The original laboratory certificates contained in the appendix were correct; however, certain assay values for rock chip sample COPE10AR-20 were not accurately transcribed into the summary table. Using the original laboratory certificates referenced in the appendix, the Company recalculated the Total Rare Earth Oxide equivalent for sample AR20, which returns approximately 26 percent TREO.</p><p>The Company cautions that this recalculated TREO value is derived from historic laboratory certificates and has not been independently re-assayed or verified under current National Instrument 43-101 standards. The reported value relates to a select rock chip sample and is not necessarily representative of mineralization across the property. Rock chip samples are selective in nature and may not be indicative of grade or continuity.</p><p>In 2024, additional rock chip samples collected near the edge of the Copeland Glacier returned values of up to 0.234 percent niobium associated with elevated molybdenum. These results are also based on selective sampling and may not be representative of mineralization across the property. Representative samples from AR20 and other prospective zones are being prepared for submission to an independent laboratory for ICP-MS analysis to support potential future NI 43-101 compliant disclosure.</p><p><b>Molybdenum and Rhenium Update</b></p><p>The Company has also applied its dry mineral separation process to molybdenum-bearing rock chip samples from both Mount Copeland and the Red Bird property, upgrading the material to molybdenum concentrates. </p><p>The Red Bird property is characterized as a copper-molybdenum porphyry system with associated silver and rhenium mineralization, as documented in prior exploration work. Rhenium is commonly associated with molybdenite in porphyry environments.</p><p>Preliminary internal XRF analysis was performed using an Elvatech ElvaX ProSpector 3 X-ray fluorescence analyzer. The instrument was calibrated in accordance with manufacturer specifications and verified using certified reference standards prior to analysis.</p><p>Internal XRF analysis indicates that Mount Copeland material returned approximately 2,790 ppm rhenium in elemental analysis. Red Bird material returned approximately 3,182 ppm rhenium in oxide analysis and 2,115 ppm rhenium in elemental analysis of selected separated samples.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9904/285660_ef0bab2f8407998f_001full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

All rhenium results reported are preliminary and based on internal XRF analysis. The reported values relate to selected samples and may not be representative of mineralization across the respective properties. Representative samples from both properties will be submitted to an independent laboratory for verification using ICP-MS methods, and any future technical disclosure will be made in accordance with NI 43-101.</p><p>At PDAC 2026, in addition to graphite concentrates, graphene materials, and lithium-metal battery samples, Volt Carbon intends to display rock chip sample COPE10AR-20 from the Mount Copeland property, along with dry separated molybdenum concentrate samples derived from Mount Copeland that demonstrated measurable rhenium values in internal XRF analysis.</p><p><b>Qualified Person</b></p><p>The technical content of this release has been reviewed and approved by Andris Kikauka, P.Geo., who is the author of the 2010 Mount Copeland technical report and acts as a geologist for the Company.

Further, PSA50 responses were observed across all baseline mean Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmean) groups.</p><p><b>About 225Ac-PSMA-Trillium (BAY 3563254)<br/></b><sup>225</sup>Ac-PSMA-Trillium (BAY 3563254) is a next-generation TAT that comprises a highly specific PSMA-targeting motif, an albumin-binding domain to optimize tumor uptake and retention, and a Macropa<sup>TM</sup> chelator complexed with the alpha-emitter actinium-225. The distinctive structural components are designed to provide a differentiated safety and efficacy profile. Both in vitro and in vivo characterization of <sup>225</sup>Ac-PSMA-Trillium demonstrates high tumor uptake and retention. Potent antitumor efficacy has been observed in several preclinical models of prostate cancer. PSMA-Trillium resulted from the acquisition of PSMA Therapeutics and Noria Therapeutics in 2021 and are now under clinical investigation.</p><p><b>About Targeted Alpha Therapy<br/></b>Targeted alpha therapy (TAT) is an emerging class of radionuclide therapy that can be used against a variety of tumors. It delivers alpha particle radiation directly to the tumor inside the body, either via its bone-seeking property (radium-223) or by combining alpha radionuclides, such as actinium-225, with specific targeting moieties.</p><p>Actinium-225 is an alpha particle–emitting radionuclide with a 9.9-day half-life. Alpha particles deposit highly ionizing radiation over a short range. This localized delivery of the radioactive payload induces irreparable DNA double-strand breaks, often resulting in cell death.</p><p><b>About prostate cancer<br/></b>Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men. Despite significant advances in the last decade, the prognosis for men with mCRPC remains poor with a median survival of about 31 months.<sup>2</sup> With increasing incidence, more than 300 thousand prostate cancer cases were reported in the US in 2025; 5-year relative survival with distant disease is only <percent>34%</percent>.<sup>3</sup> Advances in imaging technologies (i.e. PSMA-PET) and their utilization across all stages of prostate cancer will likely result in an increased number of patients diagnosed with metastatic disease earlier. Consequently, more men will be diagnosed with <i>de novo</i> PSMA-positive metastatic disease.</p><p><b>About Bayer<br/></b>Bayer is a global enterprise with core competencies in the life science fields of health care and nutrition.
