(NASDAQ: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/ILMN/\" title=\"View ILMN stock overview\">ILMN</a>) today announced that Illumina Laboratory Services, Illumina's CLIA-certified laboratory, is providing clinical sequencing and interpretation services to the new Diagnostic Lab at Florida Institute for Pediatric Rare Diseases (IPRD) at Florida State University (FSU) College of Medicine, further driving innovation in diagnostics and treatments for rare diseases.</p><div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1\"><p><a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2921838/Illumina_Tech.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Cynthia Vied, PhD, scientific director, IPRD Diagnostic Lab at FSU College of Medicine\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2921838/Illumina_Tech.jpg\" title=\"Cynthia Vied, PhD, scientific director, IPRD Diagnostic Lab at FSU College of Medicine\"/></a></p></div><p>\"An estimated 30 million people across the country are living with a rare disease today and clinical whole-genome testing provides a transformative opportunity to end the diagnostic odyssey for patients,\" said Eric Green, MD, PhD, chief medical officer of Illumina. \"Our colleagues at IPRD will now be equipped to break diagnostic barriers, and we are proud to help them accelerate making life-saving discoveries.\"</p><p>Diagnosing rare genetic diseases is challenging—advanced genomic sequencing and interpretation are crucial for uncovering novel mutations that can be hidden in deep parts of the genome. Furthermore, results must be reliable and actionable for clinicians who are often presented with diseases they have never encountered previously. Illumina's goal is to equip more labs with the solutions and tools they need to diagnose rare diseases more consistently and help reduce the time it takes to transition from diagnosis to clinical management.</p><p>\"I've been running Illumina sequencers for over 10 years, but it's a new ball game when you're talking about clinical samples,\" said Cynthia Vied, PhD, scientific director, IPRD Diagnostic Lab at FSU College of Medicine. \"We have learned how to do things much differently in the clinical lab compared to my work in the research facility, and I think it has helped both sides.\"</p><p>\"Now, all the work we do means we can impact a patient—a child—and a family going through a challenging health situation,\" continued Vied. \"We can help them understand and hopefully help the physicians provide a treatment based on the diagnoses that we're going to provide from the lab. That, to me, is extraordinary.\"   </p><p>Building on a long-standing relationship between Illumina and FSU College of Medicine, the IPRD Diagnostic Lab utilized services from the Illumina Customer Success and Implementation team for workflow enablement. Illumina Laboratory Services enabled the IPRD Diagnostic Lab to rapidly initiate their clinical diagnostic testing through clinical genome sequencing and interpretation services.</p><p>With a mission to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome, Illumina is proud to support customers like IPRD who are dedicated to finding answers for patients with rare genetic disease.

Our business model is to provide clients with toll milling services and produce high-grade marketable concentrates from mineral purchases. The Aguila Norte processing plant has an environmental permit (\"IGAC\") from the Peruvian government which provides the Company with the ability to expand operations past the current 100 tonnes per day level. The Company continues to acquire and develop precious and base metal properties in Peru.</p><p>The Company has recently completed a financing which will allow the Company to focus its 2026 development program on its high-grade Au-Ag Palta Dorada property. New metallurgical results in both oxide and sulphide material highlight the gold potential at Palta Dorada. Provisional permits are in place allowing the company to extract large bulk samples of both the oxide and sulphide material. Sulphide material will be transported to our Aguila Norte mill for processing where we will be able to produce an Au-Ag concentrate for sale. The oxide gold material, along with similar oxide mineral at our Aguila Norte site, will be one of many catalysts and sources of material for a potential CIP circuit.

(\"Orogen\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that it has signed a purchase and sale agreement (the \"Agreement\") with Quebec Nickel Corp. (CSE: QNI) (\"Quebec Nickel\") whereby Quebec Nickel can acquire a <percent>100%</percent> interest in the Ecru gold project, Nevada, USA.</p><p>Under the terms of the Agreement, Quebec Nickel can acquire a <percent>100%</percent> interest in the Ecru claims from Orogen for an aggregate consideration of <money>$540,000</money> in cash and shares of Quebec Nickel (\"Consideration Shares\"), subject to regulatory acceptance of the Canadian Securities Exchange, and payable as follows:</p><ol><li><p><money>$250,000</money> cash on closing of the acquisition, <money>$25,000</money> of which has already been received;</p></li><li><p>1,000,000 Consideration Shares of Quebec Nickel issued on closing, at a price of <money>$0.16</money>5 per share, representing the permitted discount to the closing price of Quebec Nickel's common shares on February 26, 2026; and</p></li><li><p>Within six months of closing, the issuance to Orogen of <money>$125,000</money> of Consideration Shares at a price per share equal to the 10-day volume weighted average price of the common shares of Quebec Nickel on the Canadian Securities Exchange at the date of the issue.</p></li></ol><p>Quebec Nickel will also grant a non-buyable <percent>2%</percent> net smelter return (\"NSR\") royalty to Orogen.</p><p>Closing of the acquisition is expected to be completed within the next 30 days.</p><p>Paddy Nicol, CEO of Orogen commented, \"The Ecru gold project, staked by Orogen's generative team, is favourably located in the prolific Cortez trend in Nevada, immediately north and adjacent to Nevada Gold Mines Robertson deposit. We look forward to following the progress of the Quebec Nickel team at Ecru.\"</p><p><strong><u>About the Ecru Gold Project</u></strong></p><p>The Ecru project is located on the northeast margin of Nevada Gold Mine's Cortez Trend land position (the Cortez Complex<sup>1</sup>) within the larger Battle Mountain - Eureka trend. The property consists of 112 lode-mining claims <percent>100%</percent> owned by Orogen and two leased sections. The project lies immediately adjacent to Nevada Gold Mines' 2.4 Moz Robertson reduced intrusion related gold deposit<sup>1</sup> (Figure 1).</p><p>Two main target areas are located on the property and demonstrate the potential for both Carlin and Robertson-style mineralization (Figure 2).</p><p>The shallower intrusive target is defined by a two-kilometre diameter area of multiple magnetic highs and adjacent gravity lows, interpreted to reflect intrusive bodies and associated alteration within upper‑plate siliciclastic rocks. Multiple intrusive phases are present on the property, both at surface and in historical drill intercepts. These multi‑phase intrusives and the surrounding rock exhibit characteristics and geochemical signatures analogous to the Robertson deposit.</p><p>A potential Carlin-type system is defined by an untested, prominent gravity high target interpreted to be a region of structurally uplifted lower plate carbonates near surface, under pediment cover. Nearby historical drilling has identified anomalous gold and pathfinder geochemistry in upper plate stratigraphy which supports the potential for a mineralized, lower plate carbonate window at Ecru.</p><p>Quebec Nickel plans to evaluate the potential for both deposit types on the property.</p><a href=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/bdbbbf6b-4bb9-443c-b0ca-2e40b3395753/1142121/orogen-fig1-022626.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/bdbbbf6b-4bb9-443c-b0ca-2e40b3395753/1142121/orogen-fig1-022626.jpg\" style=\"text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto;\" width=\"566\"/></a><figcaption><strong>Figure 1: Location of the Ecru project.
