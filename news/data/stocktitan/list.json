Revenues from commercial, state and local and international government clients increased <percent>16%</percent> and accounted for <percent>62%</percent> of fourth quarter revenues. This performance served to offset a large portion of the year-on-year reduction in federal government revenues, which was amplified by the direct and indirect impacts of the six-week federal government shutdown.</p><p>\"ICF continued to experience robust demand from our commercial energy clients, driving revenue growth in this client category of <percent>23%</percent> in the fourth quarter and <percent>24%</percent> for the full year. Approximately <percent>80%</percent> of our 2025 commercial energy revenues were related to our market-leading programs for utility clients on energy efficiency, flexible load management, electrification and grid optimization. These are critical areas for our utility clients as they address increasing electricity demand and the need for grid resilience and energy affordability.</p><p>\"We succeeded in maintaining full year 2025 margins that were similar to those of 2024, despite the revenue decline. Year-on-year gross margins expanded by more than 60 basis points and Adjusted EBITDA margin on total revenues was <percent>11.1%</percent> in 2025 compared to <percent>11.2%</percent> in 2024, benefitting from the increased contribution of higher-margin commercial energy revenues and cost management initiatives, while we continued to invest in growth initiatives and emerging technologies including our AI service offerings. Additionally, fixed price and time and materials contracts accounted for approximately <percent>93%</percent> of 2025 revenues compared to <percent>89%</percent> in 2024, while cost reimbursement contracts declined to <percent>7%</percent>.</p><p>\"ICF ended 2025 with a firm backlog, a healthy book-to-bill ratio of 1.19 and a business development pipeline of <money><money>$8.6 billion</money></money>, reflecting effective execution on existing contracts and our agility in capturing new business opportunities with capabilities that support our expectations for future growth. Demonstrating our confidence in ICF's outlook, we repurchased approximately 564,000 shares of outstanding common stock in 2025, of which about 220,000 shares were purchased in the fourth quarter.\"</p><p><b>Fourth Quarter 2025 Results</b></p><p>Fourth quarter 2025 total revenue was <money><money>$443.7 million</money></money>, reflecting the impact of the government shutdown, compared to <money><money>$496.3 million</money></money> reported in the fourth quarter of 2024 and <money><money>$465.4 million</money></money> in this year's third quarter.

Our 2025 revenues were firmly within the guidance framework we provided one year ago despite the six-week government shutdown, we maintained our margins, and we built the foundation for a return to growth in 2026. This performance underscores ICF's competitive strengths, namely our diversified business model, deep domain expertise and cross-cutting technology offerings that are primarily provided under outcome-based contracts.</p><p>\"We expect our 2026 revenues to range from <money><money>$1.89 billion</money></money> to <money><money>$1.96 billion</money></money>, representing <percent>3%</percent> growth at the midpoint, GAAP EPS to range from <money><money>$5.95</money></money> to <money><money>$6.25</money></money>, and Non-GAAP EPS to range from <money><money>$6.95</money></money> to <money><money>$7.25</money></money>, or <percent>5%</percent> growth at the midpoint. These expectations anticipate another year of double-digit revenue growth from our non-federal government clients, which we estimate will account for more than <percent>60%</percent> of our total 2026 revenues, and a return to year-on-year growth in certain parts of our federal government business. Full-year operating cash flow is estimated to range from <money><money>$135 million</money></money> to <money><money>$150 million</money></money>.</p><p>\"With respect to the cadence of the year, we generally expect sequential improvement in federal revenues from the first quarter through the third quarter of 2026, returning to year-on-year growth by the fourth quarter. Our first-quarter comparisons will be down as we will be comparing against a quarter that included federal government contract work that was cancelled between February and May of last year. For the first quarter of 2026, we expect total revenues of approximately <money><money>$450 million</money></money>, GAAP EPS of approximately <money><money>$1.20</money></money>, and Non-GAAP EPS of approximately <money><money>$1.55</money></money>.</p><p>\"We appreciate the tremendous contributions made by our professional staff, whose commitment to excellent client work was critical to our ability to navigate 2025 and whose dedication to ICF supports our confidence in a return to growth in 2026,\" Mr. Wasson concluded.</p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"prnbcc\"><tr><td class=\"prnpr2 prnpl2 prnvab prnsbtb0 prnrbrb0 prnsbbb0 prnsblb0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><sup>1</sup> Non-GAAP EPS, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measurements.

We present historical and forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. See the section entitled “Statement Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for an explanation of these non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures for sales-led subscription revenue, operating margin and net earnings/(loss) per share is not available without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, many of the costs and expenses that may be incurred in the future. These items necessary to reconcile such non-GAAP measures could be material and have a significant impact on the Company’s results computed in accordance with GAAP.</p><p><b>Conference Call and Webcast</b></p><p>As previously announced, Elastic’s executive management team will host a conference call today at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss the Company’s financial results and business outlook.

Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to uncertainties, risks, and changes in circumstances, including but not limited to, those related to: our future financial performance, including our expectations regarding our revenue, cost of revenue, gross profit or gross margin, operating expenses (which include changes in sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses), and our ability to achieve and maintain future profitability; the impact of the evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical environments on our business, operations, hiring and financial results, and on businesses and spending priorities of our customers and partners; the impact of our pricing model strategies on our business; the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the uncertain inflation and interest rate environment, and tariffs and other international trade policies on our results; our ability to continue to deliver and improve our offerings and develop new offerings (including innovations around AI use cases); customer acceptance and purchase of our new and existing offerings; the expansion and adoption of our offerings; our ability to realize value from investments in the business; our ability to maintain and expand our user and customer base; our international expansion strategy; the impact of our licensing model on the use and adoption of our software; our operating results and cash flows; the sufficiency of our capital resources; our ability to successfully execute our go-to-market strategy; our forecasts regarding our business; risks affecting continuation of our share repurchase program; and general market, political, economic and business conditions.</p><p>Any additional or unforeseen effects from the evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical environments may exacerbate these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements are included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2025 and subsequent quarterly and current reports filed with the SEC. SEC filings are available on the Investor Relations section of Elastic’s website at ir.elastic.co and the SEC’s website at <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&amp;esheet=54434271&amp;newsitemid=20260226919094&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.sec.gov&amp;index=1&amp;md5=c135fce54a1d075eb4678d08e2da0686\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">www.sec.gov</a>. Elastic assumes no obligation to, and does not currently intend to, update any such forward-looking statements, except as required by law.</p><p><b>Statement Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures</b></p><p>In addition to our results determined in accordance with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we believe the non-GAAP measures discussed below are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. Investors are cautioned that there are a number of limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics as analytical tools. Investors are encouraged to review the differences between GAAP financial measures and the corresponding non-GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business and financial results.</p><p>Reconciliations of historical GAAP financial measures to their respective historical non-GAAP financial measures are included below. In relation to constant currency non-GAAP financial measures, the only reconciling item between GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures is the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Further details on how we calculate such effects can be found in the definition of “Constant Currency” below.</p><p><b>Sales-led Subscription Revenue</b></p><p>Sales-led subscription revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as total subscription revenue excluding Monthly Elastic Cloud. We believe sales-led subscription revenue provides management and our investors with a consistent metric with which to measure the health of our business.</p><p><b>Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin</b></p><p>We define non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin as GAAP gross profit and GAAP gross margin, respectively, excluding stock-based compensation expense and related employer taxes, and amortization of acquired intangible assets. We believe non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations, as these metrics generally eliminate the effects of certain variables from period to period for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.</p><p><b>Non-GAAP Operating Income and Non-GAAP Operating Margin</b></p><p>We define non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin as GAAP operating income/(loss) and GAAP operating margin, respectively, excluding stock-based compensation expense and related employer taxes, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses, and restructuring and other related charges. We believe non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations, as these metrics generally eliminate the effects of certain variables from period to period for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.</p><p><b>Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share</b></p><p>We define non-GAAP net income as GAAP income/(loss), excluding stock-based compensation expense and related employer taxes, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses, and restructuring and other related charges. Additionally, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are adjusted for an assumed provision for income taxes based on a projected non-GAAP annual effective tax rate of <percent>13%</percent>. We define non-GAAP earnings per share, basic, as non-GAAP net income divided by weighted average shares outstanding and non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted, as non-GAAP net income divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding, which includes the potentially dilutive effect of the company’s employee equity incentive plan awards. We believe non-GAAP earnings per share provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as this metric generally eliminates the effects of certain variables from period to period for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.</p><p><b>Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin</b></p><p>Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for cash paid for interest on long-term debt less cash used for investing activities for purchases of property and equipment. Adjusted free cash flow margin is calculated as adjusted free cash flow divided by total revenue. Adjusted free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since, among other things, we have mandatory debt service requirements.</p><p><b>Constant Currency</b></p><p>We compare the percent change in certain results from one period to another period using constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. In presenting this information, current and comparative prior period results are converted into <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location> dollars at the exchange rates in effect on the last day of our prior fiscal year, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods.</p><p><b>Contact Information</b></p><p>Elastic Investor Relations<br/><a

We believe this approach provides investors with a more consistent view of our underlying operating performance. Our annual projected non-GAAP tax rate excludes the impact from stock-based compensation expense and related employer taxes, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses, restructuring and other related charges, discrete tax items, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, and other non-recurring tax adjustments, which may vary in size and frequency. Our annual projected non-GAAP tax rate may change due to factors such as new tax legislation, shifts in the geographic mix of earnings, or other significant business developments. We assess this rate as needed to ensure it reflects current conditions. Applying a consistent annual rate improves comparability across reporting periods by excluding the effects of discrete or non-recurring tax items.</p></td></tr></table><table cellspacing=\"0\"

These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> GAAP. EBITDA, EBITDA<i>re</i>, Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, Adjusted FFO, Comparable Total Revenue, Comparable Room Revenues, Comparable Hotel Adjusted EBITDA and Comparable Hotel Adjusted EBITDA Margin, as calculated by us, may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company.</p><p><b><i>Use and Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures</i></b></p><p>Our management and Board of Directors use EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, Adjusted FFO, Comparable Total Revenue, Comparable Room Revenues, Comparable Hotel Adjusted EBITDA and Comparable Hotel Adjusted EBITDA Margin, to evaluate the performance of our hotels and to facilitate comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital intensive companies. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations. These non-GAAP financial measures as presented by us, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures as calculated by other real estate companies. These measures do not reflect certain expenses or expenditures that we incurred and will incur, such as depreciation, interest and capital expenditures. We compensate for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our reconciliations to the most comparable <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> GAAP financial measures, and our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income and consolidated statements of cash flows, include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures.</p><p>These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> GAAP. They should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit, cash flow from operations, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe, when viewed with our <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure.</p><p><b><i>EBITDA and EBITDA</i></b><b>re</b></p><p>EBITDA represents net income (calculated in accordance with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> GAAP) excluding: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sale of assets; and (3) depreciation and amortization. The Company computes EBITDA<i>re</i> in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"Nareit\") guidelines, as defined in its September 2017 white paper \"Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate.\" EBITDA<i>re</i> represents net income (calculated in accordance with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> GAAP) adjusted for: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sale of assets; (3) depreciation and amortization; (4) gains or losses on the disposition of depreciated property including gains or losses on change of control; (5) impairment write-downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate; and (6) adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDA<i>re</i> of unconsolidated affiliates.</p><p>We believe EBITDA and EBITDA<i>re</i> are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because they help investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization, and in the case of EBITDA<i>re</i>, impairment and gains or losses on dispositions of depreciated property) from our operating results. In addition, covenants included in our debt agreements use EBITDA as a measure of financial compliance. We also use EBITDA and EBITDA<i>re</i> as measures in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions.</p><p><b><i>FFO</i></b></p><p>The Company computes FFO in accordance with standards established by Nareit, which defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> GAAP) excluding gains or losses from sales of properties and impairment losses, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO provides useful information to investors regarding its operating performance because it is a measure of the Company's operations without regard to specified non-cash items, such as real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains or losses on the sale of assets. The Company also uses FFO as one measure in assessing its operating results.</p><p><b><i>Adjustments to EBITDAre and FFO</i></b></p><p>We adjust EBITDA<i>re </i>and FFO when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted FFO when combined with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> GAAP net income, EBITDA<i>re</i> and FFO, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our consolidated and property-level operating performance.  We adjust EBITDA<i>re </i>and FFO for the following items:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li><i>Non-Cash Lease Expense and Other Amortization</i>: We exclude the non-cash expense incurred from the straight line recognition of expense from our ground leases and other contractual obligations and the non-cash amortization of our favorable and unfavorable contracts, originally recorded in conjunction with certain hotel acquisitions. We exclude these non-cash items because they do not reflect the actual cash amounts due to the respective lessors in the current period and they are of lesser significance in evaluating our actual performance for that period.<br/><br/></li><li><i>Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle</i>: The Financial Accounting Standards Board promulgates new accounting standards that require or permit the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. We exclude the effect of these adjustments, which include the accounting impact from prior periods, because they do not reflect the Company's actual underlying performance for the current period.<br/><br/></li><li><i>Gains or Losses from Debt Extinguishment</i>: We exclude the effect of gains or losses recorded on debt extinguishment because these gains or losses result from transaction activity related to the Company's capital structure that we believe are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of the Company or our hotels.<br/><br/></li><li><i>Hotel Acquisition Costs</i>: We exclude hotel acquisition costs expensed during the period because we believe these transaction costs are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels.<br/><br/></li><li><i>Severance Costs</i>: We exclude corporate severance costs, or reversals thereof, incurred with the termination of corporate-level employees and severance costs incurred at our hotels related to lease terminations or structured severance programs because we believe these costs do not reflect the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels.<br/><br/></li><li><i>Hotel Manager Transition and Hotel Pre-Opening Costs</i>: We exclude the transition costs associated with a change in hotel manager and the pre-opening costs associated with the redevelopment or rebranding of a hotel because we believe these items do not reflect the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels.<br/><br/></li><li><i>Share-Based Compensation Expense: W</i>e exclude share-based compensation expense as it is a non-cash item. This adjustment aligns with the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for our financial covenant ratios under our credit facility, supporting consistency in our financial reporting and covenant compliance, as well as comparability with our peers.<br/><br/></li><li><i>Other Items</i>: From time to time we incur costs or realize gains that we consider outside the ordinary course of business and that we do not believe reflect the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels. Such items may include, but are not limited to, the following: non-cash realized gains or losses on our deferred compensation plan assets; management or franchise contract termination fees; terminated transaction costs; gains or losses from legal settlements; costs incurred related to natural disasters; and gains on property insurance claim settlements, other than income related to business interruption insurance.</li></ul><p>In addition, to derive Adjusted FFO, we exclude any unrealized fair value adjustments to interest rate swaps and the portion of our non-cash ground lease expense recognized as interest expense.  We exclude these non-cash amounts because they do not reflect the underlying performance of the Company.</p><p><b><i>Hotel Adjusted EBITDA</i></b></p><p>We believe that Hotel Adjusted EBITDA provides our investors a useful financial measure to evaluate our hotel operating performance, excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest), our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization), and our corporate-level expenses.  With respect to Hotel Adjusted EBITDA, we believe that excluding the effect of corporate-level expenses provides a more complete understanding of the operating results over which individual hotels and third-party management companies have direct control.  We believe property-level results provide investors with supplemental information on the ongoing operational performance of our hotels and effectiveness of the third-party management companies operating our business on a property-level basis. Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margins are calculated as Hotel Adjusted EBITDA divided by total hotel revenues. </p><p><b><i>Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results</i></b></p><p>We believe that presenting comparable hotel operating statistics (such as ADR, occupancy, RevPAR, Total RevPAR and Available Rooms) and results (such as Room Revenues, Total Revenues, Hotel Adjusted EBITDA, and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA Margin) is useful to investors because these measures help facilitate year-over-year comparisons of the performance of hotels owned by us as of the reporting date.  Our comparable portfolio includes hotels (i) owned and in operation by us for the entirety of the periods presented and (ii) acquired by us during the period as though the acquisition happened at the beginning of the period presented.  We make adjustments for recently acquired hotels to include operating statistics and results for periods prior to our ownership.  As a result, changes as compared to periods prior to our ownership will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results.  In addition, comparable metrics excludes results and operating statistics for hotels that were sold during the reporting period or held for sale at the end of the period.  We believe these comparable measures provide more consistent metrics for comparing the performance of our hotels. </p><p>Our comparable portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2025 includes all of our hotels owned as of December 31, 2025 and excludes the Westin Washington D.C. City Center sold on February 19, 2025.</p><p><b>Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures</b></p><p><b><i>EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA</i></b></p><p>The following tables are

These activities are intended to optimize the developable footprint and maximize usable acreage for data center deployment.</p><p>By seeking to consolidate this corridor, New Era is looking to enhance its ability to structure direct power solutions and optimize interconnection design as it advances development of its now 438-acre, master-planned TCDC campus, which is designed to scale to more than 1 gigawatt over time.</p><p>The additional acreage would expand New Era’s capacity to:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Directly on next for major power offtake arrangements with nearby energy generation and transport infrastructure</li><li>Negotiate more efficient and flexible interconnection structures</li><li>Reduce exposure to broader grid congestion and transmission constraints; and</li><li>Enhance redundancy, reliability, and long-term expansion flexibility</li></ul><p>The Company expects control of the corridor between operating generation assets and its campus footprint may potentially increase New Era’s negotiating leverage with power producers while improving development sequencing. It also expands the Company’s options for transmission access and energy integration, which are critical for hyperscale and high-performance computing tenants requiring scalable, resilient power infrastructure.</p><p>E. Will Gray II, CEO of New Era Energy &amp; Digital commented: “By taking the first step to secure this additional 54 acres, we are seeking to strengthen our strategic land position between major power generation and transmission assets and take a pivotal step toward finalizing a definitive lease agreement with our end tenant. This transaction would further reinforce TCDC’s positioning as an integrated power and digital infrastructure platform designed for long-term expansion and operational reliability.”</p><p><b>About New Era Energy &amp; Digital, Inc.<br/></b>New Era Energy &amp; Digital, Inc.

The combination demonstrated a safety profile consistent with docetaxel alone, with no new or unexpected safety signals observed. The regimen also showed clinically meaningful efficacy, including high rates of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses and sustained PSA reductions, supporting continued development and advancement into Phase 3 studies. The results were presented for the first time at the 2026 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Genitourinary Cancers Symposium (Abstract #171).<sup>1</sup></p><div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1\"><p><a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2333578/Johnson_and_Johnson_Logo_v1.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"(PRNewsfoto/Johnson &amp; Johnson)\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2333578/Johnson_and_Johnson_Logo_v1.jpg\" title=\"(PRNewsfoto/Johnson &amp; Johnson)\"/></a></p></div><p>Pasritamig is designed to engage the immune system through a novel mechanism of action, binding CD3 on T cells and human kallikrein 2 (KLK2). KLK2 is a novel, highly specific prostate cancer target with minimal expression outside prostate tissue. By both activating and directing T cells to KLK2-expressing tumor cells, pasritamig enables targeted immune engagement. This differentiated, prostate-specific approach was intentionally built to focus immune activity on prostate cancer cells, which may help limit effects on healthy tissue, and supports administration in a doctor's office rather than hospital setting.</p><p>\"These data represent an important step forward for patients with advanced prostate cancer,\" said Professor Shahneen Sandhu,* M.D., Ph.D., MBBS, FRACP, Associate Professor, Consultant Medical Oncologist and researcher at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, and study investigator. \"In a disease where outcomes remain poor for many patients, seeing encouraging clinical activity alongside a favorable safety profile in combination with docetaxel reinforces the potential of this approach and supports further clinical development.\"</p><p>\"Based on these findings, we are increasingly confident in the potential of pasritamig to meaningfully improve outcomes for people with prostate cancer,\" said Charles Drake, M.D., Ph.D., Vice President, Prostate Cancer and Cross Cancer Immuno-Oncology, Johnson &amp; Johnson. \"The ability to combine pasritamig with docetaxel, where prior approaches in the field have fallen short, gives us a strong foundation for Phase 3 development. What we're seeing with this combination, including deep and durable PSA responses, underscores the promise of this combination immunotherapy approach and our commitment to advancing innovation that can make a difference for patients.\"</p><p><b>Detailed Study Results</b></p><p>In the study, pasritamig was evaluated in combination with docetaxel in an outpatient setting in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer whose disease had progressed following androgen receptor pathway inhibitor therapy. Approximately half of the patients (45 percent) had received at least one prior taxane-based regimen. The primary endpoint was safety and identification of the recommended regimen for further development in Phase 2/3 studies, with secondary and exploratory endpoints assessing clinical activity, including PSA response rates.<sup>1</sup></p><p>As of December 9, 2025, 51 patients had received pasritamig plus docetaxel, including patients who were pretreated with a median of three prior therapies (range, 1-9). Reductions of 50 percent or greater in PSA levels were achieved in 64.7 percent of patients overall and in 75.0 percent of taxane-naïve patients. Reductions of 90 percent or greater in PSA levels were achieved in 39.2 percent of patients overall and 53.6 percent of taxane-naïve patients. Among taxane-naïve patients with bone-only disease, confirmed PSA reductions of 50 percent or greater and 90 percent or greater were observed in 88.2 percent and 76.5 percent of patients, respectively. Patients were able to continue pasritamig beyond docetaxel discontinuation. Those patients received a median of six docetaxel doses every three weeks and eight pasritamig doses every six weeks, supporting the potential for sustained disease control over time.<sup>1</sup></p><p>The safety profile of pasritamig plus docetaxel was consistent with the known safety profile of docetaxel in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurring in at least 20 percent of patients included fatigue (60.8 percent), alopecia (41.2 percent), diarrhea and nausea (31.4 percent each), peripheral edema (27.5 percent), peripheral sensory neuropathy (25.5 percent) and dysgeusia (23.5 percent). Pasritamig-related adverse events occurring in at least 10 percent of patients were fatigue (33.3 percent) and non-chronic diarrhea (11.8 percent). Grade 3 or higher TRAEs attributed to docetaxel were observed in 29.4 percent of patients, compared with only two percent attributed to pasritamig. No patients experienced cytokine release syndrome of any grade or treatment-related deaths.<sup>1 </sup></p><p>Two ongoing Phase 3 studies are evaluating pasritamig in the metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer setting.

The primary objective is to determine the recommended regimen for further development based on safety, with secondary and exploratory endpoints assessing clinical activity. Pasritamig was administered intravenously every six weeks, with initial step-up doses given during the first treatment cycle, in combination with docetaxel administered intravenously every three weeks. Treatment was delivered in an outpatient setting. Corticosteroids were used only as standard premedication for docetaxel, and hematopoietic growth factor support was permitted as needed.<sup>4</sup></p><p><b>About Pasritamig (JNJ-78278343)</b></p><p>Pasritamig (JNJ-78278343) is an investigational T-cell-redirecting bispecific antibody (bsAb) targeting human kallikrein 2 (KLK2) on prostate cancer cells and CD3 receptor complexes on T cells, leveraging the body's immune system to selectively target and eliminate cancer cells. This innovative approach is being evaluated in pretreated patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), a patient population with limited treatment options.</p><p><b>About Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)</b></p><p>Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a challenging and aggressive stage of prostate cancer where the disease progresses despite androgen deprivation therapy.<sup>5</sup> Patients often experience metastasis to bones and lymph nodes, leading to poor outcomes and limited treatment options, including chemotherapy and second-line hormone therapies.<sup>6</sup> The median overall survival ranges from 13.5 to 31.6 months depending on the site of metastasis, with a typical range of 15 to 36 months across the broader population.<sup>7,8</sup> Survival rates can vary significantly depending on factors such as prior treatment history, disease burden, and response to therapy. The need for more effective treatments is critical, as the disease continues to impact a large number of men globally, with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) being responsible for a substantial number of prostate cancer-related deaths.</p><p><b>About Johnson &amp; Johnson</b></p><p>At Johnson &amp; Johnson, we believe health is everything.
