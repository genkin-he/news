The combination demonstrated a safety profile consistent with docetaxel alone, with no new or unexpected safety signals observed. The regimen also showed clinically meaningful efficacy, including high rates of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses and sustained PSA reductions, supporting continued development and advancement into Phase 3 studies. The results were presented for the first time at the 2026 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Genitourinary Cancers Symposium (Abstract #171).<sup>1</sup></p><div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1\"><p><a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2333578/Johnson_and_Johnson_Logo_v1.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"(PRNewsfoto/Johnson &amp; Johnson)\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2333578/Johnson_and_Johnson_Logo_v1.jpg\" title=\"(PRNewsfoto/Johnson &amp; Johnson)\"/></a></p></div><p>Pasritamig is designed to engage the immune system through a novel mechanism of action, binding CD3 on T cells and human kallikrein 2 (KLK2). KLK2 is a novel, highly specific prostate cancer target with minimal expression outside prostate tissue. By both activating and directing T cells to KLK2-expressing tumor cells, pasritamig enables targeted immune engagement. This differentiated, prostate-specific approach was intentionally built to focus immune activity on prostate cancer cells, which may help limit effects on healthy tissue, and supports administration in a doctor's office rather than hospital setting.</p><p>\"These data represent an important step forward for patients with advanced prostate cancer,\" said Professor Shahneen Sandhu,* M.D., Ph.D., MBBS, FRACP, Associate Professor, Consultant Medical Oncologist and researcher at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, and study investigator. \"In a disease where outcomes remain poor for many patients, seeing encouraging clinical activity alongside a favorable safety profile in combination with docetaxel reinforces the potential of this approach and supports further clinical development.\"</p><p>\"Based on these findings, we are increasingly confident in the potential of pasritamig to meaningfully improve outcomes for people with prostate cancer,\" said Charles Drake, M.D., Ph.D., Vice President, Prostate Cancer and Cross Cancer Immuno-Oncology, Johnson &amp; Johnson. \"The ability to combine pasritamig with docetaxel, where prior approaches in the field have fallen short, gives us a strong foundation for Phase 3 development. What we're seeing with this combination, including deep and durable PSA responses, underscores the promise of this combination immunotherapy approach and our commitment to advancing innovation that can make a difference for patients.\"</p><p><b>Detailed Study Results</b></p><p>In the study, pasritamig was evaluated in combination with docetaxel in an outpatient setting in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer whose disease had progressed following androgen receptor pathway inhibitor therapy. Approximately half of the patients (45 percent) had received at least one prior taxane-based regimen. The primary endpoint was safety and identification of the recommended regimen for further development in Phase 2/3 studies, with secondary and exploratory endpoints assessing clinical activity, including PSA response rates.<sup>1</sup></p><p>As of December 9, 2025, 51 patients had received pasritamig plus docetaxel, including patients who were pretreated with a median of three prior therapies (range, 1-9). Reductions of 50 percent or greater in PSA levels were achieved in 64.7 percent of patients overall and in 75.0 percent of taxane-naïve patients. Reductions of 90 percent or greater in PSA levels were achieved in 39.2 percent of patients overall and 53.6 percent of taxane-naïve patients. Among taxane-naïve patients with bone-only disease, confirmed PSA reductions of 50 percent or greater and 90 percent or greater were observed in 88.2 percent and 76.5 percent of patients, respectively. Patients were able to continue pasritamig beyond docetaxel discontinuation. Those patients received a median of six docetaxel doses every three weeks and eight pasritamig doses every six weeks, supporting the potential for sustained disease control over time.<sup>1</sup></p><p>The safety profile of pasritamig plus docetaxel was consistent with the known safety profile of docetaxel in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurring in at least 20 percent of patients included fatigue (60.8 percent), alopecia (41.2 percent), diarrhea and nausea (31.4 percent each), peripheral edema (27.5 percent), peripheral sensory neuropathy (25.5 percent) and dysgeusia (23.5 percent). Pasritamig-related adverse events occurring in at least 10 percent of patients were fatigue (33.3 percent) and non-chronic diarrhea (11.8 percent). Grade 3 or higher TRAEs attributed to docetaxel were observed in 29.4 percent of patients, compared with only two percent attributed to pasritamig. No patients experienced cytokine release syndrome of any grade or treatment-related deaths.<sup>1 </sup></p><p>Two ongoing Phase 3 studies are evaluating pasritamig in the metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer setting.

The primary objective is to determine the recommended regimen for further development based on safety, with secondary and exploratory endpoints assessing clinical activity. Pasritamig was administered intravenously every six weeks, with initial step-up doses given during the first treatment cycle, in combination with docetaxel administered intravenously every three weeks. Treatment was delivered in an outpatient setting. Corticosteroids were used only as standard premedication for docetaxel, and hematopoietic growth factor support was permitted as needed.<sup>4</sup></p><p><b>About Pasritamig (JNJ-78278343)</b></p><p>Pasritamig (JNJ-78278343) is an investigational T-cell-redirecting bispecific antibody (bsAb) targeting human kallikrein 2 (KLK2) on prostate cancer cells and CD3 receptor complexes on T cells, leveraging the body's immune system to selectively target and eliminate cancer cells. This innovative approach is being evaluated in pretreated patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), a patient population with limited treatment options.</p><p><b>About Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)</b></p><p>Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a challenging and aggressive stage of prostate cancer where the disease progresses despite androgen deprivation therapy.<sup>5</sup> Patients often experience metastasis to bones and lymph nodes, leading to poor outcomes and limited treatment options, including chemotherapy and second-line hormone therapies.<sup>6</sup> The median overall survival ranges from 13.5 to 31.6 months depending on the site of metastasis, with a typical range of 15 to 36 months across the broader population.<sup>7,8</sup> Survival rates can vary significantly depending on factors such as prior treatment history, disease burden, and response to therapy. The need for more effective treatments is critical, as the disease continues to impact a large number of men globally, with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) being responsible for a substantial number of prostate cancer-related deaths.</p><p><b>About Johnson &amp; Johnson</b></p><p>At Johnson &amp; Johnson, we believe health is everything.

Clinical efficacy across leading programs is converging in the 12–<percent>16%</percent> weight-loss range.</p> <p>In this increasingly competitive field, long-term differentiation depends not only on clinical performance but also on the strength and defensibility of each program’s patent portfolio.</p> <p>The report reviews more than 1,200 patent documents across 26 clinical-stage programs, mapping composition-of-matter claims, Markush scope, formulation layers, and method-of-use protection. The findings reveal dramatic disparities in patent depth between programs at similar development stages.</p> <p>More than <money>$47 billion</money> in GLP-1-related deal value has been committed since 2023, yet most oral programs remain unpartnered. With semaglutide’s patent cliff approaching in 2031 and tirzepatide’s in 2036, long-term exclusivity will determine which assets become franchises and which face early generic pressure.</p> <p>“When multiple drugs deliver similar weight-loss results, the competitive moat shifts beneath the surface,” said Javier Chamorro, Chief Operating Officer of PatentVest. “The difference between a broad genus claim and a narrow composition patent can determine who owns this market for the next twenty years.”</p> <p>This analysis maps 50 oral small-molecule GLP-1 programs worldwide, including 30 in clinical development, and evaluates the IP positioning of leading assets from Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Roche, AstraZeneca, Gilead, Structure Therapeutics, and others.</p> <p>This is the first in a series of deep-dive analyses evaluating the structural and patent defensibility of each major program.</p> <p>PatentVest, a division of MDB Capital Holdings (Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/MDBH/\" title=\"View MDBH stock overview\">MDBH</a>), is the first integrated IP intelligence, strategy, and law firm designed to help visionary companies become technology leaders.

(Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/NUAI/\" title=\"View NUAI stock overview\">NUAI</a>) (“New Era” or the “Company”), a developer and operator of next-generation digital infrastructure and integrated power assets in the Permian Basin, today announced it has entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent (\"LOI\") to acquire approximately 54 acres of strategically located land adjacent to its Texas Critical Data Centers (“TCDC”) campus in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.ector\">Ector County, Texas</location>.</p><div id=\"bwbodyimg\" style=\"width: 150px; float:left; padding-left:0px; padding-right:20px; padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;\"><img alt=\"Site Overview\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20260226055146/en/2732622/4/New_Era.jpg\"/><p style=\"font-size:85%;\">Site Overview</p></div><p>The contemplated acquisition was undertaken as part of ongoing lease negotiations with a leading hyperscale tenant and partners, where securing the additional acreage emerged as a key milestone in advancing discussions. This development is accompanied by continued site advancement, including initial land clearing, removal of out-of-service and abandoned pipeline infrastructure, relocation of active lines, and subsurface soil sampling to support civil engineering design. These activities are intended to optimize the developable footprint and maximize usable acreage for data center deployment.</p><p>By seeking to consolidate this corridor, New Era is looking to enhance its ability to structure direct power solutions and optimize interconnection design as it advances development of its now 438-acre, master-planned TCDC campus, which is designed to scale to more than 1 gigawatt over time.</p><p>The additional acreage would expand New Era’s capacity to:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Directly on next for major power offtake arrangements with nearby energy generation and transport infrastructure</li><li>Negotiate more efficient and flexible interconnection structures</li><li>Reduce exposure to broader grid congestion and transmission constraints; and</li><li>Enhance redundancy, reliability, and long-term expansion flexibility</li></ul><p>The Company expects control of the corridor between operating generation assets and its campus footprint may potentially increase New Era’s negotiating leverage with power producers while improving development sequencing. It also expands the Company’s options for transmission access and energy integration, which are critical for hyperscale and high-performance computing tenants requiring scalable, resilient power infrastructure.</p><p>E. Will Gray II, CEO of New Era Energy &amp; Digital commented: “By taking the first step to secure this additional 54 acres, we are seeking to strengthen our strategic land position between major power generation and transmission assets and take a pivotal step toward finalizing a definitive lease agreement with our end tenant. This transaction would further reinforce TCDC’s positioning as an integrated power and digital infrastructure platform designed for long-term expansion and operational reliability.”</p><p><b>About New Era Energy &amp; Digital, Inc.<br/></b>New Era Energy &amp; Digital, Inc.

These are meaningful shortfalls against the very peer group selected by the Board’s Compensation Committee. Yet management continues to receive peer-level compensation for disappointing results. This is not a portfolio problem, FR’s same-store NOI and FFO growth have been comparable to Prologis and EastGroup.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p align=\"justify\">BEIJING, Feb.  26, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global Mofy AI Limited (the “Company” or “Global Mofy”) (Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/GMM/\" title=\"View GMM stock overview\">GMM</a>), a generative AI-driven technology solutions provider engaged in virtual content production and the development of 3D digital assets, today announced that its visual effects brand, Mofy VFX, provided visual effects (“VFX”) production services for the 16-episode crime drama series <em>The Devil Between Us</em>.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The series, adapted from Lei Mi’s novel <em>Old Boy</em> and directed by Teng Huatao, is produced by iQIYI, with co-producers Yuewen Pictures, New Classics Media and Inverse Mapping. It premiered exclusively on iQIYI’s Mist Theatre on February 23, 2026.</p> <p align=\"justify\">According to iQIYI’s launch performance report, the series achieved an in-platform popularity score exceeding 7,705 on its launch day, with total pre-release reservations reaching approximately 1.59 million. The show ranked Top 1 across multiple iQIYI charts, including Overall Rising Chart, Overall Anticipation Chart, TV Series Rising Chart, TV Series Anticipation Chart, and TV Crime Genre Chart, while also placing Top 3 on both the Overall Trending Search Chart and TV Series Trending Search Chart. In addition, it entered iQIYI’s New Releases Top 5 and Hot Broadcast Top 5. These early performance indicators reflect strong initial audience engagement and highlight the continued market appeal of Mist Theatre’s premium crime content.</p> <p align=\"justify\">As iQIYI’s flagship suspense and crime content label, Mist Theatre is widely recognized for its emphasis on realism, genre execution, and high production standards. <em>The Devil Between Us</em> continues this creative direction by exploring moral dilemmas and social realities within close-knit communities. Through a restrained and grounded narrative lens, the series portrays the cascading impact of crime on ordinary families, interpersonal relationships, and small-town ecosystems—extending beyond conventional crime storytelling toward deeper reflections on human choice and social dynamics. This creative approach places elevated demands on atmospheric consistency, narrative pacing, and overall visual quality.</p> <p align=\"justify\">In alignment with the series’ thematic focus and Mist Theatre’s premium production standards, Mofy VFX supported key visual objectives, including atmospheric enhancement, environmental realism, and narrative rhythm reinforcement. Given the project’s multi-character structure, diverse locations, and interwoven storylines, the team emphasized visual consistency and viewing continuity across complex sequences. Rather than prioritizing speed alone, Mofy VFX focused on delivering stable, controllable, and reusable production capabilities through standardized workflows and mature collaboration processes—providing reliable quality output while maintaining delivery discipline for large-scale projects.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Mrs. Wenjun Jiang, CTO of Global Mofy, commented: “<em>The Devil Between Us</em> is a crime drama that balances genre intensity with grounded social expression, placing high demands on visual atmosphere, narrative pacing, and emotional delivery. Mist Theatre’s premium positioning also requires strong consistency in style, image quality, and delivery stability. The successful completion of this project represents a meaningful milestone for our team’s professional execution, collaborative efficiency, and quality control systems. Looking ahead, we will continue to leverage our experience in complex productions and our stable cross-functional workflows to support creative teams with disciplined production methodologies and rigorous quality standards—delivering visually compelling content while providing reliable, scalable VFX support for future premium projects.”</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>About Global Mofy AI Limited</strong><br/>Global Mofy AI Limited (Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/GMM/\" title=\"View GMM stock overview\">GMM</a>) is a generative AI-driven technology solutions provider engaged in virtual content production, and the development of digital assets for the digital content industry.
