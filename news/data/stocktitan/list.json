Fosun International received the \"Certificate of Excellence in Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting\", underscoring the company's outstanding performance in ESG strategy, environmental protection, social responsibility, corporate governance and information disclosure, and its continued recognition by industry authorities.</p><p>Since its inception in 1973, the HKMA Best Annual Reports Awards has become a highly regarded benchmark in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong's</location> information disclosure landscape. It aims to award and recognize organizations for their achievement in annual report preparation.</p><p>A total of nine enterprises received the \"Certificate of Excellence in Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting\". Other award-winning companies include CLP Holdings, CK Hutchison Holdings, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, MTR Corporation, Swire Properties, Chow Tai Fook Jewellery, S.F. Holding, Lenovo Group, and The Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, all of which are prominent blue-chip listed companies.</p><p>HKMA pointed out that the award-winning companies have significantly enhanced ESG governance by incorporating ESG into their long-term development strategies and key future initiatives. They also align with international climate-related information disclosure standards such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), while demonstrating management's active engagement and strong commitment to ecosystems and biodiversity.</p><p>In 2023, Fosun established the \"Create IMPACT\" sustainable development strategy, built on six key pillars: Innovation-driven, Mindful Operation, People and Partner Oriented, Advanced Governance, Climate and Planet Positive and Transparency, to systematically integrate ESG principles into its business strategy.</p><p>I: Innovation-driven</p><p>M: Mindful Operation</p><p>P: People and Partner Oriented</p><p>A: Advanced Governance</p><p>C: Climate and Planet Positive</p><p>T: Transparency</p><p>Since its establishment in 1992, Fosun has developed into a global innovation-driven consumer group with businesses in more than 40 countries and regions. With the original aspiration of \"Self-improvement, Teamwork, Performance, and Contribution to Society\", Fosun remains committed to developing business for good. While advancing robust business development, Fosun continuously optimizes its sustainable development strategy to address profound shifts in the global economy, society, and environment, ensuring long-term competitiveness alongside social value creation.</p><p><b>Actively responding to climate change and promoting low-carbon transformation</b></p><p>In response to climate change challenges, the Group has transitioned from passive adaptation to proactive participation and innovation. At top-level governance, under the coordination of the Board of Directors (the \"Board\") and the Carbon Neutrality Committee, Fosun has achieved several key milestones, such as incorporating carbon neutrality indicators into the performance appraisal of the management, establishing a carbon emission management system and audit standards, and conducting greenhouse gas inventory training across the Group. In terms of technology-driven low-carbon transformation, the Group has accelerated the adoption of low-carbon technologies, leveraging innovative approaches to drive green transformation across its industrial chain and continuously provide sustainable products and services to consumers. In terms of financial innovation, In September 2025, Fosun held the signing ceremony in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong</location> for its three-year sustainability-linked syndicated loan. The total syndicated amount was further increased to <money>USD990 million</money> equivalent, setting a new record for the largest offshore syndicated loan by a Chinese private enterprise in 2025. This achievement has effectively supported the implementation of the Group's sustainable development strategy.</p><p>Fosun actively responds to the national \"dual carbon\" goals by promoting carbon neutrality, energy conservation and emission reduction. In 2021, Fosun made a commitment to society – \"strive to peak carbon emissions by 2028 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050\". Fosun has formulated strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation in support of the <i>Paris Agreement's</i> global temperature control framework. As Hong Kong Stock Exchange's New Climate Requirements came into effect in 2025, Fosun International further aligned with the International Financial Reporting Standards S2 Climate-related Disclosures Requirements (IFRS S2) and TCFD recommendations, and released its third Climate Information Disclosures Report, continuously enhancing the transparency of its climate initiatives and demonstrating its steadfast long-term commitment.</p><p>The Group also actively encourages its member companies to carry out climate actions. In 2022, the Bund Finance Center (BFC), Fosun's base in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..shangh\">Shanghai</location>, was awarded the LEED Platinum certification, which is hailed as the \"Oscar Award\" in the green building industry, with a score of 97 points to set a new world record. In August 2024, BFC was successfully included in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..shangh\">Shanghai's</location> first batch of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality pilot demonstration projects, making it the only large-scale commercial complex exceeding 200,000 square meters on the list.</p><p>During the 29th session of the Conference of the Parties (<money>COP29</money>), Fosun Insurance Portugal (Fidelidade), a member company of Fosun, launched the Impact Center for Climate Change (ICCC), a platform for the study, research and sharing of knowledge with society, to drive innovation in climate risk knowledge and enhance the insurance industry's climate resilience. In February 2026, the ICCC held its annual Climate Research and Industry Exchange Conference, unveiling <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/pt\">Portugal's</location> first innovative study on forest fire risks to translate climate science into practical insurance risk management.</p><p><b>Actively driving global sustainable development and achieving outstanding ESG ratings</b></p><p>With a focus on core business development, Fosun leverages its comprehensive global industrial ecosystem to conduct responsible operations across more than 40 countries and regions, continuously contributing to public welfare and creating sustainable value worldwide. In addition, Fosun has long been committed to philanthropy in areas such as rural revitalization, healthcare, educational equity, community building, culture and art, steadily expanding its community impact and striving to build a more responsible, inclusive and sustainable future.</p><p>As a responsible global citizen, Fosun officially joined the United Nations Global Compact (\"UN Global Compact\") in 2014. It fully supports the ten principles of the UN Global Compact on human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption, and has deeply integrated these principles into the Group's sustainable development strategy and code of conduct. Despite persistent global macroeconomic uncertainties, Fosun remains steadfast in advancing its sustainable development, fulfilling its long-term commitments on key issues and earning continued international recognition.</p><p>Fosun International's ongoing efforts have earned growing recognition from international rating agencies for its ESG management. Fosun has been included in the FTSE4Good Index Series for five consecutive years and has maintained its HSI ESG rating at AA-. In 2025, Fosun's FTSE Russell ESG score rose to 4.2. It also ranked in the top <percent>5%</percent> among global peers in S&amp;P Global's Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA), was included in S&amp;P Global's Sustainability Yearbook 2025 (Global Edition), and was selected as the top <percent>1%</percent> in S&amp;P Global's Sustainability Yearbook (China Edition).</p><p>SOURCE Fosun</p></div></article>",

(NYSE: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/FOF/\" title=\"View FOF stock overview\">FOF</a>) (the \"Fund\") with information regarding the sources of the distribution to be paid on February 27, 2026 and cumulative distributions paid fiscal year-to-date.</p><p>In December 2021, the Fund implemented a managed distribution policy in accordance with exemptive relief issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The managed distribution policy seeks to deliver the Fund's long-term total return potential through regular monthly distributions declared at a fixed rate per common share. The policy gives the Fund greater flexibility to realize long-term capital gains throughout the year and to distribute those gains on a regular monthly basis to shareholders. The Board of Directors of the Fund may amend, terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares.</p><p>The Fund's monthly distributions may include long-term capital gains, short-term capital gains, net investment income and/or return of capital for federal income tax purposes. Return of capital includes distributions paid by the Fund in excess of its net investment income and net realized capital gains and such excess is distributed from the Fund's assets. A return of capital is not taxable; rather, it reduces a shareholder's tax basis in his or her shares of the Fund. The amount of monthly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors, including changes in portfolio and market conditions.</p><p>At the time of each monthly distribution, information will be posted to cohenandsteers.com and mailed to shareholders in a concurrent notice. However, this information may change at the end of the year because the final tax characteristics of the Fund's distributions cannot be determined with certainty until after the end of the calendar year. Final tax characteristics of all of the Fund's distributions will be provided on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year.</p><p>The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year-to-date from the sources indicated. All amounts are expressed per common share.</p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"prnbcc\"><tr><td class=\"prnpr2 prnpl2 prnvab prncbts prnrbrb1 prnbbbs prnbsbls\"

The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market.</p><p><b><i>Fund Performance and Distribution Rate Information: </i></b></p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"prnbcc\"><tr><td class=\"prnpr2 prnpl2 prnvab prncbts prnbrbrs prnbbbs prnbsbls\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Year-to-date January 1, 2026 to January 31, 2026</b></span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen9\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">Year-to-date Cumulative Total Return<sup>1                                        </sup></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen10\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">3.97 %</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen9\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">Cumulative Distribution Rate<sup>2</sup></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen10\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">1.28 %</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prnpr10 prnpl2 prnvab prnsbtb1 prnbrbrs prnbbbs prnbsbls\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\"><br/></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen5\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Five-year period ending January 31, 2026</b></span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen9\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">Average Annual Total Return<sup>3</sup></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen10\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">10.66 %</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen9\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">Current Annualized Distribution Rate<sup>4</sup></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen10\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">7.65 %</span></p></td></tr></table></div><p> </p><ol type=\"1\"><li>Year-to-date Cumulative Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund's NAV over the year-to-date time period including distributions paid and assuming reinvestment of those distributions.</li><li>Cumulative Distribution Rate for the Fund's current fiscal period (January 1, 2026 through February 28, 2026) measured on the dollar value of distributions in the year-to-date period as a percentage of the Fund's NAV as of January 31, 2026.</li><li>Average Annual Total Return represents the compound average of the Annual NAV Total Returns of the Fund for the five-year period ending January 31, 2026.

An archived version of both presentations will be available on our website following the presentation.</p><p><b>About Ivonescimab</b></p><p>Ivonescimab, known as SMT112 in Summit’s license territories, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LB/nam\">North America</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LB/sam\">South America</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/eur\">Europe</location>, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/mde\">Middle East</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/afr\">Africa</location>, and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/jp\">Japan</location>, and as AK112 outside of Summit’s license territories, is a novel, potential first-in-class investigational bispecific antibody combining the effects of immunotherapy via a blockade of PD-1 with the anti-angiogenesis effects associated with blocking VEGF into a single molecule. By design, ivonescimab displays unique cooperative binding to each of its intended targets with multifold higher affinity to PD-1 when in the presence of VEGF.</p><p>This is intended to differentiate ivonescimab as there is potentially higher expression (presence) of both PD-1 and VEGF in tumor tissue and the tumor microenvironment (TME) as compared to normal tissue in the body. We believe ivonescimab’s specifically engineered tetravalent structure (four binding sites) enables higher avidity (accumulated strength of multiple binding interactions) in the TME (Zhong, et al, <i>iScience</i>, 2025). This tetravalent structure, the intentional novel design of the molecule, and bringing these two targets into a single bispecific antibody with cooperative binding qualities have the potential to direct ivonescimab to the tumor tissue versus healthy tissue. The intent of this design, together with a half-life of 6 to 7 days after the first dose (Zhong, et al, <i>iScience</i>, 2025) increasing to approximately 10 days at steady state dosing, is to improve upon previously established efficacy thresholds, side effects, and safety profiles associated with prior approved drugs to these targets.</p><p>Ivonescimab was engineered by Akeso Inc. (HKEX Code: 9926.HK) and is currently utilized in multiple Phase III clinical trials. Over 4,000 patients have been treated with ivonescimab in clinical studies globally, and over 60,000 patients when considering those treated in a commercial setting in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>, as noted by Akeso.</p><p>There are currently 15 Phase III clinical studies that are either announced, ongoing, or have been completed studying ivonescimab, four of which are Summit-sponsored global studies, one of which is a multiregional study sponsored by a cooperative group, and ten of which are being or have been conducted in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> by Akeso. Summit began its clinical development of ivonescimab in NSCLC, commencing enrollment in 2023 in two multiregional Phase III clinical trials, HARMONi and HARMONi-3. In 2025, the Company began enrolling patients in HARMONi-7. Summit expanded its Phase III clinical development program into CRC in the fourth quarter of 2025 by initiating enrollment in HARMONi-GI3.</p><p>HARMONi is a Phase III clinical trial which intends to evaluate ivonescimab combined with chemotherapy compared to placebo plus chemotherapy in patients with EGFR-mutated, locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who were previously treated with a 3rd generation EGFR TKI (e.g., osimertinib). Detailed results of the study were provided in September 2025, and a Biologics License Application (BLA) was submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing authorization, which the FDA accepted for filing in January 2026; the goal Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date is November 14, 2026.</p><p>HARMONi-3 is a Phase III clinical trial, which is intended to evaluate ivonescimab combined with chemotherapy compared to pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy in patients with first-line metastatic, squamous or non-squamous NSCLC, irrespective of PD-L1 expression.</p><p>HARMONi-7 is a Phase III clinical trial which is intended to evaluate ivonescimab monotherapy compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with first-line metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression.</p><p>HARMONi-GI3 is a Phase III clinical trial evaluating ivonescimab in combination with chemotherapy compared with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in patients with first-line unresectable metastatic CRC.</p><p>Also including Summit’s license territories, a Phase III study is planned to be conducted by GORTEC, a cooperative group dedicated to Head and Neck Oncology, in recurrent / metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (r/m HNSCC). ILLUMINE is a three-arm Phase III clinical trial which is intended to evaluate ivonescimab monotherapy, as well as ivonescimab in combination with ligufalimab, Akeso’s proprietary anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody, compared to monotherapy pembrolizumab in patients with PD-L1 positive r/m HNSCC.</p><p>In addition, Akeso has recently had positive read-outs in three single-region (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>), randomized Phase III clinical trials, HARMONi-A, HARMONi-2, and HARMONi-6, for ivonescimab in NSCLC, including a statistically significant overall survival benefit in HARMONi-A with a manageable safety profile in each study.</p><p>HARMONi-A was a Phase III clinical trial which evaluated ivonescimab combined with chemotherapy compared to placebo plus chemotherapy in patients with EGFR-mutated, locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who have progressed after treatment with an EGFR TKI.</p><p>HARMONi-2 is a Phase III clinical trial evaluating monotherapy ivonescimab against monotherapy pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have positive PD-L1 expression.</p><p>HARMONi-6 is a Phase III clinical trial evaluating ivonescimab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy compared with tislelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC, irrespective of PD-L1 expression.</p><p>Akeso is actively conducting multiple Phase III clinical studies in settings outside of NSCLC, including biliary-tract cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer.</p><p>Ivonescimab is an investigational therapy that is not approved by any regulatory authority in Summit’s license territories, including <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/eur\">Europe</location>. Ivonescimab was initially approved for marketing authorization in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> in May 2024. Ivonescimab was granted Fast Track designation by the US FDA for the HARMONi clinical trial setting.</p><p><b>About Summit Therapeutics</b></p><p>Summit Therapeutics Inc. is a biopharmaceutical oncology company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of patient-, physician-, caregiver- and societal-friendly medicinal therapies intended to improve quality of life, increase potential duration of life, and resolve serious unmet medical needs.</p><p>Summit was founded in 2003 and our shares are listed on the Nasdaq Global Market (symbol \"<a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/SMMT/\" title=\"View SMMT stock overview\">SMMT</a>\").

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><div class=\"xn-content\"><p><span class=\"legendSpanClass\"><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">NEW YORK</location></span>, <span class=\"legendSpanClass\">Feb. 26, 2026</span> /PRNewswire/ --This press release provides shareholders of Cohen &amp; Steers Quality Income Realty Fund, Inc. (NYSE: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/RQI/\" title=\"View RQI stock overview\">RQI</a>) (the \"Fund\") with information regarding the sources of the distribution to be paid on February 27, 2026 and cumulative distributions paid fiscal year-to-date.</p><p>In December 2012, the Fund implemented a managed distribution policy in accordance with exemptive relief issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The managed distribution policy seeks to deliver the Fund's long-term total return potential through regular monthly distributions declared at a fixed rate per common share. The policy gives the Fund greater flexibility to realize long-term capital gains throughout the year and to distribute those gains on a regular monthly basis to shareholders. The Board of Directors of the Fund may amend, terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares. </p><p>The Fund's monthly distributions may include long-term capital gains, short-term capital gains, net investment income and/or return of capital for federal income tax purposes. Return of capital includes distributions paid by the Fund in excess of its net investment income and net realized capital gains and such excess is distributed from the Fund's assets. A return of capital is not taxable; rather, it reduces a shareholder's tax basis in his or her shares of the Fund. In addition, distributions from the Fund's investments in real estate investment trusts (REITs) may later be characterized as capital gains and/or a return of capital, depending on the character of the dividends reported to the Fund after year end by REITs held by the Fund. The amount of monthly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors, including changes in portfolio and market conditions.</p><p>At the time of each monthly distribution, information will be posted to cohenandsteers.com and mailed to shareholders in a concurrent notice. However, this information may change at the end of the year because the final tax characteristics of the Fund's distributions cannot be determined with certainty until after the end of the calendar year. Final tax characteristics of all of the Fund's distributions will be provided on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year.</p><p>The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year-to-date from the sources indicated. All amounts are expressed per common share.</p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"prnbcc\"><tr><td class=\"prnpr2 prnpl2 prnvab prncbts prnrbrb1 prnbbbs prnbsbls\"

(NYSE: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/RFI/\" title=\"View RFI stock overview\">RFI</a>) (the \"Fund\") with information regarding the sources of the distribution to be paid on February 27, 2026 and cumulative distributions paid fiscal year-to-date.</p><p>In December 2011, the Fund implemented a managed distribution policy in accordance with exemptive relief issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The managed distribution policy seeks to deliver the Fund's long-term total return potential through regular monthly distributions declared at a fixed rate per common share. The policy gives the Fund greater flexibility to realize long-term capital gains throughout the year and to distribute those gains on a regular monthly basis to shareholders. The Board of Directors of the Fund may amend, terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares. </p><p>The Fund's monthly distributions may include long-term capital gains, short-term capital gains, net investment income and/or return of capital for federal income tax purposes. Return of capital includes distributions paid by the Fund in excess of its net investment income and net realized capital gains and such excess is distributed from the Fund's assets. A return of capital is not taxable; rather, it reduces a shareholder's tax basis in his or her shares of the Fund. In addition, distributions from the Fund's investments in real estate investment trusts (REITs) may later be characterized as capital gains and/or a return of capital, depending on the character of the dividends reported to the Fund after year-end by REITs held by the Fund. The amount of monthly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors, including changes in portfolio and market conditions.</p><p>At the time of each monthly distribution, information will be posted to cohenandsteers.com and mailed to shareholders in a concurrent notice. However, this information may change at the end of the year because the final tax characteristics of the Fund's distributions cannot be determined with certainty until after the end of the calendar year. Final tax characteristics of all of the Fund's distributions will be provided on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year.</p><p>The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year-to-date from the sources indicated. All amounts are expressed per common share.</p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"prnbcc\"><tr><td class=\"prnpr2 prnpl2 prnvab prntal prncbts prnrbrb1 prnbbbs

With these new data, existing Orphan Drug designation for treating this group of patients, and FDA’s stated preference for randomized controlled trials, Mesoblast is moving from filing for accelerated approval to filing for full FDA approval next quarter. A confirmatory study would no longer be needed, if approved.</li><li style=\"margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify;\"><strong>Commercial manufacturing:</strong> scale-up work for rexlemestrocel-L is well progressed to support BLA filings for both CLBP and, in the first instance, for end-stage HFrEF patients with LVADs.</li></ul> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>FY2026 Net Revenue Guidance </strong><br/>Mesoblast anticipates full-year fiscal 2026 Ryoncil<sup>®</sup> net revenue to range between US<money>$110 million</money> and US<money>$120 million</money>.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Commentary</strong><br/>Mesoblast Chief Executive Dr. Silviu Itescu, commented on the result: “Today we report strong operational and financial performance for the first half of FY2026, a period that marks an important inflection point in Mesoblast’s evolution from clinical development to sustainable commercial execution.

We are pleased to announce a dividend of US<money>$0.66</money> per share — well above our Dividend Policy minimum. This brings our trailing 12-month dividend and buyback yield to <percent>6.2%</percent>, positioning Aura once again among the world’s leading gold miners for total shareholder returns. During the quarter and in recent months we achieved several key milestones: (i) Declared commercial production at Borborema; (ii) Completed the MSG acquisition; (iii) Secured the early-works license for Era Dorada; (iv) Advanced the Matupá project and (v) Signed the road-relocation agreement at Borborema. These accomplishments are concrete proof that we are executing our strategy: develop high-return greenfield projects to grow production above 600 koz GEO per year, expand resources and reserves, pursue disciplined M&amp;A, and deliver meaningful dividends to shareholders.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><div class=\"xn-content\"><p><span class=\"legendSpanClass\"><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">NEW YORK</location></span>, <span class=\"legendSpanClass\">Feb. 26, 2026</span> /PRNewswire/ -- This press release provides shareholders of Cohen &amp; Steers REIT and Preferred and Income Fund, Inc. (NYSE: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/RNP/\" title=\"View RNP stock overview\">RNP</a>) (the \"Fund\") with information regarding the sources of the distribution to be paid on February 27, 2026 and cumulative distributions paid fiscal year-to-date.</p><p>In December 2017, the Fund implemented a managed distribution policy in accordance with exemptive relief issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The managed distribution policy seeks to deliver the Fund's long-term total return potential through regular monthly distributions declared at a fixed rate per common share. The policy gives the Fund greater flexibility to realize long-term capital gains throughout the year and to distribute those gains on a regular monthly basis to shareholders. The Board of Directors of the Fund may amend, terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares.</p><p>The Fund's monthly distributions may include long-term capital gains, short-term capital gains, net investment income and/or return of capital for federal income tax purposes. Return of capital includes distributions paid by the Fund in excess of its net investment income and net realized capital gains and such excess is distributed from the Fund's assets. A return of capital is not taxable; rather, it reduces a shareholder's tax basis in his or her shares of the Fund. In addition, distributions from the Fund's investments in real estate investment trusts (REITs) may later be characterized as capital gains and/or a return of capital, depending on the character of the dividends reported to the Fund after year-end by REITs held by the Fund. The amount of monthly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors, including changes in portfolio and market conditions.</p><p>At the time of each monthly distribution, information will be posted to cohenandsteers.com and mailed to shareholders in a concurrent notice. However, this information may change at the end of the year because the final tax characteristics of the Fund's distributions cannot be determined with certainty until after the end of the calendar year. Final tax characteristics of all of the Fund's distributions will be provided on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year.</p><p>The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year-to-date from the sources indicated. All amounts are expressed per common share.</p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"prnbcc\"><tr><td class=\"prnpr2 prnpl2 prnvab prncbts prnrbrb1 prnbbbs prnbsbls\"

(NYSE: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/UTF/\" title=\"View UTF stock overview\">UTF</a>) (the \"Fund\") with information regarding the sources of the distribution to be paid on February 27, 2026 and cumulative distributions paid fiscal year-to-date.</p><p>In March 2015, the Fund implemented a managed distribution policy in accordance with exemptive relief issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The managed distribution policy seeks to deliver the Fund's long-term total return potential through regular monthly distributions declared at a fixed rate per common share. This policy gives the Fund greater flexibility to realize long-term capital gains throughout the year and to distribute those gains on a regular monthly basis to shareholders. The Board of Directors of the Fund may amend, terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares.</p><p>The Fund's monthly distributions may include long-term capital gains, short-term capital gains, net investment income and/or return of capital for federal income tax purposes. Return of capital includes distributions paid by the Fund in excess of its net investment income and net realized capital gains and such excess is distributed from the Fund's assets. A return of capital is not taxable; rather, it reduces a shareholder's tax basis in his or her shares of the Fund. In addition, distributions from the Fund's investments in MLPs are attributed to various sources, including net investment income and return of capital. The amount of monthly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors, including changes in portfolio and market conditions.</p><p>At the time of each monthly distribution, information will be posted to cohenandsteers.com and mailed to shareholders in a concurrent notice. However, this information may change at the end of the year because the final tax characteristics of the Fund's distributions cannot be determined with certainty until after the end of the calendar year. Final tax characteristics of all of the Fund's distributions will be provided on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year.</p><p>The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year-to-date from the sources indicated. All amounts are expressed per common share.</p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"prnbcc\"><tr><td class=\"prnpr2 prnpl2 prnvab prncbts prnrbrb1 prnbbbs prnbsbls\"

The amounts and sources of distributions year-to-date may be subject to additional adjustments.</b></p><p><b>*THE FUND WILL SEND YOU A FORM 1099-DIV FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR THAT WILL TELL YOU HOW TO REPORT THESE DISTRIBUTIONS FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES.</b></p><p>The Fund's Year-to-date Cumulative Total Return for fiscal year 2026 (January 1, 2026 through January 31, 2026) is set forth below. Shareholders should take note of the relationship between the Year-to-date Cumulative Total Return with the Fund's Cumulative Distribution Rate for 2026. In addition, the Fund's Average Annual Total Return for the five-year period ending January 31, 2026 is set forth below. Shareholders should note the relationship between the Average Annual Total Return with the Fund's Current Annualized Distribution Rate for 2026. The performance and distribution rate information disclosed in the table is based on the Fund's net asset value per share (NAV). The Fund's NAV is calculated as the total market value of all the securities and other assets held by the Fund minus the total liabilities, divided by the total number of shares outstanding. While NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund's investment performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder's individual investment in the Fund. The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market.</p><p><b><i>Fund Performance and Distribution Rate Information: </i></b></p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"prnbcc\"><tr><td class=\"prnpr2 prnpl2 prnvab prncbts prnbrbrs prnbbbs prnbsbls\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Year-to-date January 1, 2026 to January 31, 2026</b></span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen9\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">Year-to-date Cumulative Total Return<sup>1      </sup></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen10\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">6.14 %</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen9\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">Cumulative Distribution Rate<sup>2     </sup></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen10\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">1.15 %</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prnpr10 prnpl2 prnvab prnsbtb1 prnbrbrs prnbbbs prnbsbls\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\"><br/></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen5\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Five-year period ending January 31, 2026            </b></span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen9\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">Average Annual Total Return<sup>3</sup></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen10\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">10.26 %</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen9\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">Current Annualized Distribution Rate<sup>4     </sup>                              </span></p></td><td class=\"prngen10\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">6.89 %</span></p></td></tr></table></div><ol type=\"1\"><li>Year-to-date Cumulative Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund's NAV over the year-to-date time period including distributions paid and assuming reinvestment of those distributions.</li><li>Cumulative Distribution Rate for the Fund's current fiscal period (January 1, 2026 through February 28, 2026) measured on the dollar value of distributions in the year-to-date period as a percentage of the Fund's NAV as of January 31, 2026.</li><li>Average Annual Total Return represents the compound average of the Annual NAV Total Returns of the Fund for the five-year period ending January 31, 2026.
