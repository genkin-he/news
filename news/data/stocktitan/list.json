The equity security investment that accounts for the net loss is identified as Investment A in Note 4 of the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Investment Concentration.</p><p>For the six months ended November 30, 2025, <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/FRMO/\" title=\"View FRMO stock overview\">FRMO</a>'s net loss attributable to the Company was <money>$26.4 million</money> (<money>$0.60</money> per diluted share), compared to net income of <money>$145.0 million</money> (<money>$3.29</money> per diluted share) a year earlier.</p><p>Net loss attributable to the Company excluding the effect of unrealized gain or loss from equity securities and digital assets net of taxes for the three months ended November 30, 2025 was <money>$7.3 million</money> (<money>$0.17</money> per diluted share) compared to net income of <money>$46.1 million</money> (<money>$1.05</money> per diluted share) for the three months ended November 30, 2024 (as restated).

The market value of several securities and digital assets might have changed substantially since that date.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><div class=\"xn-content\"><p><span class=\"legendSpanClass\"><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.hayard\">HAYWARD, Calif.</location></span>, <span class=\"legendSpanClass\">Feb. 26, 2026</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/UCTT/\" title=\"View UCTT stock overview\">UCTT</a>) today announced the pricing of its offering of <money><money>$525.0 million</money></money> aggregate principal amount of <percent>0.00%</percent> convertible senior notes due 2031 (the \"notes\") in a private offering to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). The offering size was increased from the previously announced offering size of <money><money>$400.0 million</money></money> aggregate principal amount of notes. The issuance and sale of the notes are scheduled to settle on March 3, 2026, subject to customary closing conditions. Ultra Clean also granted the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a period of 13 days from, and including, the date the notes are first issued, up to an additional <money><money>$75.0 million</money></money> principal amount of notes.</p><div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1\"><p><a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/582701/Ultra_Clean_Holdings_Logo.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"(PRNewsfoto/Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc.)\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/582701/Ultra_Clean_Holdings_Logo.jpg\" title=\"(PRNewsfoto/Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc.)\"/></a></p></div><p>Ultra Clean estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately <money><money>$511.1 million</money></money> (or approximately <money><money>$584.2 million</money></money> if the initial purchasers fully exercise their option to purchase additional notes), after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. Ultra Clean intends to use the net proceeds from the offering as follows:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>approximately <money><money>$21.9 million</money></money> of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the cost of entering into the capped call transactions described below;</li><li>approximately <money><money>$40.0 million</money></money> of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase 672,608 shares of its common stock; and</li><li>the remainder for working capital, prepayment of a portion of the company's outstanding term loan under its amended and restated credit agreement or other general corporate purposes.</li></ul><p>If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, then Ultra Clean intends to use a portion of the additional net proceeds to fund the cost of entering into additional capped call transactions, as described below, and the remainder for the purposes described above.</p><p>The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Ultra Clean. The notes will not bear regular interest and the principal amount of the notes will not accrete. The notes will mature on March 15, 2031, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Before December 16, 2030, noteholders will have the right to convert their notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after December 16, 2030, noteholders may convert their notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. Ultra Clean will settle conversions in cash and, if applicable, shares of its common stock. The initial conversion rate is 11.8001 shares of common stock per <money><money>$1,000</money></money> principal amount of notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately <money><money>$84.75</money></money> per share of common stock. The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately <percent>42.5%</percent> over the last reported sale price of <money><money>$59.47</money></money> per share of Ultra Clean's common stock on February 26, 2026. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. If a \"make-whole fundamental change\" (as defined in the indenture for the notes) occurs, then Ultra Clean will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a specified period of time for holders who convert their notes in connection with that make-whole fundamental change.</p><p>The notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations), for cash at Ultra Clean's option at any time, and from time to time, on or after March 20, 2029 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of Ultra Clean's common stock exceeds <percent>130%</percent> of the conversion price for a specified period of time and certain other conditions are satisfied. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest and additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. If Ultra Clean calls any or all notes for redemption, then holders of notes called for redemption may convert their notes during the related redemption conversion period, and such conversions will also constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to the notes so converted.</p><p>If a \"fundamental change\" (as defined in the indenture for the notes) occurs, then, subject to a limited exception, noteholders may require Ultra Clean to repurchase their notes for cash. The repurchase price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest and additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date.</p><p>In connection with the pricing of the notes, Ultra Clean entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates and certain other financial institutions (the \"option counterparties\"). The capped call transactions will cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the notes, the number of shares of Ultra Clean's common stock initially underlying the notes. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Ultra Clean expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties.</p><p>The cap price of the capped call transactions will initially be <money><money>$104.07</money>25</money> per share, which represents a premium of <percent>75.0%</percent> over the last reported sale price of Ultra Clean's common stock of <money><money>$59.47</money></money> per share on February 26, 2026, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions.</p><p>The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to Ultra Clean's common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or offset any potential cash payments Ultra Clean is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, upon conversion of the notes. If, however, the market price per share of Ultra Clean's common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions.</p><p>Ultra Clean has been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Ultra Clean's common stock and/or purchase shares of Ultra Clean's common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Ultra Clean's common stock or the notes at that time.</p><p>In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Ultra Clean's common stock and/or purchasing or selling Ultra Clean's common stock or other securities of Ultra Clean in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and (x) are likely to do so during the relevant valuation period under the capped call transactions and (y) are likely to do so following any early conversion or repurchase of the notes by Ultra Clean, if Ultra Clean elects to unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions in connection with such early conversion or repurchase). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Ultra Clean's common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the number of shares of common stock and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes.</p><p>Concurrently with the pricing of the notes, Ultra Clean entered into privately negotiated transactions with or through one of the initial purchasers of the notes in this offering to use approximately <money><money>$40.0 million</money></money> of the net proceeds from the notes offering to repurchase shares of Ultra Clean's common stock at a purchase price of <money><money>$59.47</money></money> per share. These share repurchases could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Ultra Clean's common stock or the notes, and could result in a higher effective conversion price for the notes. The offering of the notes is not contingent upon the repurchase of any common stock.</p><p>The offer and sale of the notes and any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, and the notes and any such shares cannot be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, the notes or any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, nor will there be any sale of the notes or any such shares, in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, sale or solicitation would be unlawful.</p><p><b>Forward-Looking Statements</b></p><p>This press release includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the completion of the offering and the share repurchases, the expected amount and intended use of the net proceeds and the effects of entering into the capped call transactions described above. Forward-looking statements represent Ultra Clean's current expectations regarding future events and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied by the forward-looking statements. Among those risks and uncertainties are market conditions, the satisfaction of the closing conditions related to the offering and risks relating to Ultra Clean's business, including those described in periodic reports that Ultra Clean files from time to time with the SEC. Ultra Clean may not consummate the offering described in this press release and, if the offering is consummated, cannot provide any assurances regarding its ability to effectively apply the net proceeds as described above. The forward-looking statements included in this press release speak only as of the date of this press release, and Ultra Clean does not undertake to update the statements included in this press release for subsequent developments, except as may be required by law.</p><p><b>Contact</b></p><p>Rhonda Bennetto<br/>SVP Investor Relations<br/><a href=\"mailto:rbennetto@uct.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">rbennetto@uct.com</a></p><p>SOURCE Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc.</p></div></article>",

The ITC issued a Limited Exclusion Order to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Customs and Border Protection to prevent further importation of Insta360's infringing products, as well as a Cease and Desist Order to Insta360 prohibiting further importation, sale, and marketing of Insta360's infringing products.

The PTAB rejected three separate Insta360 challenges to patents covering GoPro's ground-breaking HyperSmooth technology.<br/><br/>GoPro's intellectual property enforcement campaign, including recent positive rulings from the PTAB reaffirming the validity of GoPro's patents, reinforces the strength of GoPro's intellectual property portfolio and highlights GoPro's long-standing record of category-defining innovation, supported by more than 1,500 <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> patents.<br/><br/>\"Innovation is at the heart of everything we do at GoPro.

He was appointed Vice Chairman in 2022 and acted as UBS’s representative within Switzerland’s leading trade associations and financial industry bodies. Furthermore, as the final Chairman of Credit Suisse AG, he played an instrumental role in overseeing the seamless integration of Credit Suisse into UBS.</p><p>William C. Dudley and Jeanette Wong have also decided to step down after seven years on the Board. During this time, Mr. Dudley served on the Corporate Culture and Responsibility Committee, the Risk Committee and the Governance and Nominating Committee. Ms. Wong was a member of the Audit Committee, the Corporate Culture and Responsibility Committee and the Compensation Committee.</p><p>Chairman Colm Kelleher and the members of the Board extend their gratitude to Lukas Gähwiler, William C.

The decrease has been driven by unfavourable foreign exchange movements, the product development impairment, investment  and inflation, partially offset by operating leverage on sales growth and cost savings, as well as a reduction in one-off pension charges and property related impairment reversals.</p><p><b>Net finance costs</b></p><p>Net finance costs increased on a headline basis from a net cost of <money>£31m</money> in 2024 to a net cost of <money>£50m</money> in 2025. The increase is primarily due to  increased net borrowing costs given increased average net debt following last year's share buy back and movements on derivatives.</p><p>Adjusted net finance costs reflected in adjusted earnings in 2025 was <money>£57m</money>, compared to a net cost of <money>£45m</money> in 2024.

This equates to an effective tax rate of <percent>26.5%</percent> (2024: <percent>14.7%</percent>), with the increase from prior year principally due to the release of the State Aid uncertain tax provision in the prior year.</p><p>The total adjusted tax charge in 2025 was <money>£136m</money> (2024: <money>£136m</money>), corresponding to an effective tax rate on adjusted profit before tax of <percent>24.5%</percent> (2024: <percent>24.4%</percent>). For a reconciliation of the adjusted measure see note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.</p><p>In 2025, there was a net tax payment of <money>£2m</money> (2024: <money>£119m</money> net tax payment). This includes a <money>£97m</money> receipt from HMRC in respect of the State Aid matter, with an additional <money>£17m</money> of associated interest also received in the period. The interest element is classified within interest received in the cash flow statement. This repayment is a result of the Court of Justice of the European Union handing down its decision on 19 September 2024 determining that the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">United Kingdom</location> controlled foreign company group financing partial exemption did not constitute State Aid, thereby resulting in a refund of the <money>£97m</money> of tax paid (plus <money>£17m</money> of interest) under the Charging Notices issued by HMRC in 2021. The balance excluding the State Aid repayment, principally relates to tax payments in the US and the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location>, and decreased due to lower tax liabilities and installment payments for 2025.</p><p>A net deferred tax liability of <money>£31m</money> is recognised in 2025 compared to a net deferred tax liability of <money>£11m</money> in 2024. The overall amount increased mainly due to the ongoing utilisation of tax losses and other tax attributes. The current tax creditor principally consists of provisions for tax uncertainties.</p><p><b>Other comprehensive income</b></p><p>Included in other comprehensive income are the net exchange differences on translation of foreign operations. The loss on translation of <money>£193m</money> in 2025 compares to a loss in 2024 of <money>£35m</money>. The loss in 2025 arises from an overall weakening of the majority of currencies to which the Group is exposed, in particular the US dollar. A significant proportion of the Group's operations are based in the US and the US dollar closing rate at 31 December 2025 was <money>£1</money>:<money><money>$1.35</money></money> compared to the opening rate of <money>£1</money>:<money><money>$1.25</money></money>. At the end of 2024, the US dollar rate was <money>£1</money>:<money><money>$1.25</money></money> compared to the opening rate of <money>£1</money>:<money><money>$1.27</money></money>.</p><p>Also included in other comprehensive income at 31 December 2025 is an actuarial gain of <money>£10m</money> in relation to retirement benefit obligations. The gain arises largely from a decrease in liabilities driven by lower long-term inflation assumptions and updates to commutation factors. The gain in 2025 compares to an actuarial gain in 2024 of <money>£5m</money>.</p><p>Fair value losses of <money>£7m</money> (2024: losses of <money>£2m</money>) have been recognised in other comprehensive income and relate to movements in the value of investments in unlisted securities held at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).</p><p><b>Cash flow and working capital </b></p><p>Our operating cash flow measure is used to align cash flows with our adjusted profit measures (see note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements). Operating cash flow decreased on a headline basis by <money>£91m</money> from an inflow of <money>£662m</money> in 2024 to an inflow of <money>£571m</money> in 2025 due to an increase in working capital given high Q4 sales growth.</p><p>The equivalent statutory measure, net cash generated from operations, was an inflow of <money>£731m</money> in 2025 compared to an inflow of <money>£811m</money> in 2024. Compared to operating cash flow, this measure includes reorganisation costs but does not include regular dividends from associates. It also excludes capital expenditure on property, plant, equipment and software, and additions to right of use assets as well as disposal proceeds from the sale of property, plant, equipment and right of use assets (including the impacts of transfers to/from investment in finance lease receivable). In 2025, reorganisation cash outflow was £nil compared to <money>£8m</money> in 2024.</p><p>Free cash flow increased on a headline basis by <money>£37m</money> from <money>£490m</money> in 2024 to <money>£527m</money> in 2025. When compared to operating cash flow, free cash flow includes tax paid/received, net finance costs paid and net costs paid for major reorganisation. The increase year on year is mainly due to the receipt of monies in respect of the State Aid tax matter offset by the reduction in operating cash flow.</p><p>In 2025, there was an overall decrease of <money>£210m</money> in cash and cash equivalents from <money>£543m</money> at the end of 2024 to <money>£333m</money> at 31 December 2025. The decrease in 2025 is primarily due to the net cash generated from operations of <money>£731m</money> being more than offset by dividends paid of <money>£160m</money>, share buyback programme payments of <money>£352m</money>, own share purchases of <money>£72m</money>, capital expenditure on property, plant, equipment and software of <money>£134m</money>, payments for the acquisition of subsidiaries of <money>£167m</money>, and payments of lease liabilities of <money>£77m</money>.</p><p><b>Liquidity and capital resources</b></p><p>The Group's net debt increased from <money>£853m</money> at the end of 2024 to <money>£1,069m</money> at the end of 2025. The increase is largely due to free cash flow of <money>£527m</money> being more than offset by the share buyback programme, dividend payments and cash outflows related to acquisitions. In May 2025, the Group repaid its <money>€300m</money> bond and closed out various related derivatives. In June 2025, the Group secured a new three-year, <money><money>$800 million</money></money> revolving credit facility (RCF). This facility can be utilised for general corporate purposes, enhancing our liquidity, and is in addition to the Group's existing RCF. At 31 December 2025, the Group had drawn <money>£0.3b</money>n on its Revolving Credit Facilities.</p><p>At 31 December 2025, the Group had approximately <money>£1.3b</money>n in total liquidity immediately available from cash and its RCFs maturing June 2028 and February 2029. In assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern for the period until 30 June 2027, the Board analysed a variety of downside scenarios, including a severe but plausible scenario, where the Group is impacted by a combination of all principal risks from H1 2026, as well as reverse stress testing to identify what would be required to either breach covenants or run out of liquidity. The severe but plausible scenario modelled a severe reduction in revenue, profit and operating cash flow from risks continuing throughout 2026 and 2027. In all scenarios, the Group would maintain comfortable liquidity headroom and sufficient headroom against covenant requirements during the period under assessment even before modelling the mitigating effect of actions that management would take in the event that these downside risks were to crystallise. The directors concluded that the likelihood of the reverse stress test scenario was remote.</p><p><b>Post-retirement benefits</b></p><p>Pearson operates a variety of pension and post-retirement plans.

In 2024, a charge of <money>£13m</money> related to one-off discretionary pension increases was excluded from adjusted operating profit, with no such amounts in 2025.</p><p>The overall surplus on <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location> Group pension plans of <money>£484m</money> at the end of 2024 has increased to a surplus of <money>£514m</money> at the end of 2025. The increase has arisen principally due to asset returns being higher than expected  and inflation over the period being slightly lower than was expected at the beginning of the year. In total, our worldwide net position in respect of pensions and other post-retirement benefits increased from a net asset of <money>£450m</money> at the end of 2024 to a net asset of <money>£482m</money> at the end of 2025.</p><p><b>Businesses acquired and disposed</b></p><p>On 24 July 2025, the Group completed the acquisition of <percent>100%</percent> of eDynamic Holdings LP ('eDynamic Learning'), a leading Career and Technical Education (CTE) curriculum solutions provider for cash consideration of <money>£168m</money>.

There are no changes to accounting standards that have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2025. The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) at fair value.</p><p>In assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern for the period to 30 June 2027, the Board analysed a variety of downside scenarios, including a severe but plausible scenario, where the Group is impacted by a combination of all principal risks from by all principal risks in both 2026 and 2027, adjusted for probability weighting, as well as reverse stress testing to identify what would be required to either breach covenants or run out of liquidity. The net impact of the risks modelled in the severe but plausible scenario was to reduce free cashflow during the period under assessment by c41%.  </p><p>At 31 December 2025, the Group had available liquidity of c<money>£1.3b</money>n, comprising central cash balances and the undrawn element of its <money><money>$1.8b</money>n</money> Revolving Credit Facilities maturing June 2028 and February 2029, but which have options to extend the maturities until 2030. Even under a severe downside case, the Group would maintain comfortable liquidity headroom and sufficient headroom against covenant requirements during the period under assessment. That is, even before modelling the mitigating effect of actions that management would take in the event that these downside risks were to crystallise. The directors concluded that the likelihood of the reverse stress test scenario was remote.</p><p>The directors have confirmed that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence and to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the assessment period to 30 June 2027. The condensed consolidated financial statements have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis.</p><p>The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting assumptions. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas requiring a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the condensed consolidated financial statements, have been set out in the 2024 Annual Report. In 2025, the valuation of acquired intangible assets recognised on the acquisition of a business is also determined to be a key area of estimation.</p><p>The Group has also assessed the impact of the uncertainty presented by the volatile macro-economic and geo-political environment on the condensed consolidated financial statements, specifically considering the impact on key judgements and significant estimates along with other areas of increased risk including financial instruments, hedge accounting and translation methodologies. No material accounting impacts relating to the areas assessed were recognised in 2025. The Group has assessed the impacts of climate change on the condensed consolidated financial statements. The assessment did not identify any material impact on the Group's significant judgements or estimates, the recoverability of the Group's assets at 31 December 2025 or the assessment of going concern for the period to 30 June 2027. The Group will continue to monitor these areas of increased judgement, estimation and risk for material changes.</p><p>The financial information for the year ended 31 December 2024 does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for that year has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The independent auditors' report on the full consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 was unqualified and did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph or any statement under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.</p><p><b>NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<br/></b><b>for the year ended 31 December 2025</b></p><p><u><b>1.     Basis of preparation </b><i>continued</i></u></p><p>This preliminary announcement does not constitute the Group's full consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2025.

income statement presentation does not reflect the economic substance of the underlying assets and liabilities. Also excluded are interest costs relating to acquisition or disposal transactions as it is considered part of the acquisition cost or disposal proceeds rather than being reflective of the underlying financing costs of the Group. Foreign exchange, fair value movements on investments classified as FVTPL and other gains and losses on derivatives are excluded from adjusted earnings as they represent short-term fluctuations in market value and are subject to significant volatility. Other gains and losses may not be realised in due course as it is normally the intention to hold the related instruments to maturity. Interest on certain tax provisions is excluded from our adjusted measure in order to mirror the treatment of the underlying tax item.</p><p><b>NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Based on the most recent financial information available for the constituent entities in the Group, the Pillar Two effective tax rates in most of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates are above <percent>15%</percent>. There are a limited number of jurisdictions where the transitional safe harbour relief does not apply, including jurisdictions that may not meet the <percent>16%</percent> effective tax rate threshold required to qualify for the effective tax rate safe harbour test in FY25. However, the Group does not expect a material exposure to Pillar Two income taxes in those jurisdictions.</p><p>In 2025, a repayment of <money>£97m</money> was received from HMRC in respect of State Aid.

(\"EGS\") to complete a helicopter-borne Mobile MagnetoTellurics System (\"MobileMT\") survey over additional mineral licenses within the Company's Alum Shale Properties in north-central Sweden.</p><p>The MobileMT survey will comprise approximately 2,253 line kilometers at 400 meter line spacing and 4,000 m spaced tie lines over recent mineral license applications (see <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/no2w3fMee0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">December 17, 2025 news release</a>) that have now all been approved by the Mining Inspectorate, and are part of the Alum Shale Properties (Figure 1).  </p><p>The MobileMT survey is planned to commence in late-June or early-July 2026, subject to permitting, contractor availability, and weather conditions. Data from the survey will be processed and interpreted following completion and will be integrated with existing geological, geochemical, and geophysical datasets.  </p><p>The optimal target for further follow up work will comprise the shallowest and thickest parts of mineralized Alum Shale. The relatively flat lying Alum Shale contains abundant graphite and sulphides that make it a super conductor, which has been previously mapped out in detail by the MobileMT survey.  </p><p>In 2025, the high resolution MobileMT survey conducted by EGS successfully identified large-scale conductive anomalies that correlate with the Viken Energy Metals Deposit, as confirmed by historic drill holes from 2006 to 2012.

(“MMLC”). The Merger was accounted for as an asset acquisition in accordance with ASC 805-50, Business Combinations — Related Issues. The consideration paid to MMLC’s shareholders was less than the aggregate fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the “purchase discount”). The purchase discount was allocated to the cost of MMLC investments acquired by us on a pro-rata basis based on their relative fair values as of the closing date. Immediately following the Merger with MMLC, we marked the investments to their respective fair values and, as a result, the purchase discount allocated to the cost basis of the investments acquired was immediately recognized as unrealized appreciation on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The purchase discount allocated to the loan investments acquired will amortize over the life of each respective loan through interest income, with a corresponding adjustment recorded as unrealized appreciation on such loan acquired through its ultimate disposition. The purchase discount allocated to equity investments acquired will not amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, we will recognize a realized gain with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"bwpadl0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"></td><td class=\"bwpadl0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> </td></tr><tr><td class=\"bwpadl0 bwvertalignt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"></td><td class=\"bwvertalignt bwpadl1\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">As a supplement to our financial results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States of America</location> (“GAAP”), we have provided, as detailed below, certain non-GAAP financial measures to our operating results that exclude the aforementioned purchase discount and the ongoing amortization thereof, as determined in accordance with GAAP.
