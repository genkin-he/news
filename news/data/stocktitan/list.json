The dose for expansion was successfully identified, with ≥<percent>80%</percent> of patients achieving a PSA50 response at the expansion dose.</p><p>New data were presented during the 2026 American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium, taking place in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\">San Francisco, CA</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location>, from February 26-28, 2026.

The compound is designed specifically to increase uptake within the tumor, with the goal to provide a differentiated safety and efficacy profile.</p><p>Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men with less than three years median survival among metastatic patients, who have developed castration-resistance. There is an increasing unmet need to improve the outcomes of men with mCRPC.<sup>6</sup></p><p><b>About the PAnTHa study (NCT06217822)<br/></b><b>P</b>SMA-targeted <b>A</b>cti<b>n</b>ium-225-<b>T</b>rillium Fi<b>H</b> study in <b>A</b>dvanced mCRPC (PAnTHa), is a Phase I, open-label, first-in-human, multicenter study to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of <sup>225</sup>Ac-PSMA-Trillium (BAY 3563254) in participants with advanced metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) that have at least 1 PSMA-positive lesion on PSMA-PET. In the trial, patients received <sup>225</sup>Ac-PSMA-Trillium intravenously every 6 weeks for up to 4 doses. At data cut-off, 50 patients were enrolled across four dose levels in the escalation cohort and <percent>80%</percent> completed all four cycles of <sup>225</sup>Ac-PSMA-Trillium (range: 75 to 150 kBq/kg; 12-13 patients/cohort).</p><p><b>Detailed Results from PAnTHa<br/></b>To date, <sup>225</sup>Ac-PSMA-Trillium has had no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) or treatment-related deaths. Most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were dry mouth, fatigue and nausea. Overall, <percent>38%</percent> of patients had Gr ≥3 TEAEs, most commonly lymphopenia, <percent>16%</percent> of patients had serious TEAEs and <percent>4%</percent> of patients discontinued treatment due to TEAEs. The overall response rate per PCWG3 criteria across all doses in patients with measurable disease at baseline (n=24) was <percent>46%</percent>, with disease control rate of <percent>83%</percent>. Respective PSA50 and PSA90 response rates were <percent>58%</percent> and <percent>36%</percent> overall, and <percent>83%</percent> and <percent>58%</percent> at the Recommended Dose for Expansion (RDE). This was further supported by the decline in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) fraction at the RDE. Further, PSA50 responses were observed across all baseline mean Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmean) groups.</p><p><b>About 225Ac-PSMA-Trillium (BAY 3563254)<br/></b><sup>225</sup>Ac-PSMA-Trillium (BAY 3563254) is a next-generation TAT that comprises a highly specific PSMA-targeting motif, an albumin-binding domain to optimize tumor uptake and retention, and a Macropa<sup>TM</sup> chelator complexed with the alpha-emitter actinium-225. The distinctive structural components are designed to provide a differentiated safety and efficacy profile. Both in vitro and in vivo characterization of <sup>225</sup>Ac-PSMA-Trillium demonstrates high tumor uptake and retention. Potent antitumor efficacy has been observed in several preclinical models of prostate cancer. PSMA-Trillium resulted from the acquisition of PSMA Therapeutics and Noria Therapeutics in 2021 and are now under clinical investigation.</p><p><b>About Targeted Alpha Therapy<br/></b>Targeted alpha therapy (TAT) is an emerging class of radionuclide therapy that can be used against a variety of tumors. It delivers alpha particle radiation directly to the tumor inside the body, either via its bone-seeking property (radium-223) or by combining alpha radionuclides, such as actinium-225, with specific targeting moieties.</p><p>Actinium-225 is an alpha particle–emitting radionuclide with a 9.9-day half-life. Alpha particles deposit highly ionizing radiation over a short range. This localized delivery of the radioactive payload induces irreparable DNA double-strand breaks, often resulting in cell death.</p><p><b>About prostate cancer<br/></b>Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men. Despite significant advances in the last decade, the prognosis for men with mCRPC remains poor with a median survival of about 31 months.<sup>2</sup> With increasing incidence, more than 300 thousand prostate cancer cases were reported in the US in 2025; 5-year relative survival with distant disease is only <percent>34%</percent>.<sup>3</sup> Advances in imaging technologies (i.e. PSMA-PET) and their utilization across all stages of prostate cancer will likely result in an increased number of patients diagnosed with metastatic disease earlier. Consequently, more men will be diagnosed with <i>de novo</i> PSMA-positive metastatic disease.</p><p><b>About Bayer<br/></b>Bayer is a global enterprise with core competencies in the life science fields of health care and nutrition.

(\"Biglari Capital\"), the largest stockholder of Jack in the Box Inc. (NasdaqGS: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/JACK/\" title=\"View JACK stock overview\">JACK</a>), with a <percent>9.86%</percent> ownership stake, today issued the following statement regarding the preliminary voting results from <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/JACK/\" title=\"View JACK stock overview\">JACK</a>'s 2026 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.</p><p><b>A Clear Divide: Accountability vs. Complacency </b></p><p>Preliminary voting results from JACK's stockholder meeting reveal a stark and troubling divide. Active fund managers and retail stockholders — those who bear the real consequences of failed corporate governance — voted to hold Chairman David Goebel accountable for the destruction of stockholder value and his failure to act as a responsible steward of stockholder interests. By contrast, ISS, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street supported the status quo, providing cover for a board that has presided over value destruction.</p><p><b>JACK spent <money><money>$5 Million</money></money> to Defend One Director for One More Year </b></p><p>JACK spent an estimated <money><money>$5 million</money></money> on this proxy contest — not to protect the company's future, but to defend the reelection of David Goebel for a single additional year.</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>Over the last five years alone, Mr. Goebel collected approximately <money><money>$1.55 million</money></money> in director compensation.</li><li>During the same period, JACK's stockholders lost approximately <percent>80%</percent> of their investment — roughly <money><money>$1.8 billion</money></money> in stockholder value.</li><li>Mr. Goebel was paid millions to oversee billions in destruction.</li></ul><p><b>ISS, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street: A Governance Failure </b></p><p>While active fund managers and retail stockholders voted for accountability, ISS and the three largest index funds — BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street — supported JACK's failed leader.</p><p>Preliminary voting data for the three index funds imply that the proxy voting teams at these firms are completely indifferent to how their decisions impact the owners whose capital they are entrusted to protect. One is left to wonder: Do these governance teams even consider the repercussions their rubber-stamping of failed leadership has on the investors who have lost <percent>80%</percent> of the value of their JACK holdings?</p><p>JACK is a poster child of everything that can go wrong at a public company — catastrophic acquisition, leadership turnover, persistent operational underperformance, and entrenched governance — yet it has still managed to secure the support of a proxy advisor and the three largest index funds. This is not governance; it is the institutionalization of unaccountability.</p><p><b>The Underlying Investors Would Disagree</b></p><p>If the ETF investors who have entrusted their savings to BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street — retail investors saving for retirement, college, and financial security — had had a say, they likely would have voted against Goebel. These investors did not hand over their savings so that the governance teams at these institutions could give a free pass to the same failed leadership at JACK that destroyed <money><money>$1.8 billion</money></money> in stockholder value.</p><p>Failing to hold boards accountable promotes mediocrity. It puts the entire system of meritocracy at risk. When the largest stewards of capital — BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street — abdicate their governance responsibilities, the consequences extend far beyond any single company.</p><p><b>JACK's False and Misleading Statements</b></p><p>In addition to these governance failures, JACK made false and misleading statements in its proxy materials. Biglari Capital reserves the right to pursue all available legal remedies.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b></p><p>Mr. Goebel should be embarrassed and ashamed of the company's performance. He should have resigned years ago instead of playing politics and trying to hold on, wasting money for personal gain while relying on abstain votes, ISS, and index funds. He has no credibility with active investors.</p><p>SOURCE Biglari Capital Corp.</p></div></article>",

With the addition of two renowned Bushveld and Platreef geologists to the team and strategic investments by Glencore plc, the Company is well positioned to advance the next phase of large-scale critical mineral supply from this world-class American district, building on past production of nickel, copper, and chromium, and the on-going production of platinum group, nickel, and other metals by neighboring Sibanye-Stillwater. An expanded NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate, released January 2023, positions Stillwater West with the largest nickel resource in an active U.S. mining district as part of a compelling suite of ten minerals now listed as critical in the USA.</p><p>Stillwater also holds a <percent>49%</percent> interest in the high-grade Drayton-Black Lake-gold project adjacent to Nexgold Mining's development-stage Goliath Gold Complex in northwest Ontario, currently under an earn-in agreement with Heritage Mining, and the Kluane PGE-Ni-Cu-Co critical minerals project on trend with Nickel Creek Platinum's Wellgreen deposit in Canada's Yukon Territory. The Company also holds the Duke Island Cu-Ni-PGE property in Alaska and maintains a back-in right on the high-grade past-producing Yankee-Dundee in BC, following its sale in 2013.</p><div id=\"contactInfo\"><p><b>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT:</b></p><p>Michael Rowley, President, CEO &amp; Director - Stillwater Critical Minerals<br/>Email: <a href=\"mailto:info@criticalminerals.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">info@criticalminerals.com</a> Phone: (604) 357 4790<br/>Web: <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/EZ2gOcjYpY\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://criticalminerals.com</a> Toll Free: (888) 432 0075</p></div><p><u><b>Forward-Looking Statements</b></u></p><p>This news release includes certain statements that may be deemed \"forward-looking statements\". In particular, this press release contains forward-looking information relating to, among other things, the Offering, the anticipated closing date of the Offering, the intended use of proceeds of the Offering, approval of the TSXV and the filing of the Amended Offering Document. All statements in this release, other than statements of historical facts including, without limitation, statements regarding potential mineralization, historic production, estimation of mineral resources, the realization of mineral resource estimates, interpretation of prior exploration and potential exploration results, the timing and success of exploration activities generally, the timing and results of future resource estimates, permitting time lines, metal prices and currency exchange rates, availability of capital, government regulation of exploration operations, environmental risks, reclamation, title, and future plans and objectives of the company are forward-looking statements that involve various risks and uncertainties. Although Stillwater Critical Minerals believes the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on a number of material factors and assumptions. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements include failure to obtain necessary approvals, unsuccessful exploration results, changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined, results of future resource estimates, future metal prices, availability of capital and financing on acceptable terms, general economic, market or business conditions, risks associated with regulatory changes, defects in title, availability of personnel, materials and equipment on a timely basis, accidents or equipment breakdowns, uninsured risks, delays in receiving government approvals, unanticipated environmental impacts on operations and costs to remedy same, and other exploration or other risks detailed herein and from time to time in the filings made by the companies with securities regulators. Readers are cautioned that mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Mineral exploration and development of mines is an inherently risky business. Accordingly, the actual events may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.
