Despite soft category consumption and a challenging Infant Formula end-market, we gained share across store brands and in key brands as our team executed with discipline. These results reinforce the strength of our consumer-preferred portfolio, deep retail partnerships and sharpened focus on everyday consumer health. Our 'Three–S plan' is delivering meaningful progress in stabilizing our business, streamlining our complexity and strengthening what is working, supported by cost savings program benefits and the implementation of our new commercial operating model.\"</p><p>\"Looking ahead, we are prioritizing resources and investments towards CORE Perrigo, our go-forward business, which excludes the Infant Formula business under strategic review, and previously announced divestitures. Our 2026 outlook reflects near-term headwinds, balanced by favorable mix in our base business, disciplined execution of our new operational enhancement program and targeted cost actions to align our structure with current market realities. We are confident that our disciplined approach is enabling us to navigate the transition year ahead and positions Perrigo to create long-term value for our shareholders,\" concluded Lockwood-Taylor.</p><p>Refer to Tables I through VII at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjustments to the current year and prior year periods and additional non-GAAP information. The Company's reported results are included in the attached Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Balance Sheets and Statements of Cash Flows.</p><p><u><b>Concluding Project Energize</b></u></p><p>Project Energize, a global investment and efficiency program launched during the first quarter of 2024, delivered gross annualized pre-tax savings of approximately <money><money>$167 million</money></money> as of the end of FY2025, towards the high-end of the Company's estimated range of <money>$140 million</money> to <money>$170 million</money>.</p><p>Reinvestments of savings of <money><money>$35 million</money></money> over the same period are within the Company's estimated range of <money><money>$30 million</money></money> to <money><money>$40 million</money></money>. Restructuring charges incurred by the Company over the same period in connection with Project Energize were approximately <money><money>$138 million</money></money>. As the program has substantively finalized, the Company anticipates less than <money><money>$10 million</money></money> of costs to be incurred through FY2026.</p><p><u><b>Concluding Supply Chain Reinvention Program</b></u></p><p>The Company initiated a Supply Chain Reinvention Program in 2022 to reduce structural costs, improve profitability and service levels to retail partners, and strengthen Perrigo's resiliency by streamlining and simplifying the Company's global supply chain. The program was successfully completed and achieved cumulative annual run-rate benefits of <money><money>$157 million</money></money> in the fourth quarter of 2025, in the range of estimated program benefits of <money><money>$150 million</money></money> to <money><money>$200 million</money></money> (not including related depreciation expense on capital investments). Total costs incurred over the same period including capital investments, restructuring expenses and implementation costs were <money><money>$286 million</money></money>, below the estimated range of <money><money>$300 million</money></money> to <money><money>$350 million</money></money> originally expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal year 2028, with the substantial portion of the costs incurred by the end of FY2025. As the program has completed, the Company anticipates less than <money><money>$10 million</money></money> of costs to be incurred through FY2026.</p><p><u><b>Agreement to Divest Dermacosmetics Business</b></u></p><p>On July 14, 2025, the Company announced it signed an agreement to sell the Company's Dermacosmetics branded business for up to <money>€327 million</money>, including <money>€300 million</money> in upfront cash and up to an additional <money>€27 million</money> contingent on the achievement of net sales milestones over the next three years. The Company anticipates this transaction closing in the second quarter of 2026, subject to customary closing conditions.</p><p><u><b>Goodwill Impairment</b></u></p><p>During the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company's reporting units had an indication of potential impairment due to a sustained decrease in share price, lower expected cash flows principally related to infant formula market dynamics and a change in near-term expectations of the broader self-care market. As such, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment of <money><money>$1.3 billion</money></money> as of December 31, 2025.</p><p>The Company is also required to reallocate goodwill from its existing reporting units to the new reporting units (see 'New Reporting Segments Beginning First Quarter 2026' below for details). While the total estimated fair and carrying values are unchanged from December 31, 2025, the redistribution of goodwill across the Company's new reporting units may cause the Company to record additional non–cash goodwill impairment charges of up to <money><money>$350 million</money></money> in the first quarter of 2026.</p><p><u><b>Perrigo Fourth Quarter 2025 Results from Continuing Operations</b></u></p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"prnbcc\"><tr><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"6\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Fourth Quarter 2025 Net Sales Change Compared to Prior Year</b><sup><b>(5)</b></sup></span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen4\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><br/></td><td class=\"prngen5\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml10\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Reported <br/>Net Sales <br/>Growth</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml20\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Foreign <br/>Exchange <br/>Impact</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml10\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Constant <br/>Currency Net <br/>Sales</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml6\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Divestitures &amp; <br/>Exited <br/>Products</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml10\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Organic <br/>Net Sales <br/>Growth</b></span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>CSCA</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen6\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">(6.3) %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">— %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">(6.3) %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">— %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">(6.3) %</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen8\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>CSCI</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">4.7 %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">6.8 %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">(2.1) %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">(1.1) %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">(1.0) %</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen9\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Total Perrigo</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen10\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>(2.5) %</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen10\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>2.3 %</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen10\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>(4.9) %</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen10\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>(0.4) %</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen10\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>(4.5) %</b></span></p></td></tr></table></div><p>Net sales of <money><money>$1.11 billion</money></money> decreased <percent>2.5%</percent>, or <money><money>$29 million</money></money>, including favorable currency translation of <percent>2.3%</percent> and divestitures and exited products of -<percent>0.4%</percent>.

These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our, or our industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. In particular, statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, future events or future performance contained in this report, including certain statements contained in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" are forward-looking statements.

We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. While we believe these expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, including: our ability to complete the proposed divestment of the Dermacosmetics branded business, receipt of works council and regulatory approval regarding the transaction, performance by counterparties to the transaction and the likelihood of satisfying the deferred payment milestones associated with the transaction, supply chain impacts on our business, including those caused or exacerbated by armed conflict, trade and other economic sanctions and/or disease; general economic, credit, and market conditions; increased or new tariffs by the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> or foreign governments (and any retaliatory or reciprocal tariffs) and changes in global trade relations; the impact of the war in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ua\">Ukraine</location> and any escalation thereof, including the effects of economic and political sanctions imposed by <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">United Kingdom</location>, European Union, and other countries related thereto; the outbreak or escalation of conflict in other regions where we do business, including the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/mde\">Middle East</location>; current and future impairment charges, if we determine that the carrying amount of specific assets may not be recoverable from the expected future cash flows of such assets; customer acceptance of new products; competition from other industry participants, some of whom have greater marketing resources or larger market shares in certain product categories than we do; pricing pressures from customers and consumers; resolution of uncertain tax positions and any litigation relating thereto, ongoing or future government investigations and regulatory initiatives; uncertainty regarding our ability to obtain and maintain our regulatory approvals; potential costs and reputational impact of product recalls or sales halts; potential adverse changes to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> and foreign tax, healthcare and other government policy; the effect of epidemic or pandemic disease; the timing, amount and cost of any share repurchases (or the absence thereof) and/or any refinancing of outstanding debt at or prior to maturity; fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates; receipt of potential earnout payments in connection with the sale of the HRA Rare Diseases Business and the risk that potential costs or liabilities incurred or retained in connection with this transaction may exceed our estimates or adversely affect our business or operations; the risk that potential costs or liabilities incurred or retained in connection with the sale of our Rx business may exceed our estimates or adversely affect our business or operations; the consummation and success of other announced and unannounced acquisitions or dispositions, and our ability to realize the desired benefits thereof; and our ability to execute and achieve the desired benefits of announced cost-reduction efforts and other strategic initiatives and investments, including our ability to achieve the expected benefits from our ongoing restructuring programs described herein. Adverse results with respect to pending litigation could have a material adverse impact on our operating results, cash flows and liquidity, and could ultimately require the use of corporate assets to pay damages, reducing assets that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. These and other important factors, including those discussed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025, and in any subsequent filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release are made only as of the date hereof, and unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.</p><p><u><b>Non-GAAP Measures</b></u></p><p>This press release contains certain non-GAAP measures. A \"non-GAAP financial measure\" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the statements of operations, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the Company. Pursuant to the requirements of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company has provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> GAAP measures for the following non-GAAP financial measures referred to in this press release:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>net sales growth on an organic basis, which excludes acquisitions, divestitures and exited products, and the impact of currency,</li><li>adjusted gross profit,</li><li>adjusted gross margin,</li><li>adjusted operating income,</li><li>adjusted operating margin,</li><li>adjusted net income,</li><li>adjusted diluted earnings per share,</li></ul><p>These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to the GAAP reported measures, should not be considered replacements for, or superior to the GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies. The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures in order to provide transparency to our investors because they are measures that management uses to assess both management performance and the financial performance of our operations and to allocate resources. In addition, management believes that these measures may assist investors with understanding and evaluating our initiatives to drive improved financial performance and enables investors to supplementally compare our operating performance with the operating performance of our competitors including with those of our competitors having different capital structures. While we have excluded certain of these items from historical non-GAAP financial measures, there is no guarantee that the items excluded from non-GAAP financial measures will not continue into future periods. For instance, we expect to continue to experience and report restructuring-related charges associated with continued execution of our strategic initiatives.</p><p>The Company provides non-GAAP financial measures as additional information that it believes is useful to investors and analysts in evaluating the performance of the Company's ongoing operating trends, facilitating comparability between periods and, where applicable, with companies in similar industries and assessing the Company's prospects for future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items, such as amortization expense, unusual litigation, impairment charges, restructuring charges, and acquisition and integration-related charges, that by their nature affect comparability of operational performance or that we believe obscure underlying business operational trends. The intangible asset amortization excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures represents the entire amount recorded within the Company's GAAP financial statements and is excluded because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. The non-GAAP measures the Company provides are consistent with how management analyzes and assesses the operating performance of the Company, and disclosing them provides investor insight into management's view of the business. Management uses these adjusted financial measures for planning and forecasting in future periods, and evaluating segment and overall operating performance. In addition, management uses certain of the profit measures as factors in determining compensation.</p><p>Non-GAAP measures related to profit measurements, which may include adjusted gross profit, adjusted net income, adjusted operating income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted gross margin, constant currency net sales, and adjusted operating margin are useful to investors as they provide them with supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company's underlying business performance and trends, and enhance the ability of investors and analysts to compare the Company's period-to-period financial results. Management believes that adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin are useful to investors, in addition to the reasons discussed above, by allowing them to more easily compare and analyze trends in the Company's peer business group and assisting them in comparing the Company's overall performance to that of its competitors. The Company also discloses net sales growth excluding the impact of currency on an organic basis. In addition, the Company presents non–GAAP measures for 'CORE' Perrigo, reflecting its go–forward business and excluding infant formula currently under strategic review and previously announced divestitures. CORE measures may include CORE net income, CORE net sales, CORE organic net sales, CORE gross profit, CORE operating income, CORE diluted earnings per share, CORE gross margin, and CORE operating margin, including on an organic, constant–currency basis. Management believes these measures provide greater consistency in financial reporting and facilitate meaningful comparisons of underlying operating results and acquisition and divestiture activity.</p><p>The Company cannot reconcile its 'All In' or 'CORE' expected organic net sales growth, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate, net leverage, or adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measures under \"Fiscal Year 2026 Outlook from Continuing Operations\" without unreasonable effort because certain items that impact net income and other reconciling metrics are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted at this time. These items include, but are not limited to, uncertainty of non-recurring infant formula related charges and timing and amount of restructuring charges and the income tax effects of these items or other income tax-related events.</p><p>The Company believes these supplemental financial measures provide investors with consistency in financial reporting, enabling meaningful comparisons of past and present underlying operating results, and also facilitate analysis of the Company's operating performance and acquisition and divestiture trends.</p><p>A copy of this press release, including the

</i>Net sales of <money><money>$442.1 million</money></money> decreased <percent>11.1%</percent> due primarily to lower consumption of proton pump inhibitors for heartburn, as well as the net impact of pricing actions, which were partially offset by higher net sales in laxatives, including <i>Polyethylene Glycol 3350</i><i>.<br/><br/></i></li><li><i>Nutrition:</i> Net sales of <money><money>$408.5 million</money></money> decreased <percent>9.1%</percent> due primarily to infant formula driven by previously disclosed lost distribution of the <i>Good Start<sup>®</sup></i>

While not all of the information that the Company posts to the Enovis Investor Relations website is of a material nature, some information could be deemed to be material. Accordingly, the Company encourages investors, the media and others interested in Enovis to review the information that it shares on <u>ir.enovis.com</u>.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><b><i>Forward-Looking Statements</i></b></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>This press release includes forward-looking statements, including forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning Enovis’ plans, goals, objectives, outlook, expectations and intentions, and other statements that are not historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements are based on Enovis’ current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause Enovis’ results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to, risks related to Enovis’ integration of Lima; the impact of public health emergencies and global pandemics; disruptions in the global economy caused by escalating geopolitical tensions including in connection with the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East; macroeconomic conditions, including the impact of inflationary pressures; changes in government trade policies, including the implementation of tariffs; supply chain disruptions; increasing energy costs and availability concerns, particularly in the European market; other impacts on Enovis’ business and ability to execute business continuity plans; and the other factors detailed in Enovis’ reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the caption “Risk Factors,” as well as the other risks discussed in Enovis’ filings with the SEC. In addition, these statements are based on assumptions that are subject to change. This press release speaks only as of the date hereof. Enovis disclaims any duty to update the information herein.</i></p> <p align=\"left\"><b><i>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</i></b></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>Enovis has provided in this press release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“non-GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures may include one or more of the following: adjusted net income from continuing operations (“Adjusted net income”), Adjusted net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted gross profit, and Adjusted gross profit margin. </i></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per diluted share exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interest from continuing operations, net of taxes; the effect of income from discontinued operations, net of taxes; restructuring charges; Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) fees and other costs; strategic transaction costs; stock-based compensation; acquisition-related intangible asset amortization; strategic purchase of economic interest on future royalty payments; property plant and equipment step-up depreciation, and</i><i> inventory step-up</i><i>; goodwill impairment charges; Other (income) expense, net; and include the tax effect of adjusted pre-tax income at applicable tax rates and other tax adjustments. Enovis also presents Adjusted net income margin, which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted net income. </i></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted net income excluding interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Enovis presents Adjusted EBITDA margin, which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted EBITDA.</i></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>Adjusted gross profit represents gross profit excluding the fair value charges of acquired inventory, depreciation step-up of acquired fixed assets, and the impact of restructuring charges. Adjusted gross profit margin is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted gross profit.</i></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>Organic sales growth calculates sales growth period over period, after excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. </i></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>These non-GAAP financial measures assist Enovis management in comparing its operating performance over time because certain items may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult, as they are of a nature and/or size that occur with inconsistent frequency or relate to discrete restructuring plans that are fundamentally different from the ongoing productivity improvements of the Company. Enovis management also believes that presenting these measures allows investors to view its performance using the same measures that the Company uses in evaluating its financial and business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures presented above to GAAP results has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release. Enovis does not provide reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA or adjusted earnings per share on a forward-looking basis to the closest GAAP financial measures, as such information is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to uncertainties regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items excluded from these measures. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the guidance period. </i></p> <p align=\"justify\">Kyle Rose<br/>Vice President, Investor Relations<br/>Enovis Corporation<br/>+1-917-734-7450<br/><u>investorrelations@enovis.com</u></p> <p align=\"center\"><b>Enovis Corporation</b><br/><b>Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations</b><br/><b>Dollars in thousands, except per share data</b><br/><b>(Unaudited)</b></p> <table align=\"center\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

We accrued a liability and recognized <money>$45.8 million</money> charge for the net present value of the purchases for the year ended December 31, 2025. <br/><sup>(</sup><sup>5</sup><sup>)</sup> Inventory step-up expense represents the incremental expense of inventory sold recognized at its fair value after business combination accounting is applied versus the expense that would have been recognized if sold at its cost to manufacture. Since only the inventory that existed at the business combination date was stepped-up to fair value, we believe excluding the incremental expense enhances comparability between periods, allowing investors to better understand our business performance and the underlying trends relevant to our ongoing business performance.</p> <p align=\"center\"><b>Enovis Corporation</b><br/><b>Reconciliation of Gross Margin (GAAP) to Adjusted Gross Margin (non-GAAP)</b><br/><b>Dollars in millions</b><br/><b>(Unaudited)</b></p> <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

MSC-NTF cells are produced from autologous, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that have been expanded and differentiated ex vivo. MSCs are converted into MSC-NTF cells by growing them under patented conditions that induce the cells to secrete high levels of neurotrophic factors (NTFs). Autologous MSC-NTF cells are designed to effectively deliver multiple NTFs and immunomodulatory cytokines directly to the site of damage to elicit a desired biological effect and ultimately slow or stabilize disease progression.</p><p><b>About BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc</b>.              <br/>BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/BCLI/\" title=\"View BCLI stock overview\">BCLI</a>) is a leading developer of autologous adult stem cell therapies for debilitating neurodegenerative diseases. The company's proprietary NurOwn® platform uses autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to produce neurotrophic factor-secreting cells (MSC-NTF cells), designed to deliver targeted biological signals that modulate neuroinflammation and promote neuroprotection.           </p><p>NurOwn® is BrainStorm's lead investigational therapy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and has received Orphan Drug designation from both the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). A Phase 3 trial in ALS (NCT03280056) has been completed, and a second Phase 3b trial is set to launch under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreement with the FDA. The NurOwn clinical program has generated valuable insights into ALS disease biology, including pharmacogenomic response associated with the UNC13A genotype, biomarker data collected at seven longitudinal time points, and a comprehensive analysis of the \"Floor Effect\" - a critical challenge in measuring clinical outcomes in advanced ALS. BrainStorm has published its findings in multiple peer-reviewed journals. In addition to ALS, BrainStorm has completed a Phase 2 open-label multicenter trial (NCT03799718) of MSC-NTF cells in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), supported by a grant from the National MS Society. BrainStorm is also advancing a proprietary, allogeneic exosome-based platform designed to deliver therapeutic proteins and nucleic acids. The company recently received a Notice of Allowance from the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Patent and Trademark Office for a foundational patent covering its exosome technology, further strengthening BrainStorm's growing IP portfolio in this emerging area of regenerative medicine.

The Project is largely underlain by the same Triassic-Jurassic geology that hosts nearby copper-gold porphyry deposits, including those held by Centerra, by Amarc Resources, and by TDG Gold.  The NIV property displays strongly anomalous soil geochemistry (&gt;100 ppm copper, &gt;75 ppb gold, &gt;4 ppm molybdenum) over broad areas along a five kilometre long trend that are coincident with similarly strongly anomalous geophysical responses (IP (Induced Polarization) chargeability and resistivity, airborne MT (Magnetotellurics) which stretch to depths of several hundreds of metres or more. Such coincident anomalies are suggestive of the potential for a large scale porphyry copper-gold system at depth, with scale to accommodate multiple porphyry centers.  Neither the NIV nor West NIV property has been drill-tested previously.   </p><p><b>Initial Drill Program Set for June </b></p><p>The initial drill program in planning for the NIV property will be designed to test multiple porphyry Cu-Au-Mo targets along the length of the NIV property's 5 km long trend of coincident geochemical and geophysical anomalies. Each target will be tested by multiple drill holes. The initial drilling will likely consist of a total of between 4,000 and 8,000 metres. </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/xEjZMtKmxn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">CLICK HERE to View NIV Target Areas</a></p><p>Final drill site selection will be informed by ongoing compilation and interpretation of all geological, geochemical and geophysical data. Geological ground-truthing and possible additional geophysics (ground AMT surveys; completion of the West NIV airborne geophysical survey) may be conducted to further refine drill sites concurrent with initiation of the drill program.</p><p>Metal Energy intends to mobilize drill crews in June 2026, with contractors engaged and logistical planning well underway.</p><p><b>Fully Capitalized and Backed by Majors</b></p><p>The Company enters 2026 fully capitalized, with approximately <money>$10 million</money> in cash, and with the backing of two major mining companies, Centerra Gold (\"Centerra\") and Teck Resources (\"Teck\") (refer to <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/7n1ZESMAa5\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">December 17, 2025 news release</a>).

While not all of the information that the Company posts to the Enovis Investor Relations website is of a material nature, some information could be deemed to be material. Accordingly, the Company encourages investors, the media and others interested in Enovis to review the information that it shares on <u>ir.enovis.com</u>.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><b><i>Forward-Looking Statements</i></b></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>This press release includes forward-looking statements, including forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning Enovis’ plans, goals, objectives, outlook, expectations and intentions, and other statements that are not historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements are based on Enovis’ current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause Enovis’ results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to, risks related to Enovis’ integration of Lima; the impact of public health emergencies and global pandemics; disruptions in the global economy caused by escalating geopolitical tensions including in connection with the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East; macroeconomic conditions, including the impact of inflationary pressures; changes in government trade policies, including the implementation of tariffs; supply chain disruptions; increasing energy costs and availability concerns, particularly in the European market; other impacts on Enovis’ business and ability to execute business continuity plans; and the other factors detailed in Enovis’ reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the caption “Risk Factors,” as well as the other risks discussed in Enovis’ filings with the SEC. In addition, these statements are based on assumptions that are subject to change. This press release speaks only as of the date hereof. Enovis disclaims any duty to update the information herein.</i></p> <p align=\"left\"><b><i>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</i></b></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>Enovis has provided in this press release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“non-GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures may include one or more of the following: adjusted net income from continuing operations (“Adjusted net income”), Adjusted net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted gross profit, and Adjusted gross profit margin. </i></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per diluted share exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interest from continuing operations, net of taxes; the effect of income from discontinued operations, net of taxes; restructuring charges; Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) fees and other costs; strategic transaction costs; stock-based compensation; acquisition-related intangible asset amortization; strategic purchase of economic interest on future royalty payments; property plant and equipment step-up depreciation, and</i><i> inventory step-up</i><i>; goodwill impairment charges; Other (income) expense, net; and include the tax effect of adjusted pre-tax income at applicable tax rates and other tax adjustments. Enovis also presents Adjusted net income margin, which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted net income. </i></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted net income excluding interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Enovis presents Adjusted EBITDA margin, which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted EBITDA.</i></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>Adjusted gross profit represents gross profit excluding the fair value charges of acquired inventory, depreciation step-up of acquired fixed assets, and the impact of restructuring charges. Adjusted gross profit margin is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted gross profit.</i></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>Organic sales growth calculates sales growth period over period, after excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. </i></p> <p align=\"justify\"><i>These non-GAAP financial measures assist Enovis management in comparing its operating performance over time because certain items may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult, as they are of a nature and/or size that occur with inconsistent frequency or relate to discrete restructuring plans that are fundamentally different from the ongoing productivity improvements of the Company. Enovis management also believes that presenting these measures allows investors to view its performance using the same measures that the Company uses in evaluating its financial and business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures presented above to GAAP results has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release. Enovis does not provide reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA or adjusted earnings per share on a forward-looking basis to the closest GAAP financial measures, as such information is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to uncertainties regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items excluded from these measures. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the guidance period. </i></p> <p align=\"justify\">Kyle Rose<br/>Vice President, Investor Relations<br/>Enovis Corporation<br/>+1-917-734-7450<br/><u>investorrelations@enovis.com</u></p> <p align=\"center\"><b>Enovis Corporation</b><br/><b>Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations</b><br/><b>Dollars in thousands, except per share data</b><br/><b>(Unaudited)</b></p> <table align=\"center\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

We accrued a liability and recognized <money>$45.8 million</money> charge for the net present value of the purchases for the year ended December 31, 2025. <br/><sup>(</sup><sup>5</sup><sup>)</sup> Inventory step-up expense represents the incremental expense of inventory sold recognized at its fair value after business combination accounting is applied versus the expense that would have been recognized if sold at its cost to manufacture. Since only the inventory that existed at the business combination date was stepped-up to fair value, we believe excluding the incremental expense enhances comparability between periods, allowing investors to better understand our business performance and the underlying trends relevant to our ongoing business performance.</p> <p align=\"center\"><b>Enovis Corporation</b><br/><b>Reconciliation of Gross Margin (GAAP) to Adjusted Gross Margin (non-GAAP)</b><br/><b>Dollars in millions</b><br/><b>(Unaudited)</b></p> <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

operations less capital expenditures.</p><p>Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operating results and financial performance. We believe these measures are useful to investors as they are widely used measures of performance and can facilitate comparison to other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are not, and should not be considered as, measures of liquidity. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because of these limitations, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with GAAP financial performance measures. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to such GAAP measures can be found below. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, our reported financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.</p><p><b>Reconciliation of Non-GAAP

The LOI is structured in two stages: first, the Company will fund a low-cost auger drill program of up to C<money>$20,000</money> (\"Due Diligence Payment\") in order to conduct diligence (\"Initial Due Diligence\") on the Property; if the Company wishes to then proceed, it will, in consideration for the Due Diligence Payment, acquire the Option. The Initial Due Diligence program will consist of up to 10 auger drill holes designed to verify the presence of ionic clay REE mineralization and assess the character and distribution of the rare earth-bearing horizon.</p><p>\"This Patos acquisition expands our exposure to another potential ionic clay rare earth system in Brazil, a country that has seen several recent rare earth discoveries within favourable geological settings,\" commented Canamera CEO Brad Brodeur. \"We will apply a systematic exploration program to determine whether similar mineralization may be present on the Patos property in a mining friendly, relatively low cost jurisdiction.\"</p><p><b>Option Exercise - Cash and Share Consideration</b></p><p>Should Canamera acquire the Option following the completion of the Initial Due Diligence program, then such Option may be exercised by the Company making the following cash and Company share payments (\"Option Payments\") immediately following completion of the Initial Due Diligence program:</p><ul><li><p><b>Cash Consideration: </b>C<money>$228,000</money> in aggregate, comprising the C<money>$20,000</money> Due Diligence Payment and a remaining cash payment of C<money>$208,000</money>; and</p></li><li><p><b>Share Consideration: </b>Common shares of Canamera having an aggregate deemed value of C<money>$307,800</money>, issued at a price equal to the 10-day volume-weighted average price (\"VWAP\") of the Company's shares over the 10 trading days immediately prior to closing, subject to applicable Canadian securities laws and CSE approval. Fifty percent (<percent>50%</percent>) of the shares will be held in escrow for four (4) months and the remaining fifty percent (<percent>50%</percent>) for six (6) months from the date of issuance.</p></li></ul><p>Upon making the Option Payments, Canamera will acquire a <percent>100%</percent> interest in the Property, subject to a <percent>2%</percent> net smelter return royalty (\"NSR\") in favor of the Offeror (and the obligation to make the Milestone Payments described below). Canamera will have the right to buy back <percent>50%</percent> of the NSR (reducing it to a <percent>1%</percent> NSR) for C<money>$228,000</money> upon certain terms and conditions.</p><p><b>Milestone Payments</b></p><p>Subject to acquiring and exercising the Option, Canamera has also agreed to pay the following milestone payment amounts (\"Milestone Payments\") to the Offeror:</p><ul><li><p><b>Milestone Payment 1: </b>C<money>$342,000</money> (comprised of <percent>50%</percent> cash / <percent>50%</percent> Company shares at 20-day VWAP) payable if Canamera reports, in respect of the Property, a 43-101-compliant Inferred Resource of 250 million tonnes or more, grading at least 2,000 ppm Total Rare Earth Oxides (\"TREO\") within five (5) years from the date of acquisition.</p></li><li><p><b>Milestone Payment 2: </b>C<money>$228,000</money> (comprised of <percent>50%</percent> cash / <percent>50%</percent> Company shares at 20-day VWAP) payable if Canamera reports, in respect of the Property, drill intercepts of 25 metres grading at least 2,500 ppm TREO within three (3) years from the date of acquisition.</p></li></ul><p><b>Patos Project Overview</b></p><p>The Patos Project consists of eight (8) prospecting licences (ANM Licence IDs: 830763/2024 through 830771/2024) totalling approximately 15,979 hectares, located in the municipality of Presidente Olegário in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The Property is road accessible and situated approximately 330 kilometres from Belo Horizonte.</p><p>The Property is underlain by the Patos Formation, a member of the Mata da Corda Group — the same stratigraphic package currently being explored for ionic clay REE mineralization by other companies active in the region. Ionic clay REE deposits are of particular interest given their amenability to low-cost, low-impact extraction methods relative to hard-rock REE deposits.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/11828/285428_66887350c49ce911_001full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 26, 2026) - Eureka Lithium Corp. (CSE: ERKA) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/UREKF/\" title=\"View UREKF stock overview\">UREKF</a>) (FSE: S58) (\"<b>Eureka Lithium</b>\" or \"<b>Eureka</b>\" or the \"<b>Company</b>\") is pleased to announce, further to its news release dated January 28, 2026, that it has completed the acquisition (\"<b>Acquisition</b>\") of a <percent>100%</percent> interest in the Cabin Lake Polymetallic Project, located in the Omineca Mining District of British Columbia, and of a <percent>100%</percent> interest in the Tyee Titanium-Vanadium Project, located within the Havre-St-Pierre region of Quebec (together, the \"<b>Properties</b>\"), through its acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares (\"<b>Stairway Shares</b>\") of Stairway Mining Inc. (\"<b>Stairway</b>\").</p><p>The Acquisition was made pursuant to the terms of an amended and restated share purchase agreement (\"<b>Share Purchase Agreement</b>\") dated February 20, 2026, under which Eureka acquired the Stairway Shares in exchange for an aggregate of 9,100,000 common shares of Eureka, issued to Stairway Shareholders on a pro rata basis (\"<b>Consideration Shares</b>\"). In addition, Eureka has agreed to make a milestone cash payment of, in aggregate, CAD <money>$1,000,000</money> (the \"<b>Milestone Payment</b>\", and together with the Consideration Shares, the \"<b>Consideration</b>\") to former Stairway Shareholders, on a pro rata basis, in the event that all of the following milestones are achieved: (i) Eureka files a technical report for each of the Properties on SEDAR+ within six months of the date of the Share Purchase Agreement; (ii) Eureka delineates and publicly discloses a mineral resource estimate in respect of at least one the Properties within nine months of the date of the Share Purchase Agreement; and (iii) Eureka publicly discloses a preliminary economic assessment in respect of at least one of the Properties within 15 months of the date of the Share Purchase Agreement. The Consideration Shares are subject to a hold period of four months and one day from the date of issuance.  The Company notes that, as disclosed in its January 28, 2026 news release, the original consideration contemplated to be paid for the Acquisition was 12,000,000 common shares of Eureka, with no Milestone Payment.  These terms were amended as a result of the Company's inability to vary the four month and one day hold applicable to the Consideration Shares pursuant to Canadian Securities Exchange policies.</p><p>The Company notes that the Consideration for the Acquisition was determined through arm's length negotiations between the Company and Stairway.  During such negotiations, the Company's management and board applied its business judgment, having regard to comparable transactions in the junior mining industry.  Stairway originally staked or acquired the Tyee Project claims in December 2025. The Company's Consideration was not based on the historical staking or acquisition cost of the claims, but rather on its independent assessment of the exploration potential, geological merit, strategic value and market comparables for similar stage critical mineral assets. Management does not consider the difference between Stairway's original acquisition cost and the Consideration to be indicative of the fair value of the Properties.</p><p>The former Stairway Shareholders are arm's length to the Company and to its directors, officers, and, to its knowledge, insiders. </p><p>The Cabin Lake Project is comprised of six contiguous mineral claims totaling approximately 2,363 hectares in central British Columbia's Omineca Mining District. Cabin Lake is a polymetallic system prospective for zinc, lead, copper, molybdenum and silver, with multiple historical showings and a 600 metre by 1,000 metre target footprint identified through prior exploration work.</p><p>The Cabin Lake Project is strategically located near established infrastructure and producing and past-producing mines, including the Endako Mine<sup>1</sup> and the Blackwater Mine<sup>2</sup>, underscoring the district-scale fertility of the region.*</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9639/285386_569dd43d44164ad0_002full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

guidance to fiscal 2026 GAAP EPS guidance is not included in this release due to the number of variables in the projected GAAP EPS range and the Company’s current inability to reasonably quantify certain amounts, such as restructuring or other charges, that would be included in the GAAP measure or the individual adjustments for such reconciliation.</p><p>Note: Although free cash flow, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating expense, adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS are not measures of financial performance under GAAP, the Company believes they are useful in understanding its financial results. Free cash flow is a commonly used measure of a company’s ability to generate cash in excess of its operating needs. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of operating earnings less non-cash expenses. The adjusted basis presentation excludes the impact of certain matters not related to the Company’s ongoing operations. Management believes that the adjusted basis presentation reflects management’s performance in operating the Company and provides a meaningful representation of the performance of the Company’s core business and is useful to understanding its financial results. A shortcoming of these financial measures is that they do not reflect the Company’s actual results under GAAP. Management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Amounts may not foot due to rounding.</p><p><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20260226184143r1&amp;sid=acqr8&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en\" style=\"width:0;height:0\"/><span class=\"bwct31415\"></span></p><p id=\"mmgallerylink\"><span id=\"mmgallerylink-phrase\">View source version on businesswire.com: </span><span id=\"mmgallerylink-link\"><a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260226184143/en/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260226184143/en/</a></span></p><p><b>For more information, contact:</b><br/>Sarika Dhadwal (952) 887-3753<br/><a href=\"mailto:Sarika.Dhadwal@Donaldson.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">Sarika.Dhadwal@Donaldson.com</a></p><p>Source: Donaldson Company, Inc.</p></article>",

In the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we generated meaningful free cash flow, enabling us to reduce leverage to levels below where we stood prior to our asset transaction in August. This performance reflects the durability of our financial model and our continued focus on disciplined capital allocation.</p><p>Subsequent to quarter-end, we announced our agreement to acquire Valiant Artificial Lift Solutions, expanding our artificial lift capabilities and strengthening our ability to deliver the right solution for our customers in each well, every time. The transaction remains subject to customary regulatory approvals, and we expect it to close in the first week of March. We believe this transaction meaningfully expands our addressable market and strengthens our ability to support customers earlier in a well’s producing life and throughout the well lifecycle. As we integrate the business in 2026, we are confident in our ability to drive incremental growth and long-term value while continuing to advance Flowco’s broader production optimization strategy.”</p><p><b>Segment Information</b></p><p>We report our results in two segments, Production Solutions and Natural Gas Technologies. Production Solutions includes the rental, sale and service associated with high pressure gas lift, conventional gas lift and plunger lift, including a range of digital solutions and other production related technologies. Natural Gas Technologies includes the design, manufacture, rental and sale of vapor recovery and natural gas systems. Corporate costs not directly related to either segment are categorized separately.</p><p><b><i>Segment Financial Information</i></b></p><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl

accepted accounting principles in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> (“GAAP”), the Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted Net Income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, as well as Adjusted Segment EBITDA and Adjusted Segment EBITDA Margin, in this press release to supplement financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that excluding certain items from our GAAP results provides management additional insight on the consolidated financial performance from period to period to project our future consolidated financial performance as forecasts are developed at a level of detail different from that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures. Moreover, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide our management and investors with useful information to help them evaluate our operating results by facilitating an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and enabling them to make more meaningful period to period comparisons. There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release. For example, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. Similarly, Free Cash Flow does not represent our residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures, since the calculation of this measure does not reflect certain debt service requirements or certain other non-discretionary expenditures. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. The Company urges investors to review the reconciliation and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.</p><p><b><i>Adjusted Net Income</i></b></p><p>Adjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP measure that we define as net income (loss) adjusted to eliminate the impact of (i) transaction-related expenses, (ii) share-based compensation, (iii) loss on the sale of equipment, (iv) loss on debt payments and (v) changes to the value of our inventory. Adjusted Net Income is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by management, our stockholders and others to provide visibility on the profitability and financial strength of the Company by excluding certain expenses related to non-recurring Company transactions.</p><p>Reconciliation from net income to Adjusted Net Income is set forth as follows:</p><table cellspacing=\"0\"

and growth capital expenditures, but excludes asset acquisitions of a business, and excludes other business acquisitions and equity investments). Management believes this information is important to provide because it is used by management to evaluate the Company’s operational performance and trends between periods and to manage our business. Management also believes this information may be useful to investors and analysts to gain a better understanding of the Company’s results of ongoing operations. Free Cash Flow is not intended to replace GAAP financial measures.

Adjusted EBITDA decreased to <money><money>$38.8 million</money></money>, and adjusted core EPS also declined to <money><money>$0.28</money></money>. Included in the Company’s reported results this quarter are <money><money>$66.2 million</money></money> of expenses associated primarily with (i) impairment charges and other losses related to underperforming assets the Company plans to sell in 2026, and (ii) operating costs and losses resulting from indemnified and repurchased loans. The Company ended the year with <money><money>$299 million</money></money> of cash and cash equivalents, as the majority of the impairment charges and other losses taken in the fourth quarter were non-cash. The recurring cash revenues driven by the Company’s <money><money>$144 billion</money></money> loan servicing portfolio and strength of the balance sheet led the Company’s Board of Directors to declare a dividend of <money><money>$0.68</money></money> per share for the first quarter of 2026, a <percent>1.5%</percent> increase over the 2025 quarterly dividend and a <percent>172%</percent> increase since the dividend was initiated in 2018.</p><p>“We closed 2025 with strong momentum across our business after growing total transaction volume each quarter throughout the year from <money><money>$7 billion</money></money> in Q1’25 to <money><money>$18 billion</money></money> in Q4’25, up <percent>161%</percent>” commented Walker &amp; Dunlop Chairman and CEO Willy Walker. “As the commercial real estate transaction market continues to improve, our people and our brand are winning, reflected in our growing market share, and strong league table rankings. We finished the year as the #1 Fannie Mae DUS lender, #3 Freddie Mac Optigo lender, the second-largest combined GSE loan originator, and the fourth-largest multifamily property sales broker in the United States.”</p><p>Mr. Walker continued, “Our fourth quarter results were impacted by loan repurchase expenses and impairment charges related to our real estate owned portfolio. As we move forward from these issues, we feel very well positioned for growth in 2026 and beyond. With a <money><money>$144 billion</money></money> servicing portfolio generating durable recurring revenue, a robust Capital Markets pipeline building early in the year, and an improving macroeconomic backdrop for commercial real estate, we are focused on generating top and bottom-line growth in 2026 and beyond. Our mission is to become the very best commercial real estate capital markets company in the world, and that journey begins now.”</p><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl\"><tr><td class=\"bwpadl0\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\">____________________</td></tr><tr><td class=\"bwpadl0 bwpadr0 bwvertalignt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"bwalignr bwcellpmargin\">(1)</p></td><td class=\"bwvertalignt bwpadl1\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"bwcellpmargin\">Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure the Company presents to help investors better understand our operating performance.

payoffs.</li><li>During the fourth quarter of 2025, we added <money><money>$4.6 billion</money></money> of net loans to our servicing portfolio, and over the past 12 months, we added <money><money>$8.7 billion</money></money> of net loans to our servicing portfolio, with the growth led primarily by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans.</li><li><money><money>$12.2 billion</money></money> of Agency loans in our servicing portfolio are scheduled to mature over the next two years, which presents an opportunity for our GSE loan servicing portfolios to continue scaling as our Capital Markets team continues to deliver top end market share with the GSEs. The maturing loans, with a weighted-average servicing fee of 28 basis points, represent only <percent>10%</percent> of the total Agency loans in our portfolio. Over the next five years, <percent>53%</percent> of Agency loans will mature, providing an opportunity for us to recapitalize or sell these deals for our clients in the coming years.</li><li>The mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) associated with our servicing portfolio are reported at an amortized cost of <money><money>$808 million</money></money> as of December 31, 2025, while the fair value is estimated at <money><money>$1.4 billion</money></money>. The long-term contractual nature of the servicing rights, coupled with ancillary revenues earned from the portfolio, generate attractive upside and value above our cost basis.</li><li>Assets under

quarter. In the first quarter of 2026, the Company made the strategic decision to sell a portfolio of underperforming assets that was acquired in 2021 from Alliant. Affordable assets have recovered more slowly than market rate assets, particularly in rent-controlled markets, and the carrying value of these assets was above the expected fair value, resulting in <money><money>$26.1 million</money></money> of asset impairment charges and accrued losses this quarter. In addition, we recognized a total of <money><money>$35.5 million</money></money> of indemnified and repurchased loan expenses and credit losses in the quarter in connection with all loans we have repurchased, indemnified or expect to indemnify.</li><li>Total revenues decreased less than <percent>1%</percent> this quarter, while total expenses increased <percent>24%</percent> as a result of the aforementioned asset impairment charges and other expenses, and indemnified and repurchased loan expenses, leading to the year-over-year decline in our operating margin and net income. The decrease in net income was the primary factor in the decrease in return on equity.</li><li>The increase in personnel expense as a percentage of total revenues was principally the result of an increase in variable compensation driven by the growth in loan origination and debt brokerage fees, net (“origination fees”) for the quarter.</li><li>The <percent>59%</percent> decrease in adjusted EBITDA was largely related to the aforementioned increases in asset impairments and other expenses and the non-credit portion of indemnified and repurchased loan expenses, coupled with increased

during the fourth quarter 2025.</li><li>In the first quarter of 2026, the Company completed an internal investigation into fraudulent borrower activity on certain loans sold to Freddie Mac. Stemming from that investigation, Freddie Mac has either asked us, or we expect they will ask us, to repurchase three portfolios of loans associated with three separate borrowers with a UPB of <money><money>$134.3 million</money></money>. We executed a forbearance and indemnification agreement for one of the portfolios of loans with a UPB of <money><money>$50.7 million</money></money> that delays the repurchase of the loans until the fourth quarter of 2027 and indemnifies Freddie Mac for any losses until the repurchase date. We are negotiating a forbearance and indemnification agreement with Freddie Mac for the second portfolio of loans with a UPB of <money><money>$49.3 million</money></money>, and we expect to negotiate a forbearance and indemnification agreement for the third portfolio of loans with a UPB of <money><money>$34.3 million</money></money> in the first half of 2026.</li><li>Prior to the fourth quarter, our approach to repurchased and indemnified loans was to operate them with the intent of repositioning them to recover a portion of the losses incurred. That approach no longer aligns with our long-term strategy, and we shifted our focus for the <money><money>$87.3 million</money></money> of assets repurchased or indemnified in 2024 to a near-term exit strategy.</li><li>We have repurchased loans with a UPB totaling <money><money>$52.5 million</money></money> over the last two years, and those loans are currently valued at <money><money>$47.7 million</money></money>. We are evaluating the most effective path to selling those assets. We have indemnification agreements in place for another <money><money>$83.4 million</money></money> of loans as of December 31, 2025, with collateral posted of <money><money>$22.7 million</money></money>, resulting in a maximum cash outlay over the next two years of <money><money>$60.7 million</money></money>. We expect to sell the loans or underlying assets associated with the loans prior to the expiration of the indemnification agreements in order to pay off the repurchase obligation.</li></ul><p class=\"bwalignc\"><b>FOURTH QUARTER 2025<br/></b><b>FINANCIAL RESULTS BY SEGMENT</b></p><p>Interest expense on corporate debt is determined at a consolidated corporate level and allocated to each segment proportionally based on each segment’s use of that corporate debt.

Revenues grew at a slower pace than transaction volumes principally due to (i) the increase in origination fees, driven primarily by debt brokerage and property sales transaction growth and several large transactions this quarter; and (ii) lower non-cash MSR income on our new Fannie Mae loan originations.</li><li>Debt brokerage and property sales transactions generally carry lower origination fee rates than Agency transactions. Large portfolio transactions also generate lower origination fee rates than smaller transactions, all else equal. The combination of these two factors this quarter drove the decline in the origination fee rate to 75 basis points this quarter, compared to 94 basis points in the year ago fourth quarter.</li><li>The decrease in MSR income was largely a result of the decrease in the Agency MSR rate. The Agency MSR rate decreased due to a decline in the weighted-average servicing fee (“WASF”) on Fannie Mae originations. Borrowers continue opting for shorter duration loans due to the shape of the yield curve and the desire to maintain optionality in the short term as interest rates continue normalizing.</li><li>Property sales broker fees increased year over year primarily due to the <percent>31%</percent> increase in property sales volume, coupled with an increase in the property sales broker fee rate year over year.</li><li>Personnel expense increased in the fourth quarter of 2025 primarily due to an increase in commission costs primarily resulting from growth in origination and property sales broker fees, coupled with an increase in salaries and benefits resulting from an increase in average segment headcount.</li><li>The change in fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities year over year was due to an adjustment taken in the fourth quarter of 2024 with no comparable adjustment in the current year quarter. The adjustment for the fourth quarter of 2024 was driven by the reduction of an expected payout of earnouts associated with a technology acquisition and one of our previous brokerage acquisitions, as both were no longer expected to achieve specific long-term performance hurdles because of the sharp declines in transaction volumes in 2023 and 2024.</li><li>The decrease in adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to the decrease in income before taxes, coupled with an increase in personnel expenses, partially offset by increases in origination fees and property sales broker fees.</li></ul><table

RESULTS</span>:</b></p><p><i>The Servicing &amp; Asset Management segment includes loan servicing, principal lending and investing, management of third-party capital invested in tax credit equity funds focused on the affordable housing sector and other commercial real estate, and real estate-related investment banking and advisory services.</i></p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>The <money><money>$8.7 billion</money></money> net increase in the servicing portfolio over the past 12 months was the principal driver of the growth in servicing fees year over year.</li><li>Investment management fees increased primarily due to an increase in investment management fees from our LIHTC operations, due to higher asset dispositions in the fourth quarter of 2025. Our LIHTC business recognizes asset management fees through cash flows from its underlying property level investments and the sale, or realization, of those property level investments.</li><li>The primary driver in the decrease in placement fees was a decline in the placement fee rates on escrow deposits as a result of the lower short-term interest rate environment in 2025 compared to 2024, combined with a decrease in the average replacement reserve escrow balance period over period.</li><li>During the fourth quarter of 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell a portfolio of affordable assets, including some of the assets, which we have operated since the acquisition of Alliant in 2021. The sale of one of the assets closed in the fourth quarter of 2024, generating a gain on sale of <money><money>$26.5 million</money></money> included in other revenues for this segment, explaining the year over year decline in that line item. The remaining assets included in that sale were expected to close in 2025 upon receipt of customary consents. Those consents are still in process, and that sale is now expected to close in the first half of 2026. However, intangible and other assets were written off in the fourth quarter of 2024 in connection with the agreement to sell the assets, explaining most of the decline in amortization and depreciation this year.</li><li>The change in fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities was primarily due to an <money><money>$8.2 million</money></money> contingent consideration revaluation in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to a <money><money>$10.8 million</money></money> revaluation in the fourth quarter of 2024, as the earnout targets for our LIHTC acquisition were not fully achieved.</li><li>The increase in indemnified and repurchased loan expenses was primarily driven by the repurchase requests as outlined in the Indemnified and Repurchased Loans section above.</li><li>The increase in asset impairments and other expenses was primarily driven by the asset impairments recorded in the fourth quarter of 2025 as outlined in the Key Performance Metrics section above.</li><li>Other operating expenses decreased largely due to a decrease in professional fees, driven by a decline in legal costs at one of our LIHTC subsidiaries.</li><li>The decrease in losses attributed to noncontrolling interests is the result of a change in the ownership of an entity producing losses in 2024. As part of a larger transaction with the noncontrolling interest holder, we regained full control of the entity at the end of 2024. The remaining noncontrolling interests in 2025 are immaterial.</li></ul><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl bwwidth100\"><tr><td class=\"bwrowaltcolor0 bwpadl0\"

Although our Agency debt financing volume grew significantly, the competitive environment in the multifamily debt financing market throughout 2025 resulted in a reduction in the origination fee rate for Agency originations and the overall origination fee rate, particularly for Freddie Mac originations. Additionally, we originated a large Fannie Mae portfolio during the second quarter of 2025, with no comparable activity in 2024, contributing to the decline in origination fee rates as large portfolios earn lower fee margins.</li><li>The increase in total expenses was primarily related to increases in personnel costs mostly due to (i) increased commission costs resulting from the growth in origination fees and property sales broker fees, (ii) increased salaries and benefits largely related to an increase in average segment headcount, and (iii) increased severance expense, resulting from the separation of several underperforming producers.</li><li>Net income, Diluted EPS and adjusted EBITDA for the Capital Markets segment have improved sequentially the last three years and represent a direct reflection of the steady improvement in overall Capital Markets transaction volumes. The increases in operating margin, adjusted EBITDA, and diluted EPS were largely the result of the increased total transaction volume year over year.</li></ul><table cellspacing=\"0\"

Our ideas and capital create communities where people live, work, shop, and play. Our innovative people, breadth of our brand, and our technological capabilities make us one of the most insightful and client-focused firms in the commercial real estate industry.</p><p><b>NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES</b></p><p>To supplement our financial statements presented in accordance with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location> generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company uses adjusted EBITDA, adjusted core net income, and adjusted core EPS, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. When analyzing our operating performance, readers should use adjusted EBITDA, adjusted core net income, and adjusted core EPS in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income and diluted EPS.</p><p>Adjusted core net income and adjusted core EPS represent net income adjusted for amortization and depreciation, provision (benefit) for credit losses, net write-offs based on the final resolution of the defaulted loans or collateral, the fair value of expected net cash flows from servicing, net, the income statement impact from periodic revaluation and accretion associated with contingent consideration liabilities related to acquired companies, goodwill impairment and other adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before income taxes, interest expense on our corporate debt, and amortization and depreciation, adjusted for provision (benefit) for credit losses, net write-offs based on the final resolution of the defaulted loans or collateral, loan repurchase losses, stock-based compensation, the fair value of expected net cash flows from servicing, net, the write-off of the unamortized balance of deferred issuance costs associated with the repayment of a portion of our corporate debt, goodwill impairment, and contingent consideration liability fair value adjustments when the fair value adjustment is a triggering event for a goodwill impairment assessment. Furthermore, adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use, as it does not reflect certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The amounts shown for adjusted EBITDA may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges that are used to determine compliance with financial covenants. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted core net income and adjusted core EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.</p><p>We use adjusted EBITDA, adjusted core net income, and adjusted core EPS to evaluate the operating performance of our business, for comparison with forecasts and strategic plans and for benchmarking performance externally against competitors. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial information, provide useful information to investors by offering:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>the ability to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s on-going operating results;</li><li>the ability to better identify trends in the Company’s underlying business and perform related trend analyses; and</li><li>a better understanding of how management plans and measures the Company’s underlying business.</li></ul><p>We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these non-GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial information. For more information on adjusted EBITDA, adjusted core net income, and adjusted core EPS, refer to the section of this press release below titled “Adjusted Financial Measure Reconciliation to GAAP” and “Adjusted Financial Measure Reconciliation to GAAP By Segment.”</p><p><b>FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS</b></p><p>Some of the statements contained in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, projections, plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.

The forward-looking statements contained in this press release reflect our current views about future events and are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that may cause actual results to differ significantly from those expressed or contemplated in any forward-looking statement.</p><p>While forward-looking statements reflect our good faith projections, assumptions and expectations, they are not guarantees of future results. Furthermore, we disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, data or methods, future events or other changes, except as required by applicable law. Factors that could cause our results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: (1) general economic conditions and multifamily and commercial real estate market conditions, (2) changes in interest rates, (3) regulatory and/or legislative changes to Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae or HUD, (4) our ability to retain and attract loan originators and other professionals, (5) success of our various investments funded with corporate capital, (6) changes in federal government fiscal and monetary policies, including any constraints or cuts in federal funds allocated to HUD for loan originations, and (7) our obligations to repurchase or indemnify the GSEs for loans we originate under their programs, including additional charges or losses related to loans we have already repurchased or indemnified and new repurchase requests we may receive from the GSEs related to the previously identified instances of borrower fraud, additional instances of borrower fraud, or other reasons.</p><p>For a further discussion of these and other factors that could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed or contemplated in any forward-looking statements, see the section titled “Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any updates or supplements in subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC.
