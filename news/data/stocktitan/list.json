The PAH enzyme is required for the metabolism of Phe, an essential amino acid found in most protein-containing foods. If functional enzyme is not present in sufficient quantities, Phe accumulates to abnormally high levels in the blood and becomes toxic to the brain, resulting in a variety of complications including severe intellectual disability, seizures, tremors, behavioral problems and psychiatric symptoms.</p><p>As a result of newborn screening efforts implemented in the 1960s and early 1970s, virtually all individuals with PKU born after this period in countries with newborn screening programs are diagnosed at birth and treatment is implemented soon after.</p><p>PKU can be managed with a severe Phe-restricted diet, supplemented by low-protein modified foods and Phe-free medical foods; however, it is difficult for most individuals to adhere to this strict diet to the extent needed to achieve adequate control of blood Phe levels. Dietary control of Phe in childhood can prevent major developmental issues and neurological consequences, but poor Phe control in adolescence and adulthood is associated with a range of neuropsychological deficits and functional impairment.</p><p><b>PALYNZIQ <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Indication and Important Safety Information</b></p><p>PALYNZIQ<sup>®</sup> (pegvaliase-pqpz) is a phenylalanine (Phe)-metabolizing enzyme indicated to reduce blood Phe concentrations in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with phenylketonuria (PKU) who have uncontrolled blood Phe concentrations greater than 600 micromol/L (10 mg/dL) on existing management.</p><p><b>BOXED WARNING: ANAPHYLAXIS</b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>Anaphylaxis has been reported after administration of PALYNZIQ and may occur at any time during treatment.</li><li>Administer the initial dose of PALYNZIQ under the supervision of a healthcare provider equipped to manage anaphylaxis, and closely observe patients for at least 60 minutes following injection.

(TSXV:EMPR)(OTCQX:EMPYF) (\"<strong>Empress</strong>\" or the \"<strong>Company</strong>\") is pleased to announce its audited financial and operating results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2025. The Company concluded the year with record-breaking revenue.</p><p><i>\"2025 was a transformational year for Empress, we doubled revenue, generated strong cash flow, and strengthened our balance sheet,\" </i>stated Alexandra Woodyer Sherron<i>, </i>CEO and President of Empress Royalty<i>. \"We executed our strategy with discipline and focus, and our model delivered. With rising production and strong gold and silver prices, we enter 2026 from a position of strength - ready to redeploy capital with precision and continue building durable, value-accretive growth for our shareholders.\"</i></p><p><strong>Key Financial and Operating Highlights for the year ended December 31, 2025</strong></p><ul><li><p>Record Revenue: Empress generated royalty and streaming revenue of US<money>$17.2M</money>, resulting in a gross profit of US<money>$12.1M</money>.</p></li><li><p>Strong Cash Generation: The Company maintained its focus on liquidity, achieving positive operating cash flow of US<money>$3.7M</money>.</p></li><li><p>Substantial Earnings Growth: Empress reported a net income of US<money>$7.4M</money> for the year, representing a significant increase over the US<money>$1.0M</money> reported in fiscal year 2024.</p></li><li><p>Operational Efficiency: Adjusted EBITDA for the full year stood at US<money>$13.9M</money>, reflecting the high-margin nature of the Company's streaming and royalty interests.</p></li></ul><p>These annual results highlight the strength of the Company's portfolio and its commitment to building long-term, sustainable value through selective, high-quality investments.</p><p>The financial statements and accompanying management's discussion and analysis have been filed on <strong>Sedar+ </strong>(<a href=\"https://pr.report/j5hq\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.sedarplus.ca</a>) and are also available on the Company's website at <a href=\"https://pr.report/j5hr\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.empressroyalty.com</a>.</p><p>Empress provides the following guidance as part of its annual financial statement filing, reflecting management's current expectations for fiscal 2026 based on the performance of its existing royalty and streaming portfolio, information provided from operators, and prevailing market conditions.</p><p><strong>Key Guidance Metrics for Fiscal 2026</strong></p><p>Empress anticipates meaningful growth in its attributable production in 2026, supported by continued contributions from key assets with potential optimization initiatives and steady performance with its portfolio holdings. Guidance incorporates assumptions of stable or improving operator performance and no major disruptions, consistent with disclosure standards under NI 51-102 and, where applicable, National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") for technical information.</p><p><strong>Attributable Gold Equivalent Ounces (GEOs)</strong></p><p>As a royalty and streaming company focused on precious metals, the Company's performance is inherently tied to production volumes and metal prices, which are volatile; accordingly, emphasis is placed on attributable gold equivalent ounces (\"GEOs\") sales as a primary metric to reflect production exposure. For streams, guidance reflects GEOs that have been delivered from the operators of our assets. Our GEO deliveries may differ from operators' production based on timing of deliveries and due to recovery and payability factors. GEO sales may differ from GEO deliveries based on the timing of the sales. For royalties, GEO guidance reflects the timing of royalty payments or accruals.</p><p>Empress expects attributable GEOs of 7,045 to 7,430 for fiscal 2026. This range represents the Company's diversified exposure across gold and silver calculated using conservative conversion ratios based on assumed commodity prices of <money>$4,000</money>/oz gold and <money>$70</money>/oz silver. GEOs are emphasized as the core metric, as they directly reflect the underlying production from operators and reduce dependency on volatile spot prices for performance evaluation.</p><p><strong>Assumptions and Basis for Guidance</strong></p><p>The 2026 Guidance is based on public and non-public forecasts, other disclosure by the owners and operators of our assets, internal analysis of historical performance, and management's understanding of the underlying producing assets. Additionally, the Company may receive information from the owners and operators of the properties, which the Company is not permitted to disclose to the public pursuant to the underlying agreement.</p><p>Key assumptions include:</p><ul><li><p>Annual increases in revenue if metals prices continue to be in the range of <money>$4,000</money>oz gold and <money>$70</money>/oz silver, and/or operating improvements are made at the underlying assets, and/or additional assets are added to the stream and royalty portfolio;</p></li><li><p>Production estimates reliant on operator guidance under NI 43-101-compliant reports and other non-public technical information and no material production interruptions;</p></li><li><p>No major new acquisitions or divestitures beyond those already announced, though the Company continues to actively evaluate opportunities; and</p></li><li><p>Currency exchange rates and tax considerations consistent with current levels.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Sensitivity</strong></p><p>The success of the Company in 2025 was based on a small number of investments and a significant increasing trend in gold and silver prices. There is no guarantee that this trend will continue in 2026. Given the volatile nature of gold and silver markets, an increase or decrease in gold or silver prices could impact attributable GEO values and related revenue considerably.</p><p><strong>Risks and Uncertainties</strong></p><p>Achievement of this guidance is subject to various risks, including but not limited to commodity price volatility (a primary concern given the small number of investments), operator-specific challenges (e.g., production delays), geopolitical factors, and environmental considerations. These could result in actual GEOs and revenues varying from the provided guidance, potentially materially. Investors should refer to the cautionary statements contained at the end of this news release, and the full discussion of risks in the Company's 2025 Annual Information Form filed on <a href=\"https://pr.report/j5hs\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.sedarplus.ca</a>.</p><p><strong>Conclusion and Updates</strong></p><p>Empress continues to implement its stated strategy of building a diversified, cash-flowing portfolio to deliver sustainable value to shareholders. The Company will review and update this outlook quarterly or as material events occur, such as new acquisitions, significant operator announcements, or commodity price shifts. Management remains focused on disciplined growth and capital allocation in the streaming and royalty sector.</p><p><strong>ABOUT EMPRESS ROYALTY CORP.</strong></p><p>Empress is a global royalty and streaming creation company providing investors with a diversified portfolio of gold and silver investments.

PAUL, Minn.</location></span>, <span class=\"legendSpanClass\">Feb. 27, 2026</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Today, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.stpaul\">St. Paul</location>-based AgriBank announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2025, with strong profitability, credit quality, and liquidity and capital.</p><div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1\"><p><a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/396773/AgriBank_Logo.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"AgriBank (PRNewsfoto/AgriBank)\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/396773/AgriBank_Logo.jpg\" title=\"AgriBank (PRNewsfoto/AgriBank)\"/></a></p></div><p><b>Highlights:</b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li><b>Profitability: </b>Net income remained strong at <money><money>$1</money></money>.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2025. AgriBank's year-to-date return on assets (ROA) ratio of 52 basis points was slightly above the target of 50 basis points.</li><li><b>Credit quality: </b>Total loan portfolio credit quality remained strong, with 99.2 percent of loans classified as acceptable at December 31, 2025.</li><li><b>Liquidity and capital: </b>End-of-the-quarter liquidity was 147 days, well above the regulatory requirement. Capital also remained well above the regulatory minimums and company targets.</li></ul><p>\"AgriBank delivered another year of strong financial results in 2025, reflecting disciplined growth, prudent balance‑sheet management, and the underlying strength of our District,\" said AgriBank CEO Jeffrey Swanhorst. \"Higher net interest income was driven by favorable retail loan spreads and increased wholesale loan volume, while credit quality, capital, and liquidity remained strong. Together, these factors position AgriBank to continue providing reliable funding and financial solutions to our Farm Credit Association‑owners as they support farmers, ranchers, and rural communities through challenging economic and market conditions.\"</p><p><b>2025</b><b> Results of Operations</b></p><p>Net interest income was <money><money>$1.2 billion</money></money> for the year ended December 31, 2025, an increase of <money><money>$143.8 million</money></money>, or 13.5 percent, compared to the same period of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher spread income on retail loans in AgriBank's asset pool portfolio and on AgriBank's wholesale loan portfolio due to an increase in volume. These factors were somewhat offset by decreased spread income on investment securities due to the mix of investment securities. The benefit of equity financing in net interest income increased compared to the prior year, due to higher levels of equity partially offset by a decline in interest rates. Equity financing represents the benefit of non-interest bearing funding. With interest rates moving lower during the second half of 2025, opportunities were taken to call and refinance debt at lower levels. While some loans have followed this pattern, the repricing or conversion of loans has been slower, resulting in wider retail interest rate spreads.</p><p>Non-interest income was <money><money>$113.9 million</money></money> for the year ended December 31, 2025, an increase of <money><money>$5.0 million</money></money>, or 4.6 percent, compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily related to an increase in loan fees due to marginally higher conversion and commitment fees generating additional income during the year. The increase in non-interest income was partially offset by the reduction in mineral income related to lower oil prices.</p><p>Non-interest expense was <money><money>$235.9 million</money></money> for the year ended December 31, 2025, an increase of <money><money>$19</money></money>.1 million, or 8.8 percent, compared to the same period of the prior year. The increase was mainly due to dealer incentive expenses related to AgriBank's crop input financing portfolio. Loan servicing expense increased due to asset pool activity during 2025 and the second half of 2024. Additionally, contractor fees added to increased purchased services expense related to additional resources for technology projects during the year.</p><p><b>Loan Portfolio</b> </p><p>Total loans were <money><money>$177</money></money>.9 billion at December 31, 2025, an increase of <money><money>$13</money></money>.2 billion, or 8.0 percent, compared to December 31, 2024. This increase was primarily attributable to wholesale loan growth and increases in retail loans from expanded participation in asset pool programs.</p><p>AgriBank's credit quality reflects the overall financial strength of District Associations and their underlying portfolios of retail loans. AgriBank's portfolio was composed of 99.2 percent acceptable loans at December 31, 2025, compared to 99.4 percent at December 31, 2024. Loans classified as acceptable represent the highest-quality assets. The credit quality of AgriBank's retail loan portfolio decreased slightly to 94.9 percent classified as acceptable at December 31, 2025, compared to 95.7 percent acceptable at December 31, 2024.</p><p><b>Agricultural Conditions</b></p><p>On February 5, 2026, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS) released its initial forecast of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> aggregate farm income and financial conditions for 2026 and updated its 2025 forecast. The revised 2025 net farm income forecast of <money><money>$154.5 billion</money></money> represents a <money><money>$27.0 billion</money></money> increase from the 2024 level, up 21.2 percent, driven by increasing direct government payments and animal and animal product cash receipts, which more than offset rising expenses. When adjusting for inflation, the 2025 net farm income forecast is <money><money>$28.4 billion</money></money>, or 22.0 percent, above the 10-year average (2015-2024) net farm income in 2026 dollars. The initial 2026 net farm income projection of <money><money>$153.4 billion</money></money> represents a decrease of <money><money>$1.2 billion</money></money>, or 0.7 percent, from the revised 2025 net farm income forecast, and if realized, would be <money><money>$24.3 billion</money></money>, or 18.8 percent, above the 10-year average net farm income in 2026 dollars.</p><p>Many factors, including weather, trade, government and monetary policy, global agricultural production levels, and pathogenic outbreaks in livestock and poultry, may keep agriculture market volatility elevated. Implementation of cost-saving technologies, marketing methods, and risk management strategies will continue to cause a wide range of results among the respective agricultural producers.</p><p><b>Capital Resources</b> <b>and Liquidity</b></p><p>Total capital remained strong at <money><money>$10</money></money>.5 billion as of December 31, 2025, an increase of <money><money>$1</money></money>.0 billion compared to December 31, 2024. The increase was driven by AgriBank's strong net income and the issuance of capital stock, which were partially offset by cash patronage declared, consistent with AgriBank's capital plan. AgriBank exceeded all regulatory capital minimum requirements, including additional regulatory buffers.</p><p>Cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled <money><money>$25</money></money>.4 billion and <money><money>$25</money></money>.1 billion at December 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively. AgriBank's end-of-the-period liquidity position represented 147 days coverage of maturing debt obligations, which supports operational demands, and was well above the 90-day minimum established by AgriBank's regulator.</p><p><b>About AgriBank </b></p><p>AgriBank is part of the customer-owned, nationwide Farm Credit System.

These late-breaking data will be presented for the first time today during an oral abstract session at the 2026 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Genitourinary (GU) Cancers Symposium (abstract #LBA418) and are included in the official ASCO GU Press Program.</p><p>At the first pre-specified interim analysis (median follow-up of 28.4 months [range, 15.0-40.1 months]), KEYTRUDA plus WELIREG given in the adjuvant setting significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS), the study’s primary endpoint, reducing the risk of disease recurrence or death by <percent>28%</percent> (HR=0.72 [<percent>95%</percent> CI 0.59-0.87]; p=0.0003) compared to KEYTRUDA plus placebo. Median DFS was not reached in either arm; the estimated 24-month DFS rate was <percent>80.7%</percent> (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 77.7-83.2) for the KEYTRUDA plus WELIREG arm and was <percent>73.7%</percent> (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 70.6-76.6) for the KEYTRUDA plus placebo arm. As previously reported, the trial will continue to evaluate overall survival (OS), a key secondary endpoint.</p><p>“Approximately <percent>40%</percent> of patients with renal cell cancer may experience tumor growth after initial treatment. Results from LITESPARK-022 mark an important step forward for certain patients with renal cell cancer, showing a significant reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death compared to pembrolizumab alone,” said Dr. Toni K. Choueiri, director, Lank Center for Genitourinary Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Jerome and Nancy Kohlberg professor of medicine, Harvard Medical School. “The combination of pembrolizumab and belzutifan is the first ever regimen in the adjuvant setting for renal cell cancer to demonstrate an improvement in disease-free survival over pembrolizumab monotherapy, positioning this regimen to potentially reshape clinical practice.”</p><p>“LITESPARK-022 is a critical part of our comprehensive RCC clinical development program, and the Phase 3 results presented at ASCO GU underscore the importance of KEYTRUDA and WELIREG in helping to treat patients with certain types of renal cell carcinoma,” said Dr. M. Catherine Pietanza, vice president, Global Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories. “These findings represent the first positive Phase 3 data for WELIREG in earlier stages of disease, as well as the first positive Phase 3 results for a HIF‑2α inhibitor and immunotherapy combination, reinforcing our commitment to exploring novel treatment approaches to improve upon established treatment paradigms for patients in need.”</p><p>The safety profile of KEYTRUDA plus WELIREG was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies for both agents; no new safety signals were observed. Of patients enrolled, <percent>69.5%</percent> of those in the KEYTRUDA plus WELIREG arm and <percent>71.1%</percent> of those in the KEYTRUDA plus placebo arm completed the assigned treatment. Among treated patients, Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in <percent>52.1%</percent> of patients who received KEYTRUDA plus WELIREG and <percent>30.2%</percent> of patients who received KEYTRUDA plus placebo. The most common Grade ≥3 TEAEs were anemia (<percent>12.1%</percent> versus <percent>0.5%</percent>), increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (<percent>6.4%</percent> versus <percent>2.0%</percent>) and hypoxia (<percent>4.6%</percent> versus <percent>0%</percent>). Grade 5 treatment-emergent (<percent>1.1%</percent> versus <percent>1.2%</percent>) and treatment-related adverse events (<percent>0.3%</percent> versus <percent>0.3%</percent>) were similar between treatment arms.</p><p>Based on data from the LITESPARK-022 trial, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for priority review supplemental applications seeking approval of WELIREG in combination with KEYTRUDA or KEYTRUDA QLEX™ (pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa-pmph) for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with RCC with a clear cell component with increased risk of recurrence following nephrectomy. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action date, of June 19, 2026 for the WELIREG sNDA and the KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX sBLAs.

In 2022, there were about 435,000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and approximately 156,000 deaths from the disease worldwide. Renal cell carcinoma is about twice as common in men as in women. Most cases of RCC are discovered incidentally during imaging tests for other abdominal diseases. Approximately <percent>30%</percent> of patients with kidney cancer are diagnosed at an advanced stage.</p><p><b>About Merck’s early-stage cancer clinical program</b></p><p>Finding cancer at an earlier stage may give patients a greater chance of long-term survival. Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease. Building on the strong understanding of the role of KEYTRUDA in later-stage cancers, Merck is evaluating our portfolio of medicines and pipeline candidates in earlier disease states, with more than 30 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer.</p><p><b>About Merck’s research in genitourinary cancers</b></p><p>Merck is advancing research aimed at helping transform the treatment landscape and broaden options for people with genitourinary (GU) cancers, including bladder, kidney and prostate cancers. Globally, GU cancers account for an estimated 2.6 million new cancer diagnoses each year, equaling over 1 in 8 of all cancer incidences. Through a robust clinical development program with more than 50 ongoing clinical trials evaluating more than 22,000 patients around the world, Merck is investigating the potential of several portfolio medicines and pipeline assets, leveraging multiple novel combination strategies, across various stages of disease, to help address unmet needs in GU cancers.</p><p><b>About WELIREG<sup>®</sup> (belzutifan) 40 mg tablets, for oral use</b></p><p>WELIREG, Merck’s first-in-class hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF-2α) inhibitor, is an orally administered small-molecule designed to reduce transcription and expression of HIF-2α target genes associated with cellular proliferation, angiogenesis and tumor growth. By inhibiting HIF-2α signaling, WELIREG aims to disrupt key pathways certain tumors may use to adapt to low-oxygen conditions, including those that help promote abnormal blood vessel formation and support tumor survival.</p><p>WELIREG has received regulatory approvals in patients with certain von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated tumors, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and in pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma (PPGL). As part of a broader clinical program, Merck continues to research WELIREG monotherapy and combination approaches for people with RCC and selected solid tumors across a range of treatment settings, to further define where HIF-2a inhibition may provide clinical benefit.</p><p><b>WELIREG<sup>®</sup> (belzutifan) Indications in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location></b></p><p><i>Certain von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated tumors</i></p><p>WELIREG is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease who require therapy for associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET), not requiring immediate surgery.</p><p><i>Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)</i></p><p>WELIREG is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with a clear cell component following a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor and a vascular endothelial growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGF-TKI).</p><p><i>Pheochromocytoma or Paraganglioma (PPGL)</i></p><p>WELIREG is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma (PPGL).</p><p><b>Selected Safety Information for WELIREG</b></p><p><b><i>Warning: Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</i></b></p><p>Exposure to WELIREG during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm.

KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD- L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.</p><p>Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.</p><p><b>About KEYTRUDA QLEX™ (pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa-pmph) injection for subcutaneous use</b></p><p>KEYTRUDA QLEX is a fixed-combination drug product of pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa. Pembrolizumab is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) blocking antibody and berahyaluronidase alfa enhances dispersion and permeability to enable subcutaneous administration of pembrolizumab. KEYTRUDA QLEX is administered as a subcutaneous injection into the thigh or abdomen, avoiding the 5 cm area around the navel, over one minute every three weeks (2.4 mL) or over two minutes every six weeks (4.8 mL).</p><p><b>Selected KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab) Indications in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location></b></p><p><i>Renal Cell Carcinoma</i></p><p>KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX are each indicated, in combination with axitinib, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).</p><p>KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX are each indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) at intermediate high or high risk of recurrence following nephrectomy, or following nephrectomy and resection of metastatic lesions.</p><p><i>See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> after the Selected Important Safety Information.</i></p><p><b>Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX</b></p><p><b>Contraindications</b></p><p>KEYTRUDA QLEX is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to berahyaluronidase alfa, hyaluronidase or to any of its excipients.</p><p><b>Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b></p><p>KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX are monoclonal antibodies that belong to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.</p><p>Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA or KEYTRUDA QLEX in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.</p><p>Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX require interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month.

Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.</p><p><b>Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma</b></p><p>In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.</p><p><b>Embryofetal Toxicity</b></p><p>Based on their mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX can each cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA or KEYTRUDA QLEX and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.</p><p><b>Adverse Reactions</b></p><p>In study MK-3475A-D77, when KEYTRUDA QLEX was administered with chemotherapy in metastatic non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), serious adverse reactions occurred in <percent>39%</percent> of patients.

These data are being presented as a late-breaking oral abstract at the 2026 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Genitourinary (GU) Cancers Symposium (abstract #LBA417) and are included in the official ASCO GU Press Program.</p><p>At a pre-specified interim analysis with a median follow-up of 29.0 months (range, 19.3-49.2), WELIREG plus LENVIMA demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS), reducing the risk of disease progression or death by <percent>30%</percent> (HR=0.70 [<percent>95%</percent> CI, 0.59-0.84]; p=0.00007) compared to cabozantinib. For WELIREG plus LENVIMA, the median PFS was 14.8 months (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 11.2-16.6) versus 10.7 months (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 9.2-11.1) for cabozantinib. A trend toward improvement in overall survival (OS), the trial’s other primary endpoint, was also observed for WELIREG plus LENVIMA (HR=0.85 [<percent>95%</percent> CI, 0.68-1.05]; p=0.06075). The median OS was 34.9 months (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 27.5-NR) for WELIREG plus LENVIMA versus 27.6 months (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 24.0-31.4) for cabozantinib. The trial is continuing, and OS will be evaluated at a subsequent analysis per the clinical trial protocol.</p><p>Based on data from the LITESPARK-011 trial, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted two supplemental New Drug Applications (sNDA) for review seeking approval for WELIREG plus LENVIMA for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC with a clear cell component following a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. The FDA set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action date, of October 4, 2026 for both the WELIREG and LENVIMA sNDAs.

These findings mark a critical step forward for these patients.”</p><p>“The LITESPARK-011 trial highlights the potential of this first-of-its-kind combination regimen to deliver a meaningful benefit for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma whose disease progresses after PD-1/L1 therapy,” said Dr. M. Catherine Pietanza, Vice President, Global Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories. “These WELIREG plus LENVIMA data demonstrate important progress for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and reinforce our commitment to improving the lives of patients through innovative treatment strategies.”</p><p>“The LITESPARK-011 results reinforce LENVIMA's established role in renal cell carcinoma and highlight the potential of this novel combination to address an area of significant unmet need,” said Dr. Corina Dutcus, Senior Vice President, Oncology Global Clinical Development Lead at Eisai. “The acceptance of this regulatory filing is an important milestone, and we remain committed to working toward approval to bring this option to patients as soon as possible. We are grateful to the patients, their families, and the investigators, whose dedication made this research possible.”</p><p><b>Additional findings</b></p><p>Data for objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR), two key secondary endpoints, were also reported.

In 2022, there were about 435,000 new cases of kidney cancer and approximately 156,000 deaths from the disease worldwide. RCC is about twice as common in men as in women. Most cases of RCC are discovered incidentally during imaging tests for other abdominal diseases. Approximately <percent>30%</percent> of patients with kidney cancer are diagnosed at an advanced stage.</p><p><b>About Merck’s research in genitourinary cancers</b></p><p>Merck is advancing research aimed at helping transform the treatment landscape and broaden options for people with genitourinary (GU) cancers, including bladder, kidney and prostate cancers. Globally, GU cancers account for an estimated 2.6 million new cancer diagnoses each year, equaling over 1 in 8 of all cancer incidences. Through a robust clinical development program with more than 50 ongoing clinical trials evaluating more than 22,000 patients around the world, Merck is investigating the potential of several portfolio medicines and pipeline assets, leveraging multiple novel combination strategies, across various stages of disease, to help address unmet needs in GU cancers.</p><p><b>About WELIREG<sup>®</sup> (belzutifan) 40 mg tablets, for oral use</b></p><p>WELIREG, Merck’s first-in-class hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF-2α) inhibitor, is an orally administered small-molecule designed to reduce transcription and expression of HIF-2α target genes associated with cellular proliferation, angiogenesis and tumor growth. By inhibiting HIF-2α signaling, WELIREG aims to disrupt key pathways certain tumors may use to adapt to low-oxygen conditions, including those that help promote abnormal blood vessel formation and support tumor survival.</p><p>WELIREG has demonstrated antitumor activity in certain von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated tumors, renal cell carcinoma and in pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. As part of a broader clinical program, Merck continues to research WELIREG monotherapy and combination approaches for people with genitourinary, breast and gynecologic cancers across a range of treatment settings to further define where HIF-2α inhibition may provide clinical benefit and to better understand which patients are most likely to respond.</p><p><b>Indications in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location></b></p><p><i>Certain von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated tumors</i></p><p>WELIREG is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease who require therapy for associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET), not requiring immediate surgery.</p><p><i>Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)</i></p><p>WELIREG is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with a clear cell component following a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor and a vascular endothelial growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGF-TKI).</p><p><i>Pheochromocytoma or Paraganglioma (PPGL)</i></p><p>WELIREG is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma (PPGL).</p><p><b>Selected Safety Information for WELIREG</b></p><p><b><i>Warning: Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</i></b></p><p>Exposure to WELIREG during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm.

LENVIMA inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1-4, the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, LENVIMA decreased tumor-associated macrophages, increased activated cytotoxic T cells, and demonstrated greater antitumor activity in combination with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody compared to either treatment alone. The combination of LENVIMA and everolimus showed increased antiangiogenic and antitumor activity as demonstrated by decreased human endothelial cell proliferation, tube formation, and VEGF signaling in vitro and tumor volume in mouse xenograft models of human renal cell cancer greater than each drug alone.</p><p><b>LENVIMA<sup>®</sup> (lenvatinib) Indications in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location></b></p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>For the treatment of adult patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).</li><li>In combination with pembrolizumab, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).</li><li>In combination with everolimus, for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following one prior anti-angiogenic therapy.</li><li>For the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).</li><li>In combination with pembrolizumab, for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) or not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.</li></ul><p><b>Selected Safety Information for LENVIMA</b></p><p><b>Warnings and Precautions</b></p><p><b>Hypertension. </b>In differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), hypertension occurred in <percent>73%</percent> of patients on LENVIMA (<percent>44%</percent> grade 3-4).

Serious tumor-related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in LENVIMA-treated patients in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. In postmarketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than other tumors. Safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials.</p><p>Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.</p><p><b>Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression/Thyroid Dysfunction. </b>LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression.

In patients with normal or low TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in <percent>70%</percent> of LENVIMA-treated patients in HCC and <percent>60%</percent> of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients in RCC.</p><p>Monitor thyroid function prior to initiation and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice.</p><p><b>Impaired Wound Healing. </b>Impaired wound healing has been reported in patients who received LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.</p><p><b>Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ).</b> ONJ has been reported in patients receiving LENVIMA. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, dental disease or invasive dental procedures, may increase the risk of ONJ.</p><p>Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with LENVIMA and periodically during LENVIMA treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices and to consider having preventive dentistry performed prior to treatment with LENVIMA and throughout treatment with LENVIMA.</p><p>Avoid invasive dental procedures, if possible, while on LENVIMA treatment, particularly in patients at higher risk. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ.</p><p>Withhold LENVIMA if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgement of adequate resolution.</p><p><b>Embryo‐Fetal Toxicity. </b>Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of LENVIMA during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus; and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for 30 days after the last dose.</p><p><b>Adverse Reactions</b></p><p>In DTC, the most common adverse reactions (≥<percent>30%</percent>) observed in LENVIMA-treated patients were hypertension (<percent>73%</percent>), fatigue (<percent>67%</percent>), diarrhea (<percent>67%</percent>), arthralgia/myalgia (<percent>62%</percent>), decreased appetite (<percent>54%</percent>), decreased weight (<percent>51%</percent>), nausea (<percent>47%</percent>), stomatitis (<percent>41%</percent>), headache (<percent>38%</percent>), vomiting (<percent>36%</percent>), proteinuria (<percent>34%</percent>), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (<percent>32%</percent>), abdominal pain (<percent>31%</percent>), and dysphonia (<percent>31%</percent>).

In November 2025, we began to see early signs of an improved supply-demand balance, driven by stronger-than-expected demand from energy storage systems (ESS), as well as certain supply disruptions. This led to a tighter market environment and a shift in pricing trends. We continue to observe solid demand fundamentals, and we estimate that the lithium market could grow by approximately <percent>25%</percent> this year, led by electric vehicles (EVs) and ESS.”</p> <p align=\"justify\">Mr. Ramos continued: At Nova Andino Litio, we are operating at full capacity to meet our customer commitments while continuing to advance our expansion plans in the Salar de Atacama. In parallel, we are increasing refinery of lithium carbonate from lithium sulfate in China through tolling agreements.”</p> <p align=\"justify\">He added: “In Australia, we are also operating at full capacity in the production of spodumene concentrate. In January of this year, we celebrated our first shipment of lithium hydroxide produced in Australia at the Kwinana refinery. Notably, lithium hydroxide from Kwinana refinery has been certified under the International Lithium Association’s Life Cycle Assessment framework, demonstrating a <percent>37%</percent> lower emissions footprint compared to traditional hard-rock production refined in China.”</p> <p align=\"justify\">Mr Ramos continued: “Our Iodine and Plant Nutrition division delivered solid performance, particularly in iodine, which contributed approximately <percent>42%</percent> of SQM’s total gross profit.

(NASDAQ: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/MU/\" title=\"View MU stock overview\">MU</a>) today celebrated the grand opening of its semiconductor assembly and test facility in Sanand, Gujarat, India. The state-of-the-art facility converts advanced DRAM and NAND wafers from Micron's global manufacturing network into finished memory and storage products. Once fully ramped, the first phase of Micron’s Sanand operation will feature more than 500,000 square feet of cleanroom space, making it one of the world’s largest single-floor assembly and test cleanrooms. The site serves customers worldwide to meet the growing global demand for memory and storage fueled by AI.</p> <p>The facility represents a combined investment of approximately <money>$2.75 billion</money> by Micron and its government partners, advancing semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in India. Micron Chairman, President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra and other executives witnessed the opening ceremony with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister of Gujarat Bhupendra Patel, Union Minister for Railways, Communications, Electronics &amp; IT Ashwini Vaishnaw, U.S. Ambassador to India Sergio Gor and other distinguished government officials and guests.</p> <p>\"Today is a proud moment for Micron and India's growing semiconductor industry,\" said Sanjay Mehrotra, Chairman, President and CEO of Micron Technology. “This pioneering facility, the first assembly and test site of its kind in the country, helps build a resilient ecosystem that underpins the global AI economy. We are deeply grateful to the government of India, the Gujarat government and all of the partners involved for their steadfast support in making this achievement possible.\"</p> <p>The Sanand site is ISO 9001:2015 certified and has begun commercial production. To mark the grand opening of the site, Micron presented its first shipment of made-in-India memory modules to Dell Technologies for its laptops made in India for India. Micron expects to assemble and test tens of millions of chips at Sanand in 2026, scaling to hundreds of millions in 2027. The expansion of conventional assembly and test operations in India complements Micron's planned development of advanced manufacturing and packaging capabilities in the United States and strengthens the company’s global assembly and test network.</p> <p>“The inauguration of Micron’s semiconductor facility in Sanand marks a historic milestone as Bharat begins its first commercial semiconductor chip production,” said Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. “This is a decisive step towards building a trusted, resilient and self-reliant semiconductor ecosystem under the leadership of Hon’ble PM Shri Narendra Modi Ji.
