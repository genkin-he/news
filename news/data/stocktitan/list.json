Although Stillwater Critical Minerals believes the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on a number of material factors and assumptions. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements include failure to obtain necessary approvals, unsuccessful exploration results, changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined, results of future resource estimates, future metal prices, availability of capital and financing on acceptable terms, general economic, market or business conditions, risks associated with regulatory changes, defects in title, availability of personnel, materials and equipment on a timely basis, accidents or equipment breakdowns, uninsured risks, delays in receiving government approvals, unanticipated environmental impacts on operations and costs to remedy same, and other exploration or other risks detailed herein and from time to time in the filings made by the companies with securities regulators.

Importantly, absent a one-time, non-cash charge related to stock-based compensation for employees, the Company would have more than doubled its profitability compared to fiscal 2024.</p><p>During fiscal 2025, in addition to our sales directly with customers, we continued to strengthen our distribution sales channel and sales through subcontractors who manufacture on behalf of our customers. By deepening these channels, we effectively open the door to a broad base of end customers. Challenge Electronics has developed numerous new products that will be introduced through its newly formed distribution sales channel, reinforcing our commitment to innovation and long-term growth.</p><p>We are also actively expanding our global reach. The Surge division’s European sales operation is performing quite well, and we are optimistic about continued growth in that market in fiscal 2026. At the same time, our Challenge Electronics sales division is establishing a sales presence in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/eur\">Europe</location>.</p><p>We are also positioning the Company to participate in sales to high-growth markets. During the year, we initiated efforts to explore opportunities within the AI ecosystem, targeting potential customers whose applications require the types of electronic components we supply.</p><p>Lastly, in response to geopolitical considerations, many customers across the industry have requested production capabilities outside of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>. As a result, several of our manufacturing partners have established secondary facilities outside of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>.</p><p>We believe our strategic initiatives, combined with our strong financial performance, position us well for continued growth and value creation in the year ahead.”</p><p><b>Results of Operations for the fiscal year Ended November 30, 2025</b></p><p>Consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2025 increased by <money><money>$5,108,966</money></money> or <percent>16.4%</percent>, to <money><money>$36,320,105</money></money> as compared to net sales of <money><money>$31,211,139</money></money> for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2024. We attribute the increase to an increase in business with new customers as well as an increase in business with existing customers. We can also attribute the increase to an increase in business from the Company’s distribution channels. Net sales for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2025 and November 30, 2024 reflect <money><money>$941,564</money></money> and <money><money>$549,564</money></money>, respectively of tariff costs that the Company was able to pass on to its customers.</p><p>Our gross profit for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2025 increased by <money><money>$1,551,477</money></money> to <money><money>$10,455,171</money></money> or <percent>17.4%</percent>, as compared to <money><money>$8,903,694</money></money> for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2024. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to <percent>28.8%</percent> for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2025 compared to <percent>28.5%</percent> for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2024. The increase can be attributed to the increase in sales to certain customers whose sales are at a higher gross profit margin. We work with electronic manufacturing service subcontractor customers who manufacture products for other customers who do not have their own manufacturing operations. The Company has agreements with these subcontractor customers to provide periodic cost reductions through rebates in the amount of <percent>5%</percent>. These reductions only affect future shipments of our products, and do not affect existing orders. These reductions can have a negative impact on our profit margins since they reduce the amount of commissions we can earn. Even though this rebate can impact the Company’s gross profit margin, these subcontractor customers represent very significant potential growth for the Company, because they can help the Company become an approved supplier at the customers they manufacture for, and they purchase our components for these customers. We believe it would be very difficult for the Company to achieve business at these customers without the help of these subcontractor customers. During Fiscal 2025, the Company was impacted by tariff costs on certain products imported from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>. The Company has been able to pass along a portion of these costs to its customers and will do so under potential tariffs imposed upon us. The Company has also moved some customer deliveries directly to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong</location> in order to mitigate some of these costs.</p><p>Selling and shipping expenses for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2025 was <money><money>$2,906,782</money></money>, an increase of <money><money>$166,788</money></money>, or <percent>6.1%</percent>, as compared to <money><money>$2,739,994</money></money> for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2024. We attribute the increase to increases in sales and the resulting selling expenses such as commission expenses, the hiring of new salespeople which increased sales payroll, travel and entertainment and auto expenses, offset by decreases in freight out and printing expenses.</p><p>General and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2025 was <money><money>$6,223,384</money></money>, an increase of <money><money>$1,034,015</money></money>, or <percent>19.9%</percent>, as compared to <money><money>$5,189,369</money></money> for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2025. The increase is due primarily to non cash stock based compensation of <money><money>$538,361</money></money> during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2025. As well as increases in officer salaries, other salaries and related payroll taxes, general insurance expenses as well as health insurance expenses, utilities and office expenses and professional fees, computer expenses and consulting expenses and pension expenses as well as increases in bank charges and bad debt expenses, offset by decreases in rent, directors fees and public company expenses.</p><p>This press release should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, which can be found at <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.surgecomponents.com&amp;esheet=54434606&amp;newsitemid=20260227271339&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.surgecomponents.com&amp;index=1&amp;md5=4a72cf161666d104ea7b8630c8f00a68\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">www.surgecomponents.com</a> and at <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&amp;esheet=54434606&amp;newsitemid=20260227271339&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.sec.gov&amp;index=2&amp;md5=fbc02cc877f943868f6b636e4226ff28\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">www.sec.gov</a>.</p><p><b>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements</b></p><p>This press release contains forward-looking statements.

During the summit's Make-a-Thon competitions, engineers will develop and present new software products designed to enhance company and hotel operations and guest experiences. Winning teams will earn cash prizes, with top innovations considered for company-wide deployment.</p><p>\"At its core, Mastery is about designing technical capabilities that will shape the next chapter of hospitality,\" said Brian Kirkland, Chief Information Officer, Choice Hotels International.  \"By engaging associates across the organization—not just engineers—we're unlocking new opportunities to apply AI and emerging technologies to real business challenges. That collective investment in talent and expertise is accelerating innovation across the Choice Hotels system and translating into dependable, practical tools that help franchisees operate more efficiently, make smarter decisions, and grow their businesses with confidence.\"</p><p>A winning project from last year's Mastery event demonstrated how emerging technologies can deliver tangible business impact. In 2025, Choice Hotels' technology organization faced a major initiative to modernize  Hotel Suite, a legacy, web‑based system used across the company's entire property portfolio. The effort focused on updating and reimagining a critical platform that had become increasingly complex to maintain and evolve. Initial estimates projected the Hotel Suite modernization would take more than a year using traditional development approaches. Instead, a cross‑functional engineering team applied lessons from Mastery 2025, leveraging generative AI and a \"vibe coding\" development approach to fully reimagine the application. The team not only dramatically accelerated the delivery, but also modernized the user interface and delivered the first business‑critical, end‑user‑facing application at Choice Hotels to reach production using an AI‑assisted development model — cutting timelines by months, and saving more than <money><money>$750,000</money></money> in projected investment.</p><p><b><i>History of Innovation</i></b><br/>Choice Hotels brings a decades-long legacy of innovation to the hospitality industry, from introducing the first hotel website with real-time rates and availability and launching the first hotel app for the iPhone, to creating the first mobile-friendly rate management tool for operators and fully migrating its platforms to the cloud. Through Mastery, that innovation is put into practice—leveraging technology to give owners tools that simplify operations, strengthen competitiveness, and allow them to focus on delivering great stays for guests.</p><p>Choice Hotels has built and introduced industry-first, owner-facing technologies, including:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>In 1995, Choice launched the first hotel website with real-time rate and availability information.</li><li>In 2003, Choice launched the first cloud-based property management system (PMS), choiceADVANTAGE.</li><li>In 2009, Choice released the first hotel app for iOS.</li><li>In 2014, Choice became the first hotel company to offer instant booking on TripAdvisor.
