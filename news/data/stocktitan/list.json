            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p> </p><p> <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">NEW YORK</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BlackRock Utilities, Infrastructure, &amp; Power Opportunities Trust (NYSE: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/BUI/\" title=\"View BUI stock overview\">BUI</a>) (the \"Fund\") today announced the terms of transferable rights (\"Rights\") to be issued to the holders of the Fund's common shares of beneficial interest (par value <money><money>$0.00</money>1</money> per share) (\"Shares\") as of March 9, 2026 (the \"Record Date\"). Holders of Rights will be entitled to subscribe for additional Shares (the \"Offer\") at a discount to the market price of the Shares.</p><p>After considering a number of factors, including potential benefits and costs, the Fund’s Board of Trustees (the “Board”) and the Fund's investment adviser, BlackRock Advisors, LLC (the \"Adviser\"), have determined that it is in the best interests of both the Fund and its shareholders to conduct the Offer and increase the assets of the Fund available to take advantage of existing and future investment opportunities that are consistent with the Fund’s investment objectives to provide total return and income through a combination of current income and long-term capital appreciation.</p><p><b>All expenses of the Offer will be borne by the Adviser, and not by the Fund or any of the Fund's shareholders.</b></p><p>The Adviser believes this is an attractive time to raise additional assets for the Fund based on several factors, including the following potential benefits:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li><b>Infrastructure: </b>Infrastructure<b> </b>sits at the intersection of three structural mega forces - the Artificial Intelligence buildout, national security priorities, and the transition to a lower carbon economy - creating sustained investment opportunities. Additionally, listed infrastructure valuations are attractive relative to history, providing a compelling entry point for new capital.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Utilities:</b> Utilities have a pressing need to raise significant capital. Rising power demand and reshoring of power supply chains are stressing existing grids and triggering the largest utility capex cycle in decades, and the Adviser believes the Fund is well-positioned to deploy capital into these opportunities.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Reward</b>: Rights provide shareholders with an opportunity to buy new shares below market price or potentially realize value from the sale of Rights.<br/><br/></li><li><b>No offering fees</b>: The Adviser, not the Fund, is paying for the expenses of the Offer.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Lower expense ratio</b>: The Offer is anticipated to spread fixed operating costs across a larger asset base.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Enhanced liquidity</b>: The Offer creates the potential for increased trading volume and liquidity of Shares.</li></ul><p><b>The Fund expects to maintain its current distribution level following the Offer.</b> Shares issued pursuant to the Offer will be entitled to receive the monthly distribution expected to be payable in April 2026, but will <span class=\"bwuline\">not</span> be eligible for the distribution payable in March 2026.</p><p>Certain key terms of the Offer include:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li><b>Rights ratio:</b> Holders of Shares on the Record Date (\"Record Date Shareholders\") will receive one Right for each outstanding Share owned on the Record Date. Rights entitle the holder to purchase one new Share for every 4 Rights exercised (1-for-4); however, any Record Date Shareholder who owns fewer than four Shares as of the Record Date will be entitled to subscribe for one Share. Fractional Shares will not be issued upon the exercise of Rights.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Pricing formula:</b> The subscription price per Share (the \"Subscription Price\") will be determined on the expiration date of the Offer, which is currently expected to be April 2, 2026, unless extended by the Fund (the \"Expiration Date\"), and will be equal to <percent>95%</percent> of the average of the last reported sales price per Share on the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") on the Expiration Date and each of the four (4) immediately preceding trading days provided that, if such price is equal to or above net asset value (“NAV”) at the Expiration Date, it shall be reduced to <money><money>$0.01</money></money> below NAV on the Expiration Date (the \"Formula Price\"). If, however, the Formula Price is less than <percent>95%</percent> of the Fund's NAV per Share at the close of trading on the NYSE on the Expiration Date, the Subscription Price will be <percent>95%</percent> of the Fund's NAV per Share at the close of trading on the NYSE on the Expiration Date. The Subscription Price will be determined by the Fund on the Expiration Date.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Over-subscription privilege:</b> Record Date Shareholders who fully exercise all Rights issued to them can subscribe, subject to certain limitations and allotment, for any additional Shares which were not subscribed for by other holders of Rights at the Subscription Price, provided that the Board may eliminate this over-subscription privilege. Investors who are not Record Date Shareholders but who otherwise acquire Rights in the secondary market are not entitled to participate in the over-subscription privilege. If sufficient Shares are available, all Record Date Shareholders' over-subscription requests will be honored in full. If these requests exceed available Shares, they will be allocated pro rata among those fully exercising Record Date Shareholders who over-subscribe based on the number of Rights originally issued to them by the Fund.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Transferable rights:</b> Rights are transferable and are expected to be admitted for trading on the NYSE under the symbol \"<a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/BUI/\" title=\"View BUI stock overview\">BUI</a> RT\" during the course of the Offer and will cease trading April 1, 2026, one trading day before the Expiration Date. During this time, Record Date Shareholders may choose to sell their Rights if they do not intend to subscribe for additional Shares.</li></ul><p>The Offer will be made only by means of a prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus. The Fund expects to mail subscription certificates evidencing the Rights and a copy of the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus for the Offer to Record Date Shareholders within <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> shortly following the Record Date. To exercise their Rights, shareholders who hold their Shares through a broker, custodian or trust company should contact such entity to forward their instructions to either exercise or sell their Rights on their behalf. Shareholders who do not hold Shares through a broker, custodian, or trust company should forward their instructions to either exercise or sell their Rights by completing the subscription certificate and delivering it to the subscription agent for the Offer, together with their payment, at one of the locations indicated on the subscription certificate or in the prospectus supplement.</p><p><b>The information in this press release is not complete and is subject to change.

Factors that could cause Sable’s actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements include: the ability to recommence sales of oil from the Santa Ynez Unit assets, including the potential implementation of an Offshore Storage and Treating Vessel (“OS&amp;T”) strategy, the cost and time required therefor, and production levels once recommenced; availability of future financing; global economic conditions and inflation; increased operating costs; lack of availability of drilling and production equipment, supplies, services and qualified personnel; geographical concentration of operations; environmental and weather risks; regulatory changes and uncertainties; litigation, complaints and/or adverse publicity; privacy and data protection laws, privacy or data breaches, or loss of data; our ability to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business; and other one-time events and other factors that can be found in Sable’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025, and any subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Current Report on Form 8-K, which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are available on Sable’s website (<a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sableoffshore.com&amp;esheet=54435591&amp;newsitemid=20260227076859&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.sableoffshore.com&amp;index=1&amp;md5=e0510f16d286392f50812ed2a3d0da67\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">www.sableoffshore.com</a>) and on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website (<a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&amp;esheet=54435591&amp;newsitemid=20260227076859&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.sec.gov&amp;index=2&amp;md5=ec73c3bfa3f3a6da298e9abcbb3d9cc5\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">www.sec.gov</a>).

Sable has not sold commercial quantities of hydrocarbons since acquisition of the Santa Ynez Unit. The Santa Ynez Unit was shut in during June of 2015 when the only onshore pipeline transporting hydrocarbons produced from the Santa Ynez Unit to market ceased transportation. Since the May 2025 production restart, the oil produced has been transported via pipeline to storage tanks onshore at Sable’s Las Flores Canyon processing facility where it is being stored pending resumed petroleum transportation through the Santa Ynez Pipeline System or an OS&amp;T vessel. There can be no assurance that the necessary approvals will be obtained that would allow the Company to recommence sales.</p><p><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20260227076859r1&amp;sid=acqr8&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en\" style=\"width:0;height:0\"/><span class=\"bwct31415\"></span></p><p id=\"mmgallerylink\"><span id=\"mmgallerylink-phrase\">View source version on businesswire.com: </span><span id=\"mmgallerylink-link\"><a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260227076859/en/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260227076859/en/</a></span></p><p>Investor Contact:<br/>Harrison Breaud<br/>Vice President, Finance &amp; Investor Relations<br/><a href=\"mailto:IR@sableoffshore.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">IR@sableoffshore.com</a><br/>713-579-8111</p><p>Source: Sable Offshore Corp.</p></article>",

Shareholders should be aware that a fund trading at a premium to net asset value may not be sustainable and a fund's discount to net asset value, can widen as well as narrow.   Shareholders of a fund trading at a premium who participate in that fund's dividend reinvestment plan should note the reinvestment of distributions may occur at a premium to net asset value.  </b></p><p>While NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund's investment performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund. The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market.</p><p>Pursuant to an exemptive order granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Funds may distribute any long-term capital gains more frequently than the limits provided in Section 19(b) under the 1940 Act and Rule 19b-1 thereunder. Therefore, distributions paid by the Funds during the year may include net income, short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains and/or a return of capital. Net income dividends and short-term capital gain dividends, while generally taxable at ordinary income rates, may be eligible, to the extent of qualified dividend income earned by the Funds, to be taxed at a lower rate not to exceed the maximum rate applicable to your long-term capital gains. Distributions made in any calendar year in excess of investment company taxable income and net capital gain are treated as taxable ordinary dividends to the extent of undistributed earnings and profits, and then as a return of capital that reduces the adjusted basis in the shares held. To the extent return of capital distributions exceed the adjusted basis in the shares held, capital gain is recognized with a holding period based on the period the shares have been held at the date such amount is received.</p><p>The payment of distributions in accordance with the Distribution Policy may result in a decrease in the Fund's net assets. A decrease in the Fund's net assets may cause an increase in the Fund's annual operating expense ratio and a decrease in the Fund's market price per share to the extent the market price correlates closely to the Fund's net asset value per share. The Distribution Policy may also negatively affect the Fund's investment activities to the extent that the Fund is required to hold larger cash positions than it typically would hold or to the extent that the Fund must liquidate securities that it would not have sold, for the purpose of paying the distribution. Each Fund's Board has the right to amend, suspend or terminate the Distribution Policy at any time. The amendment, suspension or termination of the Distribution Policy may affect the Fund's market price per share. Investors should consult their tax advisor regarding federal, state, and local tax considerations that may be applicable in their particular circumstances.</p><p><u>Circular 230 disclosure</u>:  To ensure compliance with requirements imposed by the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Treasury, we inform you that any <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> tax advice contained in this communication (including any attachments) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of (i) avoiding penalties under the Internal Revenue Code or (ii) promoting, marketing or recommending to another party any transaction or matter addressed herein.</p><p>Aberdeen Investments Global is the trade name of Aberdeen's investments business, herein referred to as \"Aberdeen Investments\" or \"Aberdeen\".

This underground mine became the primary producer of gallium and germanium in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> when Musto Explorations Ltd. brought it into production in the mid 1980's and again with Hecla Mining Company in the 1990's. During its peak year of operations, Apex produced 10,270 tons yielding 1,645 lb Ga, 5,634 lbs of Ge, and 224,800 lbs of Cu.</p><p>Hecla completed a feasibility study in 1989, reporting a reserve of 230,200 tons of <percent>0.100%</percent> Ge, <percent>0.046%</percent> Ga and <percent>1.6%</percent> Cu.  A historical reserve estimate<sup>1</sup> by Ken Krahulec in 2018 estimated 1 MT @ <percent>0.087%</percent> Ge, <percent>0.033%</percent> Ga, <percent>1.8%</percent> Cu and 41 g/t Ag. The Ge and Ga are 10-100x higher grade than most Ge and Ga deposits, with in-situ value per ton similar to 0.5 oz/T gold ores. Beyond the historical reserves, Hecla also identified several additional breccia bodies as prospective exploration targets, including the Paymaster, Cavern, and 500 North pipes, along with further oxide zones in the immediate mine area. </p><p><sup>1</sup>As at the date of this news release, a qualified person has not completed sufficient work to classify the historical estimates above as current mineral resources or mineral reserves in accordance with NI 43-101 and Blue Moon is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. In order to verify the historical estimates, the Company needs to engage a qualified person to review the historical data, review any work completed on the property since and complete a new technical report. Blue Moon views this historical data as an indicator of the potential size and grade of the mineralized deposits, and this data is relevant to Company's future plans with respect to the property.</p><p>Subject to renewed permits and with the intent to reopen the mine, the Company plans to fast track efforts to advance the technical studies, metallurgical testing, process flowsheets, permitting and community engagement to support a final investment decision. In parallel, Blue Moon is evaluating options for a new processing line at the Company's Springer complex to process the Apex material and provide an integrated United States Ge and Ga value chain.</p><div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1637\"><p><a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2922419/Blue_Moon_Metals_Blue_Moon_to_Acquire_the_Apex_Germanium_and_Gal.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Figure 4: Location of Apex Project; 23 km from St. George, Utah (CNW Group/Blue Moon Metals)\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2922419/Blue_Moon_Metals_Blue_Moon_to_Acquire_the_Apex_Germanium_and_Gal.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4: Location of Apex Project; 23 km from St. George, Utah (CNW Group/Blue Moon Metals)\"/></a></p></div><p><b>Springer Complex, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nv\">Nevada</location> (Multi-commodity Processing Hub)</b></p><p>The Springer property is located on the east flank of the Eugene Mountains, approximately 25 miles southwest of the city of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nv.wincca\">Winnemucca</location>, and 125 miles northeast of the city of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nv.reno\">Reno</location>, in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nv.pering\">Pershing County, Nevada</location>. The mine site is approximately 8 miles from Interstate 80, serviced by paved/gravel road, over owned land. The Springer tungsten milling facility is located entirely on private fee lands.</p><p>Springer is a former tungsten production facility consisting of a 1,360-ft vertical shaft and underground workings, a 1,200 ton per day mill with automated rod/ball mill grinding and flotation circuits, plus all water rights, and most permits necessary for operation of the facility.</p><p>The Springer tungsten property was the site of continuous underground tungsten mining between 1918 and 1958, much of that time controlled first by the Segerstrom family, and later by the Nevada-Massachusetts Mining Company (\"NMC\"). The General Electric Company (\"GE\") acquired the property in the 1970's, interested in securing long term tungsten supply assets to support its lighting and industrial tools businesses. The current mine and mill were constructed by Utah International Inc. (\"UII\", later became BHP Minerals Group) for GE in the mid 1970's, and was subsequently commissioned and operated by GE for 8 months in 1982. The property has not been actively mined since October 1982, and the underground workings are currently flooded to a depth of approximately 375 feet. EMC Metals Corp. acquired the Springer mine and associated properties from GE in 2006. Between that purchase date and today, considerable refurbishment and renewal has been undertaken to the mill, control systems, hoist house, and an up-rating of the mill throughput from a nominal 950 tpd to a current 1,350 tpd capacity, and an estimated 1,200 tpd throughput after availabilities (<percent>89%</percent>).</p><p>Centrally located with access to diverse mineral sources and existing road and rail infrastructure, the Springer Mine and Mill is well situated to become a regional metallurgical complex. With established tailings and water management systems, the brownfield site provides significant opportunities to reduce capital and permitting timelines compared to a greenfield development.</p><p>The Company purchased the site in February 2026 to provide processing capacity to support the development of the Blue Moon Mine and to establish a regional processing hub. Sitting on a large land package, Blue Moon believes there is significant room to expand the mill layout and add additional buildings to process multiple ore types and improve economies of scale to unlock and maximize the value of resources that would otherwise not support stand-alone processing facilities. Located only a few miles from both Interstate 80 and the Union Pacific rail line, the Springer complex is well connected to the transportation and logistics infrastructure to integrate with other operations, including Teck's Trail Operations.</p><p>The Company is presently advancing analysis and engineering to process the Blue Moon Mine material, including updating permitting requirements and changes required to the mill and tailings management system.</p><div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder5121\"><p><a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2922420/Blue_Moon_Metals_Blue_Moon_to_Acquire_the_Apex_Germanium_and_Gal.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Figure 5: The Springer Complex (CNW Group/Blue Moon Metals)\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2922420/Blue_Moon_Metals_Blue_Moon_to_Acquire_the_Apex_Germanium_and_Gal.jpg\" title=\"Figure 5: The Springer Complex (CNW Group/Blue Moon Metals)\"/></a></p></div><p><b>Springer Mine, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nv\">Nevada</location> (Tungsten)</b></p><p>Located on the larger Springer Complex, the Springer Mine as discussed above was one of the most important mines for US-sourced tungsten production.  A historic resource estimate was in place at the time of construction and ownership by GE/Utah International Inc.</p><p>A historical resource estimate of 10.7 MT at <percent>0.45%</percent> tungsten is based on data and reports prepared by the previous operators, General Electric and Utah International Inc in 1984.  The company has not completed the work necessary to have the historical estimate verified by a QP.
