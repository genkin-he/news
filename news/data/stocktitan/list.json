December 3, 2025, the day prior to Land and Buildings’ public presentation. Performance of the Proxy Peer Group Companies represents weighted average of Proxy Peer Group Companies in the 2025 Proxy Statement.</p></td></tr></table><p>FR has underperformed its proxy compensation peers by <percent>17%</percent> over the trailing four-year period and <percent>4%</percent> over the trailing three-year period. These are meaningful shortfalls against the very peer group selected by the Board’s Compensation Committee. Yet management continues to receive peer-level compensation for disappointing results. This is not a portfolio problem, FR’s same-store NOI and FFO growth have been comparable to Prologis and EastGroup. It is clear to us that FR’s underperformance is a governance and communication failure.</p><p>We strongly believe that a Board that has overseen this level of underperformance has no business resisting refreshment. Shockingly, no director has been added to the FR Board in the past five years. If the incumbent Board could not consistently deliver superior returns over 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, why should shareholders trust them to realize the ~<percent>20%</percent> upside to NAV going forward and close the valuation discount to its closest peers?</p><p><b>Steps to Generate Value<br/></b>We urge the Board to take the following actions immediately:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Publicly commit to a plan to close the NAV discount with specific milestones and timelines.</li><li>Initiate a <money>$500M</money>–<money>$1B</money> asset disposition program with proceeds returned to shareholders.</li><li>Schedule an investor day with property tours within 90 days.</li><li>Authorize a formal exploration of strategic alternatives if the discount does not narrow within six months.</li><li>Immediately refresh the Board: Mr. Dominski and Mr. Hackett should not stand for re-election, and their seats, along with the vacancy created following Mr. Rau’s passing, must be filled with directors experienced in capital allocation and REIT value creation.</li></ul><p>Constructive engagement requires a willing partner and to date, we have not found one in FR. Our preference would be to work together with FR to realize value for all shareholders. However, based on FR’s track record, we believe that we need to keep open all options available to us as shareholders – which is why Land &amp; Buildings has nominated me, Jonathan Litt, as a director candidate for election to the Board at the Company’s 2026 annual meeting of shareholders.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Jonathan Litt<br/>Land &amp; Buildings Investment Management, LLC</p><p class=\"bwalignc\"><b>CERTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING THE PARTICIPANTS</b></p><p>Land &amp; Buildings intends to file a preliminary proxy statement and accompanying universal proxy card with the SEC to be used to solicit votes for the election of its director nominee at the 2026 annual meeting of shareholders of First Industrial.</p><p>LAND &amp; BUILDINGS STRONGLY ADVISES ALL SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT AND OTHER PROXY MATERIALS AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Ottawa, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - February 26, 2026) - <b>Stria Lithium Inc. (TSXV: SRA) </b>(\" <b>Stria </b>\" or the \" <b>Company </b>\") announced today the closing of its non-brokered private placement (the \" Offering \") previously announced on February 13, 2026 and February 25, 2026, and raised <money>$1,000,000</money> gross proceeds. The Company issued 2,127,659 Units at a price of <money>$0.47</money> per Unit. Each Unit is composed of one common share of the Company and one common share purchase warrant (the \"Warrant\"). Each Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one common share of the Company at a price of <money>$0.59</money> per share for a period of 36 months following the closing of the private placement, 26 February 2029.</p><p>The proceeds of the Financing will be used for advancement of the Company's mineral exploration assets and operations, potential future acquisitions, and general working capital purposes. No finder fees were paid in relation to the private placement and no insiders participated in the equity financing. </p><p>All securities issued pursuant to the Financing will be subject to a statutory hold period of four months and one day from the date of issuance in accordance with applicable securities laws and TSXV policies.</p><p><b>About Stria Lithium</b></p><p>Stria Lithium (TSXV: SRA) is an emerging resource exploration company developing Canadian lithium reserves to meet legislated demand for electric vehicles and their rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. The Company is committed to growth through responsible and efficient exploration and development of its mining assets.</p><p>Stria's Central Pontax Lithium Project covers 36 square kilometres, including 8 km of strike along the prospective Chambois Greenstone Belt. The region, known as the Canadian \"Lithium Triangle,\" is one of only a few known sources of lithium available for hard rock mining in North America. Stria's Pontax Central Project Joint Venture with Cygnus Metals now has a maiden JORC-compliant inferred mineral resource estimate of 10.1Mt at <percent>1.04%</percent> Li2O based on the central area of the known mineralisation.</p><p>This JORC estimate establishes Pontax Central as a significant occurrence in the emerging James Bay lithium region. Cygnus Metals, being an ASX issuer, adhered to Australian JORC Code 2012 guidelines, meaning that such mineral resource estimate is not necessarily compliant with CIM and National Instrument 43-101 standards and the Company is not considering them as such at this time.</p><p>Cygnus Metals is committed to fully funding and managing the current two-stage exploration and drilling program to a maximum of <money>$10 million</money> at Stria's Pontax property and will also pay Stria up to <money>$6 million</money> in cash. In return, Cygnus may acquire up to a <percent>70%</percent> interest in the property. Cygnus has fulfilled its stage 1 requirements within the agreement and has now earned its <percent>51%</percent> interest in the property.</p><p>As momentum builds for the green energy revolution and the shift to electric vehicles, governments in Canada and the United States are aggressively supporting the North American lithium industry, presenting the industry and its investors with a rare opportunity for growth and prosperity well into the next decade and beyond.</p><p>Stria is committed to exceeding the industry's environmental, social and governance standards. A critical part of that commitment is forging meaningful, enduring and mutually beneficial relationships with local communities and stakeholders, and engaging openly and respectfully as neighbours and collaborators in this project that has the potential to create lasting jobs and prosperity.</p><p>The scientific and technical content disclosed herein was reviewed and approved by Réjean Girard, P.Geo and president of IOS Services Geoscientifiques Inc., a qualified person as defined under National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.</p><p>Reference:<br/>JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of Pontax Project, James Bay Quebec, Brian Wolfe; Duncan Grieve, August 14, 2023.</p><p>For more information about Stria Lithium and the Pontax Lithium project, please visit <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/Q2pXKCEYma\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://strialithium.com</a>.</p><p>Follow us on:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li>Twitter @StriaLithium</li><li>Instagram @strialithium</li><li>Facebook <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/mjxEwsxX3K\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://www.facebook.com/strialithium</a></li><li>LinkedIn <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/kXYx2sYDpp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://www.linkedin.com/company/stria-lithium/</a></li></ul><div id=\"contactInfo\"><p>For more information on Stria Lithium Inc., please contact:</p><p>Dean Hanisch<br/>CEO, Stria Lithium<br/><a href=\"mailto:dhanisch@strialithium.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">dhanisch@strialithium.com</a></p><p>Investor Relations, Stria Lithium Inc.<br/><a href=\"mailto:info@strialithium.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">info@strialithium.com</a></p></div><p>Neither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the accuracy or adequacy of this release.</p><p><i><b>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information</b></i></p><p><i>Except for statements of historical fact, this news release contains certain forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities law.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 26, 2026) - <b>Minaurum Silver Inc. (TSXV: MGG) (OTCQX: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/MMRGF/\" title=\"View MMRGF stock overview\">MMRGF</a>) (FSE: 78M0) (\"Minaurum\" or the \"Company\")</b> is pleased to report that <b>six drill rigs</b> are now operating at its <b>Alamos Silver Project</b> as part of the <b>Phase II - 50,000-metre resource expansion drill program</b>.  Minaurum will continue step-out drilling on vein zones with established resources at <b>Europa</b> and <b>Promontorio-Travesia</b>, while initiating resource-definition drilling on several additional veins, including <b>San Jose</b>, <b>Quintera, Cotera-Pulpito</b>, and <b>Minas Nuevas</b>.</p><p>Recent step-out drilling at Europa has returned multiple high-grade silver intercepts, including: <b>0.50 m of 524 g/t silver equivalent (\"AgEq\")</b> in hole AL25-172, <b>0.30 m of 1,032 g/t AgEq</b> in hole AL25-174 and <b>1.40 m of 290 g/t AgEq</b> in hole AL25-175.  At Travesía-Quintera, step-out drilling returned <b>2.55 m of 197 g/t AgEq</b>, including <b>0.40 m grading 567 g/t AgEq</b> in hole AL25-173 (see Table 1).</p><p><b>\"With the continued success of our step-out drilling at the Europa vein zone, we are pleased to have expanded our drill fleet from four to six rigs,\" </b>stated Darrell Rader, President and CEO of Minaurum Silver.<b> \"Supported by an inferred resource of 55 million ounces AgEq at Alamos and a fully funded 50,000-metre resource expansion program currently underway, Minaurum is well positioned to deliver an updated mineral resource estimate in the second half of 2026.  We anticipate a steady increase in drill results as the expanded fleet advances the program.\"</b></p><p>Mineralization at the Europa and Travesia-Quintera zones has intersected high-grade silver over narrower widths that clearly define the margins of the robust silver shoots.  The vein system displays a well-developed pinch-and-swell geometry along strike and down-dip, characterized by variations in vein thickness and grade.  This continuity is exemplified by Hole AL25-163 at Europa, which returned 12.35 metres grading 408 g/t AgEq, including 3.20 metres of 1,277 g/t AgEq, in a 250-metre step-out (see Minaurum news release dated February 10, 2026), demonstrating a potentially large expansion of the mineralized envelope.</p><p>At Quintera, drilling continues to intersect mineralization within and surrounding historic underground workings, as well as in parallel hanging-wall veins and along strike.  </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/3455/285489_8c7cd3810420b91b_003full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

Maynard, Vice President of Exploration of Minaurum and a Qualified Person (QP) as defined by National Instrument 43-101, reviewed and verified the assay data, and has approved the disclosure in this news release. Verification was done by visual inspection of core samples and comparison to assay results. Assay results have not been checked by re-analysis. No factors were identified that could materially affect the accuracy or reliability of the data presented in this news release.</font></i></p><p><i><font style=\"font-size: 11px;\"><b>Analytical Procedures and Quality Assurance/Quality Control: </b>Preparation and assaying of drilling samples from Minaurum's Alamos project are done with strict adherence to a Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) protocol. Core samples are sawed in half and then bagged in a secure facility near the site and then shipped either by a licensed courior by Company personnel to ALS Minerals' preparation facility in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. ALS prepares the samples, crushing them to <percent>70%</percent> less than 2mm, splitting off 250g, and pulverizing the split to more than <percent>85%</percent> passing 75 microns. The resulting sample pulps are prepared in Hermosillo and then shipped to Vancouver for chemical analysis by ALS Minerals. In Vancouver, the pulps are analyzed for gold by fire assay and ICP/AES on a 30-gram charge. In addition, analyses are done for silver, copper, lead, and zinc using 4-acid digestion and ICP analysis. Samples with silver values greater than 100 g/t; and copper, lead, or zinc values greater than 10,000 ppm (<percent>1%</percent>) are re-analyzed using 4-acid digestion and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). </font></i></p><p><i><font style=\"font-size: 11px;\">Quality-control (QC) samples are inserted in the sample stream every 20 samples on average, and thus represent <percent>5%</percent> of the total samples. QC samples include standards, blanks, and duplicate samples. Standards are pulps that have been prepared by a third-party laboratory; they have gold, silver, and base-metal values that are established by an extensive analytical process in which several commercial labs (including ALS Minerals) participate. Standards test the calibration of the analytical equipment. Blanks are rock material known from prior sampling to contain less than 0.005 ppm gold; they test the sample preparation procedure for cross-sample contamination.  In the case of duplicates, the sample interval is cut in half and then quartered. The first quarter is the original sample, the second becomes the duplicate. Duplicate samples provide a test of the reproducibility of assays in the same drilled interval. When final assays are received, QC sample results are inspected for deviation from accepted values. To date, QC sample analytical results have fallen in acceptable ranges on the Alamos project.</font></i></p><p><i><font style=\"font-size: 11px;\">When final assays are received, QC sample results are inspected for deviation from accepted values by the QP.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><i><strong>eConsent solution deploys in under four weeks, integrates with any EDC, and delivers affordable, patient‑centric digital consent</strong></i></p><p><strong id=\"dateline\">AUSTIN, TX / <a href=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ACCESS Newswire</a> / February 26, 2026 / </strong>DATATRAK International, Inc.'s<strong> (OTC:<a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/DTRK/\" title=\"View DTRK stock overview\">DTRK</a>)</strong> DATATRAK Powered by Fountayn unified eClinical, eSource, and decentralized clinical trial (DCT) platform, announces the release of its standalone eConsent solution designed to help sponsors, CROs, and sites modernize informed consent while reducing startup timelines and technology costs. The new eConsent offering can be deployed in under four weeks and is available as a lightweight, cost‑effective module or as a fully integrated component of the DATATRAK Powered by Fountayn EDC and DCT ecosystem.</p><p>Unlike many eConsent tools that are bundled only within large, expensive ePRO or DCT packages, DATATRAK's standalone eConsent delivers flexible pricing so study teams can implement digital informed consent without paying for an entire ePRO system they do not need. Reasonable, study‑level pricing makes eConsent accessible for a broader range of trials and budgets, including early‑phase, single‑site, and investigator‑initiated studies.</p><p>\"Study teams want the benefits of modern eConsent-faster startup, better participant understanding, and cleaner documentation-without lengthy implementations or bloated platform costs,\" said Alex Tabatabai, CEO, DATATRAK. \"Our standalone eConsent is purpose‑built to launch quickly, fit into existing study infrastructure, and scale seamlessly when sponsors are ready to expand into DATATRAK EDC, ePRO, RTSM, CTMS, or full decentralized clinical trials.\"</p><p><strong>Fast Startup, IND‑Ready Timelines</strong></p><p>The DATATRAK eConsent solution is designed for implementation timelines of under four weeks, allowing study teams to go live in time for IND or ethics approval and first‑patient‑in milestones. Configuration is supported by reusable templates and best‑practice workflows that help streamline approvals and site activation.</p><p><strong>Standalone eConsent with Enterprise‑Grade Integration</strong></p><p>The eConsent module can be used as a standalone utility and integrated with third‑party infrastructure, including external EDC, RTSM, CTMS, and eTMF systems, or deployed as a native component of DATATRAK EDC. When used with DATATRAK EDC, consent data and enrollment status are seamlessly connected to subject records, randomization, and visit schedules, enabling true end‑to‑end digital trial execution on a single platform.</p><p><strong>Key Capabilities Include:</strong></p><p>1. Standalone eConsent that integrates with third‑party clinical trial systems or EDC<br/>2. Seamless integration with the consent and enrollment workflow in EDC<br/>3. Support for remote and decentralized clinical trials with patient access from any device<br/>4. Designed for protocol amendments and regulatory workflows</p><p>DATATRAK's eConsent simplifies managing protocol amendments and re‑consent, a common pain point for sponsors and sites. Study teams can easily trigger and track re‑consent when protocol changes occur, ensuring every participant is on the correct version and that audit trails remain inspection‑ready.</p><p>The system also supports tracking and managing supporting documents such as witness statements, translations, and supplemental information, helping maintain complete, compliant records across sites and regions.</p><p><strong>Flexible Patient Engagement and Enrollment Options</strong></p><p>To support both site‑based and remote enrollment, the eConsent solution enables sites to invite participants using multiple methods: email links, QR codes patients can scan on their own device, or direct registration by the physician or site staff. Sites can also schedule consent visits prior to trial enrollment, helping ensure participants have adequate time to review materials, ask questions, and complete consent in a controlled, compliant workflow.</p><p>When combined with DATATRAK's EDC, ePRO, and eSource capabilities, sponsors can extend the same patient‑centric digital experience beyond consent to ongoing data collection and engagement throughout the study.</p><p><strong>About DATATRAK</strong></p><p>DATATRAK Powered by Fountayn is transforming healthcare and life sciences through technological innovations by providing a unified, cloud based eClinical and decentralized clinical trial platform that brings together EDC, eSource, ePRO/eCOA, eConsent, RTSM, RBM, Adjudication, Imaging, Safety, Global Oversight and Enterprise Workflow Management, CTMS, eTMF, and DCT tools in a single, configurable environment.

As she reaches the end of her second term as CEO, the Board of Directors unanimously supports her remaining as Chair to ensure strategic continuity and guide Viridien’s long-term vision. Since 2018, her leadership has repositioned Viridien as an asset-light, technology-driven company with a stronger financial foundation and a more diversified portfolio.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The Board also unanimously approved the appointment of Henning Berg as Viridien’s new CEO, effective June 3, 2026. Henning Berg brings more than 27 years of experience in the oil and gas services industry, including several senior global leadership roles at SLB. He will join the Group on March 3, 2026, as Chief Operating Officer, ensuring a structured and gradual transition to the CEO role. His appointment as Director will also be submitted for approval at the upcoming General Meeting</p> <p align=\"center\" style=\"padding-left:4pt;\"><b>OUTLOOK</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">While short-term energy price volatility may result in some industry caution and softer activity in the first half of 2026, we anticipate a recovery in the second half. Under an overall business environment comparable to last year, Viridien expects to deliver around <money>$100 million</money> of Net Cash Flow in FY26, with a seasonal profile similar to 2025 and full allocation to further deleveraging. This target incorporates the planned Phase 1 expansion of our US HPC infrastructure and assumes a normalization of working capital, including PEMEX.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Looking further ahead, the structural dynamics of global energy supply increasingly point toward a new exploration upcycle<sup>7</sup>. Frontier discoveries and offshore deepwater developments, areas where Viridien holds clear technological leadership, will be critical to sustaining production and reinforce our confidence in the Group’s medium- and long-term trajectory.</p> <p align=\"center\">***</p> <p align=\"left\"><b>Q4 2025 conference call details</b><br/><br/>The press release and presentation will be made available on <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tJH3gufvMFZB8juXlhAbOQs2hjeqmuIbzPr90Nn4geVhUetAGjRlhF8OE-aeoej3zUbMZOtJ4jt7XaPoyCTplOEMxQlZhGIbOD7LdqA8XaU=\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.viridiengroup.com</a> at 5:45 p.m. (CET).<br/><br/>An English-language conference call is scheduled today at 6:00 p.m. (CET).</p> <p align=\"justify\">Participants must register for the conference call by clicking <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=VoRpnFOMFf1dGKGt7XcvdPmsf3ByL-a4t_IaTOjYQlEc73RyDLO00xV8Fd80WPae8SkaN8o2UTTlWrCAwfHXhr73AllpLNCvBRIHnwsrxcx3ejSZOONP3bMdBB4uu3zkIo1g4rZwd6C-Zp0PN5Aat_o0QI65udaDWBof2xhmFy0=\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to receive a dial-in number and PIN code.

            "title": "QIMC Identifies Second Hydrogen-Associated Structural Zone at 313m, Supporting Multi-Zone H2 System at West Advocate in Nova Scotia | QIMCF Stock News",
            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><b>Vertical Structural Continuity Emerging in DDH-26-01<br/>Nova Scotia Introduces Purpose-Built Natural Hydrogen Legislation</b></p><p>Montreal, Quebec--(Newsfile Corp. - February 26, 2026) - Québec Innovative Materials Corp.  (CSE: QIMC) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/QIMCF/\" title=\"View QIMCF stock overview\">QIMCF</a>) (FSE: 7FJ) (\"QIMC\" or the \"Company\") reports that drill hole DDH-26-01 has intersected a second hydrogen-associated structural zone at approximately 313 metres depth at its West Advocate Project, Nova Scotia. This interval from approximately 313 metres to 330 metres depth is distinct from the previously reported 40-metre hydrogen-bearing fault corridor encountered between 142 and 191 metres.</p><p>The identification of two vertically separated hydrogen-associated structural zones within a single borehole supports the interpretation of a structurally controlled, multi-zone natural hydrogen system and further strengthens QIMC's H2 geological model. Drilling at DDH-26-01 remains ongoing toward the planned total depth of 650 metres.</p><p>This development coincides with the Government of Nova Scotia's introduction of the Powering the Economy Act (Bill No. 193), proposed legislation that regulates natural hydrogen as a subsurface energy resource within the Province. This legislative development directly enhances investment certainty and long-term planning capability and demonstrates the Province's and Premier Houston's commitment to establishing Nova Scotia as a hub for responsible clean energy development. The Company's exploration at West Advocate involves no hydraulic fracturing and no reservoir stimulation.</p><p><b>What This Means for Investors</b></p><p>DDH-26-01 has now intersected hydrogen-associated structural intervals at approximately 142 metres and 313 metres depth within a single borehole, supporting the interpretation of a multi-zone, structurally controlled natural hydrogen system rather than an isolated occurrence. In natural hydrogen exploration, structural repetition across depth is a recognized indicator of system continuity and scale. This result further strengthens QIMC's working geological model and provides a defined, systematic, data-driven pathway for the next phases of its Nova Scotia natural hydrogen exploration program.</p><p><b>CEO Commentary</b></p><p>John Karagiannidis, President &amp; CEO of QIMC, stated:</p><p>\"Intersecting a second hydrogen-associated structural zone at 320 metres while Hole 1 continues drilling toward 650 metres significantly strengthens our geological interpretation of West Advocate as a structurally controlled, multi-zone system. We are observing vertically separated brecciated intervals within a single borehole that exhibit geochemical characteristics consistent with hydrogen-bearing environments.</p><p>The Province of Nova Scotia's introduced regulatory framework provides the clarity necessary to responsibly advance multi-well exploration strategies and support long-term planning and investment. As we continue defining structural continuity through drilling and logging, this regulatory certainty underpins our disciplined, systematic approach and we commend the Province for its proactive clean energy leadership.\"</p><p><b>Project Geologist Commentary</b></p><p>Edward Procyshyn, Project Geologist, commented:</p><p>\"Drill logging has identified within the second structural fault zone three separate brecciated shear zones that are progressively more altered and sheared downhole. With progressive alteration, the breccia fragments become more completely replaced by finely crystalline massive dark carbon-graphite and dark mica. Each underlying shear zone is more highly altered than the overlying shear zone. The middle and lower altered shear zones were most highly altered and develop dark, very finely granular, massive carbon-rich intervals 0.5 to 1 metre thick. These highly altered core intervals contain the highest measured hydrogen gas values.</p><p>The host rock within the structural fault zone is also progressively altered as the intensity of shear deformation increases downhole. Thinly bedded, finely granular siltstone, dark carbonaceous mudstone, and fanglomerate are progressively recrystallized to form, within the structural fault zone, massive white, very fine-grained porcelain-like units cut by darker web to lenticular fractures. As shear fracturing and alteration increase in intensity downhole, the intervening porcellanite-like host changes colour from white to pale green and finally to darker greenish grey, indicating mineralogical changes due to increasing conditions of alteration.\"</p><p>Edward Procyshyn continued:</p><p>\"The progressive hydrothermal alteration of this structural fault shear zone supports the model that white native hydrogen is being increasingly generated at lower crustal levels by degassing of a magmatic system and being transported by advective hydrothermal fluids into the fault-related shear structures. This suggests that the degassing may be generated by injection of mantle plumes into the upper crust within the West Advocate area and that this process may have contributed significant amounts of white hydrogen gas that was and is presently being measured in the intersected structural zones and at surface in the soil-gas samples.</p><p>The very low to absent quantities of methane contained in the measured gases support the concept that hydrogen is being generated from crustal sources in a naturally occurring hydrogen system rather than from a conventional hydrocarbon occurrence.\"</p><p><b>Gas Monitoring Observations at 313m</b></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align: start; width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"width: 50%;\">Parameter<br/><br/></td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Observation</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 50%;\">Hydrogen (H₂)<br/><br/></td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Elevated concentrations detected</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 50%;\">Oxygen (O₂)<br/><br/></td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Depleted relative to atmospheric levels</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 50%;\">Methane (CH₄)<br/><br/></td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">None detected</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 50%;\">Hydraulic fracturing / stimulation<br/></td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Not conducted</td></tr></tbody></table><p> <br/>Measurements were collected in ambient atmospheric air near the borehole collar and during core handling and are subject to atmospheric dilution.</p><p><b>2026 Drill Program: Five-Hole Campaign</b></p><p>DDH-26-01 is the first hole in a planned five-hole 2026 drill program designed to systematically evaluate structural hydrogen corridors at West Advocate and adjacent targets.</p><ul><li>Hole 1 (DDH-26-01): Drilling continues toward planned 650 metres depth.<br/><br/></li><li>Hole 2 (DDH-26-02): Planned from same pad; oriented N297° with 55° plunge to the northwest.<br/><br/></li><li>Hole 3 (DDH-26-03): Eatonville Road area along the Reid Line; planned to 700 metres depth.<br/><br/></li><li>Holes 4 &amp; 5 (DDH-26-04 and DDH-26-05): Bennett Hill targets testing the broader regional structural hydrogen corridor.</li></ul><p><b>Nova Scotia Legislation</b></p><p>Nova Scotia's proposed legislation reflects a broader recognition by governments that natural hydrogen warrants a dedicated regulatory framework, a development that directly benefits companies with active exploration programs in the province.
