This underground mine became the primary producer of gallium and germanium in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> when Musto Explorations Ltd. brought it into production in the mid 1980's and again with Hecla Mining Company in the 1990's. During its peak year of operations, Apex produced 10,270 tons yielding 1,645 lb Ga, 5,634 lbs of Ge, and 224,800 lbs of Cu.</p><p>Hecla completed a feasibility study in 1989, reporting a reserve of 230,200 tons of <percent>0.100%</percent> Ge, <percent>0.046%</percent> Ga and <percent>1.6%</percent> Cu.  A historical reserve estimate<sup>1</sup> by Ken Krahulec in 2018 estimated 1 MT @ <percent>0.087%</percent> Ge, <percent>0.033%</percent> Ga, <percent>1.8%</percent> Cu and 41 g/t Ag. The Ge and Ga are 10-100x higher grade than most Ge and Ga deposits, with in-situ value per ton similar to 0.5 oz/T gold ores. Beyond the historical reserves, Hecla also identified several additional breccia bodies as prospective exploration targets, including the Paymaster, Cavern, and 500 North pipes, along with further oxide zones in the immediate mine area. </p><p><sup>1</sup>As at the date of this news release, a qualified person has not completed sufficient work to classify the historical estimates above as current mineral resources or mineral reserves in accordance with NI 43-101 and Blue Moon is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. In order to verify the historical estimates, the Company needs to engage a qualified person to review the historical data, review any work completed on the property since and complete a new technical report. Blue Moon views this historical data as an indicator of the potential size and grade of the mineralized deposits, and this data is relevant to Company's future plans with respect to the property.</p><p>Subject to renewed permits and with the intent to reopen the mine, the Company plans to fast track efforts to advance the technical studies, metallurgical testing, process flowsheets, permitting and community engagement to support a final investment decision. In parallel, Blue Moon is evaluating options for a new processing line at the Company's Springer complex to process the Apex material and provide an integrated United States Ge and Ga value chain.</p><div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1637\"><p><a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2922419/Blue_Moon_Metals_Blue_Moon_to_Acquire_the_Apex_Germanium_and_Gal.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Figure 4: Location of Apex Project; 23 km from St. George, Utah (CNW Group/Blue Moon Metals)\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2922419/Blue_Moon_Metals_Blue_Moon_to_Acquire_the_Apex_Germanium_and_Gal.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4: Location of Apex Project; 23 km from St. George, Utah (CNW Group/Blue Moon Metals)\"/></a></p></div><p><b>Springer Complex, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nv\">Nevada</location> (Multi-commodity Processing Hub)</b></p><p>The Springer property is located on the east flank of the Eugene Mountains, approximately 25 miles southwest of the city of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nv.wincca\">Winnemucca</location>, and 125 miles northeast of the city of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nv.reno\">Reno</location>, in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nv.pering\">Pershing County, Nevada</location>. The mine site is approximately 8 miles from Interstate 80, serviced by paved/gravel road, over owned land. The Springer tungsten milling facility is located entirely on private fee lands.</p><p>Springer is a former tungsten production facility consisting of a 1,360-ft vertical shaft and underground workings, a 1,200 ton per day mill with automated rod/ball mill grinding and flotation circuits, plus all water rights, and most permits necessary for operation of the facility.</p><p>The Springer tungsten property was the site of continuous underground tungsten mining between 1918 and 1958, much of that time controlled first by the Segerstrom family, and later by the Nevada-Massachusetts Mining Company (\"NMC\"). The General Electric Company (\"GE\") acquired the property in the 1970's, interested in securing long term tungsten supply assets to support its lighting and industrial tools businesses. The current mine and mill were constructed by Utah International Inc. (\"UII\", later became BHP Minerals Group) for GE in the mid 1970's, and was subsequently commissioned and operated by GE for 8 months in 1982. The property has not been actively mined since October 1982, and the underground workings are currently flooded to a depth of approximately 375 feet. EMC Metals Corp. acquired the Springer mine and associated properties from GE in 2006. Between that purchase date and today, considerable refurbishment and renewal has been undertaken to the mill, control systems, hoist house, and an up-rating of the mill throughput from a nominal 950 tpd to a current 1,350 tpd capacity, and an estimated 1,200 tpd throughput after availabilities (<percent>89%</percent>).</p><p>Centrally located with access to diverse mineral sources and existing road and rail infrastructure, the Springer Mine and Mill is well situated to become a regional metallurgical complex. With established tailings and water management systems, the brownfield site provides significant opportunities to reduce capital and permitting timelines compared to a greenfield development.</p><p>The Company purchased the site in February 2026 to provide processing capacity to support the development of the Blue Moon Mine and to establish a regional processing hub. Sitting on a large land package, Blue Moon believes there is significant room to expand the mill layout and add additional buildings to process multiple ore types and improve economies of scale to unlock and maximize the value of resources that would otherwise not support stand-alone processing facilities. Located only a few miles from both Interstate 80 and the Union Pacific rail line, the Springer complex is well connected to the transportation and logistics infrastructure to integrate with other operations, including Teck's Trail Operations.</p><p>The Company is presently advancing analysis and engineering to process the Blue Moon Mine material, including updating permitting requirements and changes required to the mill and tailings management system.</p><div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder5121\"><p><a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2922420/Blue_Moon_Metals_Blue_Moon_to_Acquire_the_Apex_Germanium_and_Gal.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Figure 5: The Springer Complex (CNW Group/Blue Moon Metals)\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2922420/Blue_Moon_Metals_Blue_Moon_to_Acquire_the_Apex_Germanium_and_Gal.jpg\" title=\"Figure 5: The Springer Complex (CNW Group/Blue Moon Metals)\"/></a></p></div><p><b>Springer Mine, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nv\">Nevada</location> (Tungsten)</b></p><p>Located on the larger Springer Complex, the Springer Mine as discussed above was one of the most important mines for US-sourced tungsten production.  A historic resource estimate was in place at the time of construction and ownership by GE/Utah International Inc.</p><p>A historical resource estimate of 10.7 MT at <percent>0.45%</percent> tungsten is based on data and reports prepared by the previous operators, General Electric and Utah International Inc in 1984.  The company has not completed the work necessary to have the historical estimate verified by a QP.

UCT≥12 is well controlled and UCT=16 is complete control.<br/><sup>2</sup>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) consists of ten questions (on a scale of 0–3, total 0–30) used to measure the impact of skin disease on patient quality of life related to symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. DLQI 0–1 indicates no effect on a patient’s life.<br/><sup>3</sup>Angioedema Activity Score for 7 days (AAS7) assesses the severity of disease activity in patients with recurrent angioedema or urticaria. It sums daily scores (0-15) over one week (total: 0 -105), evaluating frequency, duration, severity, disfigurement, and impact on daily life.<br/><br/><strong>About Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU)</strong><br/>CSU is an underdiagnosed disease of misery marked by spontaneous hives, unbearable itch, and unpredictable episodes of disfiguring swelling (angioedema) that causes substantial mental health burden, profound impact on quality of life and is associated with a 1.7-fold increase in all cause mortality at 5 years. Mast cell activation plays a central role in the onset and progression of CSU. While the goal of CSU treatment is the complete absence of symptoms, the vast majority of patients today, even those receiving the most advanced approved and available therapies, continue to suffer from itch, hives, swelling, sleep disruption, and unrelenting anxiety about when the next flare up will occur.</p> <p><strong>About Chronic Inducible Urticaria (CIndU), Cold Urticaria (ColdU), Symptomatic Dermographism (SD)</strong><br/>CIndU is characterized by the occurrence of hives or wheals that have an attributable trigger associated with them. ColdU symptoms include itching, burning wheals/hives and angioedema when skin is exposed to cold temperatures. SD symptoms include the development of wheals in response to stroking, scratching or rubbing of the skin. For these diseases, mast cell activation leading to release of soluble mediators is thought to be the driving mechanism leading to the wheals and other symptoms. There are currently no approved therapies for chronic inducible urticarias other than antihistamines and patients attempt to manage symptoms associated with their disease through avoidance of triggers.</p> <p><strong>About Barzolvolimab</strong><br/>Barzolvolimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody with a completely novel mechanism of action that targets mast cells by binding with high specificity to a unique part of the KIT receptor and potently inhibiting its activity. The KIT receptor is abundantly expressed by mast cells and critical for their function and survival. Mast cells are drivers of inflammatory responses such as hypersensitivity and allergic reactions and, in certain inflammatory diseases, such as chronic urticarias, mast cell activation plays a central role in the onset and progression of the disease. Based on data from robust, randomized, placebo controlled Phase 2 studies, barzolvolimab has significant potential as a first-in-class and best-in-disease treatment option for patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), cold urticaria (ColdU) and symptomatic dermographism (SD). Barzolvolimab is currently being studied in Phase 3 studies in CSU and ColdU/SD and Phase 2 studies in prurigo nodularis (PN) and atopic dermatitis (AD), with additional indications planned for the future.</p> <p><strong>About Celldex </strong><br/>Celldex is pioneering new horizons in immunology to deliver life-changing therapies.
