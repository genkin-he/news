These data are being presented as a late-breaking oral abstract at the 2026 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Genitourinary (GU) Cancers Symposium (abstract #LBA417) and are included in the official ASCO GU Press Program.</p><p>At a pre-specified interim analysis with a median follow-up of 29.0 months (range, 19.3-49.2), WELIREG plus LENVIMA demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS), reducing the risk of disease progression or death by <percent>30%</percent> (HR=0.70 [<percent>95%</percent> CI, 0.59-0.84]; p=0.00007) compared to cabozantinib. For WELIREG plus LENVIMA, the median PFS was 14.8 months (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 11.2-16.6) versus 10.7 months (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 9.2-11.1) for cabozantinib. A trend toward improvement in overall survival (OS), the trial’s other primary endpoint, was also observed for WELIREG plus LENVIMA (HR=0.85 [<percent>95%</percent> CI, 0.68-1.05]; p=0.06075). The median OS was 34.9 months (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 27.5-NR) for WELIREG plus LENVIMA versus 27.6 months (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 24.0-31.4) for cabozantinib. The trial is continuing, and OS will be evaluated at a subsequent analysis per the clinical trial protocol.</p><p>Based on data from the LITESPARK-011 trial, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted two supplemental New Drug Applications (sNDA) for review seeking approval for WELIREG plus LENVIMA for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC with a clear cell component following a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. The FDA set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action date, of October 4, 2026 for both the WELIREG and LENVIMA sNDAs. Merck and Eisai will also discuss these data with regulatory authorities worldwide to support potential submissions outside <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>.</p><p>“Choosing the right treatment for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma after immunotherapy has been an ongoing challenge, and treatment options in this setting had not previously been evaluated against a current standard of care tyrosine kinase inhibitor in a Phase 3 trial,” said Dr. Robert Motzer, Principal Investigator and Genitourinary Medical Oncologist, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. “The LITESPARK-011 study demonstrated a <percent>30%</percent> reduction in the risk of disease progression or death with belzutifan plus lenvatinib compared to cabozantinib, and <percent>52.6%</percent> of patients experienced a response to treatment. These findings mark a critical step forward for these patients.”</p><p>“The LITESPARK-011 trial highlights the potential of this first-of-its-kind combination regimen to deliver a meaningful benefit for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma whose disease progresses after PD-1/L1 therapy,” said Dr. M. Catherine Pietanza, Vice President, Global Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories. “These WELIREG plus LENVIMA data demonstrate important progress for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and reinforce our commitment to improving the lives of patients through innovative treatment strategies.”</p><p>“The LITESPARK-011 results reinforce LENVIMA's established role in renal cell carcinoma and highlight the potential of this novel combination to address an area of significant unmet need,” said Dr. Corina Dutcus, Senior Vice President, Oncology Global Clinical Development Lead at Eisai. “The acceptance of this regulatory filing is an important milestone, and we remain committed to working toward approval to bring this option to patients as soon as possible. We are grateful to the patients, their families, and the investigators, whose dedication made this research possible.”</p><p><b>Additional findings</b></p><p>Data for objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR), two key secondary endpoints, were also reported. At the first interim analysis with a median follow-up of 19.6 months (range, 9.9-39.8), WELIREG plus LENVIMA met ORR, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement compared to cabozantinib. A confirmed ORR of <percent>52.6%</percent> (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 47.3-57.7) was observed for WELIREG plus LENVIMA versus <percent>39.6%</percent> (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 34.6-44.8) for cabozantinib. At the second interim analysis with a median follow-up of 29.0 months, the median DOR was 23.0 months (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 2.0-44.3+) for WELIREG plus LENVIMA versus 12.3 months (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 1.8+-35.9+) for cabozantinib.</p><p>WELIREG plus LENVIMA was administered to 370 patients and cabozantinib was administered to 371 patients.

Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms.</p><p><b>Hemorrhagic Events. </b>Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. In DTC, RCC, and HCC clinical trials, hemorrhagic events, of any grade, occurred in <percent>29%</percent> of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least <percent>5%</percent> of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. In DTC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in <percent>2%</percent> of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In RCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in <percent>8%</percent> of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients, including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In HCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in <percent>5%</percent> of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events. Serious tumor-related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in LENVIMA-treated patients in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. In postmarketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than other tumors. Safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials.</p><p>Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.</p><p><b>Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression/Thyroid Dysfunction. </b>LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In DTC, <percent>88%</percent> of patients had baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level ≤0.5 mU/L. In patients with normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level &gt;0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in <percent>57%</percent> of LENVIMA-treated patients. In RCC and HCC, grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in <percent>24%</percent> of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients and <percent>21%</percent> of LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. In patients with normal or low TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in <percent>70%</percent> of LENVIMA-treated patients in HCC and <percent>60%</percent> of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients in RCC.</p><p>Monitor thyroid function prior to initiation and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice.</p><p><b>Impaired Wound Healing. </b>Impaired wound healing has been reported in patients who received LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.</p><p><b>Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ).</b> ONJ has been reported in patients receiving LENVIMA. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, dental disease or invasive dental procedures, may increase the risk of ONJ.</p><p>Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with LENVIMA and periodically during LENVIMA treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices and to consider having preventive dentistry performed prior to treatment with LENVIMA and throughout treatment with LENVIMA.</p><p>Avoid invasive dental procedures, if possible, while on LENVIMA treatment, particularly in patients at higher risk. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ.</p><p>Withhold LENVIMA if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgement of adequate resolution.</p><p><b>Embryo‐Fetal Toxicity. </b>Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of LENVIMA during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus; and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for 30 days after the last dose.</p><p><b>Adverse Reactions</b></p><p>In DTC, the most common adverse reactions (≥<percent>30%</percent>) observed in LENVIMA-treated patients were hypertension (<percent>73%</percent>), fatigue (<percent>67%</percent>), diarrhea (<percent>67%</percent>), arthralgia/myalgia (<percent>62%</percent>), decreased appetite (<percent>54%</percent>), decreased weight (<percent>51%</percent>), nausea (<percent>47%</percent>), stomatitis (<percent>41%</percent>), headache (<percent>38%</percent>), vomiting (<percent>36%</percent>), proteinuria (<percent>34%</percent>), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (<percent>32%</percent>), abdominal pain (<percent>31%</percent>), and dysphonia (<percent>31%</percent>).

In November 2025, we began to see early signs of an improved supply-demand balance, driven by stronger-than-expected demand from energy storage systems (ESS), as well as certain supply disruptions. This led to a tighter market environment and a shift in pricing trends. We continue to observe solid demand fundamentals, and we estimate that the lithium market could grow by approximately <percent>25%</percent> this year, led by electric vehicles (EVs) and ESS.”</p> <p align=\"justify\">Mr. Ramos continued: At Nova Andino Litio, we are operating at full capacity to meet our customer commitments while continuing to advance our expansion plans in the Salar de Atacama. In parallel, we are increasing refinery of lithium carbonate from lithium sulfate in China through tolling agreements.”</p> <p align=\"justify\">He added: “In Australia, we are also operating at full capacity in the production of spodumene concentrate. In January of this year, we celebrated our first shipment of lithium hydroxide produced in Australia at the Kwinana refinery. Notably, lithium hydroxide from Kwinana refinery has been certified under the International Lithium Association’s Life Cycle Assessment framework, demonstrating a <percent>37%</percent> lower emissions footprint compared to traditional hard-rock production refined in China.”</p> <p align=\"justify\">Mr Ramos continued: “Our Iodine and Plant Nutrition division delivered solid performance, particularly in iodine, which contributed approximately <percent>42%</percent> of SQM’s total gross profit.

As previously reported, bezuclastinib demonstrated clinically meaningful and highly statistically significant improvements across the primary and all key secondary endpoints. New results highlight the deepening of clinical benefit over longer treatment duration, the benefit of bezuclastinib in populations with high unmet need, and bezuclastinib’s impact on bone mineral density as additional evidence of disease modification.</p> <p>“The additional SUMMIT data presented at AAAAI today reinforce our belief that bezuclastinib can rapidly and meaningfully improve a wide variety of symptoms that impact the daily lives of patients with NonAdvanced SM,” said Andrew Robbins, Cogent’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “These posters underscore the significance of our findings and build upon the data we shared at ASH last year.

The mission deployed DART AE, a scramjet-powered aircraft developed by Australian aerospace engineering firm Hypersonix, into a suborbital hypersonic flight environment at several times the speed of sound. </p> <p align=\"justify\">With <percent>100%</percent> mission success across all HASTE launches, Rocket Lab is helping to shape a new era of hypersonic systems testing with speed and precision, lower costs, and a modern test platform that serves the Department of War’s critical technology priorities.

Successfully flying DART AE in a real hypersonic environment validates years of disciplined engineering and preparation by our team. Launching aboard Rocket Lab’s HASTE vehicle enabled us to execute the mission with speed and precision. This flight moves us from ground-based validation into true hypersonic operations and brings us closer to delivering reusable hypersonic capability that is operationally relevant for our partners and allies.”</p> <p align=\"justify\">“That’s Not A Knife” is Rocket Lab’s third launch of the year with <percent>100%</percent> mission success and 82nd launch overall, maintaining the global superiority of Rocket Lab’s small-lift launch capabilities across government and commercial missions.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Rocket Lab Media Contact</strong><br/>Murielle Baker<br/><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=IRrLrLMJ6f3TjuyIWi_jUkDGA_5j78hoGWW54oe87-2eSUdf7SnUdQQjt0jpI-7VmMuopxMEokAyX7DTLYxHg1SXRUpiblPNmqg8AXfL_V4=\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">media@rocketlabusa.com</a></p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>About Rocket Lab</strong><br/>About Rocket Lab Rocket Lab is a leading space company that provides launch services, spacecraft, payloads and satellite components serving commercial, government, and national security markets.

The PAH enzyme is required for the metabolism of Phe, an essential amino acid found in most protein-containing foods. If functional enzyme is not present in sufficient quantities, Phe accumulates to abnormally high levels in the blood and becomes toxic to the brain, resulting in a variety of complications including severe intellectual disability, seizures, tremors, behavioral problems and psychiatric symptoms.</p><p>As a result of newborn screening efforts implemented in the 1960s and early 1970s, virtually all individuals with PKU born after this period in countries with newborn screening programs are diagnosed at birth and treatment is implemented soon after.</p><p>PKU can be managed with a severe Phe-restricted diet, supplemented by low-protein modified foods and Phe-free medical foods; however, it is difficult for most individuals to adhere to this strict diet to the extent needed to achieve adequate control of blood Phe levels. Dietary control of Phe in childhood can prevent major developmental issues and neurological consequences, but poor Phe control in adolescence and adulthood is associated with a range of neuropsychological deficits and functional impairment.</p><p><b>PALYNZIQ <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Indication and Important Safety Information</b></p><p>PALYNZIQ<sup>®</sup> (pegvaliase-pqpz) is a phenylalanine (Phe)-metabolizing enzyme indicated to reduce blood Phe concentrations in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with phenylketonuria (PKU) who have uncontrolled blood Phe concentrations greater than 600 micromol/L (10 mg/dL) on existing management.</p><p><b>BOXED WARNING: ANAPHYLAXIS</b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>Anaphylaxis has been reported after administration of PALYNZIQ and may occur at any time during treatment.</li><li>Administer the initial dose of PALYNZIQ under the supervision of a healthcare provider equipped to manage anaphylaxis, and closely observe patients for at least 60 minutes following injection.

The reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures in accordance with Regulation G are included herein.</p><p>Berkshire presents its results in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful, as well as most transparent, to the investing public and others who use Berkshire’s financial information. That presentation includes the use of certain non-GAAP financial measures. In addition to the GAAP presentations of net earnings, Berkshire shows operating earnings defined as net earnings exclusive of investment gains (losses), impairments of goodwill and intangible assets and other-than-temporary impairments of equity method investments.</p><p>Although the investment of insurance and reinsurance premiums to generate investment income and investment gains or losses is an integral part of Berkshire’s operations, the generation of investment gains or losses is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Moreover, as previously described, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, we are required to include the changes in unrealized gains/losses of our equity security investments as a component of investment gains/losses in our periodic earnings statements. In sum, investment gains/losses for any particular period are not indicative of quarterly business performance.</p><p><b>About Berkshire</b></p><p>Berkshire Hathaway and its subsidiaries engage in diverse business activities including insurance and reinsurance, utilities and energy, freight rail transportation, manufacturing, services and retailing.
