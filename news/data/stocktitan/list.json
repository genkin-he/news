Atrium Therapeutics' platform is designed to selectively target the underlying drivers of genetically driven cardiac diseases through targeted, non-viral delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA). This approach builds upon learnings from delivery to the skeletal muscle and applies it for efficient delivery to the heart overcoming challenges associated with non-specific tissue delivery. The company's pipeline consists of two precision cardiology candidates, ATR 1072 and ATR 1086, and two undisclosed research targets in rare cardiomyopathies.</p><p>For more information about our RNA delivery platform, development pipeline and people, please visit <a href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628893-1&amp;h=3249694127&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fatriumtherapeutics.com%2F&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Fatriumtherapeutics.com%2F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://atriumtherapeutics.com/</a> and engage with us on <a href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628893-1&amp;h=2886538182&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fatrium-therapeutics%2F&amp;a=LinkedIn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a>.</p><p><b>About PRKAG2 Syndrome</b></p><p>PRKAG2 syndrome is a rare, autosomal dominant, early-onset cardiomyopathy caused by mutations in the PRKAG2 gene, which encodes the Gamma 2 regulatory subunit of AMPK. Mutations enhance AMPK activity leading to abnormal glycogen accumulation in heart muscle cells leading to thickened heart muscles, electrical conduction problems, and arrhythmias. There are 1,000 – 2,000 people with PRKAG2 syndrome in the US. Current management is limited to symptomatic treatment; no approved therapies exist to address the underlying genetic driver of disease.</p><p><b>About PLN Cardiomyopathy</b></p><p>PLN (phospholamban) cardiomyopathy is a rare autosomal dominant, progressive cardiac disease caused by mutations in PLN, a key regulator of SERCA2a calcium pump. Pathogenic variants produce protein aggregates that disrupt endoplasmic reticulum processes and lead to dilated, arrhythmogenic, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathies and a significantly increased risk of heart failure and sudden cardiac death. There are 2,000 – 4,000 people with pathogenic PLN variants in the US. No approved therapies target the underlying molecular cause of the disease.</p><p><b>Forward-Looking Statements</b></p><p>This communication contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Our business model is to provide clients with toll milling services and produce high-grade marketable concentrates from mineral purchases. The Aguila Norte processing plant has an environmental permit (\"IGAC\") from the Peruvian government which provides the Company with the ability to expand operations past the current 100 tonnes per day level. The Company continues to acquire and develop precious and base metal properties in Peru.</p><p>The Company has recently completed a financing which will allow the Company to focus its 2026 development program on its high-grade Au-Ag Palta Dorada property. New metallurgical results in both oxide and sulphide material highlight the gold potential at Palta Dorada. Provisional permits are in place allowing the company to extract large bulk samples of both the oxide and sulphide material. Sulphide material will be transported to our Aguila Norte mill for processing where we will be able to produce an Au-Ag concentrate for sale. The oxide gold material, along with similar oxide mineral at our Aguila Norte site, will be one of many catalysts and sources of material for a potential CIP circuit. Peruvian Metals will move into the Peruvian gold space which will be bolstered by the progress at Palta Dorada.</p><p><b>About PDAC</b></p><p>The World's Premier Mineral Exploration &amp; Mining Convention is the leading convention for people, governments, companies and organizations connected to mineral exploration. The annual convention is held in Toronto, Canada. It has grown in size, stature and influence since it began in 1932 and today is the event of choice for the world's mineral industry.</p><p>We look forward to seeing you there.</p><p><b>ON BEHALF OF PERUVIAN METALS</b><br/><b>CORP.</b><br/><u>(Signed) Jeffrey Reeder</u> <u> </u></p><div id=\"contactInfo\"><p><b>For additional information, contact: </b><br/>Jeffrey Reeder, C.E.O.<br/>Telephone: (647) 302-3290<br/>Email<i>: </i><a href=\"mailto:jeffrey.reeder@peruvianmetals.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">jeffrey.reeder@peruvianmetals.com</a></p></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><b>Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.</b></i></p><p><i><b>Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements: </b></i>This press release contains certain \"Forward-Looking Statements\" within the meaning of applicable securities legislation.

(\"Orogen\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that it has signed a purchase and sale agreement (the \"Agreement\") with Quebec Nickel Corp. (CSE: QNI) (\"Quebec Nickel\") whereby Quebec Nickel can acquire a <percent>100%</percent> interest in the Ecru gold project, Nevada, USA.</p><p>Under the terms of the Agreement, Quebec Nickel can acquire a <percent>100%</percent> interest in the Ecru claims from Orogen for an aggregate consideration of <money>$540,000</money> in cash and shares of Quebec Nickel (\"Consideration Shares\"), subject to regulatory acceptance of the Canadian Securities Exchange, and payable as follows:</p><ol><li><p><money>$250,000</money> cash on closing of the acquisition, <money>$25,000</money> of which has already been received;</p></li><li><p>1,000,000 Consideration Shares of Quebec Nickel issued on closing, at a price of <money>$0.16</money>5 per share, representing the permitted discount to the closing price of Quebec Nickel's common shares on February 26, 2026; and</p></li><li><p>Within six months of closing, the issuance to Orogen of <money>$125,000</money> of Consideration Shares at a price per share equal to the 10-day volume weighted average price of the common shares of Quebec Nickel on the Canadian Securities Exchange at the date of the issue.</p></li></ol><p>Quebec Nickel will also grant a non-buyable <percent>2%</percent> net smelter return (\"NSR\") royalty to Orogen.</p><p>Closing of the acquisition is expected to be completed within the next 30 days.</p><p>Paddy Nicol, CEO of Orogen commented, \"The Ecru gold project, staked by Orogen's generative team, is favourably located in the prolific Cortez trend in Nevada, immediately north and adjacent to Nevada Gold Mines Robertson deposit. We look forward to following the progress of the Quebec Nickel team at Ecru.\"</p><p><strong><u>About the Ecru Gold Project</u></strong></p><p>The Ecru project is located on the northeast margin of Nevada Gold Mine's Cortez Trend land position (the Cortez Complex<sup>1</sup>) within the larger Battle Mountain - Eureka trend. The property consists of 112 lode-mining claims <percent>100%</percent> owned by Orogen and two leased sections. The project lies immediately adjacent to Nevada Gold Mines' 2.4 Moz Robertson reduced intrusion related gold deposit<sup>1</sup> (Figure 1).</p><p>Two main target areas are located on the property and demonstrate the potential for both Carlin and Robertson-style mineralization (Figure 2).</p><p>The shallower intrusive target is defined by a two-kilometre diameter area of multiple magnetic highs and adjacent gravity lows, interpreted to reflect intrusive bodies and associated alteration within upper‑plate siliciclastic rocks. Multiple intrusive phases are present on the property, both at surface and in historical drill intercepts. These multi‑phase intrusives and the surrounding rock exhibit characteristics and geochemical signatures analogous to the Robertson deposit.</p><p>A potential Carlin-type system is defined by an untested, prominent gravity high target interpreted to be a region of structurally uplifted lower plate carbonates near surface, under pediment cover. Nearby historical drilling has identified anomalous gold and pathfinder geochemistry in upper plate stratigraphy which supports the potential for a mineralized, lower plate carbonate window at Ecru.</p><p>Quebec Nickel plans to evaluate the potential for both deposit types on the property.</p><a href=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/bdbbbf6b-4bb9-443c-b0ca-2e40b3395753/1142121/orogen-fig1-022626.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/bdbbbf6b-4bb9-443c-b0ca-2e40b3395753/1142121/orogen-fig1-022626.jpg\" style=\"text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto;\" width=\"566\"/></a><figcaption><strong>Figure 1: Location of the Ecru project.
