As development accelerates, becomes more automated, and relies more heavily on third-party components, risk is increasingly shaped by the software supply chain and the tools used to build and deploy applications - not just the code that runs in production.</p> <p>Key findings at a glance:</p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:12pt;\"><percent>87%</percent> of organizations have at least one known exploitable vulnerability in deployed services</li><li style=\"margin-top:10pt;\"><percent>42%</percent> of services rely on libraries that are no longer actively maintained</li><li style=\"margin-top:10pt;\">Services using end-of-life language versions face exploitable vulnerabilities in <percent>50%</percent> of cases, compared to <percent>31%</percent> for supported versions</li><li style=\"margin-top:10pt;\"><percent>50%</percent> of organizations adopt new library versions within 24 hours of release, increasing the risk of installing malicious or compromised software</li><li style=\"margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:12pt;\">Only <percent>4%</percent> of organizations pin all public GitHub Actions to a specific version using commit hashes, leaving CI/CD pipelines vulnerable to silent code changes<br/><br/></li></ul> <p><strong>Security Risk Increasing at Both Ends of the Lifecycle</strong></p> <p>On one end, software is aging faster than teams can keep it up to date. The median software dependency is now 278 days out of date - 63 days further behind than last year.</p> <p>At the same time, third-party software accelerates development but introduces risk when implicitly trusted. Datadog researchers found that half of organizations (<percent>50%</percent>) adopt new library versions within 24 hours of release, and only <percent>4%</percent> pin all public GitHub Actions to a specific version using commit hashes.</p> <p>As a result, build and deployment pipelines are increasingly exposed to silent changes in third-party code, making CI/CD systems a critical supply-chain risk.</p> <p>“The way software is built has fundamentally changed, but security practices haven’t kept up,” said Andrew Krug, Head of Security Advocacy at Datadog. “DevSecOps teams are caught between moving too slowly and moving too fast. Go slow, and outdated software accumulates known vulnerabilities. Go fast, and automation can introduce unvetted code. The real challenge, though, isn’t speed - it’s clarity. As environments grow more complex, AI-assisted workflows help ensure top priorities get attention first.”</p> <p><strong>Alert Volume Is Obscuring Real Risk</strong></p> <p>While vulnerability alerts continue to rise, the report also finds that most do not represent immediate business risk. Only <percent>18%</percent> of vulnerabilities labeled “critical” remain critical once runtime context is applied.</p> <p>“When almost everything is labeled ‘critical’, nothing is,” Krug added. “Teams get paged for noise while threats that pose real risk slip through. Without context, prioritization becomes harder - leading to burnout, slower response times and accumulated risk. Teams need better visibility into what <em>actually</em> requires action.”</p> <p>Read the full report, <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=UZ3UcXpxVfI9_CeA7JNfgIoxLXjDhx6WIfYpi4MXGURok8M-uScqRZiv7RcCvBRCyIR4d3wYNnJAuaHYdJigDM6jtHrddyaFkK8hfRTbTUsxPIBc_auStNStoPtmbJTq-qMuTvVKlpti6yDb-iamnA==\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>State of DevSecOps Report 2026</u></a>, to see how these findings are shaping modern approaches to detecting, prioritizing and remediating security risk.</p> <p><strong>Contact</strong><br/><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ofNna8sT1hFliTiZAJ9-ZpPpWWwuwFtuAF3yfXFT3AZn-wU4BYN2WB-p7euW6-s27Xi1qPSZZy79MmelrjbEgXcmcgWYhddYmx35Dsfjeis=\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>press@datadoghq.com</u></a></p> <p><strong>Report Methodology</strong></p> <p>Datadog analyzed telemetry from tens of thousands of applications to assess security risk across modern software environments, along with additional datasets used for specific findings.

He began his career as a faculty member in the Radiation Medicine Department at Georgetown University before moving to the pharmaceutical industry, where he led <em>in vivo</em> pharmacology teams with increasing responsibility at OSI Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer, and Verastem. He currently heads the Experimental Therapeutics Core at Dana-Farber, overseeing translational research programs that integrate genomics, molecular biology, patient-derived models, imaging and preclinical studies to advance novel therapeutic strategies.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Dr. Gokhale commented, “I am excited to join Akari’s Scientific Advisory Board and work alongside a team advancing a truly differentiated approach to ADC development. Unlike conventional payload strategies that rely on tubulin inhibitors or DNA-damaging agents, PH1 targets RNA splicing, a fundamental regulator of cancer cell biology. This novel mechanism offers the potential to disrupt tumor survival pathways while also drive unique innate and adaptive immune system engagement. I look forward to collaborating closely with the team to further refine the translational strategy and support the advancement of AKTX-101 into the clinic.”</p> <p align=\"justify\">Dr. Gokhale’s work has been widely published and funded, reflecting his leadership in transforming fundamental discoveries into clinical innovations for cancer and related diseases.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>About Akari Therapeutics </strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">Akari Therapeutics is an oncology biotechnology company developing next-generation antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) with a unique payload, PH1, which targets RNA splicing. Utilizing its innovative ADC discovery platform, the Company has the ability to generate ADC candidates and optimize them based on the desired application to any antigen target of interest. Akari’s lead candidate, AKTX-101, targets the Trop2 receptor on cancer cells and with a proprietary linker, enabling it to deliver its novel PH1 payload directly into the tumor with minimal off-target effects. Unlike current ADCs that use tubulin inhibitors and DNA damaging agents as their payloads, PH1 is a novel payload that is a spliceosome modulator designed to disrupt RNA splicing within cancer cells. This splicing modulation has been shown in preclinical animal models to induce cancer cell death while activating both the innate and adaptive immune system to drive robust and durable activity. In preclinical studies, AKTX-101 has shown to have significant activity and prolonged survival relative to ADCs with traditional payloads. Additionally, AKTX-101 has the potential to be synergistic with checkpoint inhibitors and has demonstrated prolonged survival as both a single agent and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. The PH1 payload has also been demonstrated to be very active against cancer cells with key oncogenic drivers such as KRAS, BRAF, ARV7, FGFR3 fusions, and others. The Company has initiated IND enabling studies for AKTX-101 with a goal of starting its First-In-Human trial by late 2026/early 2027. Akari is also developing AKTX-102, an ADC candidate targeting CEACAM5 (Carcinoembryonic Antigen-related Cell Adhesion Molecule-5), a well-validated tumor antigen broadly expressed across multiple solid tumors. AKTX-102 is designed to leverage Akari’s proprietary PH1 spliceosome-modulating payload and novel antibody construct to enable differentiated tumor cell killing and immune activation.</p> <p align=\"justify\">For more information about the Company, please visit <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ZBbqhES2PJnXlUs79ASX5UyKlEWVB8yY4Na9DctxihCZrY7QiefMwU5hrFWWjAw-YvWdjIxGzswifoU0ghJwkvnrKnwIv1NjG5SH4cBdtJ0=\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.akaritx.com</a> and connect on <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=165fpgLsKT2iW0UGbSRXojI7CCQGoM_Wnb54etgyNdJNUY30Zzj_qalJHNTYQ6yilwsCBMr4hSdWxqJe-i47PQ==\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">X</a> and <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=dtRnHe45SLNXeCj8Ukt1z56bqtNF1XRTlhFd2XSx7NGTYzrBCsd7JbTx1gBp981lX737Y5EvNSrXFp0vg9IFHwJfsFC7ykIQihvtziHbHWU=\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a>.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements </strong><br/><br/>This press release includes express or implied forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, about the Company that involve risks and uncertainties relating to future events and the future performance of the Company.

Rock-chip channel results there returned up to 6 meters at 2.3 grams per tonne gold and 70.9 ppm silver and individual rock-chip assays returned a maximum of 6.1 grams per tonne gold and 165 ppm silver (gold minimum 0.01 and mean 0.2 grams per tonne; silver minimum 0.01 and mean: 6.2 ppm). RC drilling intersected elevated bismuth, silver and tellurium over 10-15-meter intervals but did not replicate the surface gold grades. The Company interprets this geochemical signature as potentially indicative of a deeper intrusion-related gold system beneath the exposed vein array, warranting further evaluation.</p><p><b>Strategic Outlook</b></p><p>This phase of exploratory drilling has confirmed the potential of both gold-dominant sheeted vein systems and zinc-polymetallic skarn-style mineralization within the Jabal Sahabiyah project area.</p><p>The Company is currently reviewing strategic options for advancing the project. Given the distinct geological styles identified, Royal Road is evaluating pathways that could optimize value creation, including the potential introduction of a partner with specific expertise in zinc-polymetallic systems, while maintaining meaningful exposure to the gold exploration upside across the broader project area.</p><p>\"These results further confirm the presence of two distinct mineral systems at Jabal Sahabiyah,\" said Tim Coughlin, Royal Road's President and CEO. \"Through disciplined, low-cost exploration we have efficiently tested multiple targets and demonstrated meaningful gold continuity at Ash Shajjah and down-plunge zinc-polymetallic grades at Hanash North. The project now warrants focused follow-up. We are assessing the most effective pathway to advance Jabal Sahabiyah, potentially alongside a partner with specific zinc expertise while ensuring we retain meaningful exposure to the broader gold upside. Our approach remains grounded in technical rigor and disciplined capital allocation.\"</p><p><i><b>About Royal Road Minerals:</b></i></p><p><i>Royal Road Minerals is a mineral exploration and development company with its head office and technical-operations center located in Jersey, Channel Islands.

estimate or predict with reasonable certainty certain discrete tax items, which could significantly impact that financial measure. </p><p><b>Operational and Financial Metrics</b></p><p><b><i>Adjusted EBITDA </i></b>is net income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, net interest expense, other income (expense), income tax (expense) benefit, (gain) loss on foreign currency, (gain) loss on transfer of assets, reorganization costs, and other supplemental adjustments. Other supplemental adjustments include certain non-operating items such as stock-based compensation, executive severance costs, debt refinancing costs, acquisition-related expenses and other non-recurring charges. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when considered along with other performance measures, is a useful measure as it reflects certain operating drivers of the business, such as sales growth, operating costs, selling and administrative expense, and other operating income and expense. We believe Adjusted EBITDA helps provide a more complete understanding of the underlying operating results and trends and an enhanced overall understanding of our financial performance and prospects for the future. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements, such as unearned passenger revenues, capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments, and tax payments. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other companies within the industry.</p><p>The following metrics apply to the Lindblad segment:</p><p><b><i>Adjusted Net Cruise Cost </i></b>represents Net Cruise Cost adjusted for Non-GAAP other supplemental adjustments which include certain non-operating items such as stock-based compensation, reorganization costs and acquisition-related expenses.</p><p><b><i>Available Guest Nights </i></b>is a measurement of capacity available for sale and represents double occupancy per cabin (except single occupancy for a single capacity cabin) multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period.

(NYSE: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/VLN/\" title=\"View VLN stock overview\">VLN</a>). Valens Semiconductor posted 4Q25      revenue of <money>$19.4M</money>, significantly above guidance of <money>$18.2</money>-<money>$18.9M</money>, marking its seventh consecutive quarter of growth and up from <money>$17.3M</money> in 3Q25 and <money>$16.7M</money> in 4Q24. GAAP gross margin was <percent>60.5%</percent>      (nonGAAP <percent>63.9%</percent>), exceeding guidance while easing slightly from <percent>63.0%</percent> in 3Q25. Adjusted EBITDA loss of <money>$(4.3)M</money> was within guidance of <money>$(4.6)</money>-<money>$(4.2)M</money> range. While momentum remains solid,      near-term results are being modestly affected by tariffs in automotive and some FX pressure. Visibility remains mixed, but we expect steady growth through 2026 as ProAV normalizes, machine      vision and medical ramp, and automotive stabilizes with continued A-PHY progress. Support also comes from share repurchases, a <money>$5M</money> annual opex savings plan, and a new automotive win tied to the      Chinese market.</p> <p>      To view the full announcement, including downloadable images, bios, and more, <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/gJYwaT53e3\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">click here</a>.    </p> <p> <b>Key Takeaways:</b> </p> <ul> <li>4Q25 revenue beat guidance, marking seventh straight quarter of growth with solid margin execution.      </li> <li>Automotive momentum improved with sequential revenue growth, better margins, and a new China-linked design win.      </li> <li>Strong balance sheet and 2026 growth outlook offset near-term tariff, FX, and seasonal automotive headwinds.      </li> </ul> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/ppYwjT5ObX\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

            "title": "Antelope Enterprise Holdings Limited Launches “Genius Plan”，a Structured Digital Asset Management Strategy Amid BTC Market | AEHL Stock News",
            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p align=\"justify\">NEW YORK, NY, Feb.  26, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Antelope Enterprise Holdings Limited (NASDAQ: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/AEHL/\" title=\"View AEHL stock overview\">AEHL</a>, or the “Company”), today announced the launch of a structured digital asset management strategy - the “Genius Plan”, designed to establish a disciplined Bitcoin (BTC) allocation and capital recycling framework, as global markets focus on Bitcoin’s sharp decline and investor sentiment rapidly shifts toward fear, which clears the way for AEHL’s BTC deployment.</p> <p align=\"justify\">With BTC retreating from recent highs to nearly half its peak value, the Company views the current market zone as a strategically compelling entry opportunity. The “Genius Plan” represents not only an evolution of AEHL’s strategic treasury reserves and capital management framework, but also the potential emergence of a new crypto-equity linkage model between Wall Street and the digital asset ecosystem. The Company believes this initiative may inject renewed confidence into the currently subdued BTC market and serve as a guiding beacon for traditional capital entering the digital asset space.</p> <p align=\"justify\">AEHL believes that during periods of extreme market volatility, long-term outcomes are not determined by short-term emotional reactions, but by rigorous data analysis and structured execution systems.</p> <p>The “Genius Plan” will be implemented in five core phases:</p> <p><b>Step One: Establish Strategic Positioning</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">The Company will initiate its strategy with a <money>$1 million</money> BTC purchase as its starting position, executing an initial one-time acquisition. Subsequent purchases will be conducted in tranches rather than through a single concentrated allocation, gradually building a structured BTC holding framework.</p> <p align=\"justify\">On February 27, the Company will announce the first objective approved by its Board of Directors. Through phased accumulation, each tranche will create an independent cost anchor, providing a clear and disciplined basis for future strategic execution.</p> <p><b>Step Two: Activate the “Genius Harvester” Mechanism</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">When the market price rises <percent>1%</percent> relative to a specific cost anchor, the system will trigger a predefined partial-sale mechanism. For example, if a <money>$1 million</money> position appreciates to <money>$1.01 million</money>, the Company would sell <money>$10,000</money> worth of BTC.</p> <p align=\"justify\">This mechanism is designed to break down consolidation phases and high-volatility environments into quantifiable and executable trading units. By repeatedly capturing small wave movements, the Company aims to accumulate incremental gains — building layer upon layer — rather than passively waiting for a single “tsunami” move.</p> <p><b>Step Three: Launch the “Genius Recycler” Mechanism</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">Fifty percent of realized gains generated through the “Genius Harvester” will be specifically allocated toward the Company’s share repurchase program. Subject to Board authorization and applicable regulatory frameworks, the repurchase program will serve as a core pathway in AEHL’s shareholder return structure.</p> <p align=\"justify\">AEHL believes that if realized gains do not ultimately return to and reinforce shareholder value, capital strategy loses its fundamental meaning.</p> <p><b>Step Four: From “Zombie Holding” to Dynamic Management</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">AEHL emphasizes that it does not intend to become a passive holder that fails to realize gains during upswings and simply absorbs losses during downturns. Long-term conviction does not conflict with phased realization. Discipline does not contradict strategic vision.</p> <p>The Company chooses to rely on data-driven models rather than emotion-driven decision-making.</p> <p><b>Step Five: Real-Time Transparency</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">Management stated that relevant holdings and strategy execution data will be disclosed in real time through official channels including X, Momo, Tiger Trade, Snowball, LinkedIn, Weibo, and Rednote, ensuring transparency and timely communication with global investors.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Ms. <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TPCUEDcSsNg-8ByeOEucIgbCI6GN757aQSKa0IQKMqVKbgpUHvpzBCoEpht61bD9i3OEnH1WpiIoNSZupQDopt8y3PssZSKAv_niNxwWqd0q69fkNI-hz3Xqwt2RAZOA63eTXzQ_4MbaBf-UVbg4rVviGbA-4xioqyh18MaAmXJi58ow-1WskOp8peXTmtxnYOq2QnHkSqzJLR4OPDnN2dTzsSPVliuD0oulzhzyTlcdftrUEBpWYQysLxM30E6CIIbhYYzE3K_mY5vHCac-uL4-jAJezAsf_vGACVj_DZq14b1Wcg9_VJcxYG3vyTPcFPq_Mf__RdUzonxA1TGAjgncyy9OOmnskMt2dMo7PPmePcsDZaPk1RKvK33y879wKPiwOkc454EJTfuBx8Vbp4NquDjTwNsAukpE0zUYTShOe2Ex3bFIQAkxRaynB4vorQuORhrj-46iJG8MfR6KTDeNHghwkGwb_bOKdaYDCBF5xNAF1PjE5wwL2Yy4gSOB8UJNguAqU-kVbkoS-u-J5pmBRcAemBPriLgB7EGDVttU6NfgkDSW99ZB5UPFVIYAF8Ctr7eRS_gUWXQfqW_x0LTR0CbCxjg4ON8QK8d-0ctbKgSp92QQPtisgQmZYMMN0mOAO9xSiam13pvr2Pq5_BFWG-0Tt7TJEHkcVKqVzYBK7Nh0dqIEbNdOQkn8HoZR947P_Pil7c99Dh3XKWpiVg==\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tingting Zhang</a>, Chief Executive Officer of Antelope Enterprise Holdings Limited, commented: “We are committed to building a structured capital loop connecting digital assets and equity markets: Financing → Digital Asset Allocation → Profit Realization → Share Repurchase → Enterprise Value Enhancement → Refinancing.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Markets may swing violently, but companies must maintain structural clarity.
