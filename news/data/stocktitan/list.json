(the \"2022 Feasibility Study\", Table 3). </p><p>Changes to the Hammerdown deposit MRE in the 2022 Feasibility Study primarily reflect the application of new estimation parameters informed by increased data confidence from the tightly spaced grade control drilling completed in 2024 and 2025. Specifically, tighter distance constraints were applied to high grade intervals, which affected overall grade and ultimately reduced it relative to the previous estimate. Additional changes include an increase in resources classified as inferred due to missing data validation needed to confirm the positions of historically mined out underground stopes. New optimization parameters also contribute to loss in contained ounces, as well as additional depletion of historically mined stopes. The methodology used to report the MRE in a narrow-vein environment also contributes to lower grades as more waste is accounted for as must-take material. Adjusted cut-off grades and the reporting methodology contributed to the increase in contained metal. The Orion and Stog'er Tight deposits were not included in the 2022 Feasibility Study.</p><p><b>Table 3:</b> Hammerdown Gold Project Consolidated MRE Compared to 2022 Feasibility Study<sup>3</sup>.</p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 100%;

Run of mine (\"ROM\") mineable material from the Hammerdown and Orion deposits will be sent to the on-site crushing and sorting plant to produce mill feed that will be hauled to Pine Cove for final processing. A total of 4,354 Mt of ROM mineable material is scheduled to be mined from all open pits with a diluted grade averaging 2.19 g/t Au. A total of 48.0 Mt of non-acid generating waste rock will also be produced and stored in a waste rock stockpile adjacent to the open pits. The open pits have been designed and scheduled to maximize project NPV. Pit slope optimization has been undertaken based on geotechnical data collected between 2020 and 2021. The Hammerdown deposit's open pit development consists of two phases of pushbacks with overburden thickness averaging less than 2 m. </p><p>Mining will be completed by conventional drilling, blasting, loading and hauling on 4 m benches in mineralized material and 8 m benches in waste where practical at the Hammerdown deposit and 5 m benches at the Orion and Stog'er Tight deposits. Waste loading and haulage will be handled by 3 m<sup>3</sup> hydraulic excavators and 41-tonne payload articulated haul trucks. Mineralized material loading and hauling will be handled by a fleet of 2 m<sup>3</sup> hydraulic excavators with a 7 m<sup>3</sup> front end loader as backup and 38 tonne payload articulated haul trucks. </p><p>Grade control in the open pit is a key part of the mining process and will be accomplished through a combination of 4 to 5 m bench heights with 2 m flitches, controlled blasting, 50,000 m of close spaced diamond drilling (15 m centres, 10 m vertically) to identify and report vein orientations and grades to the mine planners, selective excavation under GPS control, and mine geological control. The sorting process is integrated to remove dilution taken with the narrow veins during the mining process. </p><p><b>Processing and Recovery</b></p><p>Pine Cove was commissioned on low grade stockpiles in 2025 and commenced processing Hammerdown deposit mineable material in Q4/25.</p><p>The mineralized material from the Hammerdown, Orion and Stog'er Tight deposits will be processed at Pine Cove, a fully permitted processing plant and in-pit tailings facility.  Mineable material from the three deposits will be trucked to the Mill and processed at a nominal rate of 700 tpd.  The flowsheet consists of a ball mill and flotation circuit that produces a gold-pyrite concentrate, cyanide leach, filtration and Merrill Crowe gold recovery circuit. </p><p>The process plant average gold recovery for the zones being mined from year 1 to year 4 is estimated to be <percent>87.2%</percent> and <percent>84.3%</percent> thereafter, with LOM average gold recovery of <percent>85.5%</percent>. </p><p>The Company has recently purchased a sorter which it plans to commission in H2/26. Sorting at the Hammerdown deposit is expected to commence in 2027, at the Orion deposit in 2033 and once commenced, continue over the LOM at these two deposits.</p><p><b>Additional Value Potential from Exploration Upside</b></p><p>Hammerdown hosts multiple gold-bearing trends with potential for resource growth and new discovery over the 44,650 hectare land package. To date, only limited near surface work has been completed across large portions of the land holdings, yet the Project presents a broad pipeline of early- to advanced-stage exploration targets. Near resource expansion opportunities remain strong at the Hammerdown, Orion, and Stog'er Tight deposits, where drilling to date has largely been confined to the upper 220 m with minimal lateral testing along key structural corridors (Figure 3). The limited deeper testing that has been completed to date has intersected mineralisation at vertical depths of up to 400 m at the Orion deposit, highlighting the opportunity for continued resource growth at depth.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/7337/285504_5cc229df2479f9df_003full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

(\"Maritime\"), Signal Gold Inc. (\"Signal Gold\"), as well as previous operators. Rock samples were obtained during prospecting programs, geological mapping, channel sampling, and diamond drilling campaigns. Sampling media include, outcrop and channel samples, interpreted to represent in place bedrock; float samples of uncertain origin that may have been transported by glacial or surficial processes; subcrop samples derived from low lying or partially exposed material that may reflect underlying bedrock but cannot be assumed to be in situ; and diamond drill core.</font></p><p><font>Historic operators employed a variety of location control methods, including cut lines and non GPS techniques, resulting in variable positional accuracy for older sample data. In contrast, Maritime and Signal Gold used handheld GPS units for geological mapping, prospecting, and a combination of handheld GPS and high-precision Trimble Differential GPS system for drill hole collar and channel sample locations.</font></p><p><font>Recent analytical work completed by Maritime and Signal Gold was performed by EAL of Springdale, NL. EAL is accredited to ISO 17025:2005 for a defined scope of analytical procedures and is independent of New Found Gold. Samples were delivered to the laboratory in sealed plastic bags by field personnel. At EAL, samples were dried, crushed, and pulped. Crushing was completed to approximately <percent>80%</percent> passing −10 mesh, after which a riffle splitter was used to obtain a ~250 g subsample. This subsample was pulverized using a ring mill to <percent>95%</percent> passing −150 mesh. A 30 g aliquot was selected from the pulped material for fire assay analysis.</font></p><p><font>EAL maintains a comprehensive internal QA/QC program including the routine insertion of standards, blanks, and duplicates within each analytical batch. In addition, for drill core and channel sampling only, Maritime and Signal Gold inserted CRMs, blanks, and duplicate samples into the sample stream to monitor assay accuracy and precision during drilling campaigns. Umpire check assays were periodically completed at an independent secondary laboratory to assess potential analytical bias, involving re-analysis of selected pulps and rejects. The EAL internal QA/QC program was relied on for grab samples.</font></p><p><font>Historical QA/QC information provided by prior operators is incomplete and cannot be fully verified. Database records indicate that the majority of historical analyses were performed by EAL; however, the absence of documented QA/QC protocols limits the ability to assess data reliability for older sampling.</font></p><p><i><b><font>Cautionary Statement</font></b></i></p><p><font>The PEA is preliminary in nature. It includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized.</font></p><p><b><font>Forward-Looking Information </font></b></p><p><font><i>This press release contains certain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Canadian securities legislation, including statements regarding bringing the recently acquired Hammerdown deposit into commercial production in H2/26; ramping up Pine Cove to full production; statements relating to Hammerdown's on-island processing, hauling, sorting and tailing facilities; advancing Queensway toward production in H2/27; commissioning of a sorter in H2/26; future exploration programs at Hammerdown and the timing and focus thereof; and continuing focused exploration at Queensway to grow resources and support future expansions. Although the Company believes that such statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts; they are generally, but not always, identified by the words \"expects\", \"plans\", \"anticipates\", \"believes\", \"interpreted\", \"intends\", \"estimates\", \"projects\", \"aims\", \"suggests\", \"indicate\", \"often\", \"target\", \"future\", \"likely\", \"pending\", \"potential\", \"encouraging\", \"goal\", \"objective\", \"prospective\", \"possibly\", \"preliminary\", and similar expressions, or that events or conditions \"will\", \"would\", \"may\", \"can\", \"could\" or \"should\" occur, or are those statements, which, by their nature, refer to future events. The Company cautions that forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs, estimates and opinions of the Company's management on the date the statements are made, and they involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Consequently, there can be no assurances that such statements will prove to be accurate and actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Except to the extent required by applicable securities laws and the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange, the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements if management's beliefs, estimates or opinions, or other factors, should change. Factors that could cause future results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements include risks associated with the Company's ability to complete exploration and drilling programs as expected, possible accidents and other risks associated with mineral exploration operations, the risk that the Company will encounter unanticipated geological factors, risks associated with the interpretation of exploration results and the results of the metallurgical testing program, the possibility that the Company may not be able to secure permitting and other governmental clearances necessary to carry out the Company's exploration plans, the risk that the Company will not be able to raise sufficient funds to carry out its business plans, and the risk of political uncertainties and regulatory or legal changes that might interfere with the Company's business and prospects.

These financial measures are not defined under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") and should not be considered in isolation. The Company believes that these financial measures, together with financial measures determined in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. The inclusion of these financial measures is meant to provide additional information and should not be used as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. These financial measures are not necessarily standard and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers.</font></i></p><p><i><b><font>All-in Sustaining Cost</font></b></i></p><p><i><font>All in sustaining cost is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated based on guidance published by the World Gold Council (\"WGC\"). The WGC is a market development organization for the gold industry and is an association whose membership comprises leading gold mining companies. Although the WGC is not a mining industry regulatory organization, it worked closely with its member companies to develop these metrics. Adoption of the all-in sustaining cost metric is voluntary and not necessarily standard, and therefore, this measure presented by the Company may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. The Company believes that the all-in sustaining cost measure complements existing measures and ratios reported by the Company.</font></i></p><p><i><font>All-in sustaining cost includes both operating and capital costs required to sustain gold production on an ongoing basis. Sustaining operating costs represent expenditures expected to be incurred at the Project that are considered necessary to maintain production. Sustaining capital represents expected capital expenditures comprising mine development costs, including capitalized waste, and ongoing replacement of mine equipment and other capital facilities, and does not include expected capital expenditures for major growth projects or enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements.</font></i></p><p><i><b><font>Cash Costs </font></b></i></p><p><i><font>Cash Costs are reflective of the cost of production. Cash Costs reported in the MRE include mining costs, processing and water treatment costs, general and administrative costs of the mine, refining and transportation costs, silver revenue credits and royalties.</font></i></p><p><i><b><font>Free Cash Flow</font></b></i></p><p><i><font>Free Cash Flows are revenues net of operating costs, royalties, working capital adjustments, capital expenditures and cash taxes.

We believe the execution of our plan will improve our liquidity profile and support greater financial stability going forward.”</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Fourth Quarter Highlights</strong></p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">LMM commercial real estate originations of <money>$235 million</money></li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Small Business Lending (“SBL”) loan originations of <money>$140 million</money>, including <money>$84 million</money> of Small Business Administration 7(a) loans and <money>$18 million</money> of United States Department of Agriculture loans</li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Book value of <money>$8.79</money> per share of common stock as of December 31, 2025</li></ul> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Full Year Highlights</strong></p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Total originations of <money>$1.8 billion</money> across all products</li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Completed the acquisition of United Development Funding IV, a real estate investment trust providing capital solutions to residential real estate developers and regional homebuilders</li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Completed the sale of GMFS, our Residential Mortgage Banking business</li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Secured ownership and control of the Portland, OR mixed-use asset via a consensual deed-in-lieu arrangement</li></ul> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Subsequent Events</strong></p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Completed the sale of 34 loans with an unpaid principal balance of <money>$855.3 million</money></li><li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Retired the remaining outstanding amount on the <percent>5.75%</percent> Senior Unsecured Note due February 2026</li></ul> <p align=\"justify\"><strong><em>Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information</em></strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">In addition to the results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this press release includes distributable earnings, formerly referred to as core earnings, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. The Company defines distributable earnings as net income adjusted for unrealized gains and losses related to certain mortgage backed securities (“MBS”) not retained by us as part of our loan origination business, realized gains and losses on sales of certain MBS, unrealized changes in our current expected credit loss reserve and valuation allowance, unrealized gains or losses on de-designated cash flow hedges, unrealized gains or losses on foreign exchange hedges, unrealized gains or losses on certain unconsolidated joint ventures, non-cash compensation expense related to our stock-based incentive plan, unrealized gains or losses on preferred equity, at fair value, unrealized gain or losses or other non-cash items related to real estate owned and one-time non-recurring gains or losses, such as gains or losses on discontinued operations, bargain purchase gains, or merger related expenses.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The Company believes that this non-U.S. GAAP financial information, in addition to the related U.S. GAAP measures, provides investors greater transparency into the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, including the determination of dividends. However, because distributable earnings is an incomplete measure of the Company's financial performance and involves differences from net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, it should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, the Company's net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of the Company's financial performance. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of distributable earnings may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies.</p> <p align=\"justify\">In calculating distributable earnings, Net Income (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) is adjusted to exclude unrealized gains and losses on MBS acquired by the Company in the secondary market but is not adjusted to exclude unrealized gains and losses on MBS retained by Ready Capital as part of its loan origination businesses, where the Company transfers originated loans into an MBS securitization and the Company retains an interest in the securitization. In calculating distributable earnings, the Company does not adjust Net Income (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) to take into account unrealized gains and losses on MBS retained by us as part of the loan origination businesses because the unrealized gains and losses that are generated in the loan origination and securitization process are considered to be a fundamental part of this business and an indicator of the ongoing performance and credit quality of the Company’s historical loan originations. In calculating distributable earnings, Net Income (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) is adjusted to exclude realized gains and losses on certain MBS securities considered to be non-distributable. Certain MBS positions are considered to be non-distributable due to a variety of reasons which may include collateral type, duration, and size.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Servicing rights relating to the Company’s small business commercial business are accounted for under ASC 860,<em> Transfer and Servicing</em>. In calculating distributable earnings, the Company does not exclude realized gains or losses on commercial MSRs, as servicing income is a fundamental part of Ready Capital’s business and is an indicator of the ongoing performance.</p> <p align=\"justify\">To qualify as a REIT, the Company must distribute to its stockholders each calendar year at least <percent>90%</percent> of its REIT taxable income (including certain items of non-cash income), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. There are certain items, including net income generated from the creation of MSRs, that are included in distributable earnings but are not included in the calculation of the current year’s taxable income. These differences may result in certain items that are recognized in the current period’s calculation of distributable earnings not being included in taxable income, and thus not subject to the REIT dividend distribution requirement until future years.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The table below reconciles Net Income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP to Distributable Earnings.</p> <table style=\"border-bottom: solid black 1pt ;

Approximately <percent>86%</percent> of assets sold to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> buyers, including <percent>39%</percent> purchased by Floridians, with the remaining <percent>14%</percent> purchased by international buyers as far away as <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/vn\">Vietnam</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/sa\">Saudi Arabia</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location>.</p><p>With assets sold through live onsite bidding, online participation and Timed Auction formats, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.orlndo\">Orlando</location> reflected broad global demand early in the year.

On day two, major equipment crossed the ramp for live bidding, marking a single-day revival of a format not seen in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.orlndo\">Orlando</location> since 2019. Then on day four, auctioneers called bids from the sound truck for one day only, bringing a familiar tradition back to the yard. Both moments added energy to the week while reinforcing how <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.orlndo\">Orlando</location> blends long-standing auction heritage with a global digital marketplace. The company also introduced its first invite-only Creator Day, offering digital creators behind-the-scenes access to the auction and extending the event’s reach to new online audiences through social and digital channels.</p><p>“We appreciate the customers who participated onsite and online, along with the creators who helped extend visibility beyond the yard,” Lawson said. “Their engagement reflects the confidence the industry places in our marketplace and in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.orlndo\">Orlando</location> as a key moment on the equipment calendar.”</p><p>For more information about upcoming Ritchie Bros. auctions, visit <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rbauction.com%2F&amp;esheet=54434664&amp;newsitemid=20260226865545&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=rbauction.com&amp;index=1&amp;md5=501a63977cff22b4b66843cb3e2cf081\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">rbauction.com</a>.</p><p><b>About RB Global</b></p><p>RB Global, Inc.

Revenues for Q3-FY26 decreased <percent>25%</percent> from <money><money>$1.3 million</money></money> of revenue in Q3-FY25, primarily due to a decline in software and subscription services revenue from two previously disclosed non-renewals in Fiscal 2025.</li><li>Annual Recurring Revenue (\"ARR\"), a non-IFRS measure, at December 31, 2025 was <money><money>$3.8 million</money></money>.

The improvement over Q2-FY26 is due to a decrease in cost of sales, primarily hosting costs that are anticipated to continue at a lower rate.

This represented an <percent>18%</percent> sequential improvement over Q2-FY26 due to an increase in revenues and a decrease in costs.

The world's largest social media company renewed its services agreement for another year, extending the partnership and expanding the scope of work. A large global multinational IT services firm, both a customer and partner, also expanded its engagement. A leading global chemical manufacturer continues to expand its use of Unity Central to improve supply chain visibility and enhance AI-driven information management.</li></ul><p><b>Subsequent to Q3-FY26 Operational Highlights:</b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>On January 6, 2026, the Company announces the expansion and extension of its contract with a leading global IT services firm to support a top‑five <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> financial institution. Boardwalktech and the global IT services firm have been jointly servicing this marquee <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> bank since 2024, transforming manual workflows and processes into automated and compliant solutions running on the Boardwalktech Velocity platform</li><li>On January 20, 2026, the Company announced the launch of Boardwalk Verity™, its next‑generation Intelligent Controls Platform. Purpose‑built for highly regulated organizations, including banks, insurers, and global financial institutions, Verity leverages Generative AI and Agentic AI for controls automation, execution, validation, testing, and continuous monitoring across thousands of business controls.</li></ul><p><b>Management Commentary </b></p><p>\"We continue to see existing customers expand deployments across Velocity and our Digital Ledger platform,\" said Andrew T. Duncan, CEO of Boardwalktech. \"Recent upgrade initiatives and new opportunities are expected to drive incremental professional services revenue and increase high-margin ARR. During the quarter, we enhanced Velocity with AI capabilities and subsequent to quarter-end we formally launched Verity, our first purpose-built AI product focused on automating internal controls testing and monitoring for financial institutions. Early traction with large banks and global partners reinforces our confidence in Verity as a meaningful growth driver. Unity Central also continues to gain momentum with AI enhancements improving enterprise data management and one supply chain customer already live and expanding usage based on measurable ROI. With previous cost reductions now taking effect and improved operating efficiency, we remain focused on accelerating revenue growth and moving toward Adjusted EBITDA breakeven in the near term. We believe the combination of Verity's launch, Velocity expansion, partner leverage, and continued cost discipline sets the stage for improved year-over-year performance and organic growth into Fiscal 2027 and beyond.\"</p><p><b>About Boardwalktech Software Corp.</b></p><p>Boardwalktech has developed a patented Digital Ledger Technology Platform currently used by Fortune 500 companies running mission-critical applications worldwide.

These Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income or loss as a measure of its operating performance. FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDA<i>re</i>, Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel EBITDA, and Hotel EBITDA Margin, as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company defines such terms.</p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">Funds From Operations (“FFO”)</span></b></p><p>The Company calculates Funds from Operations (“FFO”) in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which defines FFO as net income or loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus depreciation and amortization, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have instead historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most real estate industry investors consider FFO to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company’s operations. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), even though FFO does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders.</p><p>The Company’s calculation of FFO may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use NAREIT's definition of FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. Additionally, FFO may not be helpful when comparing the Company to non-REITs. The Company presents FFO attributable to common shareholders, which includes unitholders of limited partnership interest (“OP units”) in RLJ Lodging Trust, L.P., the Company’s operating partnership, because the OP units may be redeemed for common shares of the Company. The Company believes it is meaningful for the investor to understand FFO attributable to all common shares and OP units.</p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">EBITDA and EBITDA<i>re</i></span></b></p><p>Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is defined as net income or loss excluding: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sales of assets; and (3) depreciation and amortization expense. The Company considers EBITDA useful to an investor in evaluating and facilitating comparisons of its operating performance between periods and between REITs by removing the impact of its capital structure (primarily interest expense) and asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense) from its operating results. In addition, EBITDA is used as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions.</p><p>In addition to EBITDA, the Company presents EBITDA<i>re</i> in accordance with NAREIT guidelines, which defines EBITDA<i>re </i>as net income or loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax benefit or expense, depreciation and amortization expense, gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. The Company believes that the presentation of EBITDA<i>re</i> provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs.</p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">Adjustments to FFO and EBITDA</span></b></p><p>The Company adjusts FFO, EBITDA, and EBITDA<i>re</i> for certain items that the Company considers outside the normal course of operations. The Company believes that Adjusted FFO, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding its ongoing operating performance that, when considered with net income or loss, FFO, EBITDA, and EBITDA<i>re</i>, are beneficial to an investor’s understanding of the Company's operating performance. The Company adjusts FFO, EBITDA, and EBITDA<i>re</i> for the following items:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li><i>Transaction Costs:</i> The Company excludes transaction costs expensed during the period</li><li><i>Pre-Opening Costs:</i> The Company excludes certain costs related to pre-opening of hotels</li><li><i>Non-Cash Expenses:</i> The Company excludes the effect of certain non-cash items such as the amortization of share-based compensation, non-cash income tax expense or benefit, and non-cash interest expense related to discontinued interest rate hedges</li><li><i>Other Non-Operational Expenses:</i> The Company excludes the effect of certain non-operational expenses representing income and expenses outside the normal course of operations</li></ul><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">Hotel EBITDA and Hotel EBITDA Margin</span></b></p><p>With respect to Consolidated Hotel EBITDA, the Company believes that excluding the effect of corporate-level expenses and certain non-cash items provides a more complete understanding of the operating results over which individual hotels and operators have direct control. The Company believes property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operational performance of the Company’s hotels and the effectiveness of third-party management companies.</p><p>Comparable Hotel EBITDA and Comparable Hotel EBITDA margin include prior ownership information provided by the sellers of the hotels for periods prior to our acquisition of the hotels and excludes results from sold hotels as applicable.
