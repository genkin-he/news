Our management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate operating performance, to forecast future results and as a basis for compensation. The Company believes this is an important supplemental measure of operating performance because it eliminates items that have less bearing on its operating performance and highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. The Company believes the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful for investors because it enables them to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company’s management, helps improve their ability to understand the Company’s operating performance and makes it easier to compare the Company’s results with other companies that may have different depreciation and amortization policies, non-cash share-based payment costs, impairment of long-lived assets, workforce reorganization costs, termination costs, system optimization costs, satellite transition costs, acquisition and transition related costs and advisor fees.</p><p>Adjusted OIBDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenue.

In addition, Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin have the limitation of not reflecting the effect of the Company’s non-cash share-based payment costs, impairment of long-lived assets, workforce reorganization costs, termination of the Regal ESA, system optimization costs, satellite transition costs, acquisition and transition related costs, and advisor fees related to involvement in the Cineworld proceeding and Chapter 11 case. Adjusted OIBDA should not be regarded as an alternative to operating income, net income or as indicators of operating performance, nor should it be considered in isolation of, or as substitutes for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that operating income is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted OIBDA, and operating margin is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted OIBDA margin. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these non-GAAP presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, or calculations in NCM LLC’s debt agreement.</p><p>The Company has not provided a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP Adjusted OIBDA measure to forward-looking GAAP operating income due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of impacts outside of the Company’s control on certain items, including the timing of revenue and charges reflected in our reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which, based on historical experience, could be significant and are difficult to reasonably predict. Accordingly, a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort.</p><p>The following table reconciles the Company's operating loss and operating margin to Adjusted

financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>. Adjusted net income (loss) and income (loss) per share are calculated using reported net income (loss) and income (loss) per share and exclude workforce reorganization costs, system optimization costs, satellite transition costs, Spotlight acquisition and integration costs, advisor fees related to the Cineworld proceeding and Chapter 11 case and (gain) loss on re-measurement of the payable to ESA Parties under the tax receivable agreement. Our management use these non-GAAP financial measures as an additional tool to evaluate operating performance. The Company believes these are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they eliminate items that have less bearing on its operating performance and so highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. The Company believes the presentation of these measures is relevant and useful for investors because it enables them to view performance in a manner similar to a method used by the Company’s management and helps improve their ability to understand the Company’s operating performance. Adjusted net income (loss) and income (loss) per share should not be regarded as alternatives to net income (loss) and income (loss) per share or as indicators of operating performance, nor should they be considered in isolation of, or as substitutes for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that net income (loss) and income (loss) per share are the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.</p><p>The following table reconciles as reported

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><strong id=\"dateline\">TORONTO, ON / <a href=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ACCESS Newswire</a> / February 27, 2026 / </strong><strong>Sterling Metals Corp. (TSXV:SAG)(OTCQB:SAGGF) (\"Sterling\" or the \"Company\")</strong> is pleased to report additional assay results from its expanded and completed 2025 drilling program at the Soo Copper Project (\"<strong>Soo Copper</strong>\" or the \"<strong>Project\"</strong>) located near Batchewana Bay, Ontario. Results from 6 additional drill holes continue to expand the copper mineralized footprint, while further defining and extending the high-grade bornite zone. Assays remain pending for the final 5 holes drilled within the core of the MEPS discovery area.</p><p><strong>Highlights:</strong></p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><p>Systematic step-out and infill drilling within the MEPS zone confirms continuous copper mineralization from surface across approximately 400m of east-west strike, centered on discovery hole MEPS-25-02 and remains open (see Figure 1 and 2).</p></li><li><p>A 30m expansion of the high-grade bornite zone in MEPS-25-18, highlighted by the highest-grade individual copper sample intersected to date of <strong><percent>38.9%</percent> Cu over 0.3m </strong>in MEPS-25-18 at 227.4m (see Figure 2) that is included within a high grade bornite-rich interval grading 24m of <percent>2.05%</percent> CuEq and also within a broader 237.2m interval grading <percent>0.5%</percent> CuEq.</p></li><li><p>New high-grade zone associated with the GFP felsic porphyry dykes and adjacent magnetite veining at shallow depths in holes MEPS-25-14, 15 and 16, including a highlighted interval in MEPS-25-16 of 13.55m grading <percent>2.04%</percent> CuEq from 96.35m depth within a larger interval of 177.3m of <percent>0.4%</percent> CuEq and a broader interval of 419.9m of <percent>0.3%</percent>CuEq.</p></li><li><p>Magnetite veins associated with early GFP felsic dykes remain the dominant hosts of the highest-grade copper sulphide mineralization observed to date, with later felsic porphyry dykes and alteration events hosting lower grade copper mineralization, supporting the interpretation that this discovery zone is situated above a large, multi-stage porphyry-style copper system.</p></li></ul><p>Jeremy Niemi, SVP Exploration and Development, commented, \"We are very excited about these wide intervals of copper from surface and, importantly, the systematic expansion of the high-grade bornite zone by 150 metres around the discovery hole MEPS-25-02. Each step-out hole has successfully extended the zone either laterally or vertically, demonstrating strong continuity of the high-grade core within a much broader copper system. The mineralization remains open in most directions, and we are beginning to see clear structural and grade trends emerging that will guide our 2026 resource-focused drilling.\"</p><p><strong>High-Grade Copper Zone Continues to Develop</strong></p><p>In addition to establishing a broad, continuous zone of copper mineralization from surface, results from new drill hole intervals continue to identify and expand the high-grade bornite zone first recognized in MEPS-25-02. Step-out drilling has now systematically extended this zone in multiple directions and increased confidence in the continuity and scale of the high-grade zone which the Company anticipates will come to surface.</p><p>Hole MEPS-25-14 extended the bornite mineralization approximately 50m east of MEPS-25-02. Follow-up hole MEPS-25-15 stepped a further 30m east, bringing the eastern expansion to 80m from the discovery hole. Hole MEPS-25-16, drilled beneath MEPS-25-15, extended the bornite zone approximately 40m vertically, demonstrating depth continuity within the high-grade domain. Hole MEPS-25-17 then pushed the eastern extent another 40m, expanding bornite mineralization to approximately 120m east of MEPS-25-02.</p><p>To the west, MEPS-25-18 intersected high-grade bornite mineralization approximately 30m beyond MEPS-25-02, confirming expansion in that direction and bringing the total newly defined east-west strike extension of the bornite zone to approximately 150m.</p><p>Importantly, these step-outs demonstrate not only lateral continuity but also vertical development of the high-grade bornite core within a much broader, near-surface envelope of chalcopyrite-dominant copper mineralization. The bornite mineralization remains open along strike and at depth and is a key focus for the planned 2026 drill program.</p><a href=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/65e536f2-9f4f-486c-a56a-21bf45d06558/1142049/figonesm.png\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/65e536f2-9f4f-486c-a56a-21bf45d06558/1142049/figonesm.png\" style=\"width:720px;text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto;\"/></a><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Figure 1.

services were provided by Actlabs, which is an independent, CALA- and SCC-accredited analytical services firm registered to ISO 17025 and ISO 9001 standard. Drill core samples were logged and split in half with a diamond core saw. Half-core samples were securely stored at the core logging facility until being delivered to Actlabs Thunder Bay lab by commercial transport. Samples were crushed (&lt; 7 kg) up to 90% passing 2mm (10 mesh), riffle split to 250 g and pulverized by mild steel to 95% passing 105μm (150 mesh). Samples splits underwent a 4-acid near total digestion followed by a multi-element analysis, including base metals, using an ICP method for 35 elements. Selected sample pulps were then analyzed for gold using a 30 g aliquot mixed with fire assay fluxes and Ag as a collector, placed in a fire clay crucible, gradually heated to 1060ºC for 60 min, and followed with an AA finish.</p><p>Laboratory QA/QC for the ICP analysis was <percent>14%</percent> for each batch, including 5 method reagent blanks, 10 in-house controls, 10 samples duplicates, and 8 certified reference materials. An additional <percent>13%</percent> QA/QC was performed as part of the instrumental analysis to ensure quality in the areas of instrumental drift. Laboratory quality control for the gold fire assay included two blanks per 42 samples, three sample duplicates and 2 certified reference materials, one high and one low (QC 7 out of 42 samples). In-house QA/QC included the systematic insertion of blanks, duplicates, and certified reference materials (CRM).</p><p><strong>Qualified Person</strong></p><p>Jeremy Niemi, P.Geo., Senior Vice President, Exploration and Evaluation for Sterling Metals has reviewed and approved the technical information presented herein.</p><p><strong>About the Soo Copper Project</strong></p><p>The Soo Copper Project sits just 20 minutes off the Trans-Canada Highway, one hour north of Sault Ste. Marie, and 20km from rail and deep-water access. With near-surface copper-one of the most critical of all critical metals-alongside gold, and with the project now demonstrating both scale and grade, Sterling sees the potential for Soo Copper to become a nationally significant asset as Canada accelerates its efforts to secure strategic copper resources. Prime Minister Carney's recent designation of copper as one of Canada's first five strategic assets underscores the importance of this discovery and its potential to emerge as a key project of national interest.</p><p><strong>About Sterling Metals</strong></p><p>Sterling Metals is a mineral exploration company focused on large scale and high-grade Canadian exploration opportunities. The Company is advancing the 25,000-hectare Soo Copper Project in Ontario which has past production, and multiple breccia and porphyry targets strategically located near robust infrastructure and the 29,000-hectare Adeline Project in Labrador which covers an entire sediment-hosted copper belt with significant silver credits. Both opportunities have demonstrated potential for important new copper discoveries, underscoring Sterling's commitment to pioneering exploration in mineral rich Canada.</p><p>Sterling Metals acknowledges that its exploration activities within the Soo Copper project are conducted on the traditional lands of the Batchewana, Garden River, and Michipicoten First Nations of the North Shore of Lake Superior. We recognize and respect the longstanding and diverse relationships Indigenous Peoples have with the land and are committed to engaging in a manner that is respectful, transparent, and inclusive.</p><p><strong>For more information, please contact:</strong></p><p>Sterling Metals Corp.<br/>Mathew Wilson, CEO and Director</p><p>Tel: (416) 643-3887<br/>Email: <a href=\"mailto:info@sterlingmetals.ca\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">info@sterlingmetals.ca</a><br/>Website: <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3vp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.sterlingmetals.ca</a></p><p><i>Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.

the impact of the market value of digital assets on the Company’s ability to satisfy its financial obligations, including any debt financings; unrealized fair value gains on its digital asset holdings subjecting the Company to the corporate alternative minimum tax; legal, commercial, regulatory and technical uncertainty regarding digital assets and enhanced regulatory oversight of companies holding digital assets including the possibility that regulators reclassify any digital assets the Company holds, including Bitcoin, as a security causing the Company to be in violation of securities laws and be classified as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940; competition by other Bitcoin treasury companies and the availability of spot-traded products for Bitcoin; enhanced regulatory oversight as a result of the Company’s Investment Policy and related treasury strategy; the possibility of experiencing greater fraud, security failures or operational problems on digital asset trading venues compared to trading venues for more established asset classes, and any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the underlying blockchain protocols, or other technological difficulties, may prevent access to or use of such digital assets; the concentration of the Company’s expected digital asset holdings relative to non-digital assets; the inability to use the Company’s digital asset holdings as a source of liquidity to the same extent as cash and cash equivalents, due to, for example, risks associated with digital assets and other risks inherent to its entirely electronic, virtual form and decentralized network; the Company or a third-party service provider experiencing a security breach or cyber-attack where unauthorized parties obtain access to its digital assets; the loss of access to or theft or data loss of the Company’s digital assets, which could be unrecoverable due to the immutable nature of blockchain transactions; if the Company elects to hold its digital assets through a third-party custodian, the loss of direct control over its digital assets and dependence on the custodian’s security practices and operational integrity which may lead to the loss of its digital assets as a result of the insolvency of the custodian, theft by employees or insiders of the custodian or if the custodian’s security measures are comprised, including as a result of a cyber-attack; the Company not being subject to the legal and regulatory protections applicable to investment companies such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, or to obligations applicable to investment advisers; the non-performance, breach of contract or other violations by counterparties assisting the Company in effecting its Investment Policy and related treasury strategy; the Company’s future capital requirements and sources and uses of cash, including funds to satisfy its liquidity needs; the Company’s ability to raise capital and investments in it, including by its Chief Executive Officer; changes in the market in which the Company competes, including with respect to its competitive landscape, technology evolution or changes in applicable laws or regulations; changes in the markets that the Company targets; volatility and disruptions in the digital asset, digital payments and stablecoin markets that subject the Company to additional risks, including the risk that banks may not provide banking services to the Company and market sentiments regarding digital assets, digital payments and stablecoins; the possibility that the Company may be adversely affected by other macroeconomic, geopolitical, business, and/or competitive factors; the Company’s ability to launch new services and products, including with its expected commercial partners, or to profitably expand into new markets and services; the Company’s ability to execute its growth strategies, including identifying and executing acquisitions and divestitures and the Company’s initiatives to add new clients; the Company’s ability to reach definitive agreements with its expected commercial counterparties; the Company’s failure to comply with extensive government regulations, oversight, licensure and appraisals; uncertain and evolving regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, stablecoins, digital payments and digital assets;

the impact of any goodwill or other intangible assets impairments on the Company’s operating results; the possibility, as a result of the Company’s lack of control over DTR, that DTR will not continue to make available, support or develop technology currently licensed pursuant to the existing commercial agreement with DTR; the Company’s ability to maintain the listing of its securities on the New York Stock Exchange; and other risks and uncertainties indicated in the Company’s filings with the SEC, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, the quarter ended June 30, 2025 and the quarter ended September 30, 2025, and the risks regarding the Company’s adoption of its Investment Policy set forth in Exhibit 99.1 to the June 10, 2025 8-K.</p> <p>You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

Giglia, Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"Our portfolio outperformed our expectations in the fourth quarter delivering impressive Total RevPAR growth of <percent>12.5%</percent> as the benefit of our recent investment activity added to generally broad-based strength across our portfolio. We were particularly encouraged by stronger performance at Andaz Miami Beach and Wailea Beach Resort which saw robust demand over the festive period with the momentum continuing into 2026.\"</p><p>Mr. Giglia continued, \"While macroeconomic uncertainty and other factors impeded industry growth in 2025, we nevertheless had a productive year at Sunstone. We recycled out of a lower growth hotel and used the proceeds to accretively repurchase our stock, debuted Andaz Miami Beach, completed other capital investments intended to drive future growth, and returned over <money><money>$170 million</money></money> to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. While we see reasons to be optimistic about the year ahead, we remain cautious and know the operating environment can be impacted, both positively and negatively, by events outside of our control. In 2026, we will continue to execute our strategy of recycling capital, investing in our portfolio, and returning capital to shareholders while working to address the valuation discount at which we trade. We have an exceptional portfolio with meaningful growth potential, a flexible balance sheet with optionality, a nimble size that allows us to pivot among the most accretive capital allocation opportunities, and a singular focus to realize the embedded value of our portfolio for our shareholders.\"</p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"prnbcc\"><tr><td

In May 2025, the Company opened Andaz Miami Beach, following a complete transformation of the property. The fully renovated luxury resort had a strong finish in 2025 and is expected to generate meaningful earnings growth for the Company in 2026 during its first full year of operations. Later this year, the resort will introduce Olazul, a members only beach club and will also debut Bazaar Meat, a signature dining destination by José Andrés Group. In addition to substantial earnings growth in 2026, the Company expects Andaz Miami Beach will contribute further to earnings in 2027 and 2028 as it ramps up and stabilizes.</p><p><i>Hilton New Orleans St. Charles Disposition</i>. In June 2025, the Company sold the 252-room Hilton New Orleans St. Charles for a gross sale price of <money><money>$47.0 million</money></money>. The sale price represented an <percent>8.7%</percent> cap rate on the hotel's prior year earnings or a <percent>6.6%</percent> cap rate inclusive of the Company's estimate of near-term capital expenditures. The Company utilized proceeds received from the sale to accretively repurchase shares of its common stock.</p><p><i>Stock Repurchase Program</i>. During 2025, the Company repurchased an aggregate amount of <money><money>$103.6 million</money></money>, before expenses, of its common and preferred stock. In addition, from the start of this year through February 26, 2026, the Company has allocated an additional <money><money>$7.5 million</money></money>, before expenses, into repurchases of its common and preferred stock. The Company believes this repurchase activity has been done on a discounted basis and generated significant value for its shareholders.</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li><i>Common stock</i>: During 2025, the Company repurchased 11,589,722 shares at an average purchase price per share of <money><money>$8.83</money></money> for a total repurchase amount before expenses of <money><money>$102.4 million</money></money>. From the start of this year through February 26, 2026, the Company has repurchased 639,355 shares at an average purchase price per share of <money><money>$8.88</money></money> for a total repurchase amount before expenses of <money><money>$5.7 million</money></money>. Since the beginning of 2022, the Company has deployed approximately <money><money>$300 million</money></money> and repurchased 31.2 million shares of its common stock, representing over <percent>14%</percent> of shares outstanding at the start of the period, at an average purchase price of <money><money>$9.60</money></money> per share. The average purchase price per share represents a substantial discount to consensus estimates of net asset value and implies a highly attractive valuation multiple on the Company's stabilized cash flow.</li><li><i>Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock</i>: During 2025, the Company repurchased 54,097 shares at an average purchase price per share of <money><money>$20.28</money></money> for a total repurchase amount before expenses of <money><money>$1.1 million</money></money>. From the start of this year through February 26, 2026, the Company has repurchased 90,459 shares at an average purchase price per share of <money><money>$20.69</money></money> for a total repurchase amount before expenses of <money><money>$1.9 million</money></money>. The 2025 and 2026 average repurchase price of <money><money>$20.54</money></money> per share reflects an <percent>18%</percent> discount to the preferred stock liquidation value.</li><li><i>Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock</i>: During 2025, the Company repurchased 9,027 shares at an average purchase price per share of <money><money>$19.25</money></money> for a total repurchase amount before expenses of <money><money>$0.2 million</money></money>. The average repurchase price per share reflects a <percent>23.0%</percent> discount to the preferred stock liquidation value.</li></ul><p><i>Amended and Restated Credit Agreement</i>. In September 2025, the Company completed its Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Amended Credit Agreement\"), which provides for an aggregate borrowing capacity of <money><money>$1.35 billion</money></money>, and allowed the Company to address all near term maturities, extend the duration of the remaining in-place loans, and further strengthen the Company's balance sheet. Inclusive of extension options, loans under the Amended Credit Agreement mature at various points in 2030 and 2031 but are freely prepayable at any time. In connection with the new facilities, the Company entered into a series of interest rate swaps to lower its borrowing cost and better manage interest rate risk.</p><p><b>Recent Developments</b></p><p><i>Stock Repurchase Program Reauthorization</i>. In February 2026, Sunstone's Board of Directors reauthorized the Company's stock repurchase program which allows the Company to acquire up to <money><money>$500.0 million</money></money> of its common and preferred stock. The authorization has no stated expiration and future repurchases under the program will depend on various factors including the Company's capital needs, other capital allocation opportunities available to the Company, and the price of the Company's common and preferred stock. Including repurchase activity completed subsequent to the reauthorization, the Company currently has nearly <money><money>$500.0 million</money></money> remaining under the new authorization.</p><p><i>Delayed-Draw and Series A Senior Notes Repayment</i>. In January 2026, the Company drew the remaining <money><money>$90.0 million</money></money> available under its <money><money>$275.0 million</money></money> delayed-draw term loan facility and used a majority of the proceeds received to repay the <money><money>$65.0 million</money></money> balance of the Series A Senior Notes at their scheduled maturity. Following this repayment, the Company has no debt maturities until 2028.</p><p><i>Corporate Responsibility Report</i>. In February 2026, the Company published its 2025 Corporate Responsibility Report. The report includes details on Sunstone's progress related to its environmental sustainability, social responsibility and corporate governance initiatives during 2024, as well as details of the Company's performance towards its 2035 environmental targets.

These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our calculation of these measures may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly the same as us. These non-GAAP measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. They should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), cash flow from operations, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure.</p><p>We present EBITDA<i>re</i> in accordance with guidelines established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"Nareit\"), as defined in its September 2017 white paper \"Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate.\" We believe EBITDA<i>re</i> is a useful performance measure to help investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period in comparison to our peers. Nareit defines EBITDA<i>re</i> as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on the disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change in control), impairment write-downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in the value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDA<i>re</i> of unconsolidated affiliates.</p><p>We make additional adjustments to EBITDA<i>re</i> when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance, and that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i>, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. In addition, we use both EBITDA<i>re</i> and Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> as measures in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions.</p><p>We believe that the presentation of FFO attributable to common stockholders provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance because it is a measure of our operations without regard to specified noncash items such as real estate depreciation and amortization, any real estate impairment loss and any gain or loss on sale of real estate assets, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and may be of lesser significance in evaluating our current performance. Our presentation of FFO attributable to common stockholders conforms to Nareit's definition of \"FFO applicable to common shares.\" Our presentation may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the terms in accordance with the current Nareit definition, or that interpret the current Nareit definition differently than we do.</p><p>We also present Adjusted FFO attributable to common stockholders when evaluating our operating performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and may facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and our peer companies.</p><p>We adjust EBITDA<i>re</i> and FFO attributable to common stockholders for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to these measures as either Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> or Adjusted FFO attributable to common stockholders:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li><i>Amortization of deferred stock compensation</i>: we exclude the noncash expense incurred with the amortization of deferred stock compensation as this expense is based on historical stock prices at the date of grant to our corporate employees and does not reflect the underlying performance of our hotels.</li><li><i>Amortization of contract intangibles</i>: we exclude the noncash amortization of any favorable or unfavorable contract intangibles recorded in conjunction with our hotel acquisitions. We exclude the noncash amortization of contract intangibles because it is based on historical cost accounting and is of lesser significance in evaluating our actual performance for the current period.</li><li><i>Gains or losses from debt transactions</i>: we exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired because, like interest expense, their removal helps investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure.</li><li><i>Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle</i>: from time to time, the FASB promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. We exclude these one-time adjustments, which include the accounting impact from prior periods, because they do not reflect our actual performance for that period.</li><li><i>Other adjustments</i>: we exclude other adjustments that we believe are outside the ordinary course of business because we do not believe these costs reflect our actual performance for the period and/or the ongoing operations of our hotels. Such items may include: lawsuit settlement costs; the write-off of development costs associated with abandoned projects; property-level restructuring, severance, and management transition costs; pre-opening costs associated with extensive renovation projects; debt resolution costs; lease terminations; property insurance restoration proceeds or uninsured losses; and other nonrecurring identified adjustments.</li></ul><p>In addition, to derive Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i>, we exclude the amortization of our right-of-use assets and related lease obligations as these expenses are based on historical cost accounting and do not reflect the actual rent amounts due to the respective lessors or the underlying performance of our hotels. We also exclude the effect of gains and losses on the disposition of undepreciated assets because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets.</p><p>To derive Adjusted FFO attributable to common stockholders, we also exclude the noncash interest on our derivatives as we believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs. Additionally, we exclude the real estate amortization of our right-of-use assets and related lease obligations (with the exception of our corporate operating lease) as these expenses are based on historical cost accounting and do not reflect the actual rent amounts due to the respective lessors or the underlying performance of our hotels. We also exclude gains or losses on the redemptions or repurchases of preferred stock, changes to deferred tax assets, liabilities or valuation allowances, and income tax benefits or provisions associated with the application of net operating loss carryforwards, uncertain tax positions or with the sale of assets.</p><p>In presenting hotel Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> and hotel Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> margins, miscellaneous non-hotel items have been excluded. We believe the calculation of hotel Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> results in a more accurate presentation of the hotel Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> margins for our hotels, and that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in evaluating our property-level operating performance.</p><p>Reconciliations of net income to EBITDA<i>re</i>, Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i>, FFO attributable to common stockholders, Adjusted FFO attributable to common stockholders, hotel Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> and hotel Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> margins are set forth in the following pages of this release.</p><p><u>For Additional Information</u>:<br/>Aaron Reyes<br/>Sunstone Hotel Investors, Inc.<br/>(949) 382-3018</p><p> </p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"

Specifically, we make use of the non-GAAP financial measures \"Adjusted EBITDA,\" \"non-GAAP coal revenues,\" \"non-GAAP cost of coal sales,\" and \"non-GAAP coal margin.\" In addition to net income (loss), we use Adjusted EBITDA to measure the operating performance of our reportable segment. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance or any other measure of operating results, financial performance, or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, this measure is not calculated identically by all companies and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it is a useful indicator of the financial performance of our coal operations. We use non-GAAP coal revenues to present coal revenues generated, excluding freight and handling fulfillment revenues. Non-GAAP coal sales realization per ton for our operations is calculated as non-GAAP coal revenues divided by tons sold. We use non-GAAP cost of coal sales to adjust cost of coal sales to remove freight and handling costs, depreciation, depletion and amortization - production (excluding the depreciation, depletion and amortization related to selling, general and administrative functions), accretion on asset retirement obligations, amortization of acquired intangibles, and idled and closed mine costs. Non-GAAP cost of coal sales per ton for our operations is calculated as non-GAAP cost of coal sales divided by tons sold. Non-GAAP coal margin per ton for our coal operations is calculated as non-GAAP coal sales realization per ton for our coal operations less non-GAAP cost of coal sales per ton for our coal operations. The presentation of these measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.</p><p>Management uses non-GAAP financial measures to supplement GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone. The definition of these non-GAAP measures may be changed periodically by management to adjust for significant items important to an understanding of operating trends and to adjust for items that may not reflect the trend of future results by excluding transactions that are not indicative of our core operating performance. Furthermore, analogous measures are used by industry analysts to evaluate the Company's operating performance. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate, capital investments and other factors.</p><p>Included below are reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures.</p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"prnbcc\"><tr><td class=\"prngen3\" colspan=\"8\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>ALPHA METALLURGICAL RESOURCES, INC.

(TSXV: PX) (OTC Pink: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/PGXPF/\" title=\"View PGXPF stock overview\">PGXPF</a>) (\"Pelangio\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that a controlled-source electromagnetic (\"CSEM\") survey has been commissioned for the Obuasi and Manfo projects to be conducted by SEMS Exploration Services of Ghana. </p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li><p>CSEM surveys will be conducted on Pelangio's Obuasi and Manfo projects to delineate targets up to 1+ kilometre depth below prospective exploration target areas.</p></li><li><p>On Pelangio's Obuasi project, the survey will be conducted in tandem with an AngloGold Ashanti survey on the Obuasi mine property. Pelangio's portion of the two surveys will cover Pelangio's Obuasi Targets Area interpreted to be on strike with the Obuasi Mine's Main Au Trend. AngloGold Ashanti's survey covers the north-northeastern extension of their Main Au Trend, within the Obuasi Mine property.</p></li><li><p>The survey is intended to search for conductive and resistive targets at depths of up to 1+ kilometer which could represent repetitions of the large, high-grade Obuasi ore shoots extending to the north-northeast. The northernmost known ore shoot at the Obuasi mine, the 'Far North Shoot' (AKA Adansi Shoot), sits approximately 4.2 kilometers south-southwest of Pelangio's property boundary at a depth of 700+ meters.</p></li><li><p>The CSEM survey on the Manfo property will follow the Obuasi surveys and will explore for deep targets below (down-dip and down-plunge of) the Pokukrom East and West deposits.</p></li></ul><p><b>CSEM (Controlled Source Electromagnetic Survey) Details</b></p><p>Pelangio Exploration has commissioned SEMS Exploration Services of Ghana to conduct CSEM surveys on their Obuasi and Manfo projects to explore for mineral targets at depths up to 1 kilometre or more. Controlled source electromagnetics is an active EM method where an electromagnetic signal is 'injected' into the ground with the response measured at multiple stations in a grid array. The SEMS survey will employ an IRIS Instruments TIP 12000 transmitter powered by a 20kVA generator to create the EM signal with the subsurface response read by two Metronics Magneto-Telluric (MT) grade receiver units working on a 170-meter grid node spacing. </p><p>The CSEM method is effective at detecting conductive features and mapping resistive bodies at shallow to intermediate depths (up to several km) and could be effective at resolving Obuasi-style mineralization (conductive sulphide ore and resistive gold-bearing quartz lodes) comfortably to a depth of 1 kilometre or more. The Magneto-Telluric (MT) method in comparison, which is a passive EM method, is a much broader frequency survey enabling deep imaging (to tens of kilometres), although at a considerably lower resolution than CSEM can provide and requiring much longer survey times.</p><p>Pelangio's Obuasi survey will cover the 'Obuasi Targets Area' on the western edge of the property, interpreted to be on strike with the Obuasi Mine's Main Au Trend. See Figure 1. The survey will cover an area of 9.2km² with 295 170-meter spaced stations. AngloGold Ashanti will conduct a parallel CSEM survey extending Pelangio's survey into their mine property with 333 stations over an area of 10.4 km². While SEMS will be conducting the survey over both properties, the surveys are independent of one another and a possible data-sharing agreement has not been discussed.</p><p>The northernmost known (from public information) orebody on the Main Au Trend at the Obuasi Mine is the 'Far North' ore shoot, also referred to as the Adansi ore shoot in some literature. Refer to AngloGold Ashanti's Obuasi Underground Analyst Site Visit presentation posted on their website on March 17, 2025. The Far North ore shoot is situated approximately 4.2 kilometre's south-southwest of Pelangio's property boundary at a depth of 700+ meters. It is believed that if there is a repetition of the Obuasi Mine ore shoots to the north and into Pelangio's property, it may be at depths comparable to the Far North ore shoot as there is little evidence of large-scale near-surface mineralization observed in the soil geochemistry and historical diamond drilling on Pelangio's ground.</p><p>The Obuasi CSEM surveys are tentatively planned to commence in mid-April once the equipment is mobilized from Sweden and will require approximately two months to complete if the weather is mostly favourable. Another month will be required for 3D inversion modelling of the data plus reporting with recommendations.</p><p>Following the Obuasi surveys, a smaller CSEM survey is planned for the Manfo project covering the area of the Pokukrom deposits plus the possible down-plunge extensions to the northeast. An area of 2.8 km² will be surveyed with 100 EM stations. The survey is not targeting as deep as at Obuasi but is intended to explore for mineralization deeper than the current drill program is planning to test.</p><p><b>Manfo Drilling Update</b></p><p>Resource extensional diamond drilling continues on the Manfo project focussed on the Pokukrom deposits. Three holes of the 15-hole, 3,150-meter program are nearly complete.

Assays for the remaining five holes are pending (see long section and plan map in Figures 2 and 3).</p><p>\"It is highly encouraging to see such strong early results that show increasing gold and copper grades at depth,\" stated Andrew Chubb, President and CEO of Awalé Resources. \"With any discovery, you have to keep pushing to fully understand the true potential. We believe there is a significant opportunity for continued growth at BBM, particularly as we are seeing evidence of increasing grades with depth in the drilling. To date, drilling has demonstrated the open-pit potential at BBM, which now covers a 1.2 km zone. This new drilling looks to expand the underground potential of this target. With our initial Mineral Resource Estimate targeted for early Q2, we are beginning to define this zone, and coupled with the deeper drilling, we are starting to better define the scale of the system.\"</p><p>\"We are also looking forward to receiving drilling results from Charger and Empire, along with further news from our <percent>100%</percent>-owned Awalé permits, where the team continues to advance exploration across the Seydou, Sama, and Sienso permits. 2026 is shaping up to be a big year for the Company.\"</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/xEjnETK8zZ\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Link to All Figures</a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/7n1KnsMk0x\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Watch Video of CEO Andrew Chubb Discussing New Results from BBM</a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/ejYnjcMvDw\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Link to Core Photos</a></p><p><b>BBM Underground Target Drilling</b></p><p>The 11-hole, 7,000-metre step-down diamond drilling program forms the first phase of drilling designed to evaluate the potential for an underground mineral resource at the BBM target. This initial phase is focused on testing continuity of the higher-grade core of the BBM system down-plunge to a depth of approximately 600 metres below surface. Results from the first six holes reported in this release represent the beginning of defining this underground potential.</p><p>If successful, further step-out drilling will be planned to test and extend the higher-grade zone to a depth of 800m below surface. The gold, copper, and molybdenite mineralization is associated with a marked increase in strain intensity and silica-biotite alteration along the subvertical to south-southwest contact between a sheared granodiorite host and footwall metasediments and metavolcanics.</p><p>Results from this deeper drilling will play a key role in assessing the long-term scale and underground development potential of the BBM system.</p><p><b>Exploration on Awalé's <percent>100%</percent>-Owned Permits</b></p><p>Concurrent exploration programs are underway across Awalé's <percent>100%</percent>-owned permits. Intensive surface geochemistry programs are advancing at Seydou and Sama, while a 3,000-metre air-core program at the Fremen target (Sienso) is nearing completion. Positive results are expected to support follow-up percussion and diamond drilling across the broader Odienné land package with the purpose of making new discoveries.</p><p><b>About Awalé Resources</b></p><p>Awalé is a diligent and systematic mineral exploration company focused on discovering large high-grade gold and copper-gold deposits. Exploration activities are currently underway in the underexplored regions of Côte d'Ivoire, where the Company is exploring the Odienné Copper-Gold Project (\"<b>Odienné</b>\" or the \"<b>Project</b>\"), covering 2,346 km<sup>2</sup> across seven permits-five granted and two applications. This includes 797 km<sup>2</sup> in two permits held under the Awalé-Newmont Joint Venture (\"OJV\"). Awalé currently manages all exploration activities over the OJV, with funding currently provided by Newmont Ventures Limited (\"Newmont\") under an Exploration Agreement signed in May 2022.</p><p>Awalé has discovered four gold, gold-copper, and gold-copper-silver-molybdenum mineralized systems within the OJV and has recently commenced exploration on its <percent>100%</percent>-owned properties.</p><p>The Odienné Project is underexplored and has multiple pipeline prospects with similar geochemical signatures to Iron Oxide Copper Gold (<b>IOCG</b>) and intrusive-related mineral systems with substantial upside potential. The Company benefits from a skilled and well-seasoned technical team that allows it to continue exploring in a pro-mining jurisdiction that offers significant potential for district-scale discoveries.</p><p><b>Table 1: Significant Intercepts from Diamond Drilling - (from this release)</b></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 100%;

Samples are prepared and stored at the Company's field camps and put into sealed bags until collected by Intertek from the Company's secure Odienné office and transported by Intertek to their preparation laboratory in Yamoussoukro, Côte d'Ivoire, for preparation. Samples are logged in the tracking system, weighed, dried, and pulverized to greater than <percent>85%</percent>, passing a 75-micron screen. Two pulps are prepared from each sample with one stream to Intertek Ghana for fire assay and a second to Australia where the sample is analyzed by 52 element ICP/MS with a 4-Acid digest. Blanks, duplicates, and certified reference material (standards) are being used to monitor laboratory performance during the analysis. Where visible gold is observed in drill core, a quartz wash is applied between every sample to reduce or eliminate any contamination. Once fire assay results are received, samples over 5 g/t gold are routinely screen fire assayed, samples lower than 5 g/t gold continued within a high-grade interval are also screen fire assayed. </p><p><b>Mineralized Interval Calculations</b></p><p>Significant intervals reported in this news release are calculated as downhole length-weighted intercepts. For the BBM target, initial mineralized zones are calculated at a 0.2 g/t Au trigger and include up to 3 metres of internal waste for delineating mineralized zones. Included intervals are calculated at 0.5 g/t Au, 2 g/t Au, 5 g/t Au, and 10 g/t Au trigger values, with up to 3 metres of internal waste. Table 2 contains a list of all BBM holes reported in this release. True widths are estimated to be <percent>70%</percent> of the downhole widths. Holes not reported do not make a 0.5 g/t Au grade trigger. </p><p><b>Au Equivalent Calculations </b></p><p>Au Equivalent is calculated using the following parameters in USD: Au - 1910/Oz (Troy), Cu 3.80/lb, Mo 40,000/Tonne, and Ag 23.40/Oz (Troy). The Formula AuEq = Au (g/t) + ((Cu (ppm) * 0.00014) + (Mo (ppm) * 0.00065) + (Ag (g/t)*0.01225)). An <percent>80%</percent> metallurgical recovery is assumed for all metals, as the specific recovery rates for individual metals are unclear, and assuming different recoveries would be premature at this stage.</p><p><b>Qualified Person</b></p><p>The technical and scientific information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved for release by Andrew Chubb, the Company's Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101.

We have secured the right to earn a <percent>100%</percent> interest in a resource-stage copper-gold-silver project that combines scale, grade, near-surface mineralisation and district-scale exploration upside - all in a jurisdiction that is increasingly recognised as one of the most attractive in the world for responsible mineral exploration and development.</i></p><p><i>With over 200 million tonnes already delineated and a higher-grade core starting at just 40 metres below surface, Beskauga Project offers a compelling foundation for value creation. The deposit remains open at depth and along strike, with post-resource drilling confirming that the system extends well beyond the current resource boundary. Equally exciting, the broader exploration licence hosts multiple untested targets with geophysical signatures analogous to the main deposit - any one of which could represent a significant new discovery.</i></p><p><i>Kazakhstan's combination of favourable geology, established mining infrastructure, competitive operating costs, and a strengthened investor protection framework makes it an ideal environment for an exploration company of our size to create outsized value. We are already on the ground preparing for the 2026 field season and look forward to updating shareholders as we advance our integrated exploration and targeting program</i>\"</p><p><b>Strategic Rationale - A Complementary Portfolio</b></p><p>The addition of Beskauga Project is designed to complement the value of Mogotes' flagship Filo Sur project in the Vicuña district.</p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li><p>Filo Sur remains the Company's primary exploration asset and continues to receive priority funding and technical focus.</p></li><li><p>The Beskauga Project is being acquired under an option structure that preserves the Company's financial flexibility: all payments are discretionary and staged over three years, the initial cash outlay is modest relative to the value of the resource being secured, and a portion may be settled in shares rather than cash, protecting treasury for Filo Sur drilling programmes.</p></li><li><p>Critically, the two projects operate on opposite seasonal calendars - the Kazakh field season runs during the Northern Hemisphere summer while Filo Sur's high-altitude Andean season is concentrated in the Southern Hemisphere summer - allowing Mogotes' technical team and management bandwidth to be deployed year-round without competing for the same resources. </p></li><li><p>The Beskauga Project cost of drilling is expected to run approximately US<money>$100</money> per metre drilled, allowing a small investment in exploration budget to go a long way.</p></li><li><p>For shareholders, this means continuous exploration newsflow, reduced single-asset concentration risk, and a second pathway to value creation through a resource-stage deposit with near-term development optionality, all achieved with relatively low cost of operation and option payments in the first years.</p></li></ul><p><b>Summary of Option Agreement Terms</b></p><p>Pursuant to the Option Agreement, Mogotes, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Mogotes Metals Kazakhstan Inc.

The Pavlodar provincial economy is largely driven by mining and heavy industry, including large-scale open-pit and underground mining. The Beskauga Project is located 70 km south-west of the provincial capital and is well serviced by established infrastructure, with the project located within 20 km of rail and sealed national highway. A 1,150 kVA powerline also traverses the project<sup>7</sup> (Figure 4).</p><p>Kazakhstan sits within the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), one of the world's most richly mineralised metallogenic domains. The CAOB hosts numerous porphyry copper-gold deposits<sup>8</sup>. The Beskauga Project is situated in the same geological terrane as the Bozshakol and Aktogai porphyry copper-gold operations, among others, underscoring the district's prospectivity.</p><p>The Beskauga Project area is covered by up to 40 m of post-mineral clay overburden. As a result, pre-discovery exploration was driven by project-scale IP geophysics and magnetics, wide-spaced grid-based KGK drilling (similar to \"wet\" reverse circulation drilling) through cover to collect basement geochemistry and geology samples. Exploration drilling of anomalies generated by this process led to the discovery of the Beskauga Project deposit in 2007. For a detailed exploration and company ownership history of the project please see the NI 43-101 report<sup>6</sup>.</p><p>Mogotes is undertaking an integrated reprocessing and targeting programme of the Beskauga Project ahead of the Kazakh field season and will provide a technical update on the Project in the coming weeks. The Company has commenced engaging a local team and service providers to advance the 2026 programme at the Beskauga Project.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/10597/285555_85e7a9ac74c5cae0_007full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

The Company is not treating the historical estimate as a current mineral resource or mineral reserve, and the historical estimate should not be relied upon. </p><p>In order to verify or upgrade the historical estimate to current mineral resources or mineral reserves, the Company anticipates that work would include, among other things: compilation and independent verification of the historical drill hole database, including re-logging and re-assaying of selected drill core where available; integration of the 18,657 metres of post-resource drilling completed to date; an updated geological and structural interpretation; revised resource estimation incorporating current commodity prices and economic parameters; and, if warranted, additional infill and step-out drilling to support reclassification. The Company intends to evaluate and advance this work as part of its 2026 exploration and technical programme at the Beskauga Project.</p><p>Inferred mineral resources, where referenced, have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. </p><p><b>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements </b></p><p>This news release contains \"forward-looking information\" and \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation (collectively, \"forward-looking information\"). Generally, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"plans\", \"expects\", \"does not expect\", \"is expected\", \"budget\", \"scheduled\", \"estimates\", \"forecasts\", \"intends\", \"projects\", \"budgets\", \"targets\", \"assumes\", \"strategy\", \"goals\", \"objectives\", \"potential\", \"possible\", \"anticipates\", \"does not anticipate\", \"believes\", or variations of such words and phrases, or statements that certain actions, events, conditions or results \"will\", \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"should\", \"might\" or \"will be taken\", \"will occur\" or \"will be achieved\", or the negative connotations thereof. All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements.</p><p>In particular, this news release contains forward-looking information pertaining to, without limitation: the proposed acquisition of the Beskauga Project, including the anticipated terms, conditions precedent, expected closing date, and anticipated benefits of the acquisition; assumptions made in the interpretation of drill results, geology, grade, geochemistry, potential implications of geophysics interpretations, and continuity of mineral deposits; the Company's planned exploration programs and expenditures at the Beskauga Project; expectations regarding access to and demand for equipment, skilled labour and services needed for exploration and development of mineral properties; potential exploration upside at the Beskauga Project, including the extent and significance of mineralization and the prospectivity of exploration targets; the ability of the Company to conduct its field programs as planned; the success of future exploration activities; potential for resource expansion; the ability to build shareholder value; expectations with regard to establishing mineral resources or mineral reserves through exploration; the ability to execute planned work programs; plans or ability to mobilize or add additional drill rigs; timing or anticipated results of laboratory assay results; and the Company's ability to obtain required financing.</p><p>The forward-looking information contained in this news release is based on certain assumptions, including, without limitation: that the acquisition of the Beskauga Project will be completed on the terms and timeline anticipated; that required regulatory approvals, including any approvals required under the laws of Kazakhstan and Canada, will be obtained in a timely manner; that financing will be available if and when needed on reasonable terms; that the Company will be able to obtain all necessary permits, licences, and authorizations to conduct exploration in Kazakhstan; that the Company will not experience any material adverse change in its business or financial condition; that commodity prices and foreign exchange rates will not decline materially; that the Company will not experience any material labour dispute, accident, or failure of plant or equipment; that there will be no material adverse changes to the political, legal, or regulatory environment in Kazakhstan; that the Company will be able to operate without being materially affected by international sanctions regimes; and that contracted counterparties will perform their obligations as agreed.</p><p>Forward-looking information involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking information. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: general business, economic and mining industry conditions; fluctuations in commodity prices; changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly as between the Canadian dollar, United States dollar, and Kazakhstani tenge; the speculative nature of mineral exploration; geological conditions and variability; uncertainty of mineral resource estimates; that the Company may not discover commercially viable quantities of minerals; environmental risks and compliance costs; the supply and demand for commodities; title disputes or claims; limitations on insurance coverage; and uninsured risks. The Company's operations in Kazakhstan are subject to the risks of operating in a foreign jurisdiction, including: changes to Kazakhstan's mining legislation, subsoil use rights framework, and tax regime, including potential increases in tax rates applicable to subsoil users; political instability or changes in government policy affecting the mining sector; inconsistent enforcement of laws, regulations, and contractual obligations; the potential for government-mandated participation in mining projects; currency fluctuations and volatility of the Kazakhstani tenge, which may be correlated with fluctuations in the Russian ruble and global commodity prices; risk of exposure to international sanctions regimes affecting the importation of equipment, technology, and services, and the Company's ability to transact with international counterparties; changes to environmental legislation, including restrictions on water usage under Kazakhstan's water code; repatriation and currency conversion risks; inadequacy of infrastructure in remote areas of Kazakhstan; potential for expropriation or nationalization; difficulties in enforcing judgments obtained in foreign jurisdictions; the need to comply with Kazakhstan's obligations under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI); and the potential for social or community opposition to mining activities; that the acquisition of the Beskauga Project may not be completed on the anticipated terms or timeline, or at all; that required regulatory, governmental, or other approvals may not be obtained or may impose conditions that are not anticipated; that due diligence may not identify all risks and liabilities associated with the acquired assets; that financing required to complete the acquisition and fund planned exploration may not be available on acceptable terms; that the Company may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition; and that integration of the acquired project may be more costly or complex than anticipated. Risks also include the stability and predictability of the political and legal environments in jurisdictions where the Company operates; that financing will be available if and when needed on reasonable terms; the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern; dilution to existing shareholders from future equity financings; and general economic, market, or business conditions.</p><p>These factors are not, and should not be construed as being, exhaustive. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that would cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking information, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated, or intended. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p align=\"justify\">CALGARY, Alberta, Feb.  27, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TransAlta Corporation (TransAlta or the Company) (TSX: TA) (NYSE: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/TAC/\" title=\"View TAC stock overview\">TAC</a>) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2025.</p> <p align=\"justify\">“TransAlta delivered strong performance in 2025, demonstrating its ability to generate solid free cash flow notwithstanding softer Alberta power prices, subdued market volatility, and lower merchant production. Our hedging strategy and contracted portfolio supported our strong ongoing performance and helped offset a challenging price environment\" said John Kousinioris, President and Chief Executive Officer of TransAlta. \"I'm pleased to share that free cash flow came in above the midpoint of our 2025 Outlook.\"</p> <p align=\"justify\">\"We are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved an eight per cent increase to our common share dividend, now equivalent to <money>$0.28</money> per share on an annualized basis. This represents our seventh consecutive annual dividend increase, affirming our confidence in the Company’s future and commitment to returning value to shareholders,” concluded Mr. Kousinioris.</p> <p align=\"justify\">\"Over the past few months, we focused on executing our strategic priorities. During the fourth quarter, we secured a definitive tolling agreement to convert Centralia Unit 2 to natural-gas-fired generation under a long-term contract and today, we announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding for our Alberta data centre strategy with Canada Pension Plan Investments and Brookfield,\" said Joel Hunter, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. \"We also recently closed the acquisition of Far North which enhances our position in Ontario,\" added Mr. Hunter.</p> <p align=\"justify\">\"We are entering 2026 with a growing and diversified fleet that is underpinned by long-term contracts and strong hedging positions. Our guidance incorporates a balanced view of our fleet's expected generation as well as Alberta power market fundamentals, which we expect to markedly improve as expected data centre load growth comes online in the coming years. We look forward to sharing more with you on our long-term outlook and strategy at our upcoming Investor Day scheduled for March 23, 2026,\" concluded Mr. Hunter.</p> <p><strong>Fourth Quarter 2025 Highlights</strong></p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt;

The MOU establishes a framework for phased development at the Company's Keephills site in Parkland County, including an initial long-term power purchase agreement for approximately 230 MW and the evaluation of additional phases aggregating up to 1 Gigawatt of load. Development is subject to regulatory approvals and the parties reaching definitive agreements.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Declared Increase in Common Share Dividend<br/></strong>The Company’s Board has approved a <money>$0.02</money> annualized (eight per cent) increase to the common share dividend and declared a dividend of <money>$0.07</money> per common share on Feb. 25, 2026 to be payable on July 1, 2026 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 1, 2026. The quarterly dividend of <money>$0.07</money> per common share represents an annualized dividend of <money>$0.28</money> per common share.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Acquisition of Far North</strong><br/>On Feb. 2, 2026, the Company closed the acquisition of Far North Power Corporation (Far North) for a purchase price of <money>$95 million</money> from an affiliate of Hut 8 Corporation, subject to working capital and other adjustments. The net cash payment for the transaction was funded through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under TransAlta's credit facilities.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The transaction adds 310 MW of capacity from four natural gas-fired facilities in our core market of Ontario, increasing the Company's total installed capacity in the province to 1,384 MW.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>US<money>$400 million</money> Senior Notes Offering and Early Redemption of the <percent>7.8%</percent> Senior Notes<br/></strong>On Dec. 22, 2025, the Company issued US<money>$400 million</money> senior notes with a fixed annual coupon rate of 5.9 per cent, maturing on Feb. 1, 2034. The notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all future subordinated indebtedness. The notes were issued at 99.39 per cent of par value, resulting in net proceeds of <money>$541 million</money> (US<money>$393 million</money>), and are callable in three years. Interest payments on the notes are made semi-annually, on Feb. 1 and Aug. 1, with the first payment scheduled for Aug. 1, 2026.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The proceeds from the offering were used to redeem all of the Company's outstanding 7.8 per cent US<money>$400 million</money> senior notes for the total redemption price of <money>$573 million</money> (US<money>$416 million</money>) in advance of the scheduled maturity date of Nov. 15, 2029.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Mothballing of Sheerness Unit 1<br/></strong>On Dec. 18, 2025, the Company provided notice to the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO) that Sheerness Unit 1 will be mothballed effective April 1, 2026, for a period of up to two years. The Company maintains the flexibility to return the mothballed unit to service when market fundamentals improve or contracting opportunities are secured. The unit will remain available and fully operational through the first quarter of 2026 and Sheerness Unit 2 will remain fully in service.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Centralia Unit 2 Mandated to Remain Available<br/></strong>On Dec. 16, 2025, the Company received an order from the United States Department of Energy (the Order) requiring that our 700 MW Centralia Unit 2 facility remain available if called upon to operate for a period of 90 days, until March 16, 2026. The Company is currently compliant with the Order and continues to work with the state and federal governments in relation thereto.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Centralia Tolling Agreement Signed<br/></strong>On Dec. 9, 2025, the Company announced it had entered into a long-term tolling agreement (Tolling Agreement) with Puget Sound Energy to convert our 700 MW Centralia Unit 2 facility from coal to natural gas. The conversion extends the operating life of facility and will leverage existing turbines, transmission and infrastructure, while also lowering emissions.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The Tolling Agreement provides a fixed-price capacity payment through 2044 for the facility. The coal-to-gas conversion project is expected to require approximately US<money>$600 million</money> in capital and, once in service, will generate contracted cash flow over the life of the Tolling Agreement. The Company expects to declare a final investment decision for the project in early 2027, after receiving required regulatory approvals. Permitting work will continue through 2026, followed by construction in 2027–2028, with converted natural gas-fired operations expected to begin in late 2028.</p> <p><strong>Chief Executive Officer Succession</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">On Nov. 6, 2025, the Company announced that John Kousinioris, President and Chief Executive Officer and a Director of TransAlta, plans to retire effective April 30, 2026. Concurrent with this announcement, the Board of Directors appointed Joel Hunter, TransAlta’s Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, to succeed Mr. Kousinioris as President and Chief Executive Officer and be nominated to join the Board effective April 30, 2026. Mr. Kousinioris has agreed to serve as a strategic advisor to Mr. Hunter and the Board for a period of six months following his retirement. The Company’s Chief Financial Officer successor will be announced in the coming months.</p> <p><strong>Demand Transmission Service Contract </strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">On Oct. 3, 2025, the Company entered into a 230 MW Demand Transmission Service Contract with the AESO, representing the full allocation awarded to the Company through Phase I of the AESO's Data Centre Large Load Integration Program.</p> <p><strong>2026 Outlook</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">For 2026, the Company expects Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of <money>$950 million</money> to <money>$1,050 million</money> and FCF to be in the range of <money>$350 million</money> to <money>$450 million</money>, based on the following expectations:</p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\">Lower contribution from the Energy Transition segment due to the Centralia facility ceasing dispatchable coal-fired generation at the end of 2025;</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\">Lower contribution from the Alberta merchant gas portfolio as a result of lower average hedge prices and higher fuel costs, partially offset by lower carbon compliance costs due to a higher utilization of internally generated low-cost environmental credits;</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\">Lower contributions from Sarnia, reflecting a step down in contracted pricing and the expiry of the contract and decommissioning of the Ada Cogeneration facility;</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\">Higher contributions within the Hydro, Gas and Wind and Solar segments due to the expected realization of carbon credits against in-year, in addition to 2025, carbon compliance costs in Alberta;</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\">Higher contributions from the Gas segment due to the acquisition of the Far North Ontario gas facilities;</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\">Higher contributions from the Wind and Solar segment as a result of higher expected production;</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\">Higher income tax expense; and</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\">Lower Net Interest Expense as a result of lower interest rates on refinanced debt and lower interest on non-recourse debt as a result of amortizing repayments.<br/><br/></li></ul> <p align=\"justify\">The following table outlines our expectations on key financial targets and related assumptions for 2026 and should be read in conjunction with the narrative discussion that follows and the \"Risk Management\" section of TransAlta's MD&amp;A for the Fourth Quarter and Year Ended Dec. 31, 2025:</p> <table style=\"border-bottom: solid black 1pt ;

Forward-looking statements are not facts, but only predictions and generally can be identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as \"may\", \"will\", \"believe\", \"expect\", \"estimate\", \"anticipate\", \"intend\", \"plan\", \"forecast\", \"continue\" or other similar words. In particular, this news release contains forward-looking statements about the following, among other things: our 2026 Outlook; the potential arising out of the MOU for data centre development for additional phases of development to aggregate to 1GW of load at the Company’s Keephills site; the costs and permitting, regulatory approvals, construction and operational timelines for the Centralia Unit 2 coal to natural gas conversion project; and the timing of the announcement of the Company’s Chief Financial Officer successor.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Forward-looking statements and future-oriented financial information in this news release are intended to provide the reader information about management's current expectations and plans and readers are cautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward-looking statements are subject to important risks and uncertainties and are based on certain key assumptions. All forward-looking statements reflect TransAlta's beliefs and assumptions based on information available at the time the statements were made and as such are not guarantees of future performance. As actual results could vary significantly from the forward-looking statements, you should not put undue reliance on forward-looking statements and should not use future-oriented information or financial outlooks for anything other than their intended purpose. We do not update our forward-looking statements due to new information or future events, unless we are required to by law. For additional information on the assumptions made, and the risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ from the anticipated results, refer to our most recent MD&amp;A, which forms part of this news release, and the 2025 Integrated Report, including the section titled \"<em>Governance and Risk Management</em>\" in our MD&amp;A for the year ended December 31, 2025, filed under TransAlta's profile on SEDAR+ at <u>www.sedarplus.ca</u> and with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission at <u>www.sec.gov</u>.</p> <p><strong>Non-IFRS and Supplementary Financial Measures</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">This news release contains references to the following Non-IFRS measures: Adjusted EBITDA; Free Cash Flow (FCF) (including per share); Adjusted earnings (loss) before income taxes; Adjusted net earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders (including per share); Funds from operations (FFO) (including per share); Energy Marketing adjusted revenues and net interest expense. Non-IFRS measures do not have standardized meanings under IFRS and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies and should not be viewed in isolation from, as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, our IFRS results. We use these measures to evaluate our performance and the performance of our business segments and believe that these measures, read together with our IFRS measures, provide readers with a better understanding of how management assesses results. Presenting these measures from period to period provides management and investors with the ability to evaluate earnings (loss) trends more readily in comparison to prior periods' results. These measures are calculated by adjusting certain IFRS measures for certain items we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operations in a period and are calculated on a consistent basis from period to period and are adjusted for specific items in each period, unless stated otherwise. Refer to the Non-IFRS and Supplementary Measures section of our most recent MD&amp;A, which forms part of this news release, for more information about these measures including, where applicable, reconciliations to measures calculated in accordance with IFRS.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Note: All financial figures are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated.<br/></p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>For more information:</strong></p> <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width:100%; border-collapse:collapse ;\"><tr><td style=\"max-width:55%; width:55%; min-width:55%;;text-align: left ;  vertical-align: middle; vertical-align: middle ; \"><strong><em>Investor Inquiries:</em></strong></td><td style=\"max-width:45%; width:45%; min-width:45%;;vertical-align: middle;   text-align: left;   padding-left: 15.0px; vertical-align: middle ; \"><strong><em>Media Inquiries:</em></strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: left ;  vertical-align: middle; vertical-align: middle ; \">Phone: 1-800-387-3598 in Canada and U.S.</td><td style=\"vertical-align: middle;   text-align: left;   padding-left: 15.0px; vertical-align: middle ; \">Phone: 1-855-255-9184</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: left ;  vertical-align: middle; vertical-align: middle ; \">Email: investor_relations@transalta.com</td><td style=\"vertical-align: middle;   text-align: left;   padding-left: 15.0px; vertical-align: middle ; \">Email: ta_media_relations@transalta.com</td></tr></table><img alt=\"\" class=\"__GNW8366DE3E__IMG\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTY2MjgyMSM3NDU4NzAyIzIyODU2NTE=\"/> <br/><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\" src=\"https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/YzZiY2NlZmYtODdmMy00Mjg1LWI5NjctOTFjN2Y5NTQ4OTE0LTEyOTcyMDEtMjAyNi0wMi0yNy1lbg==/tiny/TransAlta-Corporation.png\"/></article>",

Management uses non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company’s operating performance and trends, as well as for making planning decisions. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps to identify underlying trends in the Company’s business that may otherwise be masked by the effect of the income and expenses and other items that it excludes in its calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. Accordingly, the Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company’s operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by the Company’s management in their financial and operational decision-making. The Company also presents this non-GAAP financial measure because it believes investors, analysts and rating agencies consider it to be a useful metric in measuring the Company’s performance against other companies and its ability to meet its debt service obligations.</p> <p align=\"justify\">There are limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures such as Adjusted EBITDA because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may exclude significant income and expenses required by GAAP to be recognized in the Company’s financial statements, and may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Company encourages investors to carefully consider its results under GAAP, as well as its supplemental non-GAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand its business. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results is presented below.</p> <p align=\"justify\">*A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net loss on a forward-looking basis is not available without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the items excluded from this non-GAAP measure.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">This press release and statements made during the Company’s earnings call contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current assumptions and expectations of future events and trends, which affect or may affect the Company’s business, strategy, operations or financial performance, and actual results and other events may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements due to numerous risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified. Factors that could cause actual results or other events to differ materially from those contemplated in this press release can be found in the Risk Factors section of Treace’s public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025, which was filed with the SEC on February 27, 2026. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. These forward-looking statements speak only as of their date and, except to the extent required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements, whether as a result of any new information, future developments or otherwise. The Company’s results for the year ended December 31, 2025, are not necessarily indicative of its operating results for any future periods.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Internet Posting of Information</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">Treace routinely posts information that may be important to investors in the “Investor Relations” section of its website at <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=c0OAFtKosUKW6OsSxVTwEwY7obOiS7SKNPmzJ-_UVPErzN3Blf4FVudhuaaVx5-UDOeoe_5vxgMezvaMRWeFfErL_9RKAO0FJpfOXJxHQJI=\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>www.treace.com</u></a>.
