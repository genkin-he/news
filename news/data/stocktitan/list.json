            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><b>Vertical Structural Continuity Emerging in DDH-26-01<br/>Nova Scotia Introduces Purpose-Built Natural Hydrogen Legislation</b></p><p>Montreal, Quebec--(Newsfile Corp. - February 26, 2026) - Québec Innovative Materials Corp.  (CSE: QIMC) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/QIMCF/\" title=\"View QIMCF stock overview\">QIMCF</a>) (FSE: 7FJ) (\"QIMC\" or the \"Company\") reports that drill hole DDH-26-01 has intersected a second hydrogen-associated structural zone at approximately 313 metres depth at its West Advocate Project, Nova Scotia. This interval from approximately 313 metres to 330 metres depth is distinct from the previously reported 40-metre hydrogen-bearing fault corridor encountered between 142 and 191 metres.</p><p>The identification of two vertically separated hydrogen-associated structural zones within a single borehole supports the interpretation of a structurally controlled, multi-zone natural hydrogen system and further strengthens QIMC's H2 geological model. Drilling at DDH-26-01 remains ongoing toward the planned total depth of 650 metres.</p><p>This development coincides with the Government of Nova Scotia's introduction of the Powering the Economy Act (Bill No. 193), proposed legislation that regulates natural hydrogen as a subsurface energy resource within the Province. This legislative development directly enhances investment certainty and long-term planning capability and demonstrates the Province's and Premier Houston's commitment to establishing Nova Scotia as a hub for responsible clean energy development. The Company's exploration at West Advocate involves no hydraulic fracturing and no reservoir stimulation.</p><p><b>What This Means for Investors</b></p><p>DDH-26-01 has now intersected hydrogen-associated structural intervals at approximately 142 metres and 313 metres depth within a single borehole, supporting the interpretation of a multi-zone, structurally controlled natural hydrogen system rather than an isolated occurrence. In natural hydrogen exploration, structural repetition across depth is a recognized indicator of system continuity and scale. This result further strengthens QIMC's working geological model and provides a defined, systematic, data-driven pathway for the next phases of its Nova Scotia natural hydrogen exploration program.</p><p><b>CEO Commentary</b></p><p>John Karagiannidis, President &amp; CEO of QIMC, stated:</p><p>\"Intersecting a second hydrogen-associated structural zone at 320 metres while Hole 1 continues drilling toward 650 metres significantly strengthens our geological interpretation of West Advocate as a structurally controlled, multi-zone system. We are observing vertically separated brecciated intervals within a single borehole that exhibit geochemical characteristics consistent with hydrogen-bearing environments.</p><p>The Province of Nova Scotia's introduced regulatory framework provides the clarity necessary to responsibly advance multi-well exploration strategies and support long-term planning and investment. As we continue defining structural continuity through drilling and logging, this regulatory certainty underpins our disciplined, systematic approach and we commend the Province for its proactive clean energy leadership.\"</p><p><b>Project Geologist Commentary</b></p><p>Edward Procyshyn, Project Geologist, commented:</p><p>\"Drill logging has identified within the second structural fault zone three separate brecciated shear zones that are progressively more altered and sheared downhole. With progressive alteration, the breccia fragments become more completely replaced by finely crystalline massive dark carbon-graphite and dark mica. Each underlying shear zone is more highly altered than the overlying shear zone. The middle and lower altered shear zones were most highly altered and develop dark, very finely granular, massive carbon-rich intervals 0.5 to 1 metre thick. These highly altered core intervals contain the highest measured hydrogen gas values.</p><p>The host rock within the structural fault zone is also progressively altered as the intensity of shear deformation increases downhole. Thinly bedded, finely granular siltstone, dark carbonaceous mudstone, and fanglomerate are progressively recrystallized to form, within the structural fault zone, massive white, very fine-grained porcelain-like units cut by darker web to lenticular fractures. As shear fracturing and alteration increase in intensity downhole, the intervening porcellanite-like host changes colour from white to pale green and finally to darker greenish grey, indicating mineralogical changes due to increasing conditions of alteration.\"</p><p>Edward Procyshyn continued:</p><p>\"The progressive hydrothermal alteration of this structural fault shear zone supports the model that white native hydrogen is being increasingly generated at lower crustal levels by degassing of a magmatic system and being transported by advective hydrothermal fluids into the fault-related shear structures. This suggests that the degassing may be generated by injection of mantle plumes into the upper crust within the West Advocate area and that this process may have contributed significant amounts of white hydrogen gas that was and is presently being measured in the intersected structural zones and at surface in the soil-gas samples.</p><p>The very low to absent quantities of methane contained in the measured gases support the concept that hydrogen is being generated from crustal sources in a naturally occurring hydrogen system rather than from a conventional hydrocarbon occurrence.\"</p><p><b>Gas Monitoring Observations at 313m</b></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align: start; width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"width: 50%;\">Parameter<br/><br/></td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Observation</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 50%;\">Hydrogen (H₂)<br/><br/></td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Elevated concentrations detected</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 50%;\">Oxygen (O₂)<br/><br/></td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Depleted relative to atmospheric levels</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 50%;\">Methane (CH₄)<br/><br/></td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">None detected</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 50%;\">Hydraulic fracturing / stimulation<br/></td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Not conducted</td></tr></tbody></table><p> <br/>Measurements were collected in ambient atmospheric air near the borehole collar and during core handling and are subject to atmospheric dilution.</p><p><b>2026 Drill Program: Five-Hole Campaign</b></p><p>DDH-26-01 is the first hole in a planned five-hole 2026 drill program designed to systematically evaluate structural hydrogen corridors at West Advocate and adjacent targets.</p><ul><li>Hole 1 (DDH-26-01): Drilling continues toward planned 650 metres depth.<br/><br/></li><li>Hole 2 (DDH-26-02): Planned from same pad; oriented N297° with 55° plunge to the northwest.<br/><br/></li><li>Hole 3 (DDH-26-03): Eatonville Road area along the Reid Line; planned to 700 metres depth.<br/><br/></li><li>Holes 4 &amp; 5 (DDH-26-04 and DDH-26-05): Bennett Hill targets testing the broader regional structural hydrogen corridor.</li></ul><p><b>Nova Scotia Legislation</b></p><p>Nova Scotia's proposed legislation reflects a broader recognition by governments that natural hydrogen warrants a dedicated regulatory framework, a development that directly benefits companies with active exploration programs in the province.

Morgan Asset Management</b>. \"As people live longer and the retirement landscape becomes more unpredictable, advisors need practical tools to help clients and participants understand and navigate retirement challenges. The Guide is a valuable resource that provides real data and meaningful guidance to support more informed financial decisions to help achieve a secure retirement.\"</p><p><b>Sharon Carson, J.P. Morgan Asset Management Retirement Strategist,</b> added, \"Social Security remains one of the most important, and often misunderstood, components of retirement planning. We continue to see that the timing of when you claim benefits can have a lasting impact on your financial security. It's critical for individuals to understand the trade-offs, debunk common myths, and consider their personal circumstances so they can make the most informed choices for their retirement.\"</p><p>Key themes from the Guide to Retirement include:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li><b>The math matters: Know your number.</b> Having a defined savings target and income replacement goal is a key driver of success. Small, consistent increases in savings rates, as little as <percent>1%</percent>, can significantly enhance retirement readiness and cover nearly nine years of Medicare-related expenses.</li><li><b>Small business, big retirement opportunities.</b> Small businesses have more options than ever to help owners and employees prepare for retirement. Access to a workplace retirement plan makes a significant difference: <percent>62%</percent> of workers with a plan have at least <money><money>$100,000</money></money> saved, compared to just <percent>5%</percent> without one. Features like auto-enrollment and auto-escalation can further boost retirement readiness for small business employees.</li><li><b>Social Security: Expectations vs. reality.</b> While many workers expect to retire at 65, the actual median retirement age is 62, often due to unforeseen circumstances. Claiming Social Security at 62 leads to a permanent reduction to <percent>70%</percent> of the full benefit, while waiting until 70 increases monthly payments by <percent>24%</percent> compared to claiming at full retirement age. These trade-offs may be complicated by misconceptions about the future of the program.</li><li><b>Tax-smart savings: Make every dollar count.</b> Choosing the right account type can help you keep more of your retirement savings. For example, diversifying across traditional and tax-free Roth accounts and being strategic about Roth conversions can provide flexibility and control over your tax bill and Medicare premiums in retirement.</li><li><b>The silent risks to retirement spending.</b> Retirement spending often faces overlooked risks, with six in ten new retirees experiencing significant spending volatility in their first three years. Households with more guaranteed income spend up to <percent>44%</percent> more in retirement, highlighting the importance of dependable income and flexible strategies to manage market volatility and unexpected health care costs that may impact long-term financial security.</li></ul><p>J.P.

This also is a <percent>16.05%</percent> increase from 4Q24's <money>$7.6 million</money>. The change from the same quarter a year ago was primarily due to:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:circle;\"><li><p>Interest and dividend income of <money>$12.7 million</money> in 4Q25, compared to <money>$12.1 million</money> in 4Q24; and</p></li><li><p>Interest expense of <money>$4.2 million</money> in 4Q25, compared to <money>$4.7 million</money> in 4Q24.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Tax equivalent net interest margin increased to <percent>3.66%</percent> for 4Q25 from <percent>3.54%</percent> for 3Q25, and from <percent>3.33%</percent> for 4Q24.</p></li><li><p>During 4Q25, there was a reversal of the allowance for credit losses of <money>$279,000</money>, due to annual historic loss updates, qualitative factor adjustments, and lower specific reserves.

December 3, 2025, the day prior to Land and Buildings’ public presentation. Performance of the Proxy Peer Group Companies represents weighted average of Proxy Peer Group Companies in the 2025 Proxy Statement.</p></td></tr></table><p>FR has underperformed its proxy compensation peers by <percent>17%</percent> over the trailing four-year period and <percent>4%</percent> over the trailing three-year period. These are meaningful shortfalls against the very peer group selected by the Board’s Compensation Committee. Yet management continues to receive peer-level compensation for disappointing results. This is not a portfolio problem, FR’s same-store NOI and FFO growth have been comparable to Prologis and EastGroup. It is clear to us that FR’s underperformance is a governance and communication failure.</p><p>We strongly believe that a Board that has overseen this level of underperformance has no business resisting refreshment. Shockingly, no director has been added to the FR Board in the past five years. If the incumbent Board could not consistently deliver superior returns over 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, why should shareholders trust them to realize the ~<percent>20%</percent> upside to NAV going forward and close the valuation discount to its closest peers?</p><p><b>Steps to Generate Value<br/></b>We urge the Board to take the following actions immediately:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Publicly commit to a plan to close the NAV discount with specific milestones and timelines.</li><li>Initiate a <money>$500M</money>–<money>$1B</money> asset disposition program with proceeds returned to shareholders.</li><li>Schedule an investor day with property tours within 90 days.</li><li>Authorize a formal exploration of strategic alternatives if the discount does not narrow within six months.</li><li>Immediately refresh the Board: Mr. Dominski and Mr. Hackett should not stand for re-election, and their seats, along with the vacancy created following Mr. Rau’s passing, must be filled with directors experienced in capital allocation and REIT value creation.</li></ul><p>Constructive engagement requires a willing partner and to date, we have not found one in FR. Our preference would be to work together with FR to realize value for all shareholders. However, based on FR’s track record, we believe that we need to keep open all options available to us as shareholders – which is why Land &amp; Buildings has nominated me, Jonathan Litt, as a director candidate for election to the Board at the Company’s 2026 annual meeting of shareholders.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Jonathan Litt<br/>Land &amp; Buildings Investment Management, LLC</p><p class=\"bwalignc\"><b>CERTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING THE PARTICIPANTS</b></p><p>Land &amp; Buildings intends to file a preliminary proxy statement and accompanying universal proxy card with the SEC to be used to solicit votes for the election of its director nominee at the 2026 annual meeting of shareholders of First Industrial.</p><p>LAND &amp; BUILDINGS STRONGLY ADVISES ALL SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT AND OTHER PROXY MATERIALS AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Ottawa, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - February 26, 2026) - <b>Stria Lithium Inc. (TSXV: SRA) </b>(\" <b>Stria </b>\" or the \" <b>Company </b>\") announced today the closing of its non-brokered private placement (the \" Offering \") previously announced on February 13, 2026 and February 25, 2026, and raised <money>$1,000,000</money> gross proceeds. The Company issued 2,127,659 Units at a price of <money>$0.47</money> per Unit. Each Unit is composed of one common share of the Company and one common share purchase warrant (the \"Warrant\"). Each Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one common share of the Company at a price of <money>$0.59</money> per share for a period of 36 months following the closing of the private placement, 26 February 2029.</p><p>The proceeds of the Financing will be used for advancement of the Company's mineral exploration assets and operations, potential future acquisitions, and general working capital purposes. No finder fees were paid in relation to the private placement and no insiders participated in the equity financing. </p><p>All securities issued pursuant to the Financing will be subject to a statutory hold period of four months and one day from the date of issuance in accordance with applicable securities laws and TSXV policies.</p><p><b>About Stria Lithium</b></p><p>Stria Lithium (TSXV: SRA) is an emerging resource exploration company developing Canadian lithium reserves to meet legislated demand for electric vehicles and their rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. The Company is committed to growth through responsible and efficient exploration and development of its mining assets.</p><p>Stria's Central Pontax Lithium Project covers 36 square kilometres, including 8 km of strike along the prospective Chambois Greenstone Belt. The region, known as the Canadian \"Lithium Triangle,\" is one of only a few known sources of lithium available for hard rock mining in North America. Stria's Pontax Central Project Joint Venture with Cygnus Metals now has a maiden JORC-compliant inferred mineral resource estimate of 10.1Mt at <percent>1.04%</percent> Li2O based on the central area of the known mineralisation.</p><p>This JORC estimate establishes Pontax Central as a significant occurrence in the emerging James Bay lithium region. Cygnus Metals, being an ASX issuer, adhered to Australian JORC Code 2012 guidelines, meaning that such mineral resource estimate is not necessarily compliant with CIM and National Instrument 43-101 standards and the Company is not considering them as such at this time.</p><p>Cygnus Metals is committed to fully funding and managing the current two-stage exploration and drilling program to a maximum of <money>$10 million</money> at Stria's Pontax property and will also pay Stria up to <money>$6 million</money> in cash. In return, Cygnus may acquire up to a <percent>70%</percent> interest in the property. Cygnus has fulfilled its stage 1 requirements within the agreement and has now earned its <percent>51%</percent> interest in the property.</p><p>As momentum builds for the green energy revolution and the shift to electric vehicles, governments in Canada and the United States are aggressively supporting the North American lithium industry, presenting the industry and its investors with a rare opportunity for growth and prosperity well into the next decade and beyond.</p><p>Stria is committed to exceeding the industry's environmental, social and governance standards. A critical part of that commitment is forging meaningful, enduring and mutually beneficial relationships with local communities and stakeholders, and engaging openly and respectfully as neighbours and collaborators in this project that has the potential to create lasting jobs and prosperity.</p><p>The scientific and technical content disclosed herein was reviewed and approved by Réjean Girard, P.Geo and president of IOS Services Geoscientifiques Inc., a qualified person as defined under National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.</p><p>Reference:<br/>JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of Pontax Project, James Bay Quebec, Brian Wolfe; Duncan Grieve, August 14, 2023.</p><p>For more information about Stria Lithium and the Pontax Lithium project, please visit <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/Q2pXKCEYma\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://strialithium.com</a>.</p><p>Follow us on:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li>Twitter @StriaLithium</li><li>Instagram @strialithium</li><li>Facebook <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/mjxEwsxX3K\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://www.facebook.com/strialithium</a></li><li>LinkedIn <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/kXYx2sYDpp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://www.linkedin.com/company/stria-lithium/</a></li></ul><div id=\"contactInfo\"><p>For more information on Stria Lithium Inc., please contact:</p><p>Dean Hanisch<br/>CEO, Stria Lithium<br/><a href=\"mailto:dhanisch@strialithium.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">dhanisch@strialithium.com</a></p><p>Investor Relations, Stria Lithium Inc.<br/><a href=\"mailto:info@strialithium.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">info@strialithium.com</a></p></div><p>Neither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the accuracy or adequacy of this release.</p><p><i><b>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information</b></i></p><p><i>Except for statements of historical fact, this news release contains certain forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities law.
