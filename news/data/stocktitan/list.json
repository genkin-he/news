(\"Biglari Capital\"), the largest stockholder of Jack in the Box Inc. (NasdaqGS: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/JACK/\" title=\"View JACK stock overview\">JACK</a>), with a <percent>9.86%</percent> ownership stake, today issued the following statement regarding the preliminary voting results from <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/JACK/\" title=\"View JACK stock overview\">JACK</a>'s 2026 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.</p><p><b>A Clear Divide: Accountability vs. Complacency </b></p><p>Preliminary voting results from JACK's stockholder meeting reveal a stark and troubling divide. Active fund managers and retail stockholders — those who bear the real consequences of failed corporate governance — voted to hold Chairman David Goebel accountable for the destruction of stockholder value and his failure to act as a responsible steward of stockholder interests. By contrast, ISS, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street supported the status quo, providing cover for a board that has presided over value destruction.</p><p><b>JACK spent <money><money>$5 Million</money></money> to Defend One Director for One More Year </b></p><p>JACK spent an estimated <money><money>$5 million</money></money> on this proxy contest — not to protect the company's future, but to defend the reelection of David Goebel for a single additional year.</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>Over the last five years alone, Mr. Goebel collected approximately <money><money>$1.55 million</money></money> in director compensation.</li><li>During the same period, JACK's stockholders lost approximately <percent>80%</percent> of their investment — roughly <money><money>$1.8 billion</money></money> in stockholder value.</li><li>Mr. Goebel was paid millions to oversee billions in destruction.</li></ul><p><b>ISS, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street: A Governance Failure </b></p><p>While active fund managers and retail stockholders voted for accountability, ISS and the three largest index funds — BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street — supported JACK's failed leader.</p><p>Preliminary voting data for the three index funds imply that the proxy voting teams at these firms are completely indifferent to how their decisions impact the owners whose capital they are entrusted to protect. One is left to wonder: Do these governance teams even consider the repercussions their rubber-stamping of failed leadership has on the investors who have lost <percent>80%</percent> of the value of their JACK holdings?</p><p>JACK is a poster child of everything that can go wrong at a public company — catastrophic acquisition, leadership turnover, persistent operational underperformance, and entrenched governance — yet it has still managed to secure the support of a proxy advisor and the three largest index funds. This is not governance; it is the institutionalization of unaccountability.</p><p><b>The Underlying Investors Would Disagree</b></p><p>If the ETF investors who have entrusted their savings to BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street — retail investors saving for retirement, college, and financial security — had had a say, they likely would have voted against Goebel. These investors did not hand over their savings so that the governance teams at these institutions could give a free pass to the same failed leadership at JACK that destroyed <money><money>$1.8 billion</money></money> in stockholder value.</p><p>Failing to hold boards accountable promotes mediocrity. It puts the entire system of meritocracy at risk. When the largest stewards of capital — BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street — abdicate their governance responsibilities, the consequences extend far beyond any single company.</p><p><b>JACK's False and Misleading Statements</b></p><p>In addition to these governance failures, JACK made false and misleading statements in its proxy materials. Biglari Capital reserves the right to pursue all available legal remedies.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b></p><p>Mr. Goebel should be embarrassed and ashamed of the company's performance. He should have resigned years ago instead of playing politics and trying to hold on, wasting money for personal gain while relying on abstain votes, ISS, and index funds. He has no credibility with active investors.</p><p>SOURCE Biglari Capital Corp.</p></div></article>",

With the addition of two renowned Bushveld and Platreef geologists to the team and strategic investments by Glencore plc, the Company is well positioned to advance the next phase of large-scale critical mineral supply from this world-class American district, building on past production of nickel, copper, and chromium, and the on-going production of platinum group, nickel, and other metals by neighboring Sibanye-Stillwater.

All statements in this release, other than statements of historical facts including, without limitation, statements regarding potential mineralization, historic production, estimation of mineral resources, the realization of mineral resource estimates, interpretation of prior exploration and potential exploration results, the timing and success of exploration activities generally, the timing and results of future resource estimates, permitting time lines, metal prices and currency exchange rates, availability of capital, government regulation of exploration operations, environmental risks, reclamation, title, and future plans and objectives of the company are forward-looking statements that involve various risks and uncertainties. Although Stillwater Critical Minerals believes the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on a number of material factors and assumptions. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements include failure to obtain necessary approvals, unsuccessful exploration results, changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined, results of future resource estimates, future metal prices, availability of capital and financing on acceptable terms, general economic, market or business conditions, risks associated with regulatory changes, defects in title, availability of personnel, materials and equipment on a timely basis, accidents or equipment breakdowns, uninsured risks, delays in receiving government approvals, unanticipated environmental impacts on operations and costs to remedy same, and other exploration or other risks detailed herein and from time to time in the filings made by the companies with securities regulators.

Leqembi has been developed together with BioArctic's partner Eisai, who are responsible for regulatory interactions and commercialization globally. In addition to Leqembi, BioArctic has a broad research portfolio with antibodies against Parkinson-related diseases and ALS as well as additional projects against Alzheimer's disease.
