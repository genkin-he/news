Initial 2026 infill drilling is planned to first target PEA Phase 2 open pit resource conversion, transitioning later in the year to PEA Phase 3 underground resource conversion. </p><p>The Company plans to expand its grade control drilling beginning in Q2/26. The next phase of work will leverage results from the 2025 program to optimize drill hole spacing and program scope. This will include completing grade-control drilling at the Iceberg excavation, commencing grade-control drilling at the Lotto excavation and potentially expanding the grade-control drilling at the Keats and Iceberg excavations. The objective of this work is to improve confidence in the distribution of gold mineralization and support mine planning as outlined for the PEA Phase 1 open pits. </p><p>Exploration drilling will focus on AFZC resource expansion including an initial grid-based program targeting the prospective corridor adjacent to the AFZ at Bullseye, continued step-outs at Dropkick, located 11 km north of the AFZC, and targeted segments of the AFZ at AFZ Peripheral. A regional drilling program testing advanced targets at Queensway South is in the planning phase and expected to commence in H2/26.</p><p>The Company plans to file an updated Technical Report for Queensway, which will include an updated mineral resource estimate, in Q3/26</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Table 1: </b><i>Drill Result Highlights.</i></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align: start;

Composite intervals reported carry a minimum weighted average of 1 g/t Au diluted over a minimum core length of 2 m with a maximum of 4 m consecutive dilution when above 200 m vertical depth and 2 m consecutive dilution when below 200 m vertical depth. Included high-grade intercepts are reported as any consecutive interval with grades greater than 10 g/t Au. Grades have not been capped in the averaging and intervals are reported as drill thickness.

The presence of a Cu-Mo mineralized felsic porphyry stock so far from the MEPS Discovery provides further strong evidence for the presence of a giant porphyry copper system at the Soo Copper Project, located off the Trans-Canada Highway only 70km north of Sault Ste Marie and 20 km from rail and deep-water access.</p><p><strong>Highlights</strong></p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><p>Drillhole SC-26-01 was designed to test a ZTEM resistivity low geophysical target in proximity to bornite and chalcopyrite exposures in outcrop and as a large step-out to the MEPS Discovery (Figure 1 and 2).</p></li><li><p>At approximately 530m vertical depth, a thick zone of altered mafic volcanics transitioned sharply into a coarse-grained felsic porphyry, interpreted as part of a stock-like intrusive body, which was then drilled for over 400m currently continuing at approximately 1000m depth. The porphyry stock contains widespread, overall weak to moderate, but locally strong development of copper sulphides as fine chalcopyrite and bornite disseminations in the groundmass and as coarser grains within veins and is closely associated with potassic feldspar alteration. Molybdenite is also commonly present within quartz veins with or without chalcopyrite (see Figure 3, 4 and 5).</p></li><li><p>While assays are not expected for some time, the evidence from this hole suggests this is not the core of the mineralized stock but a peripheral part of a larger copper zone. However, it does confirm that there is a large porphyry stock complex associated with the surface copper showings identified across this 7km x 3km copper corridor of surface showings and drill holes that represent the upper expression of the overall giant footprint of this porphyry copper system.</p></li><li><p>The next hole is planned to drill-test the western edge of the same ZTEM anomaly in search of the shoulders of the stock and a possible associated zone of larger, higher grade porphyry copper mineralization.</p></li><li><p>A similar ZTEM resistivity anomaly has also been identified beneath the MEPS Discovery area which is also a focus for drill-testing in this winter program (Figure 1).</p></li></ul><p>Neil O'Brien, Chief Geologist of Sterling Metals, comments, \"The discovery of a source porphyry stock that hosts widespread potassic alteration and copper mineralization, including bornite, so quickly into the winter program is an incredible early result. It validates both our contention of there being a giant porphyry copper complex underlying a significant area of the Soo Project but also that our exploration targeting approach is right and will lead us to where there is the greatest potential for large concentrations of copper.\"</p><p>Based upon visual core logging, the stock is so far principally composed of a granite porphyry to quartz monzonite porphyry intrusive, compositions that are common to many major porphyry copper systems worldwide. The porphyry contains abundant phenocrysts of feldspar (plagioclase and orthoclase) and quartz with common but lesser mafic phenocrysts (hornblende and biotite). The common presence of both primary igneous hornblende and biotite (Figure 4), both hydrous minerals, in this felsic porphyry is indicative of a 'wet' hydrous source magma that is critical to the late-stage development of abundant, metal-rich, hydrothermal fluids that are ultimately responsible for the mineralization of copper and other metals in porphyry copper systems typically as sulphides within veins crossing the stock and intruded country rocks.</p><p>The granite porphyry hosts widespread but patchy potassic feldspar alteration with lesser local zones of epidote alteration and weak to moderate development of porphyry style veining, including early biotite veins and a variety of quartz-sulphide A-veins. Copper is present as very fine disseminations of chalcopyrite throughout much the groundmass of the porphyry, and as larger grains within veins and partly replacing mafic phenocrysts (Figure 3 and 4). Bornite locally replaces chalcopyrite, especially within mafic mineral grains but also within irregularly shaped pegmatitic zones of very coarse grained quartz and potassic feldspar. Molybdenite is present as medium to coarse grains within later, thicker quartz veins with or without chalcopyrite (Figure 4).</p><p>There is also strong evidence that other intrusive porphyry phases help comprise the intrusive stock complex, including an early-stage felsic porphyry with a fine grained groundmass reminiscent of the GFP felsic porphyry dykes found at MEPS, that is strongly potassic (biotite) altered and hosts a greater concentration of veins than the granite porphyry (Figure 5). The discovery of this Cu-Mo mineralized, potassic altered and veined granite porphyry stock at 1.5km from the MEPS Discovery supports the Company's contention that the widespread surface copper showings and copper-in-soil anomalies are indicative of the presence of a giant porphyry copper complex that offers tremendous exploration discovery potential.</p><a href=\"https://pr.report/j53x\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/05f8a14b-8420-4753-8964-df3827331c4b/1142358/sterlingmet-img1-03012026.jpg\" style=\"width:649px;text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto;\"/></a><div></div><div></div><div></div><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Figure 1: Plan map illustrating 8km copper corridor, as defined by copper in surface showings and drill holes, associated with underlying resistivity lows along 800m depth slice</strong></p><a href=\"https://pr.report/j53y\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/9aa8f867-f55d-423b-b095-a08a79fd348f/1142358/sterlingmet-img2-03012026.png\" style=\"width:648px;text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto;\"/></a><div></div><div></div><div></div><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Figure 2: Cross Section illustrating ZTEM resistivity target and main rock units intercepted in drill hole; transition from basalt to porphyry stock at approximately 530m vertical depth</strong></p><a href=\"https://pr.report/j53z\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/c6930927-bc70-4d77-be09-8ef0a3eb79c2/1142358/sterlingmet-img3-03012026.png\" style=\"width:649px;text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto;\"/></a><div></div><div></div><div></div><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Figure 3: Example in SC-26-01 of porphyry stock 740m downhole with close up illustrating early biotite (dark) veining and quartz-sulphide (light) A-veining</strong></p><a href=\"https://pr.report/j540\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/096f7308-5e82-4256-89c5-dd51255a2389/1142358/sterlingmet-img4-03012026.png\" style=\"width:646px;text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto;\"/></a><div></div><div></div><div></div><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Figure 4: Examples within SC-26-01 of different types of Cu-Mo veining and disseminated chalcopyrite within porphyry stock</strong></p><a href=\"https://pr.report/j541\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/05a2bcb2-3ad8-4ffe-b41f-fcbb706328b9/1142358/sterlingmet-img5-03012026.jpg\" style=\"width:342px;text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto;\"/></a><div></div><div></div><div></div><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Figure 5: Example in SC-26-01 of clasts of potassic-altered, fine-grained felsic porphyry (dark), reminiscent of bornite-related GFP porphyry dykes at MEPS Discovery, hosted by coarser grained granite porphyry and crosscut by significant density of porphyry style A-veins</strong></p><p>Sterling will be attending PDAC 2026 at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre (MTCC) from Sunday, March 1 to Monday, March 2, 2026, participating in Core Shack - Session A, Booth 3113A.

Copper Equivalent (CuEq) for drill intersections is calculated based on a three-year trailing average for each commodity (2023, 2024 and 2025) which equates to US<money>$ 4.18</money>/lb Cu, US<money>$ 2,600</money>/oz Au, US<money>$ 30.54</money>/oz Ag and US<money>$ 21.46</money>/lb Mo, with <percent>80%</percent> metallurgical recoveries assumed for all metals. The formula is: CuEq % = Cu % + (0.907 x Au g/t) + (0.0107 x Ag g/t) + (0.00051 x Mo ppm).</p><p><strong>Sampling Procedures - Quality Assurance/Quality Control</strong></p><p>Analytical services were provided by Actlabs, which is an independent, CALA- and SCC-accredited analytical services firm registered to ISO 17025 and ISO 9001 standard. Drill core samples were logged and split in half with a diamond core saw. Half-core samples were securely stored at the core logging facility until being delivered to Actlabs Thunder Bay lab by commercial transport. Samples were crushed (&lt; 7 kg) up to 90% passing 2mm (10 mesh), riffle split to 250 g and pulverized by mild steel to 95% passing 105μm (150 mesh). Samples splits underwent a 4-acid near total digestion followed by a multi-element analysis, including base metals, using an ICP method for 35 elements. Selected sample pulps were then analyzed for gold using a 30 g aliquot mixed with fire assay fluxes and Ag as a collector, placed in a fire clay crucible, gradually heated to 1060ºC for 60 min, and followed with an AA finish.</p><p>Laboratory QA/QC for the ICP analysis was <percent>14%</percent> for each batch, including 5 method reagent blanks, 10 in-house controls, 10 samples duplicates, and 8 certified reference materials. An additional <percent>13%</percent> QA/QC was performed as part of the instrumental analysis to ensure quality in the areas of instrumental drift. Laboratory quality control for the gold fire assay included two blanks per 42 samples, three sample duplicates and 2 certified reference materials, one high and one low (QC 7 out of 42 samples). In-house QA/QC included the systematic insertion of blanks, duplicates, and certified reference materials (CRM).</p><p><strong>Qualified Person</strong></p><p>Jeremy Niemi, P.Geo., Senior Vice President, Exploration and Evaluation for Sterling Metals has reviewed and approved the technical information presented herein.</p><p><strong>About the Soo Copper Project</strong></p><p>The Soo Copper Project sits just 20 minutes off the Trans-Canada Highway, one hour north of Sault Ste. Marie, and 20km from rail and deep-water access. With near-surface copper-one of the most critical of all critical metals-alongside gold, and with the project now demonstrating both scale and grade, Sterling sees the potential for Soo Copper to become a nationally significant asset as Canada accelerates its efforts to secure strategic copper resources. Prime Minister Carney's recent designation of copper as one of Canada's first five strategic assets underscores the importance of this discovery and its potential to emerge as a key project of national interest.</p><p><strong>About Sterling Metals</strong></p><p>Sterling Metals is a mineral exploration company focused on large scale and high-grade Canadian exploration opportunities. The Company is advancing the 25,000-hectare Soo Copper Project in Ontario which has past production, and multiple breccia and porphyry targets strategically located near robust infrastructure and the 29,000-hectare Adeline Project in Labrador which covers an entire sediment-hosted copper belt with significant silver credits. Both opportunities have demonstrated potential for important new copper discoveries, underscoring Sterling's commitment to pioneering exploration in mineral rich Canada.</p><p>Sterling Metals acknowledges that its exploration activities within the Soo Copper project are conducted on the traditional lands of the Batchewana, Garden River, and Michipicoten First Nations of the North Shore of Lake Superior.

These late-breaking data will be presented for the first time today during an oral abstract session at the 2026 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Genitourinary (GU) Cancers Symposium (abstract #LBA418) and are included in the official ASCO GU Press Program.</p><p>At the first pre-specified interim analysis (median follow-up of 28.4 months [range, 15.0-40.1 months]), KEYTRUDA plus WELIREG given in the adjuvant setting significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS), the study’s primary endpoint, reducing the risk of disease recurrence or death by <percent>28%</percent> (HR=0.72 [<percent>95%</percent> CI 0.59-0.87]; p=0.0003) compared to KEYTRUDA plus placebo. Median DFS was not reached in either arm; the estimated 24-month DFS rate was <percent>80.7%</percent> (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 77.7-83.2) for the KEYTRUDA plus WELIREG arm and was <percent>73.7%</percent> (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 70.6-76.6) for the KEYTRUDA plus placebo arm. As previously reported, the trial will continue to evaluate overall survival (OS), a key secondary endpoint.</p><p>“Approximately <percent>40%</percent> of patients with renal cell cancer may experience tumor growth after initial treatment. Results from LITESPARK-022 mark an important step forward for certain patients with renal cell cancer, showing a significant reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death compared to pembrolizumab alone,” said Dr. Toni K. Choueiri, director, Lank Center for Genitourinary Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Jerome and Nancy Kohlberg professor of medicine, Harvard Medical School. “The combination of pembrolizumab and belzutifan is the first ever regimen in the adjuvant setting for renal cell cancer to demonstrate an improvement in disease-free survival over pembrolizumab monotherapy, positioning this regimen to potentially reshape clinical practice.”</p><p>“LITESPARK-022 is a critical part of our comprehensive RCC clinical development program, and the Phase 3 results presented at ASCO GU underscore the importance of KEYTRUDA and WELIREG in helping to treat patients with certain types of renal cell carcinoma,” said Dr. M. Catherine Pietanza, vice president, Global Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories. “These findings represent the first positive Phase 3 data for WELIREG in earlier stages of disease, as well as the first positive Phase 3 results for a HIF‑2α inhibitor and immunotherapy combination, reinforcing our commitment to exploring novel treatment approaches to improve upon established treatment paradigms for patients in need.”</p><p>The safety profile of KEYTRUDA plus WELIREG was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies for both agents; no new safety signals were observed. Of patients enrolled, <percent>69.5%</percent> of those in the KEYTRUDA plus WELIREG arm and <percent>71.1%</percent> of those in the KEYTRUDA plus placebo arm completed the assigned treatment. Among treated patients, Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in <percent>52.1%</percent> of patients who received KEYTRUDA plus WELIREG and <percent>30.2%</percent> of patients who received KEYTRUDA plus placebo.

In 2022, there were about 435,000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and approximately 156,000 deaths from the disease worldwide. Renal cell carcinoma is about twice as common in men as in women. Most cases of RCC are discovered incidentally during imaging tests for other abdominal diseases. Approximately <percent>30%</percent> of patients with kidney cancer are diagnosed at an advanced stage.</p><p><b>About Merck’s early-stage cancer clinical program</b></p><p>Finding cancer at an earlier stage may give patients a greater chance of long-term survival. Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease. Building on the strong understanding of the role of KEYTRUDA in later-stage cancers, Merck is evaluating our portfolio of medicines and pipeline candidates in earlier disease states, with more than 30 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer.</p><p><b>About Merck’s research in genitourinary cancers</b></p><p>Merck is advancing research aimed at helping transform the treatment landscape and broaden options for people with genitourinary (GU) cancers, including bladder, kidney and prostate cancers. Globally, GU cancers account for an estimated 2.6 million new cancer diagnoses each year, equaling over 1 in 8 of all cancer incidences. Through a robust clinical development program with more than 50 ongoing clinical trials evaluating more than 22,000 patients around the world, Merck is investigating the potential of several portfolio medicines and pipeline assets, leveraging multiple novel combination strategies, across various stages of disease, to help address unmet needs in GU cancers.</p><p><b>About WELIREG<sup>®</sup> (belzutifan) 40 mg tablets, for oral use</b></p><p>WELIREG, Merck’s first-in-class hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF-2α) inhibitor, is an orally administered small-molecule designed to reduce transcription and expression of HIF-2α target genes associated with cellular proliferation, angiogenesis and tumor growth.

These data are being presented as a late-breaking oral abstract at the 2026 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Genitourinary (GU) Cancers Symposium (abstract #LBA417) and are included in the official ASCO GU Press Program.</p><p>At a pre-specified interim analysis with a median follow-up of 29.0 months (range, 19.3-49.2), WELIREG plus LENVIMA demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS), reducing the risk of disease progression or death by <percent>30%</percent> (HR=0.70 [<percent>95%</percent> CI, 0.59-0.84]; p=0.00007) compared to cabozantinib. For WELIREG plus LENVIMA, the median PFS was 14.8 months (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 11.2-16.6) versus 10.7 months (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 9.2-11.1) for cabozantinib. A trend toward improvement in overall survival (OS), the trial’s other primary endpoint, was also observed for WELIREG plus LENVIMA (HR=0.85 [<percent>95%</percent> CI, 0.68-1.05]; p=0.06075). The median OS was 34.9 months (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 27.5-NR) for WELIREG plus LENVIMA versus 27.6 months (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 24.0-31.4) for cabozantinib. The trial is continuing, and OS will be evaluated at a subsequent analysis per the clinical trial protocol.</p><p>Based on data from the LITESPARK-011 trial, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted two supplemental New Drug Applications (sNDA) for review seeking approval for WELIREG plus LENVIMA for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC with a clear cell component following a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. The FDA set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action date, of October 4, 2026 for both the WELIREG and LENVIMA sNDAs.

These findings mark a critical step forward for these patients.”</p><p>“The LITESPARK-011 trial highlights the potential of this first-of-its-kind combination regimen to deliver a meaningful benefit for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma whose disease progresses after PD-1/L1 therapy,” said Dr. M. Catherine Pietanza, Vice President, Global Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories. “These WELIREG plus LENVIMA data demonstrate important progress for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and reinforce our commitment to improving the lives of patients through innovative treatment strategies.”</p><p>“The LITESPARK-011 results reinforce LENVIMA's established role in renal cell carcinoma and highlight the potential of this novel combination to address an area of significant unmet need,” said Dr. Corina Dutcus, Senior Vice President, Oncology Global Clinical Development Lead at Eisai. “The acceptance of this regulatory filing is an important milestone, and we remain committed to working toward approval to bring this option to patients as soon as possible. We are grateful to the patients, their families, and the investigators, whose dedication made this research possible.”</p><p><b>Additional findings</b></p><p>Data for objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR), two key secondary endpoints, were also reported. At the first interim analysis with a median follow-up of 19.6 months (range, 9.9-39.8), WELIREG plus LENVIMA met ORR, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement compared to cabozantinib. A confirmed ORR of <percent>52.6%</percent> (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 47.3-57.7) was observed for WELIREG plus LENVIMA versus <percent>39.6%</percent> (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 34.6-44.8) for cabozantinib. At the second interim analysis with a median follow-up of 29.0 months, the median DOR was 23.0 months (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 2.0-44.3+) for WELIREG plus LENVIMA versus 12.3 months (<percent>95%</percent> CI, 1.8+-35.9+) for cabozantinib.</p><p>WELIREG plus LENVIMA was administered to 370 patients and cabozantinib was administered to 371 patients.

In 2022, there were about 435,000 new cases of kidney cancer and approximately 156,000 deaths from the disease worldwide. RCC is about twice as common in men as in women. Most cases of RCC are discovered incidentally during imaging tests for other abdominal diseases. Approximately <percent>30%</percent> of patients with kidney cancer are diagnosed at an advanced stage.</p><p><b>About Merck’s research in genitourinary cancers</b></p><p>Merck is advancing research aimed at helping transform the treatment landscape and broaden options for people with genitourinary (GU) cancers, including bladder, kidney and prostate cancers. Globally, GU cancers account for an estimated 2.6 million new cancer diagnoses each year, equaling over 1 in 8 of all cancer incidences. Through a robust clinical development program with more than 50 ongoing clinical trials evaluating more than 22,000 patients around the world, Merck is investigating the potential of several portfolio medicines and pipeline assets, leveraging multiple novel combination strategies, across various stages of disease, to help address unmet needs in GU cancers.</p><p><b>About WELIREG<sup>®</sup> (belzutifan) 40 mg tablets, for oral use</b></p><p>WELIREG, Merck’s first-in-class hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF-2α) inhibitor, is an orally administered small-molecule designed to reduce transcription and expression of HIF-2α target genes associated with cellular proliferation, angiogenesis and tumor growth. By inhibiting HIF-2α signaling, WELIREG aims to disrupt key pathways certain tumors may use to adapt to low-oxygen conditions, including those that help promote abnormal blood vessel formation and support tumor survival.</p><p>WELIREG has demonstrated antitumor activity in certain von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated tumors, renal cell carcinoma and in pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. As part of a broader clinical program, Merck continues to research WELIREG monotherapy and combination approaches for people with genitourinary, breast and gynecologic cancers across a range of treatment settings to further define where HIF-2α inhibition may provide clinical benefit and to better understand which patients are most likely to respond.</p><p><b>Indications in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location></b></p><p><i>Certain von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated tumors</i></p><p>WELIREG is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease who require therapy for associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET), not requiring immediate surgery.</p><p><i>Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)</i></p><p>WELIREG is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with a clear cell component following a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor and a vascular endothelial growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGF-TKI).</p><p><i>Pheochromocytoma or Paraganglioma (PPGL)</i></p><p>WELIREG is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma (PPGL).</p><p><b>Selected Safety Information for WELIREG</b></p><p><b><i>Warning: Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</i></b></p><p>Exposure to WELIREG during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm.

LENVIMA inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1-4, the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, LENVIMA decreased tumor-associated macrophages, increased activated cytotoxic T cells, and demonstrated greater antitumor activity in combination with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody compared to either treatment alone. The combination of LENVIMA and everolimus showed increased antiangiogenic and antitumor activity as demonstrated by decreased human endothelial cell proliferation, tube formation, and VEGF signaling in vitro and tumor volume in mouse xenograft models of human renal cell cancer greater than each drug alone.</p><p><b>LENVIMA<sup>®</sup> (lenvatinib) Indications in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location></b></p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>For the treatment of adult patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).</li><li>In combination with pembrolizumab, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).</li><li>In combination with everolimus, for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following one prior anti-angiogenic therapy.</li><li>For the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).</li><li>In combination with pembrolizumab, for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) or not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.</li></ul><p><b>Selected Safety Information for LENVIMA</b></p><p><b>Warnings and Precautions</b></p><p><b>Hypertension. </b>In differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), hypertension occurred in <percent>73%</percent> of patients on LENVIMA (<percent>44%</percent> grade 3-4).

Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.</p><p><b>Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ).</b> ONJ has been reported in patients receiving LENVIMA. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, dental disease or invasive dental procedures, may increase the risk of ONJ.</p><p>Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with LENVIMA and periodically during LENVIMA treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices and to consider having preventive dentistry performed prior to treatment with LENVIMA and throughout treatment with LENVIMA.</p><p>Avoid invasive dental procedures, if possible, while on LENVIMA treatment, particularly in patients at higher risk. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ.</p><p>Withhold LENVIMA if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgement of adequate resolution.</p><p><b>Embryo‐Fetal Toxicity. </b>Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of LENVIMA during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus; and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for 30 days after the last dose.</p><p><b>Adverse Reactions</b></p><p>In DTC, the most common adverse reactions (≥<percent>30%</percent>) observed in LENVIMA-treated patients were hypertension (<percent>73%</percent>), fatigue (<percent>67%</percent>), diarrhea (<percent>67%</percent>), arthralgia/myalgia (<percent>62%</percent>), decreased appetite (<percent>54%</percent>), decreased weight (<percent>51%</percent>), nausea (<percent>47%</percent>), stomatitis (<percent>41%</percent>), headache (<percent>38%</percent>), vomiting (<percent>36%</percent>), proteinuria (<percent>34%</percent>), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (<percent>32%</percent>), abdominal pain (<percent>31%</percent>), and dysphonia (<percent>31%</percent>).

In November 2025, we began to see early signs of an improved supply-demand balance, driven by stronger-than-expected demand from energy storage systems (ESS), as well as certain supply disruptions. This led to a tighter market environment and a shift in pricing trends. We continue to observe solid demand fundamentals, and we estimate that the lithium market could grow by approximately <percent>25%</percent> this year, led by electric vehicles (EVs) and ESS.”</p> <p align=\"justify\">Mr. Ramos continued: At Nova Andino Litio, we are operating at full capacity to meet our customer commitments while continuing to advance our expansion plans in the Salar de Atacama. In parallel, we are increasing refinery of lithium carbonate from lithium sulfate in China through tolling agreements.”</p> <p align=\"justify\">He added: “In Australia, we are also operating at full capacity in the production of spodumene concentrate. In January of this year, we celebrated our first shipment of lithium hydroxide produced in Australia at the Kwinana refinery. Notably, lithium hydroxide from Kwinana refinery has been certified under the International Lithium Association’s Life Cycle Assessment framework, demonstrating a <percent>37%</percent> lower emissions footprint compared to traditional hard-rock production refined in China.”</p> <p align=\"justify\">Mr Ramos continued: “Our Iodine and Plant Nutrition division delivered solid performance, particularly in iodine, which contributed approximately <percent>42%</percent> of SQM’s total gross profit.

(NASDAQ: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/MU/\" title=\"View MU stock overview\">MU</a>) today celebrated the grand opening of its semiconductor assembly and test facility in Sanand, Gujarat, India. The state-of-the-art facility converts advanced DRAM and NAND wafers from Micron's global manufacturing network into finished memory and storage products. Once fully ramped, the first phase of Micron’s Sanand operation will feature more than 500,000 square feet of cleanroom space, making it one of the world’s largest single-floor assembly and test cleanrooms. The site serves customers worldwide to meet the growing global demand for memory and storage fueled by AI.</p> <p>The facility represents a combined investment of approximately <money>$2.75 billion</money> by Micron and its government partners, advancing semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in India. Micron Chairman, President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra and other executives witnessed the opening ceremony with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister of Gujarat Bhupendra Patel, Union Minister for Railways, Communications, Electronics &amp; IT Ashwini Vaishnaw, U.S. Ambassador to India Sergio Gor and other distinguished government officials and guests.</p> <p>\"Today is a proud moment for Micron and India's growing semiconductor industry,\" said Sanjay Mehrotra, Chairman, President and CEO of Micron Technology. “This pioneering facility, the first assembly and test site of its kind in the country, helps build a resilient ecosystem that underpins the global AI economy. We are deeply grateful to the government of India, the Gujarat government and all of the partners involved for their steadfast support in making this achievement possible.\"</p> <p>The Sanand site is ISO 9001:2015 certified and has begun commercial production. To mark the grand opening of the site, Micron presented its first shipment of made-in-India memory modules to Dell Technologies for its laptops made in India for India. Micron expects to assemble and test tens of millions of chips at Sanand in 2026, scaling to hundreds of millions in 2027. The expansion of conventional assembly and test operations in India complements Micron's planned development of advanced manufacturing and packaging capabilities in the United States and strengthens the company’s global assembly and test network.</p> <p>“The inauguration of Micron’s semiconductor facility in Sanand marks a historic milestone as Bharat begins its first commercial semiconductor chip production,” said Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. “This is a decisive step towards building a trusted, resilient and self-reliant semiconductor ecosystem under the leadership of Hon’ble PM Shri Narendra Modi Ji.

DBV Technologies is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary VIASKIN<sup>®</sup> patch technology to address food allergies, which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies, including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT), the VIASKIN<sup>®</sup> Patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV Technologies is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of the VIASKIN<sup>®</sup> Peanut Patch in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).</p> <p align=\"justify\">DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon, France, with North American operations in Warren, NJ.
