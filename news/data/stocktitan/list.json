(\"Biglari Capital\"), the largest stockholder of Jack in the Box Inc. (NasdaqGS: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/JACK/\" title=\"View JACK stock overview\">JACK</a>), with a <percent>9.86%</percent> ownership stake, today issued the following statement regarding the preliminary voting results from <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/JACK/\" title=\"View JACK stock overview\">JACK</a>'s 2026 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.</p><p><b>A Clear Divide: Accountability vs. Complacency </b></p><p>Preliminary voting results from JACK's stockholder meeting reveal a stark and troubling divide. Active fund managers and retail stockholders — those who bear the real consequences of failed corporate governance — voted to hold Chairman David Goebel accountable for the destruction of stockholder value and his failure to act as a responsible steward of stockholder interests. By contrast, ISS, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street supported the status quo, providing cover for a board that has presided over value destruction.</p><p><b>JACK spent <money><money>$5 Million</money></money> to Defend One Director for One More Year </b></p><p>JACK spent an estimated <money><money>$5 million</money></money> on this proxy contest — not to protect the company's future, but to defend the reelection of David Goebel for a single additional year.</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>Over the last five years alone, Mr. Goebel collected approximately <money><money>$1.55 million</money></money> in director compensation.</li><li>During the same period, JACK's stockholders lost approximately <percent>80%</percent> of their investment — roughly <money><money>$1.8 billion</money></money> in stockholder value.</li><li>Mr. Goebel was paid millions to oversee billions in destruction.</li></ul><p><b>ISS, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street: A Governance Failure </b></p><p>While active fund managers and retail stockholders voted for accountability, ISS and the three largest index funds — BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street — supported JACK's failed leader.</p><p>Preliminary voting data for the three index funds imply that the proxy voting teams at these firms are completely indifferent to how their decisions impact the owners whose capital they are entrusted to protect. One is left to wonder: Do these governance teams even consider the repercussions their rubber-stamping of failed leadership has on the investors who have lost <percent>80%</percent> of the value of their JACK holdings?</p><p>JACK is a poster child of everything that can go wrong at a public company — catastrophic acquisition, leadership turnover, persistent operational underperformance, and entrenched governance — yet it has still managed to secure the support of a proxy advisor and the three largest index funds. This is not governance; it is the institutionalization of unaccountability.</p><p><b>The Underlying Investors Would Disagree</b></p><p>If the ETF investors who have entrusted their savings to BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street — retail investors saving for retirement, college, and financial security — had had a say, they likely would have voted against Goebel. These investors did not hand over their savings so that the governance teams at these institutions could give a free pass to the same failed leadership at JACK that destroyed <money><money>$1.8 billion</money></money> in stockholder value.</p><p>Failing to hold boards accountable promotes mediocrity. It puts the entire system of meritocracy at risk. When the largest stewards of capital — BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street — abdicate their governance responsibilities, the consequences extend far beyond any single company.</p><p><b>JACK's False and Misleading Statements</b></p><p>In addition to these governance failures, JACK made false and misleading statements in its proxy materials. Biglari Capital reserves the right to pursue all available legal remedies.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b></p><p>Mr. Goebel should be embarrassed and ashamed of the company's performance. He should have resigned years ago instead of playing politics and trying to hold on, wasting money for personal gain while relying on abstain votes, ISS, and index funds. He has no credibility with active investors.</p><p>SOURCE Biglari Capital Corp.</p></div></article>",

Geochemical analysis certificates included in Assessment Report 31,834 comprise results from three laboratories: Pioneer Labs (Certificate 2102718, 2010), ALS (Certificate VA10144345, 2010), and SGS (Certificate CA02322, 2010). The SGS certificate reported three rare earth elements including La 10 percent, Pr 0.77 percent, and Ce 13.1 percent.</p><p>Sample AR-20 was taken from a shear zone at 2,270 meters elevation hosted in coarse grain syenite gneiss with elevated apatite and zircon. The historic Copeland Mine, at elevation 2,100 metres is located 1.2 km northwest of Mount Copeland. Review of the 2010 technical report identified a typographical transcription error in the summary table. The original laboratory certificates contained in the appendix were correct; however, certain assay values for rock chip sample COPE10AR-20 were not accurately transcribed into the summary table. Using the original laboratory certificates referenced in the appendix, the Company recalculated the Total Rare Earth Oxide equivalent for sample AR20, which returns approximately 26 percent TREO.</p><p>The Company cautions that this recalculated TREO value is derived from historic laboratory certificates and has not been independently re-assayed or verified under current National Instrument 43-101 standards. The reported value relates to a select rock chip sample and is not necessarily representative of mineralization across the property. Rock chip samples are selective in nature and may not be indicative of grade or continuity.</p><p>In 2024, additional rock chip samples collected near the edge of the Copeland Glacier returned values of up to 0.234 percent niobium associated with elevated molybdenum. These results are also based on selective sampling and may not be representative of mineralization across the property. Representative samples from AR20 and other prospective zones are being prepared for submission to an independent laboratory for ICP-MS analysis to support potential future NI 43-101 compliant disclosure.</p><p><b>Molybdenum and Rhenium Update</b></p><p>The Company has also applied its dry mineral separation process to molybdenum-bearing rock chip samples from both Mount Copeland and the Red Bird property, upgrading the material to molybdenum concentrates. </p><p>The Red Bird property is characterized as a copper-molybdenum porphyry system with associated silver and rhenium mineralization, as documented in prior exploration work. Rhenium is commonly associated with molybdenite in porphyry environments.</p><p>Preliminary internal XRF analysis was performed using an Elvatech ElvaX ProSpector 3 X-ray fluorescence analyzer. The instrument was calibrated in accordance with manufacturer specifications and verified using certified reference standards prior to analysis.</p><p>Internal XRF analysis indicates that Mount Copeland material returned approximately 2,790 ppm rhenium in elemental analysis. Red Bird material returned approximately 3,182 ppm rhenium in oxide analysis and 2,115 ppm rhenium in elemental analysis of selected separated samples.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9904/285660_ef0bab2f8407998f_001full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?
