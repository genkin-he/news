The LOI is structured in two stages: first, the Company will fund a low-cost auger drill program of up to C<money>$20,000</money> (\"Due Diligence Payment\") in order to conduct diligence (\"Initial Due Diligence\") on the Property; if the Company wishes to then proceed, it will, in consideration for the Due Diligence Payment, acquire the Option. The Initial Due Diligence program will consist of up to 10 auger drill holes designed to verify the presence of ionic clay REE mineralization and assess the character and distribution of the rare earth-bearing horizon.</p><p>\"This Patos acquisition expands our exposure to another potential ionic clay rare earth system in Brazil, a country that has seen several recent rare earth discoveries within favourable geological settings,\" commented Canamera CEO Brad Brodeur. \"We will apply a systematic exploration program to determine whether similar mineralization may be present on the Patos property in a mining friendly, relatively low cost jurisdiction.\"</p><p><b>Option Exercise - Cash and Share Consideration</b></p><p>Should Canamera acquire the Option following the completion of the Initial Due Diligence program, then such Option may be exercised by the Company making the following cash and Company share payments (\"Option Payments\") immediately following completion of the Initial Due Diligence program:</p><ul><li><p><b>Cash Consideration: </b>C<money>$228,000</money> in aggregate, comprising the C<money>$20,000</money> Due Diligence Payment and a remaining cash payment of C<money>$208,000</money>; and</p></li><li><p><b>Share Consideration: </b>Common shares of Canamera having an aggregate deemed value of C<money>$307,800</money>, issued at a price equal to the 10-day volume-weighted average price (\"VWAP\") of the Company's shares over the 10 trading days immediately prior to closing, subject to applicable Canadian securities laws and CSE approval. Fifty percent (<percent>50%</percent>) of the shares will be held in escrow for four (4) months and the remaining fifty percent (<percent>50%</percent>) for six (6) months from the date of issuance.</p></li></ul><p>Upon making the Option Payments, Canamera will acquire a <percent>100%</percent> interest in the Property, subject to a <percent>2%</percent> net smelter return royalty (\"NSR\") in favor of the Offeror (and the obligation to make the Milestone Payments described below). Canamera will have the right to buy back <percent>50%</percent> of the NSR (reducing it to a <percent>1%</percent> NSR) for C<money>$228,000</money> upon certain terms and conditions.</p><p><b>Milestone Payments</b></p><p>Subject to acquiring and exercising the Option, Canamera has also agreed to pay the following milestone payment amounts (\"Milestone Payments\") to the Offeror:</p><ul><li><p><b>Milestone Payment 1: </b>C<money>$342,000</money> (comprised of <percent>50%</percent> cash / <percent>50%</percent> Company shares at 20-day VWAP) payable if Canamera reports, in respect of the Property, a 43-101-compliant Inferred Resource of 250 million tonnes or more, grading at least 2,000 ppm Total Rare Earth Oxides (\"TREO\") within five (5) years from the date of acquisition.</p></li><li><p><b>Milestone Payment 2: </b>C<money>$228,000</money> (comprised of <percent>50%</percent> cash / <percent>50%</percent> Company shares at 20-day VWAP) payable if Canamera reports, in respect of the Property, drill intercepts of 25 metres grading at least 2,500 ppm TREO within three (3) years from the date of acquisition.</p></li></ul><p><b>Patos Project Overview</b></p><p>The Patos Project consists of eight (8) prospecting licences (ANM Licence IDs: 830763/2024 through 830771/2024) totalling approximately 15,979 hectares, located in the municipality of Presidente Olegário in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The Property is road accessible and situated approximately 330 kilometres from Belo Horizonte.</p><p>The Property is underlain by the Patos Formation, a member of the Mata da Corda Group — the same stratigraphic package currently being explored for ionic clay REE mineralization by other companies active in the region. Ionic clay REE deposits are of particular interest given their amenability to low-cost, low-impact extraction methods relative to hard-rock REE deposits.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/11828/285428_66887350c49ce911_001full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 26, 2026) - Eureka Lithium Corp. (CSE: ERKA) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/UREKF/\" title=\"View UREKF stock overview\">UREKF</a>) (FSE: S58) (\"<b>Eureka Lithium</b>\" or \"<b>Eureka</b>\" or the \"<b>Company</b>\") is pleased to announce, further to its news release dated January 28, 2026, that it has completed the acquisition (\"<b>Acquisition</b>\") of a <percent>100%</percent> interest in the Cabin Lake Polymetallic Project, located in the Omineca Mining District of British Columbia, and of a <percent>100%</percent> interest in the Tyee Titanium-Vanadium Project, located within the Havre-St-Pierre region of Quebec (together, the \"<b>Properties</b>\"), through its acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares (\"<b>Stairway Shares</b>\") of Stairway Mining Inc. (\"<b>Stairway</b>\").</p><p>The Acquisition was made pursuant to the terms of an amended and restated share purchase agreement (\"<b>Share Purchase Agreement</b>\") dated February 20, 2026, under which Eureka acquired the Stairway Shares in exchange for an aggregate of 9,100,000 common shares of Eureka, issued to Stairway Shareholders on a pro rata basis (\"<b>Consideration Shares</b>\"). In addition, Eureka has agreed to make a milestone cash payment of, in aggregate, CAD <money>$1,000,000</money> (the \"<b>Milestone Payment</b>\", and together with the Consideration Shares, the \"<b>Consideration</b>\") to former Stairway Shareholders, on a pro rata basis, in the event that all of the following milestones are achieved: (i) Eureka files a technical report for each of the Properties on SEDAR+ within six months of the date of the Share Purchase Agreement; (ii) Eureka delineates and publicly discloses a mineral resource estimate in respect of at least one the Properties within nine months of the date of the Share Purchase Agreement; and (iii) Eureka publicly discloses a preliminary economic assessment in respect of at least one of the Properties within 15 months of the date of the Share Purchase Agreement. The Consideration Shares are subject to a hold period of four months and one day from the date of issuance.  The Company notes that, as disclosed in its January 28, 2026 news release, the original consideration contemplated to be paid for the Acquisition was 12,000,000 common shares of Eureka, with no Milestone Payment.  These terms were amended as a result of the Company's inability to vary the four month and one day hold applicable to the Consideration Shares pursuant to Canadian Securities Exchange policies.</p><p>The Company notes that the Consideration for the Acquisition was determined through arm's length negotiations between the Company and Stairway.  During such negotiations, the Company's management and board applied its business judgment, having regard to comparable transactions in the junior mining industry.  Stairway originally staked or acquired the Tyee Project claims in December 2025. The Company's Consideration was not based on the historical staking or acquisition cost of the claims, but rather on its independent assessment of the exploration potential, geological merit, strategic value and market comparables for similar stage critical mineral assets. Management does not consider the difference between Stairway's original acquisition cost and the Consideration to be indicative of the fair value of the Properties.</p><p>The former Stairway Shareholders are arm's length to the Company and to its directors, officers, and, to its knowledge, insiders. </p><p>The Cabin Lake Project is comprised of six contiguous mineral claims totaling approximately 2,363 hectares in central British Columbia's Omineca Mining District. Cabin Lake is a polymetallic system prospective for zinc, lead, copper, molybdenum and silver, with multiple historical showings and a 600 metre by 1,000 metre target footprint identified through prior exploration work.</p><p>The Cabin Lake Project is strategically located near established infrastructure and producing and past-producing mines, including the Endako Mine<sup>1</sup> and the Blackwater Mine<sup>2</sup>, underscoring the district-scale fertility of the region.*</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9639/285386_569dd43d44164ad0_002full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

Tariff impacts are forecast to be immaterial.</p><p>Mobile sales are expected to grow <percent>2%</percent> to <percent>6%</percent> year over year compared with flat to <percent>4%</percent> growth previously, due to favorable currency translation. Off-Road sales are projected to grow mid-single digits as select end-market conditions improve following weakness in the prior year. On-Road sales are forecast to be flat as a result of muted global truck production. Aftermarket sales are expected to increase mid-single digits from continued market share gains and vehicle utilization rates.</p><p>Industrial sales are projected to be in a range of between -<percent>1%</percent> and <percent>3%</percent> compared with 2025, below previous guidance of between <percent>2%</percent> and <percent>6%</percent> as a result of lower volumes.

guidance to fiscal 2026 GAAP EPS guidance is not included in this release due to the number of variables in the projected GAAP EPS range and the Company’s current inability to reasonably quantify certain amounts, such as restructuring or other charges, that would be included in the GAAP measure or the individual adjustments for such reconciliation.</p><p>Note: Although free cash flow, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating expense, adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS are not measures of financial performance under GAAP, the Company believes they are useful in understanding its financial results. Free cash flow is a commonly used measure of a company’s ability to generate cash in excess of its operating needs. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of operating earnings less non-cash expenses. The adjusted basis presentation excludes the impact of certain matters not related to the Company’s ongoing operations. Management believes that the adjusted basis presentation reflects management’s performance in operating the Company and provides a meaningful representation of the performance of the Company’s core business and is useful to understanding its financial results. A shortcoming of these financial measures is that they do not reflect the Company’s actual results under GAAP. Management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Amounts may not foot due to rounding.</p><p><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20260226184143r1&amp;sid=acqr8&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en\" style=\"width:0;height:0\"/><span class=\"bwct31415\"></span></p><p id=\"mmgallerylink\"><span id=\"mmgallerylink-phrase\">View source version on businesswire.com: </span><span id=\"mmgallerylink-link\"><a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260226184143/en/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260226184143/en/</a></span></p><p><b>For more information, contact:</b><br/>Sarika Dhadwal (952) 887-3753<br/><a href=\"mailto:Sarika.Dhadwal@Donaldson.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">Sarika.Dhadwal@Donaldson.com</a></p><p>Source: Donaldson Company, Inc.</p></article>",

In the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we generated meaningful free cash flow, enabling us to reduce leverage to levels below where we stood prior to our asset transaction in August. This performance reflects the durability of our financial model and our continued focus on disciplined capital allocation.</p><p>Subsequent to quarter-end, we announced our agreement to acquire Valiant Artificial Lift Solutions, expanding our artificial lift capabilities and strengthening our ability to deliver the right solution for our customers in each well, every time. The transaction remains subject to customary regulatory approvals, and we expect it to close in the first week of March. We believe this transaction meaningfully expands our addressable market and strengthens our ability to support customers earlier in a well’s producing life and throughout the well lifecycle. As we integrate the business in 2026, we are confident in our ability to drive incremental growth and long-term value while continuing to advance Flowco’s broader production optimization strategy.”</p><p><b>Segment Information</b></p><p>We report our results in two segments, Production Solutions and Natural Gas Technologies. Production Solutions includes the rental, sale and service associated with high pressure gas lift, conventional gas lift and plunger lift, including a range of digital solutions and other production related technologies. Natural Gas Technologies includes the design, manufacture, rental and sale of vapor recovery and natural gas systems. Corporate costs not directly related to either segment are categorized separately.</p><p><b><i>Segment Financial Information</i></b></p><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl

accepted accounting principles in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> (“GAAP”), the Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted Net Income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, as well as Adjusted Segment EBITDA and Adjusted Segment EBITDA Margin, in this press release to supplement financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that excluding certain items from our GAAP results provides management additional insight on the consolidated financial performance from period to period to project our future consolidated financial performance as forecasts are developed at a level of detail different from that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures. Moreover, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide our management and investors with useful information to help them evaluate our operating results by facilitating an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and enabling them to make more meaningful period to period comparisons. There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release. For example, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. Similarly, Free Cash Flow does not represent our residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures, since the calculation of this measure does not reflect certain debt service requirements or certain other non-discretionary expenditures. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. The Company urges investors to review the reconciliation and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.</p><p><b><i>Adjusted Net Income</i></b></p><p>Adjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP measure that we define as net income (loss) adjusted to eliminate the impact of (i) transaction-related expenses, (ii) share-based compensation, (iii) loss on the sale of equipment, (iv) loss on debt payments and (v) changes to the value of our inventory. Adjusted Net Income is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by management, our stockholders and others to provide visibility on the profitability and financial strength of the Company by excluding certain expenses related to non-recurring Company transactions.</p><p>Reconciliation from net income to Adjusted Net Income is set forth as follows:</p><table cellspacing=\"0\"

The Company reported a diluted loss per share of <money><money>$0.41</money></money> in the fourth quarter of 2025. Adjusted EBITDA decreased to <money><money>$38.8 million</money></money>, and adjusted core EPS also declined to <money><money>$0.28</money></money>. Included in the Company’s reported results this quarter are <money><money>$66.2 million</money></money> of expenses associated primarily with (i) impairment charges and other losses related to underperforming assets the Company plans to sell in 2026, and (ii) operating costs and losses resulting from indemnified and repurchased loans. The Company ended the year with <money><money>$299 million</money></money> of cash and cash equivalents, as the majority of the impairment charges and other losses taken in the fourth quarter were non-cash. The recurring cash revenues driven by the Company’s <money><money>$144 billion</money></money> loan servicing portfolio and strength of the balance sheet led the Company’s Board of Directors to declare a dividend of <money><money>$0.68</money></money> per share for the first quarter of 2026, a <percent>1.5%</percent> increase over the 2025 quarterly dividend and a <percent>172%</percent> increase since the dividend was initiated in 2018.</p><p>“We closed 2025 with strong momentum across our business after growing total transaction volume each quarter throughout the year from <money><money>$7 billion</money></money> in Q1’25 to <money><money>$18 billion</money></money> in Q4’25, up <percent>161%</percent>” commented Walker &amp; Dunlop Chairman and CEO Willy Walker. “As the commercial real estate transaction market continues to improve, our people and our brand are winning, reflected in our growing market share, and strong league table rankings. We finished the year as the #1 Fannie Mae DUS lender, #3 Freddie Mac Optigo lender, the second-largest combined GSE loan originator, and the fourth-largest multifamily property sales broker in the United States.”</p><p>Mr. Walker continued, “Our fourth quarter results were impacted by loan repurchase expenses and impairment charges related to our real estate owned portfolio. As we move forward from these issues, we feel very well positioned for growth in 2026 and beyond. With a <money><money>$144 billion</money></money> servicing portfolio generating durable recurring revenue, a robust Capital Markets pipeline building early in the year, and an improving macroeconomic backdrop for commercial real estate, we are focused on generating top and bottom-line growth in 2026 and beyond. Our mission is to become the very best commercial real estate capital markets company in the world, and that journey begins now.”</p><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl\"><tr><td class=\"bwpadl0\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\">____________________</td></tr><tr><td class=\"bwpadl0 bwpadr0 bwvertalignt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"bwalignr bwcellpmargin\">(1)</p></td><td class=\"bwvertalignt bwpadl1\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"bwcellpmargin\">Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure the Company presents to help investors better understand our operating performance.

billion</money></money> of Agency loans in our servicing portfolio are scheduled to mature over the next two years, which presents an opportunity for our GSE loan servicing portfolios to continue scaling as our Capital Markets team continues to deliver top end market share with the GSEs. The maturing loans, with a weighted-average servicing fee of 28 basis points, represent only <percent>10%</percent> of the total Agency loans in our portfolio. Over the next five years, <percent>53%</percent> of Agency loans will mature, providing an opportunity for us to recapitalize or sell these deals for our clients in the coming years.</li><li>The mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) associated with our servicing portfolio are reported at an amortized cost of <money><money>$808 million</money></money> as of December 31, 2025, while the fair value is estimated at <money><money>$1.4 billion</money></money>.

decreases in net income and diluted earnings per share were primarily the result of increases in indemnified and repurchased loan expenses and asset impairments and other expenses during the fourth quarter. In the first quarter of 2026, the Company made the strategic decision to sell a portfolio of underperforming assets that was acquired in 2021 from Alliant. Affordable assets have recovered more slowly than market rate assets, particularly in rent-controlled markets, and the carrying value of these assets was above the expected fair value, resulting in <money><money>$26.1 million</money></money> of asset impairment charges and accrued losses this quarter. In addition, we recognized a total of <money><money>$35.5 million</money></money> of indemnified and repurchased loan expenses and credit losses in the quarter in connection with all loans we have repurchased, indemnified or expect to indemnify.</li><li>Total revenues decreased less than <percent>1%</percent> this quarter, while total expenses increased <percent>24%</percent> as a result of the aforementioned asset impairment charges and other expenses, and indemnified and repurchased loan expenses, leading to the year-over-year decline in our operating margin and net income. The decrease in net income was the primary factor in the decrease in return on equity.</li><li>The increase in personnel expense as a percentage of total revenues was principally the result of an increase in variable compensation driven by the growth in loan origination and debt brokerage fees, net (“origination fees”) for the quarter.</li><li>The <percent>59%</percent> decrease in adjusted EBITDA was largely related to the aforementioned increases in asset impairments and other expenses and the non-credit portion of indemnified and repurchased loan expenses, coupled with increased personnel expenses and a decrease in other revenues.</li><li>Adjusted core EPS decreased <percent>79%</percent>, largely for the same reasons that adjusted EBITDA decreased.</li></ul><table

during the fourth quarter 2025.</li><li>In the first quarter of 2026, the Company completed an internal investigation into fraudulent borrower activity on certain loans sold to Freddie Mac. Stemming from that investigation, Freddie Mac has either asked us, or we expect they will ask us, to repurchase three portfolios of loans associated with three separate borrowers with a UPB of <money><money>$134.3 million</money></money>. We executed a forbearance and indemnification agreement for one of the portfolios of loans with a UPB of <money><money>$50.7 million</money></money> that delays the repurchase of the loans until the fourth quarter of 2027 and indemnifies Freddie Mac for any losses until the repurchase date. We are negotiating a forbearance and indemnification agreement with Freddie Mac for the second portfolio of loans with a UPB of <money><money>$49.3 million</money></money>, and we expect to negotiate a forbearance and indemnification agreement for the third portfolio of loans with a UPB of <money><money>$34.3 million</money></money> in the first half of 2026.</li><li>Prior to the fourth quarter, our approach to repurchased and indemnified loans was to operate them with the intent of repositioning them to recover a portion of the losses incurred. That approach no longer aligns with our long-term strategy, and we shifted our focus for the <money><money>$87.3 million</money></money> of assets repurchased or indemnified in 2024 to a near-term exit strategy.</li><li>We have repurchased loans with a UPB totaling <money><money>$52.5 million</money></money> over the last two years, and those loans are currently valued at <money><money>$47.7 million</money></money>. We are evaluating the most effective path to selling those assets. We have indemnification agreements in place for another <money><money>$83.4 million</money></money> of loans as of December 31, 2025, with collateral posted of <money><money>$22.7 million</money></money>, resulting in a maximum cash outlay over the next two years of <money><money>$60.7 million</money></money>. We expect to sell the loans or underlying assets associated with the loans prior to the expiration of the indemnification agreements in order to pay off the repurchase obligation.</li></ul><p class=\"bwalignc\"><b>FOURTH QUARTER 2025<br/></b><b>FINANCIAL RESULTS BY SEGMENT</b></p><p>Interest expense on corporate debt is determined at a consolidated corporate level and allocated to each segment proportionally based on each segment’s use of that corporate debt.

rate, remained flat at <money><money>$16.0 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower average interest rates during the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to the fourth

Revenues grew at a slower pace than transaction volumes principally due to (i) the increase in origination fees, driven primarily by debt brokerage and property sales transaction growth and several large transactions this quarter; and (ii) lower non-cash MSR income on our new Fannie Mae loan originations.</li><li>Debt brokerage and property sales transactions generally carry lower origination fee rates than Agency transactions. Large portfolio transactions also generate lower origination fee rates than smaller transactions, all else equal. The combination of these two factors this quarter drove the decline in the origination fee rate to 75 basis points this quarter, compared to 94 basis points in the year ago fourth quarter.</li><li>The decrease in MSR income was largely a result of the decrease in the Agency MSR rate. The Agency MSR rate decreased due to a decline in the weighted-average servicing fee (“WASF”) on Fannie Mae originations. Borrowers continue opting for shorter duration loans due to the shape of the yield curve and the desire to maintain optionality in the short term as interest rates continue normalizing.</li><li>Property sales broker fees increased year over year primarily due to the <percent>31%</percent> increase in property sales volume, coupled with an increase in the property sales broker fee rate year over year.</li><li>Personnel expense increased in the fourth quarter of 2025 primarily due to an increase in commission costs primarily resulting from growth in origination and property sales broker fees, coupled with an increase in salaries and benefits resulting from an increase in average segment headcount.</li><li>The change in fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities year over year was due to an adjustment taken in the fourth quarter of 2024 with no comparable adjustment in the current year quarter. The adjustment for the fourth quarter of 2024 was driven by the reduction of an expected payout of earnouts associated with a technology acquisition and one of our previous brokerage acquisitions, as both were no longer expected to achieve specific long-term performance hurdles because of the sharp declines in transaction volumes in 2023 and 2024.</li><li>The decrease in adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to the decrease in income before taxes, coupled with an increase in personnel expenses, partially offset by increases in origination fees and property sales broker fees.</li></ul><table

RESULTS</span>:</b></p><p><i>The Servicing &amp; Asset Management segment includes loan servicing, principal lending and investing, management of third-party capital invested in tax credit equity funds focused on the affordable housing sector and other commercial real estate, and real estate-related investment banking and advisory services.</i></p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>The <money><money>$8.7 billion</money></money> net increase in the servicing portfolio over the past 12 months was the principal driver of the growth in servicing fees year over year.</li><li>Investment management fees increased primarily due to an increase in investment management fees from our LIHTC operations, due to higher asset dispositions in the fourth quarter of 2025. Our LIHTC business recognizes asset management fees through cash flows from its underlying property level investments and the sale, or realization, of those property level investments.</li><li>The primary driver in the decrease in placement fees was a decline in the placement fee rates on escrow deposits as a result of the lower short-term interest rate environment in 2025 compared to 2024, combined with a decrease in the average replacement reserve escrow balance period over period.</li><li>During the fourth quarter of 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell a portfolio of affordable assets, including some of the assets, which we have operated since the acquisition of Alliant in 2021. The sale of one of the assets closed in the fourth quarter of 2024, generating a gain on sale of <money><money>$26.5 million</money></money> included in other revenues for this segment, explaining the year over year decline in that line item. The remaining assets included in that sale were expected to close in 2025 upon receipt of customary consents. Those consents are still in process, and that sale is now expected to close in the first half of 2026. However, intangible and other assets were written off in the fourth quarter of 2024 in connection with the agreement to sell the assets, explaining most of the decline in amortization and depreciation this year.</li><li>The change in fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities was primarily due to an <money><money>$8.2 million</money></money> contingent consideration revaluation in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to a <money><money>$10.8 million</money></money> revaluation in the fourth quarter of 2024, as the earnout targets for our LIHTC acquisition were not fully achieved.</li><li>The increase in indemnified and repurchased loan expenses was primarily driven by the repurchase requests as outlined in the Indemnified and Repurchased Loans section above.</li><li>The increase in asset impairments and other expenses was primarily driven by the asset impairments recorded in the fourth quarter of 2025 as outlined in the Key Performance Metrics section above.</li><li>Other operating expenses decreased largely due to a decrease in professional fees, driven by a decline in legal costs at one of our LIHTC subsidiaries.</li><li>The decrease in losses attributed to noncontrolling interests is the result of a change in the ownership of an entity producing losses in 2024. As part of a larger transaction with the noncontrolling interest holder, we regained full control of the entity at the end of 2024. The remaining noncontrolling interests in 2025 are immaterial.</li></ul><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl bwwidth100\"><tr><td class=\"bwrowaltcolor0 bwpadl0\"

The decline in net income and diluted EPS were principally attributable to a <percent>40%</percent> decrease in income before taxes.</li><li>Adjusted EBITDA decreased primarily due to decreases in placement fees and other interest income and other revenues, coupled with increased personnel costs and indemnified and repurchased loan expenses and a decrease in losses attributable to non-controlling interest holders. These changes were partially offset by increases in origination fees, property sales broker fees, and servicing fees.</li><li>Diluted EPS decreased <percent>49%</percent> year over year, in tandem with the <percent>48%</percent> decline in net income, compared to a decrease of <percent>30%</percent> year over year for adjusted core EPS.

Additionally, we originated a large Fannie Mae portfolio during the second quarter of 2025, with no comparable activity in 2024, contributing to the decline in origination fee rates as large portfolios earn lower fee margins.</li><li>The increase in total expenses was primarily related to increases in personnel costs mostly due to (i) increased commission costs resulting from the growth in origination fees and property sales broker fees, (ii) increased salaries and benefits largely related to an increase in average segment headcount, and (iii) increased severance expense, resulting from the separation of several underperforming producers.</li><li>Net income, Diluted EPS and adjusted EBITDA for the Capital Markets segment have improved sequentially the last three years and represent a direct reflection of the steady improvement in overall Capital Markets transaction volumes.

Our ideas and capital create communities where people live, work, shop, and play. Our innovative people, breadth of our brand, and our technological capabilities make us one of the most insightful and client-focused firms in the commercial real estate industry.</p><p><b>NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES</b></p><p>To supplement our financial statements presented in accordance with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location> generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company uses adjusted EBITDA, adjusted core net income, and adjusted core EPS, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. When analyzing our operating performance, readers should use adjusted EBITDA, adjusted core net income, and adjusted core EPS in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income and diluted EPS.</p><p>Adjusted core net income and adjusted core EPS represent net income adjusted for amortization and depreciation, provision (benefit) for credit losses, net write-offs based on the final resolution of the defaulted loans or collateral, the fair value of expected net cash flows from servicing, net, the income statement impact from periodic revaluation and accretion associated with contingent consideration liabilities related to acquired companies, goodwill impairment and other adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before income taxes, interest expense on our corporate debt, and amortization and depreciation, adjusted for provision (benefit) for credit losses, net write-offs based on the final resolution of the defaulted loans or collateral, loan repurchase losses, stock-based compensation, the fair value of expected net cash flows from servicing, net, the write-off of the unamortized balance of deferred issuance costs associated with the repayment of a portion of our corporate debt, goodwill impairment, and contingent consideration liability fair value adjustments when the fair value adjustment is a triggering event for a goodwill impairment assessment. Furthermore, adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use, as it does not reflect certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The amounts shown for adjusted EBITDA may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges that are used to determine compliance with financial covenants. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted core net income and adjusted core EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.</p><p>We use adjusted EBITDA, adjusted core net income, and adjusted core EPS to evaluate the operating performance of our business, for comparison with forecasts and strategic plans and for benchmarking performance externally against competitors. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial information, provide useful information to investors by offering:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>the ability to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s on-going operating results;</li><li>the ability to better identify trends in the Company’s underlying business and perform related trend analyses; and</li><li>a better understanding of how management plans and measures the Company’s underlying business.</li></ul><p>We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these non-GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial information. For more information on adjusted EBITDA, adjusted core net income, and adjusted core EPS, refer to the section of this press release below titled “Adjusted Financial Measure Reconciliation to GAAP” and “Adjusted Financial Measure Reconciliation to GAAP By Segment.”</p><p><b>FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS</b></p><p>Some of the statements contained in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, projections, plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.

The forward-looking statements contained in this press release reflect our current views about future events and are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that may cause actual results to differ significantly from those expressed or contemplated in any forward-looking statement.</p><p>While forward-looking statements reflect our good faith projections, assumptions and expectations, they are not guarantees of future results. Furthermore, we disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, data or methods, future events or other changes, except as required by applicable law.

The introduction of US tariffs and subsequent uncertainty around USTR-related port fees set the tone early in the year. As months passed, Houthi attacks and the unpredictability surrounding Suez Canal transits continued to affect shipping routes and schedules. At the same time, tightened sanctions on <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ru\">Russia</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ir\">Iran</location>, and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ve\">Venezuela</location> reshaped energy flows, while a brief but intense conflict between <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/il\">Israel</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ir\">Iran</location>, alongside stepped-up Ukrainian strikes on Russian infrastructure and shadow tankers, added further tension to an already complex landscape.</p><p>Against this challenging environment, we kept our focus at TORM on operational excellence and agility. Our scalable platform and disciplined commercial approach enabled us to navigate market fluctuations and strengthen our standing as a dependable, resilient leader in the product tanker industry.</p><p>In this market, TORM achieved TCE fleet-wide rates of USD/day 28,783 on average (2024: USD/day 36,061), and available earning days increased to 31,840 (2024: 31,287). Our vessel class LR2 achieved TCE rates of USD/day 35,850, the LR1 vessels achieved TCE rates of USD/day 28,262, and the MR vessels achieved TCE rates of USD/day 26,374.</p><p>Key

</sup>Excludes unrealized gains/losses on derivatives.</p><p>For the full-year 2025, Return on Invested Capital was <percent>11.5%</percent> (2024: <percent>24.3%</percent>), a level that remains solid and satisfactory even as it reflects the expected normalization in freight rates and the corresponding impact on earnings.</p><p>During the year, the weighted average number of outstanding shares increased to 98.2m shares (2024: 93.6m shares) which combined with the net profit led to basic EPS of <money>USD 2.91</money> (2024: <money>USD 6.54</money>).</p><p>In the fourth quarter of 2025, TORM achieved TCE of <money>USD 251m</money> (2024, same period: <money>USD 215m</money>). Adjusted EBITDA amounted to <money>USD 151.5m</money> including unrealized gains on derivatives of <money>USD 5m</money> (2024, same period: <money>USD 135.0m</money> including unrealized gains on derivatives of <money>USD 7m</money>) and a net profit of <money>USD 87m</money> (2024, same period: <money>USD 77m</money>), underscoring the improved market dynamics for the product tanker industry compared to the same quarter last year. In this market, TORM achieved TCE rates of USD/day 30,658 on average (2024, same period: USD/day 25,775), while available earning days were broadly unchanged at 8,032 (2024, same period: 8,054).</p><p>Vessel Transactions</p><p>Throughout 2025, TORM continued its disciplined fleet renewal strategy, balancing the divestment of older tonnage with targeted acquisitions to strengthen fleet quality and efficiency. The fourth quarter stood out as the most active period of the year, with TORM agreeing to acquire eight product tankers, the majority of which were delivered before year-end. These additions further enhanced the fleet profile and underscored our commitment to maintaining a high-quality, competitive fleet. During the same period, TORM also completed the divestment of one older LR2 tanker, with delivery scheduled for early 2026.</p><p>Over the full year, TORM acquired nine second-hand vessels as part of our ongoing optimization efforts. In addition, we exercised purchase options on 14 leaseback vessels, transitioning them to full ownership and strengthening both operational and financial flexibility.</p><p>Together, these actions reflect TORM's sustained commitment to maintaining a modern, efficient fleet and to a capital allocation strategy designed to support long-term competitiveness.</p><p>By the end of December 2025, TORM had 93 owned and leased vessels in the LR2, LR1, and MR vessel classes.</p><p>Distribution of Dividend for the Fourth Quarter of 2025</p><p>TORM's Board of Directors has approved an interim dividend for the fourth quarter of <money>USD 0.70</money> per share to be paid to the shareholders, corresponding to an expected total dividend payment of <money>USD 70.9</money> m. The distribution for the quarter is equivalent to <percent>82%</percent> of net profit and reflects the Distribution Policy. The payment date is 25 March 2026 to all shareholders on record as of 12 March 2026, and the ex-dividend date is 11 March 2026 for the shares listed on Nasdaq OMX Copenhagen and 12 March 2026 for the shares listed on Nasdaq New York.</p><p>Financial Outlook 2026 (INSIDE INFORMATION)</p><p>TORM's financial outlook is based on our current product tanker market expectations. We do, however, have limited visibility on TCE rates that are not yet fixed with our customers; hence these rates may be significantly lower or significantly higher than our current expectations.</p><p>For the full-year 2026, TCE earnings are expected to be in the range of <money>USD 850</money> - 1,250m (2025: <money>USD 910m</money>), and EBITDA is expected to be in the range of <money>USD 500</money> - 900m (2025: <money>USD 571m</money>) based on the current fleet size, including published acquisitions and divestment of vessels.</p><p>As of 17 February 2026, <percent>70%</percent> of the Q1 2026 earning days were covered at USD/day 34,926. For the individual vessel classes, the Q1 2026 coverage was <percent>69%</percent> at USD/day 44,943 for LR2, <percent>53%</percent> at USD/day 46,803 for LR1 and <percent>74%</percent> at USD/day 30,411 for MR.</p><p>Further, as of 17 February 2026, TORM had covered <percent>23%</percent> of the 2026 full-year earning days at USD/day 34,462. Hence, <percent>77%</percent> of the 2026 full-year earning days are subject to change.</p><p>Thus as 26,241 earning days in 2026 are unfixed as of 17 February 2026, a change in freight rates of USD/day 1,000 will - all other things being equal - impact the EBITDA by <money>USD 26m</money>.</p><p>Webcast and Conference Call</p><p>TORM will host a webcast and conference call for investors and analysts today, Thursday 26 February 2026 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time / 04:00 p.m. Central European Time.</p><p><u>Webcast link:</u><br/>Please access the webcast <a href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628109-1&amp;h=1829029024&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fevents.q4inc.com%2Fattendee%2F430923390&amp;a=here\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a><a href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628109-1&amp;h=2507165561&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fevents.q4inc.com%2Fattendee%2F430923390&amp;a=.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">.</a></p><p><u>Participants joining by telephone:</u><br/>Please call one of the dial-in numbers (below) at least ten minutes prior to the start (Conference ID: 34069):</p><p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/dk\">Denmark</location>: +45 32 74 07 10<br/><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">United Kingdom</location>: +44 20 3481 4247<br/><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location>: +1 (646) 307 1963</p><p>Contacts</p><p>Mikael Bo Larsen, Head of Investor Relations<br/>Tel.: +45 5143 8002</p><p>About TORM</p><p>TORM is one of the world's leading carriers of refined oil products.

The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.</p> <p align=\"justify\">iQIYI believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its operating performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of its business operating results, such as operating performance excluding non-cash charges or non-operating in nature. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to the non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to iQIYI’s historical operating performance. The Company believes the non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that the non-GAAP measures exclude certain items that have been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant component in the Company’s results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to the Company’s data.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Non-GAAP operating income/(loss) represents operating income/(loss) excluding share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from business combinations.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to iQIYI, Inc. represents net income/(loss) attributable to iQIYI, Inc. excluding share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from business combinations, disposal gain or loss, impairment of long-term investments, fair value change of long-term investments, adjusted for related income tax effects. iQIYI’s share of equity method investments for these non-GAAP reconciling items, primarily amortization and impairment of intangible assets not on the investees’ books, accretion of their redeemable non-controlling interests, and the gain or loss associated with the issuance of shares by the investees at a price higher or lower than the carrying value per share, adjusted for related income tax effects, are also excluded.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Non-GAAP diluted net income/(loss) per ADS represents diluted net income/(loss) per ADS calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to iQIYI, Inc, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares expressed in ADS.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.</p> <p align=\"justify\">For more information, please contact:</p> <p align=\"justify\">Investor Relations<br/>iQIYI, Inc.<br/><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=c7-SLfUfvb3rgvo7lhbdd-I__c5gQ4IAcJ8WRZQlCeIUQEm949L7pR5N9bGIG-Z4hvfhXfAHJzXhx2YzUZeGJA==\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ir@qiyi.com</a></p> <table align=\"center\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.</p><p>Baidu believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of its recurring core business operating results, such as operating performance excluding non-cash charges or non-operating in nature. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Baidu's historical performance and liquidity. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that these non-GAAP measures exclude certain items that have been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant component in the Company's results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to the Company's data.</p><p>Non-GAAP operating income represents operating income excluding share-based compensation expenses, amortization and impairment of intangible assets resulting from business combinations, impairment of long-lived assets, and one-time employee severance costs.</p><p>Non-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu represents net income attributable to Baidu excluding share-based compensation expenses, amortization and impairment of intangible assets resulting from business combinations, impairment of long-lived assets, one-time employee severance costs, disposal gain or loss, impairment of long-term investments, and fair value gain or loss of long-term investments and exchangeable bonds, adjusted for related income tax effects. Baidu's share of equity method investments for these non-GAAP reconciling items, amortization and impairment of intangible assets not on the investees' books, accretion of their redeemable non-controlling interests, and the gain or loss associated with the issuance of shares by the investees at a price higher or lower than the carrying value per share, adjusted for related income tax effects, are also excluded.</p><p>Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS represents diluted earnings per ADS calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares expressed in ADS. Adjusted EBITDA represents non-GAAP operating income excluding depreciation of fixed assets, and amortization of intangible assets excluding those resulting from business combinations. Adjusted long-term investments represent long-term investments, net, with publicly listed equity method investments adjusted to fair value based on quoted market prices.</p><p>For more information on non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned \"Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measure.\"</p><p> </p><div><table border=\"0\"
