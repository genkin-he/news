Members of the Summit leadership team will participate in individual investor meetings along with some fireside chats at the following conferences:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>TD Cowen's 46th Annual Health Care Conference in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.boston\">Boston</location> on Monday, March 2, 2026<ul class=\"bwlistcircle\"><li>Fireside chat 2:30pm ET</li></ul></li><li>Jefferies Conference in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.miami\">Miami</location> on Tuesday, March 10, 2026<ul class=\"bwlistcircle\"><li><i>Investor meetings only</i></li></ul></li><li>Citizens Life Sciences Conference in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.miami\">Miami</location> on Wednesday, March 11, 2026<ul class=\"bwlistcircle\"><li>Fireside chat 2:15pm ET</li></ul></li></ul><p>The fireside chats will be available live on our website: <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smmttx.com%2F&amp;esheet=54434972&amp;newsitemid=20260226560754&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.smmttx.com&amp;index=1&amp;md5=9fe63ed2db5e906dd5e9c70fbc19b4e9\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">www.smmttx.com</a>. An archived version of both presentations will be available on our website following the presentation.</p><p><b>About Ivonescimab</b></p><p>Ivonescimab, known as SMT112 in Summit’s license territories, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LB/nam\">North America</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LB/sam\">South America</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/eur\">Europe</location>, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/mde\">Middle East</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/afr\">Africa</location>, and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/jp\">Japan</location>, and as AK112 outside of Summit’s license territories, is a novel, potential first-in-class investigational bispecific antibody combining the effects of immunotherapy via a blockade of PD-1 with the anti-angiogenesis effects associated with blocking VEGF into a single molecule. By design, ivonescimab displays unique cooperative binding to each of its intended targets with multifold higher affinity to PD-1 when in the presence of VEGF.</p><p>This is intended to differentiate ivonescimab as there is potentially higher expression (presence) of both PD-1 and VEGF in tumor tissue and the tumor microenvironment (TME) as compared to normal tissue in the body. We believe ivonescimab’s specifically engineered tetravalent structure (four binding sites) enables higher avidity (accumulated strength of multiple binding interactions) in the TME (Zhong, et al, <i>iScience</i>, 2025). This tetravalent structure, the intentional novel design of the molecule, and bringing these two targets into a single bispecific antibody with cooperative binding qualities have the potential to direct ivonescimab to the tumor tissue versus healthy tissue. The intent of this design, together with a half-life of 6 to 7 days after the first dose (Zhong, et al, <i>iScience</i>, 2025) increasing to approximately 10 days at steady state dosing, is to improve upon previously established efficacy thresholds, side effects, and safety profiles associated with prior approved drugs to these targets.</p><p>Ivonescimab was engineered by Akeso Inc. (HKEX Code: 9926.HK) and is currently utilized in multiple Phase III clinical trials. Over 4,000 patients have been treated with ivonescimab in clinical studies globally, and over 60,000 patients when considering those treated in a commercial setting in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>, as noted by Akeso.</p><p>There are currently 15 Phase III clinical studies that are either announced, ongoing, or have been completed studying ivonescimab, four of which are Summit-sponsored global studies, one of which is a multiregional study sponsored by a cooperative group, and ten of which are being or have been conducted in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> by Akeso. Summit began its clinical development of ivonescimab in NSCLC, commencing enrollment in 2023 in two multiregional Phase III clinical trials, HARMONi and HARMONi-3. In 2025, the Company began enrolling patients in HARMONi-7. Summit expanded its Phase III clinical development program into CRC in the fourth quarter of 2025 by initiating enrollment in HARMONi-GI3.</p><p>HARMONi is a Phase III clinical trial which intends to evaluate ivonescimab combined with chemotherapy compared to placebo plus chemotherapy in patients with EGFR-mutated, locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who were previously treated with a 3rd generation EGFR TKI (e.g., osimertinib). Detailed results of the study were provided in September 2025, and a Biologics License Application (BLA) was submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing authorization, which the FDA accepted for filing in January 2026; the goal Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date is November 14, 2026.</p><p>HARMONi-3 is a Phase III clinical trial, which is intended to evaluate ivonescimab combined with chemotherapy compared to pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy in patients with first-line metastatic, squamous or non-squamous NSCLC, irrespective of PD-L1 expression.</p><p>HARMONi-7 is a Phase III clinical trial which is intended to evaluate ivonescimab monotherapy compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with first-line metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression.</p><p>HARMONi-GI3 is a Phase III clinical trial evaluating ivonescimab in combination with chemotherapy compared with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in patients with first-line unresectable metastatic CRC.</p><p>Also including Summit’s license territories, a Phase III study is planned to be conducted by GORTEC, a cooperative group dedicated to Head and Neck Oncology, in recurrent / metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (r/m HNSCC). ILLUMINE is a three-arm Phase III clinical trial which is intended to evaluate ivonescimab monotherapy, as well as ivonescimab in combination with ligufalimab, Akeso’s proprietary anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody, compared to monotherapy pembrolizumab in patients with PD-L1 positive r/m HNSCC.</p><p>In addition, Akeso has recently had positive read-outs in three single-region (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>), randomized Phase III clinical trials, HARMONi-A, HARMONi-2, and HARMONi-6, for ivonescimab in NSCLC, including a statistically significant overall survival benefit in HARMONi-A with a manageable safety profile in each study.</p><p>HARMONi-A was a Phase III clinical trial which evaluated ivonescimab combined with chemotherapy compared to placebo plus chemotherapy in patients with EGFR-mutated, locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who have progressed after treatment with an EGFR TKI.</p><p>HARMONi-2 is a Phase III clinical trial evaluating monotherapy ivonescimab against monotherapy pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have positive PD-L1 expression.</p><p>HARMONi-6 is a Phase III clinical trial evaluating ivonescimab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy compared with tislelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC, irrespective of PD-L1 expression.</p><p>Akeso is actively conducting multiple Phase III clinical studies in settings outside of NSCLC, including biliary-tract cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer.</p><p>Ivonescimab is an investigational therapy that is not approved by any regulatory authority in Summit’s license territories, including <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/eur\">Europe</location>. Ivonescimab was initially approved for marketing authorization in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> in May 2024. Ivonescimab was granted Fast Track designation by the US FDA for the HARMONi clinical trial setting.</p><p><b>About Summit Therapeutics</b></p><p>Summit Therapeutics Inc. is a biopharmaceutical oncology company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of patient-, physician-, caregiver- and societal-friendly medicinal therapies intended to improve quality of life, increase potential duration of life, and resolve serious unmet medical needs.</p><p>Summit was founded in 2003 and our shares are listed on the Nasdaq Global Market (symbol \"<a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/SMMT/\" title=\"View SMMT stock overview\">SMMT</a>\").

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><div class=\"xn-content\"><p><span class=\"legendSpanClass\"><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">NEW YORK</location></span>, <span class=\"legendSpanClass\">Feb. 26, 2026</span> /PRNewswire/ -- This press release provides shareholders of Cohen &amp; Steers Total Return Realty Fund, Inc. (NYSE: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/RFI/\" title=\"View RFI stock overview\">RFI</a>) (the \"Fund\") with information regarding the sources of the distribution to be paid on February 27, 2026 and cumulative distributions paid fiscal year-to-date.</p><p>In December 2011, the Fund implemented a managed distribution policy in accordance with exemptive relief issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The managed distribution policy seeks to deliver the Fund's long-term total return potential through regular monthly distributions declared at a fixed rate per common share. The policy gives the Fund greater flexibility to realize long-term capital gains throughout the year and to distribute those gains on a regular monthly basis to shareholders. The Board of Directors of the Fund may amend, terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares. </p><p>The Fund's monthly distributions may include long-term capital gains, short-term capital gains, net investment income and/or return of capital for federal income tax purposes. Return of capital includes distributions paid by the Fund in excess of its net investment income and net realized capital gains and such excess is distributed from the Fund's assets. A return of capital is not taxable; rather, it reduces a shareholder's tax basis in his or her shares of the Fund. In addition, distributions from the Fund's investments in real estate investment trusts (REITs) may later be characterized as capital gains and/or a return of capital, depending on the character of the dividends reported to the Fund after year-end by REITs held by the Fund. The amount of monthly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors, including changes in portfolio and market conditions.</p><p>At the time of each monthly distribution, information will be posted to cohenandsteers.com and mailed to shareholders in a concurrent notice. However, this information may change at the end of the year because the final tax characteristics of the Fund's distributions cannot be determined with certainty until after the end of the calendar year. Final tax characteristics of all of the Fund's distributions will be provided on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year.</p><p>The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year-to-date from the sources indicated. All amounts are expressed per common share.</p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"prnbcc\"><tr><td class=\"prnpr2 prnpl2 prnvab prntal prncbts prnrbrb1 prnbbbs

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p align=\"center\"><em>At Mobile World Congress 2026 in Barcelona, March 2-4, Veea will be demonstrating a groundbreaking control plane for distributed edge environments </em>— <em>organizations with multiple deployments</em> <em>can automate management of AI workloads, network-wide across fleets of devices, with policy enforcement, and software lifecycle management powered by prpl LCM </em></p> <p>NEW YORK, Feb.  26, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Veea Inc. (NASDAQ: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/VEEA/\" title=\"View VEEA stock overview\">VEEA</a>) today announced TerraFabric, a transformative control plane that enables organizations to automate distributed edge environments composed of multi-vendor heterogeneous networks as highly coordinated systems rather than collections of individual devices or networks. TerraFabric brings together fleet orchestration, policy enforcement, and software lifecycle management to give operators the visibility and control they need to run AI workloads at the edge safely and at scale.</p> <p>TerraFabric is available for early deployments now, both as a standalone platform and as an integrated capability within VeeaONE, Veea’s edge computing platform.</p> <p><strong>The Gap Between Deploying Edge Infrastructure and Actually Operating It</strong></p> <p>The edge computing industry has become proficient at deploying hardware in the field. Organizations can register devices, push containers, and monitor basic health across dozens or hundreds of locations. However, a growing gap remains between deploying edge infrastructure and operating it efficiently with minimal overhead.</p> <p>The challenges are familiar to anyone managing a multi-site enterprise. One service may require GPU resources, while another must provide guest Wi-Fi with a captive portal. Security policies must apply consistently across every location. A software update at one site should not disrupt the entire fleet. When each location is managed independently, every change introduces risk, and teams end up performing work that could otherwise be automated.</p> <p>“We have spent the last decade making multiaccess edge computing easier to deploy,” said Allen Salmasi, co-founder and CEO of Veea. “We believe TerraFabric is about what comes next. Our customers are telling us that deployment is no longer the hard part. The challenge is coordinating dozens to hundreds of sites, keeping policies consistent, and maintaining uniform application of cybersecurity while rolling out changes without disruption. We built TerraFabric to address exactly that.”</p> <p><strong>What TerraFabric Does</strong></p> <p>TerraFabric sits above existing infrastructure. It does not replace Kubernetes, operating systems, or hardware. Instead, it provides a coordination layer that understands the full structure of an edge deployment — from fleet to region to site to device, and makes that structure actionable, instantly customizable, and verifiable.</p> <p>Operators define policies that are enforced consistently at every level. Workloads are optimally placed based on use case requirements and constraints, rather than guesswork. Software rollouts follow controlled sequences with health checks at each stage and one-click rollback if issues arise. Every action is logged, auditable, and tied to a clear chain of accountability.</p> <p>Instead of asking, “Which device should run this container?”, operators define where a system should run, under what constraints, and within what policy boundaries. TerraFabric is designed to handles the rest. Its implementation also offers the ability to continuously enhance the automation from edge to cloud in dynamic, resource constrained edge environments through machine learning and AI,</p> <p><strong>Carrier-Grade Lifecycle Management with prpl LCM</strong></p> <p>For software lifecycle management, TerraFabric incorporates prpl LCM, the open-source lifecycle management engine developed by the prpl Foundation. prpl LCM has been proven at scale, managing containerized applications across more than 12 million AT&amp;T gateways. It enables operators to remotely deploy, update, pause, restart, and remove individual containerized applications without affecting the underlying system firmware.</p> <p>By building on prpl LCM, TerraFabric inherits a lifecycle management layer that has been battle-tested across some of the largest device fleets in the world. Applications can be managed independently, updated on their own schedules, and rolled back individually if a problem is detected. Based on large scale deployments to date, we believe this allows organizations to accelerate updates and deploy new capabilities without compromising overall system stability.</p> <p>“We chose prpl LCM because it is the most proven open-source lifecycle management engine available,” Mr. Salmasi said. “TerraFabric brings that same carrier-grade lifecycle management to every edge environment, whether you are operating ten sites or ten thousand.”</p> <p><strong>Governed Autonomy for AI at the Edge</strong></p> <p>As AI agents and automated workflows become standard edge workloads, governance becomes increasingly critical. These systems make decisions, take actions, and interact with physical environments. Granting them access without clear boundaries creates risk.</p> <p>TerraFabric introduces a principle Veea calls “governed autonomy.” AI agents and automation run as workloads under explicit identity, scope, and policy controls. They operate within defined boundaries, enforced by the TerraFabric control plane, rather than relying on manual oversight at each site.</p> <p>This matters because the promise of edge AI depends on trust. Organizations deploying these systems must be confident that autonomous workloads operate within defined and enforceable limits. TerraFabric makes that confidence possible by design.</p> <p><strong>What Operators Can Do on Day One</strong></p> <p>TerraFabric is designed to deliver immediate value. On day one, operators can roll out AI model updates, whether via cloud distribution or federated learning, by region with automated health checks and failover. TerraFabric can publish network policies across entire fleets in controlled batches with immediate rollback capability. It can coordinate sensor-triggered workflows across sites without manual integration. And it can version, stage, and promote workloads with full change history and accountability.</p> <p>These are the challenges that typically emerge when edge deployments transition from pilot to production. TerraFabric was built to address them from the outset.</p> <p><strong>Three Ways to Deploy</strong></p> <p>TerraFabric runs as a standalone control plane across any mix of data centers, edge clusters, and Kubernetes environments — no rip-and-replace required. With VeeaONE, it is available directly within the Veea Control Center, where operators can enroll VeeaHubs and additional nodes and activate orchestration, policy, and lifecycle controls across the mesh. In hybrid mode, TerraFabric bridges VeeaONE and non-Veea environments under a unified control plane, enabling organizations to automate diverse infrastructure as a single coordinated system.</p> <p><strong>Availability</strong></p> <p>TerraFabric is currently available for pilot deployments. Organizations interested in evaluating TerraFabric can request early access, schedule a pilot discussion, or explore partner and licensing opportunities at veea.com.</p> <p><strong>About Veea Inc.</strong></p> <p>Veea Inc.

(NYSE: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/RNP/\" title=\"View RNP stock overview\">RNP</a>) (the \"Fund\") with information regarding the sources of the distribution to be paid on February 27, 2026 and cumulative distributions paid fiscal year-to-date.</p><p>In December 2017, the Fund implemented a managed distribution policy in accordance with exemptive relief issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The managed distribution policy seeks to deliver the Fund's long-term total return potential through regular monthly distributions declared at a fixed rate per common share. The policy gives the Fund greater flexibility to realize long-term capital gains throughout the year and to distribute those gains on a regular monthly basis to shareholders. The Board of Directors of the Fund may amend, terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares.</p><p>The Fund's monthly distributions may include long-term capital gains, short-term capital gains, net investment income and/or return of capital for federal income tax purposes. Return of capital includes distributions paid by the Fund in excess of its net investment income and net realized capital gains and such excess is distributed from the Fund's assets. A return of capital is not taxable; rather, it reduces a shareholder's tax basis in his or her shares of the Fund. In addition, distributions from the Fund's investments in real estate investment trusts (REITs) may later be characterized as capital gains and/or a return of capital, depending on the character of the dividends reported to the Fund after year-end by REITs held by the Fund. The amount of monthly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors, including changes in portfolio and market conditions.</p><p>At the time of each monthly distribution, information will be posted to cohenandsteers.com and mailed to shareholders in a concurrent notice. However, this information may change at the end of the year because the final tax characteristics of the Fund's distributions cannot be determined with certainty until after the end of the calendar year. Final tax characteristics of all of the Fund's distributions will be provided on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year.</p><p>The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year-to-date from the sources indicated.

(NASDAQ: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/AUGO/\" title=\"View AUGO stock overview\">AUGO</a>) (B3: AURA33) (“Aura” or the “Company”) </strong>announces that it has filed its audited consolidated financial statements and earnings release (together, “Financial and Operational Results”) for the period ended December 30, 2025. The full version of the Financial and Operational Results can be viewed on the Company’s website at www.auraminerals.com, on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca. or on SEC www.sec.com.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Rodrigo Barbora, Aura’s President, and CEO commented: “We are delighted to report that higher production, higher metal prices and stable costs have once again driven Aura to another set of record results. We closed 2025 with record full-year Adjusted EBITDA of US<money>$547 million</money> at an average realized gold price of <money>$3,446</money>/oz, including a standout Q4 performance of US<money>$207 million</money> at realized gold prices of <money>$4,090</money>/oz. During this transformative year, we achieved multiple major milestones: we completed construction and declared commercial production at Borborema under budget and on schedule, delivered record-high production together with record quarterly, closed the strategic acquisition of MSG in December, successfully listed on Nasdaq — now enjoying strong liquidity with average daily traded volume of almost US<money>$100 million</money> — and were included in 58 different ETFs during the last three months. We also recently announced initial groundwork construction at our Era Dorada project and obtained the license to relocate the road at Borborema, with a potential to double its reserves.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Looking ahead to 2026, we project production to grow to 360,000–390,000 GEO while we still prepare MSG and Apoena for higher output, pursue opportunities to increase capacity at Borborema, advance underground development and expand capacity at Almas, continue exploration and studies to grow Matupá’s Resources &amp; Reserves, and progress our drill campaign in Carajás. Yet, we are just in the beginning. Throughout 2025 and recent months, Aura has taken decisive steps toward our forecast of exceeding 600,000 GEO per year, while we continue to identify and pursue opportunities to go even further.”</p> <p><strong>Operational &amp;

At constant prices, Aura’s quarterly production was record high, increasing by <percent>12%</percent> compared to Q3 2025 and <percent>29%</percent> above Q4 2024. When compared to the last quarter, the result was mainly attributable to stronger operational performance driven by higher ore processed volumes and improved grades at Almas, the production increase of Borborema and the inclusion of MSG in December.</p> <p align=\"justify\">In 2025, production reached 280,414 GEO, representing a <percent>5%</percent> increase in current metal prices.

At 2025 Production Guidance Prices and excluding MSG, the 2025 production was 285,380 GEO, ending the year achieving the upper half of the Company’s 2025 Production Guidance (266k GEO – 300k GEO).</p> <p><strong>2.2.

Excluding this impact of MSG and at constant 2024 metal prices, Aura’s Cash Cost was US<money>$1,036</money>/GEO, reflecting a <percent>6%</percent> decrease compared to Q4 2024 and <percent>2%</percent> decrease compared to Q3 2025. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, this improvement was mainly driven by operational enhancements at Almas and Borborema, supported by higher grades and higher recovery rates, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, increase in production at Almas and the additional of Borborema, which had a lower-than-average cash cost profile, contributed to the reduction.</p> <p align=\"justify\">In 2025, Cash Cost averaged US<money>$1,136</money>/GEO, representing a <percent>9%</percent> increase, primarily driven by lower grades and a higher waste-to-ore ratio at Almas and Apoena, as well as the impact of copper-to-GEO conversion at Aranzazu. At constant 2024 metal prices and excluding MSG, Cash Cost in 2025 averaged US<money>$1,054</money>/GEO, in line with 2024 which was US<money>$1,041</money>/GEO. Cash Cost also adversely affected by lower stacking volumes at Minosa, resulting from higher rainfall in 2025 compared to 2024, which followed an unusually dry rainy season in Minosa during 2024, and Apoena, which is going under an investment phase. These negative impacts were offset by the addition of Borborema with its lower-than-average cash cost profile.</p> <p align=\"justify\">In Q4 2025, consolidated All-in Sustaining Cost (AISC) at current metal prices totaled US<money>$1,521</money>/GEO, representing a <percent>9%</percent> increase compared to Q4 2024, while at Q4 2024 metal prices and excluding MSG would have been down <percent>2%</percent> mainly due to higher sales volume from Almas and the addition from Borborema; these business units have the lower AISC of Aura’s portfolio of mines in production. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, AISC increased by <percent>8%</percent> compared to Q3 2025 at current prices and <percent>2%</percent> at constant prices ex-MSG, reflecting as flat sales were offset by temporary <percent>18%</percent> increase in capex and <percent>28%</percent> higher G&amp;A, which were partially mitigated by higher production from Borborema.</p> <p align=\"justify\">In 2025, AISC reached US<money>$1,458</money>/GEO, an increase of <percent>10%</percent> when compared to 2024 at current prices and <percent>2%</percent> increase in constant prices and excluding MSG for the same reasons discussed above. At Guidance Prices and excluding MSG, Aura’s AISC was US<money>$1,368</money>/GEO, in line with the bottom end of the Company’s guidance range of US<money>$1,374</money>/GEO to US<money>$1,492</money>/GEO.</p> <p><strong>2.4.

(ii) the Feasibility Study for the Era Dorada Project (non-recurring); and (iii) higher stock-based compensation (non-cash) and Deferred Share Unit (“DSU”) expenses, driven by the significant appreciation in the Company’s share price during the period; (iv) declaration of commercial production from Borborema (during the pre-commercial production period, a portion of the expenses were capitalized) and (v) addition G&amp;A associated with the MSG Mine in December 2025. Compared to Q4 2024, G&amp;A increased mainly due to the same reasons.</p> <p align=\"justify\">In 2025, the increase in G&amp;A expenses was driven by the same factors, as well as costs related to the Nasdaq IPO.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Exploration expenses totaled US<money>$2.6 million</money> in Q4 2025, a <percent>11%</percent> increase compared to Q3 2025 and <percent>46%</percent> decrease from Q4 2024, as most expenses related to exploration activities in the quarter were capitalized. Exploration activities in the quarter were concentrated in Aranzazu and Almas. In 2025, exploration expenses were US<money>$8.1 million</money>, with a total of US<money>$3.6 million</money> of Aranzazu and US<money>$1.9 million</money> of Almas, <percent>2%</percent> higher than 2024 (excluding Projects). In 2025, Projects were significantly lower compared to 2024, which counted for US<money>$6.4 million</money> of Exploration expenses. In Matupá, efforts were focused on expanding reserves in regions close to X1, Pé Quente and other strategic areas. In Carajás, exploration work successfully confirmed copper mineralization, expanding the mineral potential of the region.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Other expenses primarily comprise provisions recognized to reflect the estimated partial non-recoverability of VAT credits related to Minosa (<money>$8,250)</money> and the expected discount on the sale of VAT (ICMS) credits from Apoena (<money>$1,922)</money> and other non-recurring expenses.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The Company thus ended Q4 2025 with Operating Income of US<money>$165.1 million</money>, compared to an Operating Income of US<money>$67.1 million</money> in Q4 2024, also higher compared to the Operating Income of Q3 2025 of US<money>$136.9 million</money>, which reflects a positive result of higher gross profit. In 2025, the Operating Income was US<money>$458.9 million</money>, <percent>125%</percent> increase compared to 2024. This result occurred due to an <percent>113%</percent> increase in the Gross Profit and a <percent>43%</percent> reduction on exploration expenses, partially offset by <percent>54%</percent> higher G&amp;A.</p> <p><strong>2.6.

The Company’s increase in production, while maintaining disciplined cost control, enabled it to fully capture the benefit of rising metal prices. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled compared to Q4 2024 and grew <percent>37%</percent> over Q3 2025.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by higher production, strong cost control and higher gold and copper prices, as discussed previously. This result was also noted on the Adjusted EBITDA margin gain of 18 p.p. compared to Q4 2024, supported by stronger metal prices but also by a <percent>16%</percent> increase in sales volume.</p> <p align=\"justify\">In 2025, Adjusted EBITDA reached a record high of US<money>$547.8 million</money>, more than doubling year-over-year, representing a <percent>105%</percent> increase compared to 2024. This strong performance was driven by higher production volumes, mainly supported by Borborema and MSG, which together added 33,334 GEO to the annual production, as well as a <percent>5%</percent> increase in production at Almas versus 2024. Supported by operating leverage and disciplined cost management, the Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to <percent>59%</percent>, compared to <percent>45%</percent> in 2024.</p> <p><strong>2.7.

Compared with Q4 2024, production increased <percent>26%</percent>, primarily because of higher recovery rates, with <percent>4%</percent> increase, and higher grades, from 0.70 g/ton to 0.79 g/ton. In 2025, production was of 35,304 GEO, a decrease of <percent>5%</percent> when compared to 2024, attributable mainly to lower grades and lower ore mined as expected. Considering the full year of 2025, Apoena exceeded the Company’s expectations by delivering higher grades and improved productivity, achieving a recovery rate of <percent>94%</percent>, which drove the mine to finish 2025 above the upper end of the Guidance range, which was 32,000 GEO.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Apoena’s Net Revenue totaled US<money>$36.1 million</money> for Q4 2025, <percent>16%</percent> higher than Q3 2025 and <percent>39%</percent> above the Q4 2024, driven primarily by higher gold prices.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The Cash Cost was US<money>$1,450</money>/GEO for the quarter, down <percent>19%</percent> from Q4 2024, primarily driven by improved recovery rates and higher grades. Compared to Q3 2025, the Cash Cost was up <percent>34%</percent>, mainly due to a higher waste-to-ore ratio which increased to 12.50 tonnes, combined with <percent>29%</percent> lower ore mined volumes. For 2025, Cash Cost increased <percent>4%</percent> to US<money>$1,232</money>/GEO, below Company’s annual Guidance, primarily due to lower grades, consistent with expected mine sequencing. In Q4 2025, Apoena’s AISC was US<money>$2,427</money>/GEO, <percent>3%</percent> lower than Q4 2024, due to the lower G&amp;A and decreased lease expenses. Compared to Q3 2025, AISC increased <percent>36%</percent> due to higher maintenance costs, impacted by plant maintenance in December, representing an increase in COGS. For 2025, AISC ended with US<money>$ 2,007</money>/GEO, <percent>9%</percent> higher than 2024, due to <percent>181%</percent> higher CAPEX due to higher exploration near mine, tailing dams investments and machinery equipment. When compared to Apoena’s AISC Guidance, this result was <percent>18%</percent> below the lower range which was US<money>$2,425</money>/GEO to US<money>$2,619</money>/GEO.</p> <p align=\"justify\">In Q4 2025 compared to Q4 2024, Adjusted EBITDA increased significantly, mainly driven by higher production levels, improved cost performance and stronger gold prices. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, despite slightly lower production and sales volumes and higher costs, the positive impact of higher gold prices more than offset these pressures, supporting an increase in Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. In Q4 2025 versus Q4 2024, EBITDA rose by <percent>255%</percent>, explained by the increase in production, gold prices and lower cash costs. On a full-year basis, EBITDA more than doubled in 2025 compared to 2024, primarily driven by higher gold prices, which more than offset the impact of lower production and sales volumes and higher cost levels during the period.</p> <p><strong>3.3 Minosa</strong></p> <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

However, given the guidance average gold price of <money>$4,287.50</money> /oz, an increase of <percent>24%</percent> over the realized gold prices of 2025, and copper price of <money>$4.9</money>/lb, the total volume in GEO will be impacted by an unfavorable metal-to-GEO conversion factor.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\"><strong>Apoena:</strong> Apoena will focus on continuing developing a new phase of the Nosde phase III pit, as previously disclosed as part of its 2-year investment phase, to support production expansion. Compared to 2025, higher grades are expected. Production will improve, with higher production expected in the second semester.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\"><strong>Minosa:</strong> Minosa is expected to maintain reliable performance throughout 2026, similar to 2025. The projected production for 2026 is lower than the previous year, mainly due to expected grade reduction during the period due to mine sequencing.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\"><strong>Almas:</strong> Almas’ production is expected to reach the new installed capacity in 2026, following process optimizations and throughput enhancements implemented in 2025. These changes increased the plant’s ore processing capacity from 2.0 to 2.2 million tonnes per year. However, the full benefits will not be realized in 2026 due to lower ore grades from mine sequencing. In parallel, the Company has started developing the underground project, which—combined with additional expansion capacity this year—should drive further production increases starting in 2027.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\"><strong>Borborema: </strong>With ramp-up finalized in Q4 2025, Borborema is expected to reach between 65k and 77k GEO in 2026. This guidance reflects the expected increase in Mineral Reserves driven by higher gold prices, which in turn reduces average grades compared to the original feasibility study. As a result, the Company has adjusted its mine sequencing and ore segmentation strategy to incorporate these lower-grade ores, prioritizing overall project economics and the long-term value generated by the mine</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\"><strong>MSG:</strong> This year's focus is on turnaround, efficiency gains, and revisions to the mine plan and methods. This will demand greater attention to equipment maintenance and underground development. Nonetheless, aligned with our operational enhancement plan emphasizing cost optimization, we guide MSG production to 50,000–60,000 GEO in 2026. Output will ramp up quarterly in the second half, reaching higher annualized rates by year-end, with gradual improvements continuing into early 2027.</li></ul> <p>All in all, the 2026 production Guidance expects a total of 340-390 kGEO, representing an average increase of up to 85k (midpoint) when compared to 2025 at current prices and up to 89k GEO at constant metal prices.</p> <p><strong>Cash Costs</strong></p> <p>The table below shows the Company’s cash operating costs per GEO sold guidance for 2026 by Business Unit:</p> <table align=\"center\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

We call this 360° Mining.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Aura is a company focused on the development and operation of gold and base metal projects in the Americas. The Company's five operating assets include the Minosa gold mine in Honduras; the Almas, Apoena, Borborema and MSG gold mines in Brazil; and the Aranzazu copper, gold, and silver mine in Mexico. Additionally, the Company owns Era Dorada, a gold project in Guatemala; Tolda Fria, a gold project in Colombia; and three projects in Brazil: Matupá, which is under development; São Francisco, which is in care and maintenance; and the Carajás copper project in the Carajás region, in the exploration phase.</p> <p><strong>CAUTIONARY NOTES AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">This Press Release, and the documents incorporated by reference herein, contain certain “forward-looking information” within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws and “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of applicable United States securities laws (together, “forward-looking information”). Forward-looking information relates to future events or future performance of the Company and reflect the Company’s current estimates, predictions, expectations or beliefs regarding future events and include, without limitation, statements with respect to: expected production from, and the further potential of the Company’s properties; the ability of the Company to achieve its long-term outlook and the anticipated timing and results thereof (including the guidance set forth herein); the ability to lower costs and increase production; the economic viability of a project; strategic plans, including the Company’s plans with respect to its properties; the amount of mineral reserves and mineral resources; probable mineral reserves; indicated mineral reserves; inferred mineral reserves; the potential conversion of indicated mineral resources into mineral reserves; the amount of future production over any period; capital expenditures and mine production costs; the outcome of mine permitting; other required permitting; information with respect to the future price of minerals; expected cash costs and AISCs; the Company’s ability expand exploration on its properties; the Company’s ability to obtain assay results; the Company’s exploration and development programs; estimated future expenses; exploration and development capital requirements; the amount of mining costs; cash operating costs; operating costs; expected grades and ounces of metals and minerals; expected processing recoveries; expected time frames; prices of metals and minerals; LOM of certain projects; expectations of gold hedging programs; the implementation of cultural initiatives; expected increases to fleet capacities; non-cash losses translating into cash losses; the ability to continue to finance planned growth; access to additional debt; and the repayment of outstanding balances on revolving credit facilities. Often, but not always, forward-looking information may be identified by the use of words such as “expects”, “anticipates”, “plans”, “projects”, “forecasts”, “estimates”, “assumes”, “intends”, “strategy”, “goals”, “objectives” or variations thereof or stating that certain actions, events or results “may”, “could”, “would”, “might” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved, or the negative of any of these terms and similar expressions.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Forward-looking information is necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by the Company, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Forward-looking information in this Press Release is based upon, without limitation, the following estimates and assumptions: the ability of the Company to successfully achieve business objectives; the presence of and continuity of metals at the Company’s projects at modeled grades; gold and copper price volatility; the capacities of various machinery and equipment; the availability of personnel, machinery and equipment at estimated prices; exchange rates; metals and minerals sales prices; cash costs and AISCs; the Company’s ability to expand operations; the Company’s ability to obtain assay results; appropriate discount rates; tax rates and royalty rates applicable to the mining operations; cash operating costs and other financial metrics; anticipated mining losses and dilution; metals recovery rates; reasonable contingency requirements; the Company’s expected ability to develop adequate infrastructure and that the cost of doing so will be reasonable; the Company’s expected ability to develop its projects including financing such projects; and receipt of regulatory approvals on acceptable terms.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s ability to predict or control, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking information. Specific reference is made to the Company’s most recent AIF for a discussion of some of the factors underlying forward-looking information, which include, without limitation: gold and copper or certain other commodity price volatility; changes in debt and equity markets; the uncertainties involved in obtaining and interpreting geological data; increases in costs; environmental compliance and changes in environmental legislation and regulation; interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations; general economic conditions; political stability; and other risks involved in the mineral exploration and development industry. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect the forward-looking information.</p> <p align=\"justify\">All forward-looking information herein is qualified by this cautionary statement. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking information whether because of new information or future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. If the Company does update any forward-looking information, no inference should be drawn that it will make additional updates with respect to such or other forward-looking information.</p> <p>______________________________<br/>1 Considered all mines in production.<br/>2 Realized average gold price per ounce sold, net is a non-GAAP financial measure with no standardized meaning under IFRS, and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. <br/>3 Adjusted EBITDA Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure with no standardized meaning under IFRS, and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.</p> <p>Photos accompanying this announcement are available at:<br/><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/cccd8d49-c784-4e84-a7b6-d876d231286b\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/cccd8d49-c784-4e84-a7b6-d876d231286b</a><br/><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/0107b983-92ef-47e9-887e-ab7917658a0e\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/0107b983-92ef-47e9-887e-ab7917658a0e</a><br/><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/fe5e66c9-e6b1-43b3-809b-ce09505610eb\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/fe5e66c9-e6b1-43b3-809b-ce09505610eb</a></p> <img alt=\"\" class=\"__GNW8366DE3E__IMG\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTY2MjQ5MiM3NDU3NzUxIzIwODcwNTQ=\"/> <br/><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\" src=\"https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/NmFmYjcwYWQtYWIyOS00OTViLWI2OTItMzYyNDM3NWFiZTdiLTEwOTg2MjUtMjAyNi0wMi0yNi1lbg==/tiny/Aura-Minerals-Inc.png\"/><br/><p></p><pre>For more information, please contact:Investor Relationsri@auraminerals.comwww.auraminerals.com</pre></article>",

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p align=\"justify\">ROAD TOWN, British Virgin Islands, Feb.  26, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <strong>Aura Minerals Inc. </strong>(Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/AUGO/\" title=\"View AUGO stock overview\">AUGO</a>) (B3: AURA33) <strong>(“Aura</strong>” or the <strong>“Company”)</strong> is pleased to announce that it has signed the agreement of cooperation with DNIT (Departamento Nacional de Infraestrutura Terrestre) to relocate the federal road, which crosses a portion of the Borborema mine in Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. Also, the Company is pleased to announce an updated Technical Report of Borborema, which is already available on <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.sec.gov</a> and SEDAR+.</p> <p align=\"justify\">This agreement allows the Company to immediately advance the conversion of a significant portion of the existing Indicated Mineral Resources into Probable Mineral Reserves. Following the completion of this Technical Report, Aura increased the Mineral Reserve base by <percent>82%</percent> for approximately 1.5 million ounces of gold.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Highlights of the Updated Feasibility Study and the Project:</strong></p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\"><strong>Strong Reserve Base:</strong> The Feasibility Study includes updated Mineral Resource and Reserve estimates under “SEC S-K 1300 definitions” for the comprising Probable Reserves of 40.7Mt at 1.13g/t Au containing approximately 1,479Koz. gold.</li><li style=\"margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\"><strong>Life of Mine 20 Years and 5 months</strong>: Weighted average annual gold production is estimated at 65 koz, with an estimated LOM of 20.5 years, based on Mineral Reserves estimated in accordance with S-K 1300 guidelines.</li><li style=\"margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\"><strong>Robust Project Economics: </strong>Net present value (“NPV”) of US<money>$612.5 million</money> (from 182 million of the previous FS) and after-tax IRR of <percent>42.8%</percent> when using the weighted average gold price of USD 2,274/Oz considering all the operational years and the exchange rate used was BRL 5.70 for USD 1.00 in 2025 onwards.</li><li style=\"margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\"><strong>Exploration Potential Remains:</strong> The ore body of the Borborema deposit remains open along strike and down dip. Aura believes the project will benefit from additional drilling both to extend the Mineral Resource’s footprint and also to add more contained ounces within the current envelope of mineralization.</li></ul> <p align=\"justify\">Rodrigo Barbosa, President and CEO of Aura, comments, \"This agreement is a major milestone that significantly accelerates value creation at Borborema. Since acquiring the project, we recognized its substantial upside potential — exactly why we designed and built a fully expandable plant from the outset. With the updated reserve now at 1.5 million ounces — <percent>82%</percent> larger than our previous feasibility study — we are immediately advancing engineering and water-access solutions to increase capacity, while progressing the road relocation. Borborema perfectly demonstrates our strategy: start production as quickly as possible, generate positive cash flow in a de-risked environment, and then unlock further upside. Looking ahead, we continue to explore additional opportunities, including a review of the mine plan with new cut-off grades based on higher gold prices, which should further improve our reserves. A new Resources &amp; Reserves report is expected by the end of Q1, concurrent with the publication of our 20F. We remain committed to executing the project responsibly and in full alignment with our Aura 360° Mining philosophy.\"</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Updated Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates </strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">The updated resource block model gold grade was modelled by SRK using Ordinary Kriging (OK) methodology constrained within nested grade shells at 0.2 g/t, 0.5 g/t, and 1.0 g/t indicatory grade shells.</p> <p align=\"justify\">SRK used a nested, soft-boundary grade shell technique with shells at 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 g/t Au to limit the influence of variable Au grades in the broader mineralized volume which displays general lower grade attributes. Raw drilling data was composted to 2 m lengths with upper capping applied at 20 g/t Au. Kriging neighborhoods and variography were determined for each nested grade shell. The Feasibility Study block model showed acceptable validation against composited and raw data with acceptable smoothing and is considered suitable for use in reporting of Mineral Resources.</p> <p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Longitudinal View of Au Grade Shells, Viewing West (Source: SRK)\" data-caption=\"Longitudinal View of Au Grade Shells, Viewing West (Source: SRK)\" data-dpi=\"150\" data-filename=\"Aura_Figure_1.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/ea6c6f86-614e-4249-83f2-4092fe0bbce7/aura-figure-1.jpg\"/><br/></p> <p align=\"center\"><em>Longitudinal View of Au Grade Shells, Viewing West (Source: SRK)</em></p> <p align=\"justify\">SRK utilized an oxidation boundary surface constructed in 2012 by Crusader (Cascar) to discriminate oxide from sulfide mineralization as the logging data was considered too variable and of lower confidence to construct this surface. The oxidation model is utilized to code bulk density as well.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Mineral Resources are classified in accordance with S-K 1300 definitions into Indicated and Inferred categories based on identified uncertainty and risks.</p> <p align=\"justify\">In order to establish reasonable prospects for economic extraction (RPEE) as per S-K 1300 definitions of Mineral Resources, SRK applied an economic cut-off grade (CoG) to blocks constrained within an economic pit shell on the Borborema property. This shell utilizes a 1.0 revenue factor, 37-degree slope on the west and 60-degree slope on the east, 2 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) mining rate, and <percent>5%</percent> discount rate.

These Mineral Reserves are defined within detailed engineered pit designs and life-of-mine (LOM) plans that are based on the optimized pit shells. Mineral Reserves within these engineered pit designs were calculated using cut-off grades (COG) specific to each rock type, considering a gold price of US<money>$ 1,472</money>/oz with an exchange rate of R<money>$ 5.2</money>/US<money>$ 1.0</money>, with refining costs included. The Mineral Reserves are contained within two pits. A high-voltage transmission line (HVTL) limits the pit expansion to the north. However, the previously constraining paved highway (BR-226), as indicated in the prior Technical Report (TR), no longer restricts the pit to the south. A summary of the Borborema Mineral Reserves estimates included in the Feasibility Study are shown in table below.</p> <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width:100%; border-collapse:collapse ;\"><tr><td colspan=\"4\"> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align: center ;

The 20 year and 5 months LOM is planned for open pit mining.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The proposed mining operations will employ hydraulic excavators and a fleet of haul trucks with conventional open-pit methods. Excavated material will be loaded into trucks and transported either the Run of Mine (ROM) pad, the low-grade stockpile, oxide ore stockpile or the Waste Rock Storage Facilities (WRSF). Weathered material is considered to be free dig with transitional material to be lightly blasted to loosen it for digging. Fresh rock will be typically blasted on 5 m benches for ore domain and 10 m benches for the waste domain. Mine scheduling assumptions are as follows:</p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\">Plant capacity: 2.0 Mtpy</li><li style=\"margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\">The maximum proportion of oxidized material in the plant is <percent>10%</percent></li><li style=\"margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\">Total material movement: approximately 16 Mtpy</li><li style=\"margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\">Sink rate: 100 meters (5 benches of 20 meters)</li><li style=\"margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\">Maximum capacity of sulfide stockpile: 5.0 Mt</li><li style=\"margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\">Maximum capacity of oxidized stockpile: 1.0 Mt</li></ul> <p align=\"justify\">The stripping ratio is 5.13:1 waste to ore at 0.9=RF(revenue factor). The mine production schedule delivers 40.69 Mt of ore grading 1.13 g/t gold to the mill over the LOM. Waste tonnage totaling 224.7 Mt will be placed in the waste rock dumps.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Mining costs, including the mining contractor charges, stockpile re-handling and grade control, are estimated to average US<money>$2.78</money>/t mined over the LOM.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Qualified Persons </strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">The technical content of this press release has been reviewed and approved by the QPs who were involved with preparation of the Borborema study: Homero Delboni Jr., SRK (U.S,), Inc., Farshid Ghazanfari and Bruno Yoshida Tomaselli.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The QPs are not aware of any known political, legal, environmental or other risks that could materially affect the project development.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Quality Assurance and Quality Control </strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">Analytical work was carried out by two Certified Brazilian laboratories were contracted by Crusader for sample analyses: Bureau Veritas Laboratory (BV) and ALS Laboratory. In addition, check sampling was undertaken at Acme Analytical Laboratories Ltd (Acme) in Santiago, Chile and by Bureau Veritas’ Ultratrace Laboratory in Perth, Western Australia. Big River used SGS GEOSOL Laboratórios Ltda (Rodovia MG010, Km 24,5, bairro Angicos, CEP: 33206-240. Vespasiano/MG.) for 2021-2022 drilling campaign.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Crusader QA/QC program comprised submitting sample blanks, standard reference samples, sample duplicates, and inter‐laboratory check samples. The rate of sample submissions for blanks and reference materials was 1 in 20 samples, duplicates 1 in 25 samples (only for RC holes) and interlaboratory check assays 1 in 10 samples.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The Big River QA/QC program included submittal of both blind and non-blind control samples into the sample stream being analyzed by the SGS laboratory. Big River maintained Internal quality control by inserting minimum of one blank sample in each batch and mainly after each mineralized zone, two standards (one high grade and one low grade in each analytical batch of 40 samples (<percent>5%</percent>) and a minimum of two core duplicates in each analytical batch of 40 samples (<percent>5%</percent>); (Duplicate samples analysis were requested to the lab after received the original results - average of 5 samples per hole).</p> <p align=\"justify\">The control sample assay results of the internal QA/QC program were monitored, including the CRMs, Blanks, and coarse duplicates. Additionally, systematic checks of the digital database were conducted against the original signed Certificates of Analysis from the laboratory.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Mr. Ghazanfari has reviewed the sampling and QA/QC procedures and results thereof as verification of the sampling data disclosed above and approved the information contained in this news release.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>About Aura 360° Mining </strong></p> <p align=\"left\">Aura is focused on mining in complete terms – thinking holistically about how its business impacts and benefits every one of our stakeholders: our company, our shareholders, our employees, and the countries and communities we serve.

The Company's six operating assets include Minosa gold mine in Honduras; Almas, Apoena, Borborema and MSG gold mines in Brazil; and Aranzazu, a copper, gold, and silver mine in Mexico. Additionally, the Company owns Era Dorada, a gold project in Guatemala; Tolda Fria, a gold project in Colombia; and three projects in Brazil: Matupá, which is under development; São Francisco, which is in care and maintenance; and the Carajás copper project in the Carajás region, in the exploration phase.</p> <p align=\"left\">Rodrigo Barbosa<br/>President &amp; CEO<br/>305-239-9332</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Caution Regarding Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">The figures for mineral resources and reserves contained herein are estimates only and no assurance can be given that the anticipated tonnages and grades will be achieved, that the indicated level of recovery will be realized or that the mineral resources and reserves could be mined or processed profitably. Actual reserves, if any, may not conform to geological, metallurgical or other expectations, and the volume and grade of ore recovered may be below the estimated levels. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral resources and reserves, including many factors beyond the Company’s control. Such estimation is a subjective process, and the accuracy of any reserve or resource estimate is a function of the quantity and quality of available data and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and geological interpretation. Short-term operating factors relating to the mineral resources and reserves, such as the need for orderly development of the ore bodies or the processing of new or different ore grades, may cause the mining operation to be unprofitable in any particular accounting period. In addition, there can be no assurance that metal recoveries in small scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in larger scale tests under on-site conditions or during production. Lower market prices, increased production costs, the presence of deleterious elements, reduced recovery rates and other factors may result in revision of its resource and reserve estimates from time to time or may render the Company’s resources and reserves uneconomic to exploit. Resource and reserve data is not indicative of future results of operations. If the Company’s actual mineral resources and reserves are less than current estimates or if the Company fails to develop its resource base through the realization of identified mineralized potential, its results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.</p> <p align=\"justify\">All forward-looking statements herein are qualified by this cautionary statement. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. If the Company does update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that it will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Forward-Looking Information </strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">This press release contains “forward-looking information” and “forward-looking statements”, as defined in applicable securities laws (collectively, “forward-looking statements”) which include, without limitation, mineral resources and mineral reserve estimates and the economic analysis resulting from the Feasibility Study (including NPV, IRR and payback periods); expected production from, and the further potential of the Company’s properties; the ability of the Company to achieve its longer-term outlook; the amount of future production over any period and LOM, capital expenditure, AISC and mine production costs, the Company’s target leverage ratio for the Project; and the completion of the conversion of Dundee’s equity interest in the Project into a net smelter returns royalty.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s ability to predict or control, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements if such risks, uncertainties or factors materialize. The Company has made numerous assumptions with respect to forward-looking information contain herein, including among other things, assumptions from the Feasibility Study, which may include assumptions on gold prices and exchange rates, which could also cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements if such assumptions prove wrong. Specific reference is made to the Company’s most recent AIF on file with certain Canadian provincial securities regulatory authorities and the Technical Reports for a discussion of some of the risk factors underlying forward-looking statements, which include, without limitation the ability of the Company to achieve its longer-term outlook and the anticipated timing and results thereof, the ability to lower costs and increase production, the ability of the Company to successfully achieve business objectives, copper and gold or certain other commodity price volatility, changes in debt and equity markets, the uncertainties involved in interpreting geological data, increases in costs, environmental compliance and changes in environmental legislation and regulation, interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations, general economic conditions and other risks involved in the mineral exploration and development industry.

Caris approached this from a broader biological perspective to encompass as many genomic alterations as can be attained from extreme ultra-deep Whole Genome Sequencing. This additional data has allowed us to achieve greater performance metrics than others and shows that methodologies focused on limited biological information are not sufficient to encompass the diversity of molecular aberrations driving cancer, especially in early-stage disease.
