(TSXV: PX) (OTC Pink: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/PGXPF/\" title=\"View PGXPF stock overview\">PGXPF</a>) (\"Pelangio\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that a controlled-source electromagnetic (\"CSEM\") survey has been commissioned for the Obuasi and Manfo projects to be conducted by SEMS Exploration Services of Ghana. </p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li><p>CSEM surveys will be conducted on Pelangio's Obuasi and Manfo projects to delineate targets up to 1+ kilometre depth below prospective exploration target areas.</p></li><li><p>On Pelangio's Obuasi project, the survey will be conducted in tandem with an AngloGold Ashanti survey on the Obuasi mine property. Pelangio's portion of the two surveys will cover Pelangio's Obuasi Targets Area interpreted to be on strike with the Obuasi Mine's Main Au Trend.

The northernmost known ore shoot at the Obuasi mine, the 'Far North Shoot' (AKA Adansi Shoot), sits approximately 4.2 kilometers south-southwest of Pelangio's property boundary at a depth of 700+ meters.</p></li><li><p>The CSEM survey on the Manfo property will follow the Obuasi surveys and will explore for deep targets below (down-dip and down-plunge of) the Pokukrom East and West deposits.</p></li></ul><p><b>CSEM (Controlled Source Electromagnetic Survey) Details</b></p><p>Pelangio Exploration has commissioned SEMS Exploration Services of Ghana to conduct CSEM surveys on their Obuasi and Manfo projects to explore for mineral targets at depths up to 1 kilometre or more. Controlled source electromagnetics is an active EM method where an electromagnetic signal is 'injected' into the ground with the response measured at multiple stations in a grid array. The SEMS survey will employ an IRIS Instruments TIP 12000 transmitter powered by a 20kVA generator to create the EM signal with the subsurface response read by two Metronics Magneto-Telluric (MT) grade receiver units working on a 170-meter grid node spacing. </p><p>The CSEM method is effective at detecting conductive features and mapping resistive bodies at shallow to intermediate depths (up to several km) and could be effective at resolving Obuasi-style mineralization (conductive sulphide ore and resistive gold-bearing quartz lodes) comfortably to a depth of 1 kilometre or more. The Magneto-Telluric (MT) method in comparison, which is a passive EM method, is a much broader frequency survey enabling deep imaging (to tens of kilometres), although at a considerably lower resolution than CSEM can provide and requiring much longer survey times.</p><p>Pelangio's Obuasi survey will cover the 'Obuasi Targets Area' on the western edge of the property, interpreted to be on strike with the Obuasi Mine's Main Au Trend. See Figure 1. The survey will cover an area of 9.2km² with 295 170-meter spaced stations. AngloGold Ashanti will conduct a parallel CSEM survey extending Pelangio's survey into their mine property with 333 stations over an area of 10.4 km². While SEMS will be conducting the survey over both properties, the surveys are independent of one another and a possible data-sharing agreement has not been discussed.</p><p>The northernmost known (from public information) orebody on the Main Au Trend at the Obuasi Mine is the 'Far North' ore shoot, also referred to as the Adansi ore shoot in some literature. Refer to AngloGold Ashanti's Obuasi Underground Analyst Site Visit presentation posted on their website on March 17, 2025. The Far North ore shoot is situated approximately 4.2 kilometre's south-southwest of Pelangio's property boundary at a depth of 700+ meters. It is believed that if there is a repetition of the Obuasi Mine ore shoots to the north and into Pelangio's property, it may be at depths comparable to the Far North ore shoot as there is little evidence of large-scale near-surface mineralization observed in the soil geochemistry and historical diamond drilling on Pelangio's ground.</p><p>The Obuasi CSEM surveys are tentatively planned to commence in mid-April once the equipment is mobilized from Sweden and will require approximately two months to complete if the weather is mostly favourable. Another month will be required for 3D inversion modelling of the data plus reporting with recommendations.</p><p>Following the Obuasi surveys, a smaller CSEM survey is planned for the Manfo project covering the area of the Pokukrom deposits plus the possible down-plunge extensions to the northeast. An area of 2.8 km² will be surveyed with 100 EM stations. The survey is not targeting as deep as at Obuasi but is intended to explore for mineralization deeper than the current drill program is planning to test.</p><p><b>Manfo Drilling Update</b></p><p>Resource extensional diamond drilling continues on the Manfo project focussed on the Pokukrom deposits. Three holes of the 15-hole, 3,150-meter program are nearly complete. There are no assays to report as yet.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/6179/285550_573371abc444ca6d_001full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

Assays for the remaining five holes are pending (see long section and plan map in Figures 2 and 3).</p><p>\"It is highly encouraging to see such strong early results that show increasing gold and copper grades at depth,\" stated Andrew Chubb, President and CEO of Awalé Resources. \"With any discovery, you have to keep pushing to fully understand the true potential. We believe there is a significant opportunity for continued growth at BBM, particularly as we are seeing evidence of increasing grades with depth in the drilling. To date, drilling has demonstrated the open-pit potential at BBM, which now covers a 1.2 km zone. This new drilling looks to expand the underground potential of this target. With our initial Mineral Resource Estimate targeted for early Q2, we are beginning to define this zone, and coupled with the deeper drilling, we are starting to better define the scale of the system.\"</p><p>\"We are also looking forward to receiving drilling results from Charger and Empire, along with further news from our <percent>100%</percent>-owned Awalé permits, where the team continues to advance exploration across the Seydou, Sama, and Sienso permits. 2026 is shaping up to be a big year for the Company.\"</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/xEjnETK8zZ\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Link to All Figures</a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/7n1KnsMk0x\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Watch Video of CEO Andrew Chubb Discussing New Results from BBM</a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/ejYnjcMvDw\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Link to Core Photos</a></p><p><b>BBM Underground Target Drilling</b></p><p>The 11-hole, 7,000-metre step-down diamond drilling program forms the first phase of drilling designed to evaluate the potential for an underground mineral resource at the BBM target. This initial phase is focused on testing continuity of the higher-grade core of the BBM system down-plunge to a depth of approximately 600 metres below surface. Results from the first six holes reported in this release represent the beginning of defining this underground potential.</p><p>If successful, further step-out drilling will be planned to test and extend the higher-grade zone to a depth of 800m below surface. The gold, copper, and molybdenite mineralization is associated with a marked increase in strain intensity and silica-biotite alteration along the subvertical to south-southwest contact between a sheared granodiorite host and footwall metasediments and metavolcanics.</p><p>Results from this deeper drilling will play a key role in assessing the long-term scale and underground development potential of the BBM system.</p><p><b>Exploration on Awalé's <percent>100%</percent>-Owned Permits</b></p><p>Concurrent exploration programs are underway across Awalé's <percent>100%</percent>-owned permits. Intensive surface geochemistry programs are advancing at Seydou and Sama, while a 3,000-metre air-core program at the Fremen target (Sienso) is nearing completion.

Exploration activities are currently underway in the underexplored regions of Côte d'Ivoire, where the Company is exploring the Odienné Copper-Gold Project (\"<b>Odienné</b>\" or the \"<b>Project</b>\"), covering 2,346 km<sup>2</sup> across seven permits-five granted and two applications. This includes 797 km<sup>2</sup> in two permits held under the Awalé-Newmont Joint Venture (\"OJV\"). Awalé currently manages all exploration activities over the OJV, with funding currently provided by Newmont Ventures Limited (\"Newmont\") under an Exploration Agreement signed in May 2022.</p><p>Awalé has discovered four gold, gold-copper, and gold-copper-silver-molybdenum mineralized systems within the OJV and has recently commenced exploration on its <percent>100%</percent>-owned properties.</p><p>The Odienné Project is underexplored and has multiple pipeline prospects with similar geochemical signatures to Iron Oxide Copper Gold (<b>IOCG</b>) and intrusive-related mineral systems with substantial upside potential. The Company benefits from a skilled and well-seasoned technical team that allows it to continue exploring in a pro-mining jurisdiction that offers significant potential for district-scale discoveries.</p><p><b>Table 1: Significant Intercepts from Diamond Drilling - (from this release)</b></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 100%;

Samples are prepared and stored at the Company's field camps and put into sealed bags until collected by Intertek from the Company's secure Odienné office and transported by Intertek to their preparation laboratory in Yamoussoukro, Côte d'Ivoire, for preparation. Samples are logged in the tracking system, weighed, dried, and pulverized to greater than <percent>85%</percent>, passing a 75-micron screen. Two pulps are prepared from each sample with one stream to Intertek Ghana for fire assay and a second to Australia where the sample is analyzed by 52 element ICP/MS with a 4-Acid digest. Blanks, duplicates, and certified reference material (standards) are being used to monitor laboratory performance during the analysis. Where visible gold is observed in drill core, a quartz wash is applied between every sample to reduce or eliminate any contamination. Once fire assay results are received, samples over 5 g/t gold are routinely screen fire assayed, samples lower than 5 g/t gold continued within a high-grade interval are also screen fire assayed. </p><p><b>Mineralized Interval Calculations</b></p><p>Significant intervals reported in this news release are calculated as downhole length-weighted intercepts. For the BBM target, initial mineralized zones are calculated at a 0.2 g/t Au trigger and include up to 3 metres of internal waste for delineating mineralized zones. Included intervals are calculated at 0.5 g/t Au, 2 g/t Au, 5 g/t Au, and 10 g/t Au trigger values, with up to 3 metres of internal waste. Table 2 contains a list of all BBM holes reported in this release. True widths are estimated to be <percent>70%</percent> of the downhole widths. Holes not reported do not make a 0.5 g/t Au grade trigger. </p><p><b>Au Equivalent Calculations </b></p><p>Au Equivalent is calculated using the following parameters in USD: Au - 1910/Oz (Troy), Cu 3.80/lb, Mo 40,000/Tonne, and Ag 23.40/Oz (Troy). The Formula AuEq = Au (g/t) + ((Cu (ppm) * 0.00014) + (Mo (ppm) * 0.00065) + (Ag (g/t)*0.01225)). An <percent>80%</percent> metallurgical recovery is assumed for all metals, as the specific recovery rates for individual metals are unclear, and assuming different recoveries would be premature at this stage.</p><p><b>Qualified Person</b></p><p>The technical and scientific information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved for release by Andrew Chubb, the Company's Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101.

We have secured the right to earn a <percent>100%</percent> interest in a resource-stage copper-gold-silver project that combines scale, grade, near-surface mineralisation and district-scale exploration upside - all in a jurisdiction that is increasingly recognised as one of the most attractive in the world for responsible mineral exploration and development.</i></p><p><i>With over 200 million tonnes already delineated and a higher-grade core starting at just 40 metres below surface, Beskauga Project offers a compelling foundation for value creation. The deposit remains open at depth and along strike, with post-resource drilling confirming that the system extends well beyond the current resource boundary. Equally exciting, the broader exploration licence hosts multiple untested targets with geophysical signatures analogous to the main deposit - any one of which could represent a significant new discovery.</i></p><p><i>Kazakhstan's combination of favourable geology, established mining infrastructure, competitive operating costs, and a strengthened investor protection framework makes it an ideal environment for an exploration company of our size to create outsized value. We are already on the ground preparing for the 2026 field season and look forward to updating shareholders as we advance our integrated exploration and targeting program</i>\"</p><p><b>Strategic Rationale - A Complementary Portfolio</b></p><p>The addition of Beskauga Project is designed to complement the value of Mogotes' flagship Filo Sur project in the Vicuña district.</p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li><p>Filo Sur remains the Company's primary exploration asset and continues to receive priority funding and technical focus.</p></li><li><p>The Beskauga Project is being acquired under an option structure that preserves the Company's financial flexibility: all payments are discretionary and staged over three years, the initial cash outlay is modest relative to the value of the resource being secured, and a portion may be settled in shares rather than cash, protecting treasury for Filo Sur drilling programmes.</p></li><li><p>Critically, the two projects operate on opposite seasonal calendars - the Kazakh field season runs during the Northern Hemisphere summer while Filo Sur's high-altitude Andean season is concentrated in the Southern Hemisphere summer - allowing Mogotes' technical team and management bandwidth to be deployed year-round without competing for the same resources. </p></li><li><p>The Beskauga Project cost of drilling is expected to run approximately US<money>$100</money> per metre drilled, allowing a small investment in exploration budget to go a long way.</p></li><li><p>For shareholders, this means continuous exploration newsflow, reduced single-asset concentration risk, and a second pathway to value creation through a resource-stage deposit with near-term development optionality, all achieved with relatively low cost of operation and option payments in the first years.</p></li></ul><p><b>Summary of Option Agreement Terms</b></p><p>Pursuant to the Option Agreement, Mogotes, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Mogotes Metals Kazakhstan Inc. (the \"Optionee\"), has been granted the sole and exclusive option to acquire <percent>100%</percent> of the participating interests in Dostyk LLP (the \"Target Company\"), a Kazakh limited liability partnership that holds the Beskauga Project exploration licence, from Copperbelt AG (the \"Optionor\").

The Pavlodar provincial economy is largely driven by mining and heavy industry, including large-scale open-pit and underground mining. The Beskauga Project is located 70 km south-west of the provincial capital and is well serviced by established infrastructure, with the project located within 20 km of rail and sealed national highway. A 1,150 kVA powerline also traverses the project<sup>7</sup> (Figure 4).</p><p>Kazakhstan sits within the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), one of the world's most richly mineralised metallogenic domains. The CAOB hosts numerous porphyry copper-gold deposits<sup>8</sup>. The Beskauga Project is situated in the same geological terrane as the Bozshakol and Aktogai porphyry copper-gold operations, among others, underscoring the district's prospectivity.</p><p>The Beskauga Project area is covered by up to 40 m of post-mineral clay overburden. As a result, pre-discovery exploration was driven by project-scale IP geophysics and magnetics, wide-spaced grid-based KGK drilling (similar to \"wet\" reverse circulation drilling) through cover to collect basement geochemistry and geology samples. Exploration drilling of anomalies generated by this process led to the discovery of the Beskauga Project deposit in 2007. For a detailed exploration and company ownership history of the project please see the NI 43-101 report<sup>6</sup>.</p><p>Mogotes is undertaking an integrated reprocessing and targeting programme of the Beskauga Project ahead of the Kazakh field season and will provide a technical update on the Project in the coming weeks. The Company has commenced engaging a local team and service providers to advance the 2026 programme at the Beskauga Project.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/10597/285555_85e7a9ac74c5cae0_007full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

The Company is under no obligation, nor does it intend to update or revise the forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.</p><p><b>Qualified Person</b></p><p>The scientific and technical disclosure for the Beskauga Project included in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Stephen Nano, who is a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"). Mr. Nano is a Director and Technical Advisor of the Company and is therefore not considered independent of the Company for the purposes of NI 43-101. </p><p><b>Cautionary Note Regarding Historical Estimates</b></p><p>The mineral resource estimate referenced in this news release was originally prepared by David Underwood BSc (Hons) Registered Professional Natural Scientist, an independent Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101, and disclosed in a technical report titled \"<i>Beskauga Copper-Gold Project, Pavlodar Province, Republic of Kazakhstan, Amended &amp; Restated NI43 101 Technical Report</i>\" with an effective date of 20 February 2022, which is available under Arras Minerals Corp. SEDAR+ profile at <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/N3KEjUPx50\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.sedarplus.ca</a>.</p><p>Mineral resources referenced in this news release are classified in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\"CIM\") Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (May 10, 2014). Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. </p><p>The mineral resource estimate for the Beskauga deposit referenced in this news release is treated as a historical estimate for the purposes of NI 43-101. The estimate was prepared by David Underwood, B.Sc. (Hons) (Osino Resources) and Matthew Dumala, B.Sc. (Archer, Cathro &amp; Associates) with an effective date of February 20, 2022, and key assumptions including top cut values for copper, gold and silver of <percent>3.00%</percent>, 10.0 g/t and 25.0 g/t respectively, a gross metal value cut-off of <money>$20</money>/t, base metal prices of <money>$3.50</money>/lb copper, <money>$22.00</money>/oz silver and <money>$1,750</money>/oz gold, and recovery factors of <percent>85.0%</percent> for copper, <percent>74.5%</percent> for gold, and <percent>50.0%</percent> for silver. The estimate was disclosed in <i>Underwood, D., and Dumala, M., 2022, Beskauga Copper-Gold Project, Pavlodar Province, Republic of Kazakhstan (NI 43-101 Technical Report, effective 20 Feb 2022). Arras Minerals Corp.</i></p><p>The Company considers the historical estimate to be relevant to investors as it provides an indication of the mineralization potential of the Beskauga property. However, the Company's Qualified Person, Mr. Nano, has not completed sufficient work to verify or classify the historical estimate as a current mineral resource or mineral reserve in accordance with NI 43-101 and CIM Definition Standards. The Company is not treating the historical estimate as a current mineral resource or mineral reserve, and the historical estimate should not be relied upon. </p><p>In order to verify or upgrade the historical estimate to current mineral resources or mineral reserves, the Company anticipates that work would include, among other things: compilation and independent verification of the historical drill hole database, including re-logging and re-assaying of selected drill core where available; integration of the 18,657 metres of post-resource drilling completed to date; an updated geological and structural interpretation; revised resource estimation incorporating current commodity prices and economic parameters; and, if warranted, additional infill and step-out drilling to support reclassification. The Company intends to evaluate and advance this work as part of its 2026 exploration and technical programme at the Beskauga Project.</p><p>Inferred mineral resources, where referenced, have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. </p><p><b>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements </b></p><p>This news release contains \"forward-looking information\" and \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation (collectively, \"forward-looking information\"). Generally, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"plans\", \"expects\", \"does not expect\", \"is expected\", \"budget\", \"scheduled\", \"estimates\", \"forecasts\", \"intends\", \"projects\", \"budgets\", \"targets\", \"assumes\", \"strategy\", \"goals\", \"objectives\", \"potential\", \"possible\", \"anticipates\", \"does not anticipate\", \"believes\", or variations of such words and phrases, or statements that certain actions, events, conditions or results \"will\", \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"should\", \"might\" or \"will be taken\", \"will occur\" or \"will be achieved\", or the negative connotations thereof. All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements.</p><p>In particular, this news release contains forward-looking information pertaining to, without limitation: the proposed acquisition of the Beskauga Project, including the anticipated terms, conditions precedent, expected closing date, and anticipated benefits of the acquisition; assumptions made in the interpretation of drill results, geology, grade, geochemistry, potential implications of geophysics interpretations, and continuity of mineral deposits; the Company's planned exploration programs and expenditures at the Beskauga Project; expectations regarding access to and demand for equipment, skilled labour and services needed for exploration and development of mineral properties; potential exploration upside at the Beskauga Project, including the extent and significance of mineralization and the prospectivity of exploration targets; the ability of the Company to conduct its field programs as planned; the success of future exploration activities; potential for resource expansion; the ability to build shareholder value; expectations with regard to establishing mineral resources or mineral reserves through exploration; the ability to execute planned work programs; plans or ability to mobilize or add additional drill rigs; timing or anticipated results of laboratory assay results; and the Company's ability to obtain required financing.</p><p>The forward-looking information contained in this news release is based on certain assumptions, including, without limitation: that the acquisition of the Beskauga Project will be completed on the terms and timeline anticipated; that required regulatory approvals, including any approvals required under the laws of Kazakhstan and Canada, will be obtained in a timely manner; that financing will be available if and when needed on reasonable terms; that the Company will be able to obtain all necessary permits, licences, and authorizations to conduct exploration in Kazakhstan; that the Company will not experience any material adverse change in its business or financial condition; that commodity prices and foreign exchange rates will not decline materially; that the Company will not experience any material labour dispute, accident, or failure of plant or equipment; that there will be no material adverse changes to the political, legal, or regulatory environment in Kazakhstan; that the Company will be able to operate without being materially affected by international sanctions regimes; and that contracted counterparties will perform their obligations as agreed.</p><p>Forward-looking information involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking information. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: general business, economic and mining industry conditions; fluctuations in commodity prices; changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly as between the Canadian dollar, United States dollar, and Kazakhstani tenge; the speculative nature of mineral exploration; geological conditions and variability; uncertainty of mineral resource estimates; that the Company may not discover commercially viable quantities of minerals; environmental risks and compliance costs; the supply and demand for commodities; title disputes or claims; limitations on insurance coverage; and uninsured risks. The Company's operations in Kazakhstan are subject to the risks of operating in a foreign jurisdiction, including: changes to Kazakhstan's mining legislation, subsoil use rights framework, and tax regime, including potential increases in tax rates applicable to subsoil users; political instability or changes in government policy affecting the mining sector; inconsistent enforcement of laws, regulations, and contractual obligations; the potential for government-mandated participation in mining projects; currency fluctuations and volatility of the Kazakhstani tenge, which may be correlated with fluctuations in the Russian ruble and global commodity prices; risk of exposure to international sanctions regimes affecting the importation of equipment, technology, and services, and the Company's ability to transact with international counterparties; changes to environmental legislation, including restrictions on water usage under Kazakhstan's water code; repatriation and currency conversion risks; inadequacy of infrastructure in remote areas of Kazakhstan; potential for expropriation or nationalization; difficulties in enforcing judgments obtained in foreign jurisdictions; the need to comply with Kazakhstan's obligations under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI); and the potential for social or community opposition to mining activities; that the acquisition of the Beskauga Project may not be completed on the anticipated terms or timeline, or at all; that required regulatory, governmental, or other approvals may not be obtained or may impose conditions that are not anticipated; that due diligence may not identify all risks and liabilities associated with the acquired assets; that financing required to complete the acquisition and fund planned exploration may not be available on acceptable terms; that the Company may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition; and that integration of the acquired project may be more costly or complex than anticipated. Risks also include the stability and predictability of the political and legal environments in jurisdictions where the Company operates; that financing will be available if and when needed on reasonable terms; the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern; dilution to existing shareholders from future equity financings; and general economic, market, or business conditions.</p><p>These factors are not, and should not be construed as being, exhaustive. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that would cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking information, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated, or intended. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Additional risk factors are identified in the Company's periodic filings with Canadian securities regulators, available under the Company's SEDAR+ profile at <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/XEzJosMaVX\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.sedarplus.ca</a>.</p><p>Statements relating to \"mineral resources\" are deemed to be forward-looking information, as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the mineral resources described can be profitably produced in the future.</p><p>The forward-looking information contained in this news release is made as of the date hereof. Except as required under applicable securities legislation, the Company does not intend, and does not assume any obligation, to update or revise this forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking information due to the inherent uncertainty thereof.</p><p>This news release has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Canadian securities laws, which differ in material respects from the requirements of United States securities laws applicable to U.S. companies. Information concerning the Company's mineral properties has been prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 and the CIM Definition Standards. These standards differ from the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") set forth in Subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. Accordingly, mineral resource and mineral reserve information contained herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by companies subject to SEC reporting requirements. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated mineral resources will ever be converted into mineral reserves. Investors are further cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable.</p><p>The information contained in this news release was accurate at the time of dissemination but may be superseded by subsequent news release(s).

This represents our seventh consecutive annual dividend increase, affirming our confidence in the Company’s future and commitment to returning value to shareholders,” concluded Mr. Kousinioris.</p> <p align=\"justify\">\"Over the past few months, we focused on executing our strategic priorities. During the fourth quarter, we secured a definitive tolling agreement to convert Centralia Unit 2 to natural-gas-fired generation under a long-term contract and today, we announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding for our Alberta data centre strategy with Canada Pension Plan Investments and Brookfield,\" said Joel Hunter, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. \"We also recently closed the acquisition of Far North which enhances our position in Ontario,\" added Mr. Hunter.</p> <p align=\"justify\">\"We are entering 2026 with a growing and diversified fleet that is underpinned by long-term contracts and strong hedging positions. Our guidance incorporates a balanced view of our fleet's expected generation as well as Alberta power market fundamentals, which we expect to markedly improve as expected data centre load growth comes online in the coming years. We look forward to sharing more with you on our long-term outlook and strategy at our upcoming Investor Day scheduled for March 23, 2026,\" concluded Mr. Hunter.</p> <p><strong>Fourth Quarter 2025 Highlights</strong></p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt;

The MOU establishes a framework for phased development at the Company's Keephills site in Parkland County, including an initial long-term power purchase agreement for approximately 230 MW and the evaluation of additional phases aggregating up to 1 Gigawatt of load. Development is subject to regulatory approvals and the parties reaching definitive agreements.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Declared Increase in Common Share Dividend<br/></strong>The Company’s Board has approved a <money>$0.02</money> annualized (eight per cent) increase to the common share dividend and declared a dividend of <money>$0.07</money> per common share on Feb. 25, 2026 to be payable on July 1, 2026 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 1, 2026. The quarterly dividend of <money>$0.07</money> per common share represents an annualized dividend of <money>$0.28</money> per common share.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Acquisition of Far North</strong><br/>On Feb. 2, 2026, the Company closed the acquisition of Far North Power Corporation (Far North) for a purchase price of <money>$95 million</money> from an affiliate of Hut 8 Corporation, subject to working capital and other adjustments. The net cash payment for the transaction was funded through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under TransAlta's credit facilities.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The transaction adds 310 MW of capacity from four natural gas-fired facilities in our core market of Ontario, increasing the Company's total installed capacity in the province to 1,384 MW.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>US<money>$400 million</money> Senior Notes Offering and Early Redemption of the <percent>7.8%</percent> Senior Notes<br/></strong>On Dec. 22, 2025, the Company issued US<money>$400 million</money> senior notes with a fixed annual coupon rate of 5.9 per cent, maturing on Feb. 1, 2034. The notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all future subordinated indebtedness. The notes were issued at 99.39 per cent of par value, resulting in net proceeds of <money>$541 million</money> (US<money>$393 million</money>), and are callable in three years. Interest payments on the notes are made semi-annually, on Feb. 1 and Aug. 1, with the first payment scheduled for Aug. 1, 2026.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The proceeds from the offering were used to redeem all of the Company's outstanding 7.8 per cent US<money>$400 million</money> senior notes for the total redemption price of <money>$573 million</money> (US<money>$416 million</money>) in advance of the scheduled maturity date of Nov. 15, 2029.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Mothballing of Sheerness Unit 1<br/></strong>On Dec. 18, 2025, the Company provided notice to the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO) that Sheerness Unit 1 will be mothballed effective April 1, 2026, for a period of up to two years. The Company maintains the flexibility to return the mothballed unit to service when market fundamentals improve or contracting opportunities are secured. The unit will remain available and fully operational through the first quarter of 2026 and Sheerness Unit 2 will remain fully in service.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Centralia Unit 2 Mandated to Remain Available<br/></strong>On Dec. 16, 2025, the Company received an order from the United States Department of Energy (the Order) requiring that our 700 MW Centralia Unit 2 facility remain available if called upon to operate for a period of 90 days, until March 16, 2026. The Company is currently compliant with the Order and continues to work with the state and federal governments in relation thereto.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Centralia Tolling Agreement Signed<br/></strong>On Dec. 9, 2025, the Company announced it had entered into a long-term tolling agreement (Tolling Agreement) with Puget Sound Energy to convert our 700 MW Centralia Unit 2 facility from coal to natural gas. The conversion extends the operating life of facility and will leverage existing turbines, transmission and infrastructure, while also lowering emissions.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The Tolling Agreement provides a fixed-price capacity payment through 2044 for the facility. The coal-to-gas conversion project is expected to require approximately US<money>$600 million</money> in capital and, once in service, will generate contracted cash flow over the life of the Tolling Agreement. The Company expects to declare a final investment decision for the project in early 2027, after receiving required regulatory approvals. Permitting work will continue through 2026, followed by construction in 2027–2028, with converted natural gas-fired operations expected to begin in late 2028.</p> <p><strong>Chief Executive Officer Succession</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">On Nov. 6, 2025, the Company announced that John Kousinioris, President and Chief Executive Officer and a Director of TransAlta, plans to retire effective April 30, 2026. Concurrent with this announcement, the Board of Directors appointed Joel Hunter, TransAlta’s Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, to succeed Mr. Kousinioris as President and Chief Executive Officer and be nominated to join the Board effective April 30, 2026. Mr. Kousinioris has agreed to serve as a strategic advisor to Mr. Hunter and the Board for a period of six months following his retirement. The Company’s Chief Financial Officer successor will be announced in the coming months.</p> <p><strong>Demand Transmission Service Contract </strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">On Oct. 3, 2025, the Company entered into a 230 MW Demand Transmission Service Contract with the AESO, representing the full allocation awarded to the Company through Phase I of the AESO's Data Centre Large Load Integration Program.</p> <p><strong>2026 Outlook</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">For 2026, the Company expects Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of <money>$950 million</money> to <money>$1,050 million</money> and FCF to be in the range of <money>$350 million</money> to <money>$450 million</money>, based on the following expectations:</p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\">Lower contribution from the Energy Transition segment due to the Centralia facility ceasing dispatchable coal-fired generation at the end of 2025;</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\">Lower contribution from the Alberta merchant gas portfolio as a result of lower average hedge prices and higher fuel costs, partially offset by lower carbon compliance costs due to a higher utilization of internally generated low-cost environmental credits;</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\">Lower contributions from Sarnia, reflecting a step down in contracted pricing and the expiry of the contract and decommissioning of the Ada Cogeneration facility;</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\">Higher contributions within the Hydro, Gas and Wind and Solar segments due to the expected realization of carbon credits against in-year, in addition to 2025, carbon compliance costs in Alberta;</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\">Higher contributions from the Gas segment due to the acquisition of the Far North Ontario gas facilities;</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\">Higher contributions from the Wind and Solar segment as a result of higher expected production;</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt;

Forward-looking statements are not facts, but only predictions and generally can be identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as \"may\", \"will\", \"believe\", \"expect\", \"estimate\", \"anticipate\", \"intend\", \"plan\", \"forecast\", \"continue\" or other similar words. In particular, this news release contains forward-looking statements about the following, among other things: our 2026 Outlook; the potential arising out of the MOU for data centre development for additional phases of development to aggregate to 1GW of load at the Company’s Keephills site; the costs and permitting, regulatory approvals, construction and operational timelines for the Centralia Unit 2 coal to natural gas conversion project; and the timing of the announcement of the Company’s Chief Financial Officer successor.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Forward-looking statements and future-oriented financial information in this news release are intended to provide the reader information about management's current expectations and plans and readers are cautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward-looking statements are subject to important risks and uncertainties and are based on certain key assumptions. All forward-looking statements reflect TransAlta's beliefs and assumptions based on information available at the time the statements were made and as such are not guarantees of future performance. As actual results could vary significantly from the forward-looking statements, you should not put undue reliance on forward-looking statements and should not use future-oriented information or financial outlooks for anything other than their intended purpose. We do not update our forward-looking statements due to new information or future events, unless we are required to by law. For additional information on the assumptions made, and the risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ from the anticipated results, refer to our most recent MD&amp;A, which forms part of this news release, and the 2025 Integrated Report, including the section titled \"<em>Governance and Risk Management</em>\" in our MD&amp;A for the year ended December 31, 2025, filed under TransAlta's profile on SEDAR+ at <u>www.sedarplus.ca</u> and with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission at <u>www.sec.gov</u>.</p> <p><strong>Non-IFRS and Supplementary Financial Measures</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">This news release contains references to the following Non-IFRS measures: Adjusted EBITDA; Free Cash Flow (FCF) (including per share); Adjusted earnings (loss) before income taxes; Adjusted net earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders (including per share); Funds from operations (FFO) (including per share); Energy Marketing adjusted revenues and net interest expense. Non-IFRS measures do not have standardized meanings under IFRS and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies and should not be viewed in isolation from, as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, our IFRS results. We use these measures to evaluate our performance and the performance of our business segments and believe that these measures, read together with our IFRS measures, provide readers with a better understanding of how management assesses results. Presenting these measures from period to period provides management and investors with the ability to evaluate earnings (loss) trends more readily in comparison to prior periods' results. These measures are calculated by adjusting certain IFRS measures for certain items we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operations in a period and are calculated on a consistent basis from period to period and are adjusted for specific items in each period, unless stated otherwise. Refer to the Non-IFRS and Supplementary Measures section of our most recent MD&amp;A, which forms part of this news release, for more information about these measures including, where applicable, reconciliations to measures calculated in accordance with IFRS.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Note: All financial figures are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated.<br/></p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>For more information:</strong></p> <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width:100%; border-collapse:collapse ;\"><tr><td style=\"max-width:55%; width:55%; min-width:55%;;text-align: left ;  vertical-align: middle; vertical-align: middle ; \"><strong><em>Investor Inquiries:</em></strong></td><td style=\"max-width:45%; width:45%; min-width:45%;;vertical-align: middle;   text-align: left;   padding-left: 15.0px; vertical-align: middle ; \"><strong><em>Media Inquiries:</em></strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: left ;  vertical-align: middle; vertical-align: middle ; \">Phone: 1-800-387-3598 in Canada and U.S.</td><td style=\"vertical-align: middle;   text-align: left;   padding-left: 15.0px; vertical-align: middle ; \">Phone: 1-855-255-9184</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: left ;  vertical-align: middle; vertical-align: middle ; \">Email: investor_relations@transalta.com</td><td style=\"vertical-align: middle;   text-align: left;   padding-left: 15.0px; vertical-align: middle ; \">Email: ta_media_relations@transalta.com</td></tr></table><img alt=\"\" class=\"__GNW8366DE3E__IMG\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTY2MjgyMSM3NDU4NzAyIzIyODU2NTE=\"/> <br/><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\" src=\"https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/YzZiY2NlZmYtODdmMy00Mjg1LWI5NjctOTFjN2Y5NTQ4OTE0LTEyOTcyMDEtMjAyNi0wMi0yNy1lbg==/tiny/TransAlta-Corporation.png\"/></article>",

The webcast will be archived on the website following the completion of the call.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">To supplement the financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, this earnings release presents Adjusted EBITDA, which the Company defines as net loss before depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, interest expense, taxes, share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related costs, restructuring costs, customer credit loss, litigation costs, and debt extinguishment loss. Non-GAAP financial measures such as Adjusted EBITDA are presented in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company’s operating performance and trends, as well as for making planning decisions. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps to identify underlying trends in the Company’s business that may otherwise be masked by the effect of the income and expenses and other items that it excludes in its calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. Accordingly, the Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company’s operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by the Company’s management in their financial and operational decision-making. The Company also presents this non-GAAP financial measure because it believes investors, analysts and rating agencies consider it to be a useful metric in measuring the Company’s performance against other companies and its ability to meet its debt service obligations.</p> <p align=\"justify\">There are limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures such as Adjusted EBITDA because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may exclude significant income and expenses required by GAAP to be recognized in the Company’s financial statements, and may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Company encourages investors to carefully consider its results under GAAP, as well as its supplemental non-GAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand its business. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results is presented below.</p> <p align=\"justify\">*A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net loss on a forward-looking basis is not available without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the items excluded from this non-GAAP measure.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">This press release and statements made during the Company’s earnings call contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the Company’s: 2026 full-year guidance; anticipated liquidity; 2026 Adjusted EBITDA guidance; expected 2026 cash usage decrease; anticipated restoration of revenue growth in the back half of the year; expected increase in product adoptions; continued execution of strategic initiatives; anticipated market position, growth rates and profitability improvement; ability to effectively respond to and mitigate the impact of challenges in the current market environment, including in response to increased competition, evolving surgeon and patient preferences for minimally invasive bunion solutions, changes in tariff and trade policies, protracted government shutdowns, lower patient demand for elective bunion surgery due to macroeconomic uncertainty or soft consumer sentiment; anticipated future product launches and the timing of such product launches; ability to increase procedure volumes, expand surgeon relationships and utilization rate, and increase procedure penetration and market share; sufficiency of its balance sheet to continue executing strategic and growth initiatives for the foreseeable future; anticipated expansion of clinical evidence; ability to protect and enforce its intellectual property rights, including through its patent infringement and unfair competition suits; success in defending against securities class actions and infringement of its intellectual property by third parties, including its competitors; expected seasonality; ability to leverage investments in its commercial organization and control costs in its organizational structure, the amount and timing of orders for our products from stocking distributors and other customers; and anticipated pace of growth in the foot and ankle market. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current assumptions and expectations of future events and trends, which affect or may affect the Company’s business, strategy, operations or financial performance, and actual results and other events may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements due to numerous risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified. Factors that could cause actual results or other events to differ materially from those contemplated in this press release can be found in the Risk Factors section of Treace’s public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025, which was filed with the SEC on February 27, 2026. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. These forward-looking statements speak only as of their date and, except to the extent required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements, whether as a result of any new information, future developments or otherwise. The Company’s results for the year ended December 31, 2025, are not necessarily indicative of its operating results for any future periods.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Internet Posting of Information</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">Treace routinely posts information that may be important to investors in the “Investor Relations” section of its website at <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=c0OAFtKosUKW6OsSxVTwEwY7obOiS7SKNPmzJ-_UVPErzN3Blf4FVudhuaaVx5-UDOeoe_5vxgMezvaMRWeFfErL_9RKAO0FJpfOXJxHQJI=\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>www.treace.com</u></a>.

IBC's consolidated loss of <money>$1.2 million</money> for the six-month period ended December 31, 2025, was lower compared to the same prior-year period, largely due to higher sales revenue in the current period and reduced costs related to the closure of the EM Division's Massachusetts plant.</i></p></li></ul><p><strong id=\"dateline\">FRANKLIN, IN / <a href=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ACCESS Newswire</a> / February 27, 2026 / </strong>IBC Advanced Alloys Corp. (\"<strong>IBC</strong>\" or the \"<strong>Company</strong>\")<strong> (TSXV:IB)(OTCQB:IAALF)</strong> announces its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.</p><p>Stronger demand for IBC copper alloy products boosted revenue in the quarter YOY by <percent>36.6%</percent> in IBC's Copper Alloys Division. Prior quarters saw softer demand largely due to market uncertainty in the application of the U.S. Government's planned copper tariffs. Now that these tariffs have been implemented, product demand appears to be strengthening. The Division also posted gains in the quarter in operating income, Adjusted EBITDA, gross profit, and gross margin over the comparable prior-year period.</p><p>Consolidated loss in the quarter of <money>$480,000</money> narrowed YOY from a loss of <money>$1.4 million</money> in the comparative period, largely driven by higher copper alloys sales revenue and reduced costs at the company's Engineered Materials division, which was closed in 2024.</p><p>\"We saw strong signs of demand recovery in our second fiscal quarter almost across the board in copper alloy products, and those gains appear to be continuing into the current quarter,\" said Mark A. Smith, CEO and Executive Chairman of IBC. \"Additionally, we continue to explore opportunities for sales of aluminum-scandium alloys, which we successfully began producing in October 2025. We see that market growing significantly as the prospect of the first-ever domestic scandium production in the U.S. appears increasingly likely to launch in the near future.\"</p><p><strong>Selected

(NASDAQ:<a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/MRNA/\" title=\"View MRNA stock overview\">MRNA</a>) today announced that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a <a href=\"https://pr.report/j46d\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">positive opinion</a> recommending marketing authorization in the European Union for mCOMBRIAX<sup>®</sup> (mRNA-1083), Moderna's combination vaccine indicated for active immunization for the prevention of influenza and COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 50 years of age and older.</p><p>\"The CHMP's positive opinion represents an important milestone for respiratory virus vaccination and for Moderna, with the introduction of the world's first flu plus COVID combination vaccine. If approved, this would be Moderna's fourth marketed product in Europe,\" said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. \"Combination vaccines have the potential to simplify vaccination and support improved health outcomes. We appreciate the EMA's rigorous scientific review.\"</p><p>mCOMBRIAX builds on the advances of mNEXSPIKE<sup>®</sup>, Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine, and mRNA-1010, Moderna's investigational seasonal influenza vaccine, which has been accepted for review in the United States, the European Union, Canada and Australia.</p><p>The CHMP opinion is supported by results from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3s6\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">NCT06097273</a>), a randomized, observer-blind, active-controlled study evaluating the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mRNA-1083 in two independent age cohorts of approximately 4,000 adults each. One cohort included adults 65 years of age and older and compared mRNA-1083 to co-administered Fluzone HD<sup>®</sup> (licensed in the European Union as Efluelda<sup>®</sup>), a high-dose influenza vaccine, and Spikevax<sup>®</sup>, Moderna's licensed COVID-19 vaccine. The second cohort included adults 50 to 64 years of age and compared mRNA-1083 to co-administered Fluarix<sup>®</sup>, a standard-dose influenza vaccine, and Spikevax.</p><p>All primary endpoints demonstrating the non-inferiority of immune responses were met. Following a single dose, mRNA-1083 elicited statistically significantly higher immune responses against three influenza virus strains (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B/Victoria) and against SARS-CoV-2 in both age cohorts. The B/Yamagata strain, which is no longer recommended for inclusion in seasonal influenza vaccines, was the only strain for which a statistically significantly higher immune response was not observed for adults 65 years of age and older compared to the co-administered licensed comparator vaccines.<sup>[1]</sup></p><p>mRNA-1083 demonstrated an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. The majority of solicited adverse reactions were grade 1 or 2 in severity and consistent with the licensed vaccines used in the trial.</p><p>Following the CHMP's positive opinion, the European Commission will consider the recommendation and is expected to adopt a final decision on marketing authorization. Once the European Commission approves a product, the marketing authorization is valid in all EU Member States as well as in the European Economic Area (EEA) countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Upon European Commission approval, Moderna will work with national regulatory and health authorities to support local access and implementation.</p><p><strong>About Moderna</strong></p><p>Moderna is a pioneer and leader in the field of mRNA medicine.

Namibia is a well-established mining jurisdiction and one of the world's top uranium-producing countries according to the <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/1KQ8wuRbLX\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">World Nuclear Association</a>, with the Erongo region hosting several operating mines. The Namibia Assets provide exposure to both uranium and copper potential in a jurisdiction with a long history of mineral development.</p><p>The Agreement has been terminated by mutual consent. As part of the termination and unwind, Critical One has agreed to return 14,200,000 common shares of Dark Star previously issued to the Company. No termination fees or other material penalties are payable by either party. In addition, Duane Parnham, Founder, Executive Chairman and CEO of Critical One, has terminated his advisory role with Dark Star effective immediately.</p><p>\"The mutual termination of this agreement was the right outcome for Critical One and our shareholders. With copper and uranium markets continuing to attract renewed pricing strength and investor attention, regaining full control of the Namibia Assets restores meaningful flexibility at the right time,\" said Parnham. \"Our focus remains firmly on the <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/A8qaKFpvWp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Howells Lake Antimony-Gold Project</a> (\"Howells Lake Project\") as we prepare to commence our maiden drill program following the recent approval of an <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/ZEjQ1HMzwp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">exploration permit</a>, and we see real opportunity to responsibly maximize the value of our broader portfolio of critical metals for shareholders.\"</p><p>Critical One's priority remains advancing the Howells Lake Project in the Thunder Bay Mining District of Ontario, Canada. Located approximately 120 kilometres (km) west of the Ring of Fire, Ontario's multi-billion-dollar infrastructure development, the Howells Lake Project is strategically positioned to contribute to Canada's critical minerals strategy, reducing reliance on foreign supplies amid growing global demand and constrained supply. </p><p>The Company intends to pursue the optionality created by the return of the Namibia Assets in a manner that complements its planned program at the Howells Lake Project. </p><p>Critical One will provide further updates as its plan for the Namibia Assets is formalized.</p><p><b>About Critical One Energy Inc.</b></p><p><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/anBO1sMP8X\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Critical One Energy Inc.</a> is a forward-focused critical minerals and upstream energy company, powering the future of clean energy and advanced technologies. The Howells Lake Antimony-Gold Project focuses the Company's exposure on antimony, one of the most in-demand critical minerals, as well as gold, which is known to occur at numerous locations on the Howells Lake Project. Backed by seasoned management expertise and prime resource assets, Critical One is strategically positioned to meet the rising global demand for critical minerals and metals. Its mine exploration portfolio is led by antimony-gold exploration potential in Canada and uranium and copper assets in Namibia, Africa.

The increase in EBITDA compared to the fourth quarter of 2024 primarily reflects improved gross margins and the impact of the Gold Tip acquisition, partly offset by <money><money>$0.5 million</money></money> in non-recurring executive transition expenses.</p><p>During the fourth quarter of 2025, the Company generated <money><money>$14.9 million</money></money> of cash flow from operations, compared to <money><money>$12.3 million</money></money> in the prior-year period.

At the end of the fourth quarter 2025, net debt (total debt less cash) was 0.3x trailing twelve-month EBITDA, down from 0.8x at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024.</p><p>Escalade announced a quarterly dividend of <money><money>$0.15</money>25</money> per share to be paid to all shareholders of record on April 6, 2026 and payable April 13, 2026.</p><p><b>MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY</b></p><p>\"We concluded 2025 with strong margin performance, driven by disciplined operational execution across the business,\" said Patrick Griffin, Interim President and CEO of Escalade. \"Fourth‑quarter margins reflect the cost structure improvements implemented over the last year. Importantly, demand across our higher‑value, premium brands remains resilient, and our diversified product portfolio continues to position us well to navigate an uncertain consumer environment.\"</p><p>Griffin continued, \"As we enter 2026, we are shifting our focus to drive growth while maintaining the operational discipline that delivered our strong performance in 2025. During the fourth quarter we completed the acquisition of AllCornhole, further expanding our presence in a premium, fast‑growing category, and we acquired a 110,000 square foot facility to support growth in our safety and fitness categories. In addition, we completed the integration of the Gold Tip Archery acquisition, which closed in the third quarter and was immediately accretive during the fourth quarter.\"</p><p>\"Our shift to focus on growth is supported by a strong balance sheet and a continued focus on capital efficiency,\" Griffin added. \"In the fourth quarter, we improved our cash flow <percent>21.2%</percent> and reduced our total debt by <percent>27.9%</percent>, resulting in net leverage of 0.3x. Reflecting the confidence we have in the long‑term cash‑generation profile of the business, our Board has approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to <money><money>$0.15</money>25</money> per share. Looking ahead, we remain focused on driving working capital efficiencies and we intend to deploy our strong free cash flow toward organic growth investments, strategic M&amp;A, continued debt reduction, and a disciplined return of capital to shareholders.\"</p><p><b>CONFERENCE CALL</b></p><p>A conference call will be held Friday, February 27, 2026, at 11:00 a.m. ET to review the Company's financial results, discuss recent events and conduct a question-and-answer session.</p><p>A webcast of the conference call and accompanying presentation materials will be available in the Investor Relations section of Escalade's website at <a href=\"http://www.escaladeinc.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.escaladeinc.com</a>.  To listen to a live broadcast, go to the site at least 15 minutes prior to the scheduled start time in order to register, download, and install any necessary audio software.</p><p>To participate in the live teleconference:</p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tr><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Domestic Live:</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">1-833-890-3250</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>International Live:</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">1-412-206-6441</span></p></td></tr></table></div><p>To listen to a replay of the teleconference, which subsequently will be available through March 13, 2026:</p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tr><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Domestic Replay:</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">1-844-512-2921</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>International Replay:</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">1-412-317-6671</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Conference ID:</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">10206528</span></p></td></tr></table></div><p><b>USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES</b></p><p>In addition to disclosing financial statements in accordance with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), this release contains the non-GAAP financial measure known as \"EBITDA.\" A reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure is contained at the end of this press release.

In accordance with TSX rules, any daily repurchases would be limited to a maximum of 103,153 subordinate voting shares, which represents <percent>25%</percent> of the average daily trading volume on the TSX of 412,615 subordinate voting shares for the period from August 18, 2025 to February 18, 2026. The TSX rules also allow the Company to purchase, once a week, a block of subordinate voting shares not owned by any insiders, which may exceed such daily limit. The specific method, timing, price and size of purchases will depend on prevailing stock prices, general economic and market conditions, and other considerations.</p><p>Pursuant to exemptive relief previously granted by the OSC to the Company on February 26, 2025, GFL is allowed to purchase up to <percent>10%</percent> of its Public Float through the facilities of the NYSE and other <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location>-based trading systems as part of any NCIB implemented in the 36 months following the date of the decision, and is therefore not limited on such trading platforms to purchasing <percent>5%</percent> of its outstanding subordinate voting shares at the beginning of any 12-month period as Canadian securities laws would otherwise provide.

In some cases, but not necessarily in all cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as \"plans\", \"targets\", \"expects\" or \"does not expect\", \"is expected\", \"an opportunity exists\", \"is positioned\", \"estimates\", \"intends\", \"assumes\", \"anticipates\" or \"does not anticipate\" or \"believes\", or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"might\", \"will\" or \"will be taken\", \"occur\" or \"be achieved\". In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances contain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, nor guarantees or assurances of future performance but instead represent management's current beliefs, expectations, estimates and projections regarding future events and operating performance. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based on a number of opinions, assumptions and estimates that, while considered reasonable by GFL as of the date of this release, are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks, changes in circumstances, and other important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ, possibly materially, from those indicated by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the factors described in the \"Risk Factors\" section of GFL's annual information form for the 2025 fiscal year filed on Form 40-F and GFL's other periodic filings with the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Securities and Exchange Commission and the securities commissions or similar regulatory authorities in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location>. These factors are not intended to represent a complete list of the factors that could affect GFL. However, such risk factors should be considered carefully. There can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will prove to be correct. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this release. GFL undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, except as required by applicable securities laws. Purchases made under the NCIB or Order will be subject to various factors, including GFL's capital and liquidity positions, debt covenant restrictions, accounting and regulatory considerations, GFL's financial and operational performance, alternative uses of capital, the trading price of GFL's subordinate voting shares and general market conditions. The NCIB and Order do not obligate GFL to acquire a specific dollar amount or number of shares and may be extended, modified, or discontinued at any time at the Company's discretion.</p><p>For more information:</p><p>Patrick Dovigi<br/>+1 905 326-0101<br/><a href=\"mailto:pdovigi@gflenv.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pdovigi@gflenv.com</a></p><p>SOURCE GFL Environmental Inc.</p></div></article>",
