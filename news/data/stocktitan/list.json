(Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/NUAI/\" title=\"View NUAI stock overview\">NUAI</a>) (“New Era” or the “Company”), a developer and operator of next-generation digital infrastructure and integrated power assets in the Permian Basin, today announced it has entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent (\"LOI\") to acquire approximately 54 acres of strategically located land adjacent to its Texas Critical Data Centers (“TCDC”) campus in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.ector\">Ector County, Texas</location>.</p><div id=\"bwbodyimg\" style=\"width: 150px; float:left; padding-left:0px; padding-right:20px; padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;\"><img alt=\"Site Overview\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20260226055146/en/2732622/4/New_Era.jpg\"/><p style=\"font-size:85%;\">Site Overview</p></div><p>The contemplated acquisition was undertaken as part of ongoing lease negotiations with a leading hyperscale tenant and partners, where securing the additional acreage emerged as a key milestone in advancing discussions. This development is accompanied by continued site advancement, including initial land clearing, removal of out-of-service and abandoned pipeline infrastructure, relocation of active lines, and subsurface soil sampling to support civil engineering design. These activities are intended to optimize the developable footprint and maximize usable acreage for data center deployment.</p><p>By seeking to consolidate this corridor, New Era is looking to enhance its ability to structure direct power solutions and optimize interconnection design as it advances development of its now 438-acre, master-planned TCDC campus, which is designed to scale to more than 1 gigawatt over time.</p><p>The additional acreage would expand New Era’s capacity to:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Directly on next for major power offtake arrangements with nearby energy generation and transport infrastructure</li><li>Negotiate more efficient and flexible interconnection structures</li><li>Reduce exposure to broader grid congestion and transmission constraints; and</li><li>Enhance redundancy, reliability, and long-term expansion flexibility</li></ul><p>The Company expects control of the corridor between operating generation assets and its campus footprint may potentially increase New Era’s negotiating leverage with power producers while improving development sequencing. It also expands the Company’s options for transmission access and energy integration, which are critical for hyperscale and high-performance computing tenants requiring scalable, resilient power infrastructure.</p><p>E. Will Gray II, CEO of New Era Energy &amp; Digital commented: “By taking the first step to secure this additional 54 acres, we are seeking to strengthen our strategic land position between major power generation and transmission assets and take a pivotal step toward finalizing a definitive lease agreement with our end tenant. This transaction would further reinforce TCDC’s positioning as an integrated power and digital infrastructure platform designed for long-term expansion and operational reliability.”</p><p><b>About New Era Energy &amp; Digital, Inc.<br/></b>New Era Energy &amp; Digital, Inc.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 26, 2026) - <b>Minaurum Silver Inc. (TSXV: MGG) (OTCQX: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/MMRGF/\" title=\"View MMRGF stock overview\">MMRGF</a>) (FSE: 78M0) (\"Minaurum\" or the \"Company\")</b> is pleased to report that <b>six drill rigs</b> are now operating at its <b>Alamos Silver Project</b> as part of the <b>Phase II - 50,000-metre resource expansion drill program</b>.  Minaurum will continue step-out drilling on vein zones with established resources at <b>Europa</b> and <b>Promontorio-Travesia</b>, while initiating resource-definition drilling on several additional veins, including <b>San Jose</b>, <b>Quintera, Cotera-Pulpito</b>, and <b>Minas Nuevas</b>.</p><p>Recent step-out drilling at Europa has returned multiple high-grade silver intercepts, including: <b>0.50 m of 524 g/t silver equivalent (\"AgEq\")</b> in hole AL25-172, <b>0.30 m of 1,032 g/t AgEq</b> in hole AL25-174 and <b>1.40 m of 290 g/t AgEq</b> in hole AL25-175.  At Travesía-Quintera, step-out drilling returned <b>2.55 m of 197 g/t AgEq</b>, including <b>0.40 m grading 567 g/t AgEq</b> in hole AL25-173 (see Table 1).</p><p><b>\"With the continued success of our step-out drilling at the Europa vein zone, we are pleased to have expanded our drill fleet from four to six rigs,\" </b>stated Darrell Rader, President and CEO of Minaurum Silver.<b> \"Supported by an inferred resource of 55 million ounces AgEq at Alamos and a fully funded 50,000-metre resource expansion program currently underway, Minaurum is well positioned to deliver an updated mineral resource estimate in the second half of 2026.  We anticipate a steady increase in drill results as the expanded fleet advances the program.\"</b></p><p>Mineralization at the Europa and Travesia-Quintera zones has intersected high-grade silver over narrower widths that clearly define the margins of the robust silver shoots.  The vein system displays a well-developed pinch-and-swell geometry along strike and down-dip, characterized by variations in vein thickness and grade.  This continuity is exemplified by Hole AL25-163 at Europa, which returned 12.35 metres grading 408 g/t AgEq, including 3.20 metres of 1,277 g/t AgEq, in a 250-metre step-out (see Minaurum news release dated February 10, 2026), demonstrating a potentially large expansion of the mineralized envelope.</p><p>At Quintera, drilling continues to intersect mineralization within and surrounding historic underground workings, as well as in parallel hanging-wall veins and along strike.  </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/3455/285489_8c7cd3810420b91b_003full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

Maynard, Vice President of Exploration of Minaurum and a Qualified Person (QP) as defined by National Instrument 43-101, reviewed and verified the assay data, and has approved the disclosure in this news release. Verification was done by visual inspection of core samples and comparison to assay results. Assay results have not been checked by re-analysis. No factors were identified that could materially affect the accuracy or reliability of the data presented in this news release.</font></i></p><p><i><font style=\"font-size: 11px;\"><b>Analytical Procedures and Quality Assurance/Quality Control: </b>Preparation and assaying of drilling samples from Minaurum's Alamos project are done with strict adherence to a Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) protocol. Core samples are sawed in half and then bagged in a secure facility near the site and then shipped either by a licensed courior by Company personnel to ALS Minerals' preparation facility in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. ALS prepares the samples, crushing them to <percent>70%</percent> less than 2mm, splitting off 250g, and pulverizing the split to more than <percent>85%</percent> passing 75 microns. The resulting sample pulps are prepared in Hermosillo and then shipped to Vancouver for chemical analysis by ALS Minerals. In Vancouver, the pulps are analyzed for gold by fire assay and ICP/AES on a 30-gram charge. In addition, analyses are done for silver, copper, lead, and zinc using 4-acid digestion and ICP analysis. Samples with silver values greater than 100 g/t; and copper, lead, or zinc values greater than 10,000 ppm (<percent>1%</percent>) are re-analyzed using 4-acid digestion and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). </font></i></p><p><i><font style=\"font-size: 11px;\">Quality-control (QC) samples are inserted in the sample stream every 20 samples on average, and thus represent <percent>5%</percent> of the total samples. QC samples include standards, blanks, and duplicate samples. Standards are pulps that have been prepared by a third-party laboratory; they have gold, silver, and base-metal values that are established by an extensive analytical process in which several commercial labs (including ALS Minerals) participate. Standards test the calibration of the analytical equipment. Blanks are rock material known from prior sampling to contain less than 0.005 ppm gold; they test the sample preparation procedure for cross-sample contamination.  In the case of duplicates, the sample interval is cut in half and then quartered. The first quarter is the original sample, the second becomes the duplicate. Duplicate samples provide a test of the reproducibility of assays in the same drilled interval. When final assays are received, QC sample results are inspected for deviation from accepted values. To date, QC sample analytical results have fallen in acceptable ranges on the Alamos project.</font></i></p><p><i><font style=\"font-size: 11px;\">When final assays are received, QC sample results are inspected for deviation from accepted values by the QP.

The combination demonstrated a safety profile consistent with docetaxel alone, with no new or unexpected safety signals observed. The regimen also showed clinically meaningful efficacy, including high rates of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses and sustained PSA reductions, supporting continued development and advancement into Phase 3 studies. The results were presented for the first time at the 2026 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Genitourinary Cancers Symposium (Abstract #171).<sup>1</sup></p><div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1\"><p><a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2333578/Johnson_and_Johnson_Logo_v1.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"(PRNewsfoto/Johnson &amp; Johnson)\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2333578/Johnson_and_Johnson_Logo_v1.jpg\" title=\"(PRNewsfoto/Johnson &amp; Johnson)\"/></a></p></div><p>Pasritamig is designed to engage the immune system through a novel mechanism of action, binding CD3 on T cells and human kallikrein 2 (KLK2). KLK2 is a novel, highly specific prostate cancer target with minimal expression outside prostate tissue. By both activating and directing T cells to KLK2-expressing tumor cells, pasritamig enables targeted immune engagement. This differentiated, prostate-specific approach was intentionally built to focus immune activity on prostate cancer cells, which may help limit effects on healthy tissue, and supports administration in a doctor's office rather than hospital setting.</p><p>\"These data represent an important step forward for patients with advanced prostate cancer,\" said Professor Shahneen Sandhu,* M.D., Ph.D., MBBS, FRACP, Associate Professor, Consultant Medical Oncologist and researcher at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, and study investigator. \"In a disease where outcomes remain poor for many patients, seeing encouraging clinical activity alongside a favorable safety profile in combination with docetaxel reinforces the potential of this approach and supports further clinical development.\"</p><p>\"Based on these findings, we are increasingly confident in the potential of pasritamig to meaningfully improve outcomes for people with prostate cancer,\" said Charles Drake, M.D., Ph.D., Vice President, Prostate Cancer and Cross Cancer Immuno-Oncology, Johnson &amp; Johnson. \"The ability to combine pasritamig with docetaxel, where prior approaches in the field have fallen short, gives us a strong foundation for Phase 3 development. What we're seeing with this combination, including deep and durable PSA responses, underscores the promise of this combination immunotherapy approach and our commitment to advancing innovation that can make a difference for patients.\"</p><p><b>Detailed Study Results</b></p><p>In the study, pasritamig was evaluated in combination with docetaxel in an outpatient setting in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer whose disease had progressed following androgen receptor pathway inhibitor therapy. Approximately half of the patients (45 percent) had received at least one prior taxane-based regimen. The primary endpoint was safety and identification of the recommended regimen for further development in Phase 2/3 studies, with secondary and exploratory endpoints assessing clinical activity, including PSA response rates.<sup>1</sup></p><p>As of December 9, 2025, 51 patients had received pasritamig plus docetaxel, including patients who were pretreated with a median of three prior therapies (range, 1-9). Reductions of 50 percent or greater in PSA levels were achieved in 64.7 percent of patients overall and in 75.0 percent of taxane-naïve patients. Reductions of 90 percent or greater in PSA levels were achieved in 39.2 percent of patients overall and 53.6 percent of taxane-naïve patients. Among taxane-naïve patients with bone-only disease, confirmed PSA reductions of 50 percent or greater and 90 percent or greater were observed in 88.2 percent and 76.5 percent of patients, respectively. Patients were able to continue pasritamig beyond docetaxel discontinuation. Those patients received a median of six docetaxel doses every three weeks and eight pasritamig doses every six weeks, supporting the potential for sustained disease control over time.<sup>1</sup></p><p>The safety profile of pasritamig plus docetaxel was consistent with the known safety profile of docetaxel in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurring in at least 20 percent of patients included fatigue (60.8 percent), alopecia (41.2 percent), diarrhea and nausea (31.4 percent each), peripheral edema (27.5 percent), peripheral sensory neuropathy (25.5 percent) and dysgeusia (23.5 percent). Pasritamig-related adverse events occurring in at least 10 percent of patients were fatigue (33.3 percent) and non-chronic diarrhea (11.8 percent). Grade 3 or higher TRAEs attributed to docetaxel were observed in 29.4 percent of patients, compared with only two percent attributed to pasritamig. No patients experienced cytokine release syndrome of any grade or treatment-related deaths.<sup>1 </sup></p><p>Two ongoing Phase 3 studies are evaluating pasritamig in the metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer setting.

The primary objective is to determine the recommended regimen for further development based on safety, with secondary and exploratory endpoints assessing clinical activity. Pasritamig was administered intravenously every six weeks, with initial step-up doses given during the first treatment cycle, in combination with docetaxel administered intravenously every three weeks. Treatment was delivered in an outpatient setting. Corticosteroids were used only as standard premedication for docetaxel, and hematopoietic growth factor support was permitted as needed.<sup>4</sup></p><p><b>About Pasritamig (JNJ-78278343)</b></p><p>Pasritamig (JNJ-78278343) is an investigational T-cell-redirecting bispecific antibody (bsAb) targeting human kallikrein 2 (KLK2) on prostate cancer cells and CD3 receptor complexes on T cells, leveraging the body's immune system to selectively target and eliminate cancer cells. This innovative approach is being evaluated in pretreated patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), a patient population with limited treatment options.</p><p><b>About Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)</b></p><p>Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a challenging and aggressive stage of prostate cancer where the disease progresses despite androgen deprivation therapy.<sup>5</sup> Patients often experience metastasis to bones and lymph nodes, leading to poor outcomes and limited treatment options, including chemotherapy and second-line hormone therapies.<sup>6</sup> The median overall survival ranges from 13.5 to 31.6 months depending on the site of metastasis, with a typical range of 15 to 36 months across the broader population.<sup>7,8</sup> Survival rates can vary significantly depending on factors such as prior treatment history, disease burden, and response to therapy. The need for more effective treatments is critical, as the disease continues to impact a large number of men globally, with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) being responsible for a substantial number of prostate cancer-related deaths.</p><p><b>About Johnson &amp; Johnson</b></p><p>At Johnson &amp; Johnson, we believe health is everything.

With semaglutide’s patent cliff approaching in 2031 and tirzepatide’s in 2036, long-term exclusivity will determine which assets become franchises and which face early generic pressure.</p> <p>“When multiple drugs deliver similar weight-loss results, the competitive moat shifts beneath the surface,” said Javier Chamorro, Chief Operating Officer of PatentVest. “The difference between a broad genus claim and a narrow composition patent can determine who owns this market for the next twenty years.”</p> <p>This analysis maps 50 oral small-molecule GLP-1 programs worldwide, including 30 in clinical development, and evaluates the IP positioning of leading assets from Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Roche, AstraZeneca, Gilead, Structure Therapeutics, and others.</p> <p>This is the first in a series of deep-dive analyses evaluating the structural and patent defensibility of each major program.</p> <p>PatentVest, a division of MDB Capital Holdings (Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/MDBH/\" title=\"View MDBH stock overview\">MDBH</a>), is the first integrated IP intelligence, strategy, and law firm designed to help visionary companies become technology leaders.
