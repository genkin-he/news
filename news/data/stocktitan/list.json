(\"Orogen\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that it has signed a purchase and sale agreement (the \"Agreement\") with Quebec Nickel Corp. (CSE: QNI) (\"Quebec Nickel\") whereby Quebec Nickel can acquire a <percent>100%</percent> interest in the Ecru gold project, Nevada, USA.</p><p>Under the terms of the Agreement, Quebec Nickel can acquire a <percent>100%</percent> interest in the Ecru claims from Orogen for an aggregate consideration of <money>$540,000</money> in cash and shares of Quebec Nickel (\"Consideration Shares\"), subject to regulatory acceptance of the Canadian Securities Exchange, and payable as follows:</p><ol><li><p><money>$250,000</money> cash on closing of the acquisition, <money>$25,000</money> of which has already been received;</p></li><li><p>1,000,000 Consideration Shares of Quebec Nickel issued on closing, at a price of <money>$0.16</money>5 per share, representing the permitted discount to the closing price of Quebec Nickel's common shares on February 26, 2026; and</p></li><li><p>Within six months of closing, the issuance to Orogen of <money>$125,000</money> of Consideration Shares at a price per share equal to the 10-day volume weighted average price of the common shares of Quebec Nickel on the Canadian Securities Exchange at the date of the issue.</p></li></ol><p>Quebec Nickel will also grant a non-buyable <percent>2%</percent> net smelter return (\"NSR\") royalty to Orogen.</p><p>Closing of the acquisition is expected to be completed within the next 30 days.</p><p>Paddy Nicol, CEO of Orogen commented, \"The Ecru gold project, staked by Orogen's generative team, is favourably located in the prolific Cortez trend in Nevada, immediately north and adjacent to Nevada Gold Mines Robertson deposit. We look forward to following the progress of the Quebec Nickel team at Ecru.\"</p><p><strong><u>About the Ecru Gold Project</u></strong></p><p>The Ecru project is located on the northeast margin of Nevada Gold Mine's Cortez Trend land position (the Cortez Complex<sup>1</sup>) within the larger Battle Mountain - Eureka trend. The property consists of 112 lode-mining claims <percent>100%</percent> owned by Orogen and two leased sections. The project lies immediately adjacent to Nevada Gold Mines' 2.4 Moz Robertson reduced intrusion related gold deposit<sup>1</sup> (Figure 1).</p><p>Two main target areas are located on the property and demonstrate the potential for both Carlin and Robertson-style mineralization (Figure 2).</p><p>The shallower intrusive target is defined by a two-kilometre diameter area of multiple magnetic highs and adjacent gravity lows, interpreted to reflect intrusive bodies and associated alteration within upper‑plate siliciclastic rocks. Multiple intrusive phases are present on the property, both at surface and in historical drill intercepts. These multi‑phase intrusives and the surrounding rock exhibit characteristics and geochemical signatures analogous to the Robertson deposit.</p><p>A potential Carlin-type system is defined by an untested, prominent gravity high target interpreted to be a region of structurally uplifted lower plate carbonates near surface, under pediment cover. Nearby historical drilling has identified anomalous gold and pathfinder geochemistry in upper plate stratigraphy which supports the potential for a mineralized, lower plate carbonate window at Ecru.</p><p>Quebec Nickel plans to evaluate the potential for both deposit types on the property.</p><a href=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/bdbbbf6b-4bb9-443c-b0ca-2e40b3395753/1142121/orogen-fig1-022626.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/bdbbbf6b-4bb9-443c-b0ca-2e40b3395753/1142121/orogen-fig1-022626.jpg\" style=\"text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto;\" width=\"566\"/></a><figcaption><strong>Figure 1: Location of the Ecru project.

Initial program activities are expected to begin in early 2026.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Schweiger will present initial findings at upcoming internal leadership meetings, highlighting the benefits of the new protocols and product within the Schweiger network. Results will also be presented at key industry conferences to demonstrate the real-world impact of introducing this innovative injectable across Schweiger’s extensive practices.</p> <p align=\"justify\">“Partnering with Schweiger Dermatology is a clear statement of our intent to launch this new injectable on a foundation of robust clinical evidence, education, and integrated patient outcomes,” said Drew Fine, U.S. General Manager, Professional Channel. “The ALOHA program will serve as a platform for a differentiated launch strategy and underscore Obagi Medical’s commitment to delivering innovative products across every facet of skincare and now injectable aesthetics.”</p> <p align=\"justify\">Obagi<sup>®</sup> saypha<sup>®</sup> MagIQ™, developed by Croma-Pharma GmbH, utilizes proprietary MACRO Core Technology to create a stable three-dimensional hyaluronic acid matrix.

(OTCID:CBLO), a blockchain infrastructure and digital asset treasury company, today announced that its corporate holdings of DOG (Bitcoin) have increased to 695,262,313 DOG, compared to 680,738,191 DOG previously reported.</p><p>The increase reflects the acquisition of <strong>14,524,122 additional DOG (Bitcoin)</strong> tokens as part of the Company's ongoing digital asset treasury strategy.</p><p>DOG (Bitcoin) is a digital asset issued via the Bitcoin Runes protocol, which launched in April 2024 in conjunction with the most recent Bitcoin halving event. The Runes protocol enables the creation and transfer of fungible digital assets directly on Bitcoin's base layer.</p><p>The Company's DOG holdings are custodied with Kraken. Token balances are independently verifiable through public blockchain data, and the Company provides additional transparency through its treasury dashboard at <strong>C2DOG.com.</strong></p><p>\"We continue to execute our digital asset treasury strategy within our capital allocation and governance framework,\" said <strong>Levi Jacobson, Chief Executive Officer of C2 Blockchain Inc.</strong> \"We evaluate Bitcoin-native digital assets in the context of long-term infrastructure developments occurring on the Bitcoin network.\"</p><p><strong>Bitcoin Halving and Runes Protocol Context</strong></p><p>The April 2024 Bitcoin halving reduced the block subsidy awarded to miners and historically has altered the economic dynamics of the Bitcoin network. The introduction of the Runes protocol coincided with that halving event, adding additional transaction activity directly on Bitcoin's base layer.</p><p>Public blockchain analytics have indicated periods in which Runes-related transactions have represented a significant portion of total Bitcoin network activity. DOG (Bitcoin), as a Runes-issued asset, participates in this on-chain transaction framework.</p><p>The Company notes that network activity levels may fluctuate over time and do not necessarily correlate with digital asset price performance.</p><p><strong>Digital Asset Treasury Framework</strong></p><p>C2 Blockchain incorporates digital assets as part of its broader treasury management strategy. The Company evaluates acquisitions based on capital availability, liquidity conditions, custody considerations, regulatory developments, and overall market factors.</p><p>The Company may increase, decrease, or otherwise adjust its digital asset holdings depending on business needs, capital requirements, and market conditions.</p><p><strong>Financial Reporting Considerations</strong></p><p>Digital assets, including DOG (Bitcoin), are accounted for in accordance with applicable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Under current accounting standards, digital assets may be subject to fair value measurement or other remeasurement requirements. Fluctuations in market price may impact the Company's reported financial results in future reporting periods.</p><p>The Company will provide appropriate disclosures regarding digital asset valuation and accounting treatment in its periodic filings.</p><p><strong>About DOG (Bitcoin)</strong></p><p>DOG (Bitcoin) is a digital asset issued through the Bitcoin Runes protocol and operates directly on Bitcoin's base layer.</p><p><strong>About C2 Blockchain Inc.</strong></p><p>C2 Blockchain Inc. (OTCID:CBLO) is a publicly traded blockchain infrastructure and digital asset treasury company focused on digital asset treasury management and Bitcoin-related initiatives within a public-market governance framework.</p><p><strong>Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p><p>This press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

            "title": "Worksport Is \"Showing Its Work\" as 2026 Momentum Targets Record-Setting Performance | WKSP Stock News",
            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><strong id=\"dateline\">WEST SENECA, NY / <a href=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ACCESS Newswire</a> / February 27, 2026 / </strong>Projections often capture attention. Measurable progress builds confidence.</p><p>At Worksport Ltd. (\"Worksport\" or the \"Company\") <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3h3\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">(NASDAQ:<u>WKSP</u>)</a>, the sequence of developments extending back through Q4 2025 reflects the latter principle. This is not a company relying on narrative alone. It's increasingly demonstrating execution alongside opportunity. As 2026 begins, the emphasis is clear: documented milestones and operational advancement are taking precedence over distant ambition.</p><p>That tone was established before the new year even turned. In December 2025, Worksport reported that November <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3h4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>revenue</u></a> marked the highest monthly total in Company history, creating a record baseline entering 2026. A single month does not define a trajectory, but it can reveal acceleration. When revenue peaks within a compressed timeframe, it often signals traction building beneath the surface, which can show up in broader quarterly performances.</p><p>Against that backdrop, the early 2026 announcements read less like routine updates and more like coordinated steps within a structured expansion.</p><p><strong>Growth Through Intention</strong></p><p>On January 27, Worksport's subsidiary <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3h5\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>Terravis Energy</u></a> selected a major Asian manufacturing partner for its Aetherlux heat pump platform with Zerofrost anti-frosting technology. The move was less about headlines and more about infrastructure. Clean energy hardware does not scale on concept alone. It requires supply chain alignment, cost discipline, and production readiness. By securing manufacturing capacity ahead of broader commercialization, Worksport signaled preparation and a willingness to lay foundational infrastructure before expanding market visibility.</p><p>Then, on February 3, the Company announced a strategic <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3h6\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>partnership</u></a> with Potomac International Partners to accelerate federal government and commercial market engagement for its clean energy ecosystem. Federal procurement is structured, compliance-driven, and relationship-based. Rather than attempting to navigate that terrain independently, Worksport aligned with a partner designed to open institutional doors. The SOLIS solar system, COR portable energy platform, and Aetherlux heat pump technology are now positioned within structured procurement conversations.</p><p>Momentum is far more compelling when numbers support it.</p><p><strong>Record-Setting Revenues Posted</strong></p><p>On February 11, Worksport <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3h7\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>reported</u></a> Q4 revenue growth of <percent>65%</percent> year over year, with gross profit increasing <percent>380%</percent>. Full-year revenue climbed <percent>91%</percent> to approximately <money>$16.2 million</money>, and gross margins expanded into the low <percent>30%</percent> range. Revenue growth draws attention. Margin expansion commands respect. Together, they indicate that scaling efforts are not occurring at the expense of discipline. In other words, operational leverage appears to be emerging alongside expansion.</p><p>The next development added another layer. On February 12, Worksport <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3h8\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>confirmed</u></a> that a government entity is evaluating its Aetherlux Pro heat pump, with AHRI and ENERGY STAR certification processes continuing to advance. Government evaluation is not casual engagement. It involves technical scrutiny, regulatory review, and structured assessment. While outcomes remain subject to process, the engagement itself signals that the technology is being tested within serious institutional channels.</p><p>That momentum carried forward on February 19, when Worksport secured key <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3h9\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>certifications</u></a> for its COR portable energy system, including transport and federal compliance approvals. The Company indicated that final UL and CSA certifications are expected within the first quarter of 2026. Those certifications are often prerequisites for large-scale retail and enterprise distribution, again showing that commercialization gates are being addressed in accretive sequence.</p><p>Viewed collectively, the pattern becomes harder to dismiss. Revenue momentum. Manufacturing readiness. Federal channel access. Certification advancement. Margin expansion. These are not disconnected headlines. They represent synchronized movement across production, distribution, compliance, and financial performance.</p><p>Worksport's broader 2026 business <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3ha\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>update</u></a> reinforces that alignment. Management has stated that clean energy products are shipping, that OEM and major distribution discussions are progressing, and that growth is expected to continue in 2026 - language that reflects forward movement supported by visible operational steps.</p><p><strong>Summing The Parts</strong></p><p>It's also important to remember the foundation beneath this expansion. Worksport's core automotive accessory business, particularly tonneau covers, continues to contribute revenue stability. The SOLIS solar integration platform, COR portable energy system, and Aetherlux heat pump portfolio are not replacements. They are extensions. The Company is layering clean energy capabilities onto an existing operational base rather than attempting to build from scratch.</p><p>Market opportunity narratives, including references to multibillion-dollar industry segments, only carry weight when paired with tangible advancement. What distinguishes Worksport's current phase is that incremental barriers are being addressed methodically. Production alignment reduces supply risk. Certifications reduce compliance friction. Institutional evaluation adds credibility. Margin expansion suggests scalability.</p><p>Taken together, the progression suggests coordination between strategy and execution. Moreover, Worksport's updates show it's not merely outlining where it intends to go in 2026. It's describing the intermediate steps designed to support that trajectory. For observers evaluating emerging clean energy participants within the small-cap landscape, the distinction between aspiration and implementation matters.</p><p>As importantly, Worksport's first-quarter developments continue to reflect a company intent on showing its work as it provides answers to serve multiple market opportunities. In a market environment that increasingly values operational clarity and disciplined advancement, that distinction could prove meaningful.</p><p><strong>About Worksport</strong></p><p>Worksport Ltd. (Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/WKSP/\" title=\"View WKSP stock overview\">WKSP</a>), through its subsidiaries, designs, develops, manufactures, and owns the intellectual property on a variety of tonneau covers, solar integrations, portable power systems, and clean heating &amp; cooling solutions.

Hole PGC-25-006 is important, as it suggests Moosehead may be part of a broader mineralized system rather than an isolated zone. We are still in the early stages, but the combination of high-grade intercepts and new zone discovery gives us real confidence in the scale potential at Treasure Island. In exploration, sometimes you intersect broad zones and sometimes you intersect narrow high-grade veins that point you toward something much larger. Both are important, and these first holes confirm we have a gold-bearing system and a structural model that is working. We are excited about what the coming weeks and months of drilling may deliver,\" said Denis Laviolette, Executive Chairman &amp; CEO.</i></p><p>Greg Matheson, VP Exploration, added:</p><p><i>\"Step-out drilling along the Moosehead Eastern and Western trends has yielded strong high-grade assay results as we continue to expand the footprint of these sub-parallel structures. Five of the first six holes reported from Moosehead intersected high-grade gold, confirming both the strength and continuity of the system. These intercepts remain relatively shallow for an orogenic gold environment, and we see significant room for growth along both fault structures. The announcement last week of a newly discovered vein linking the Eastern and Western trends is important and adds a new element to the potential for additional new zones as the drilling continues.</i></p><p><i>\"While much of the drilling to date has focused on expanding the known Moosehead trends, we believe the broader opportunity lies in testing near-surface geophysical targets across the property. We're truly excited by the success in drill hole PGC-25-006 and plan to not only further define this new zone but continue the hunt for additional new discoveries. With more than 50 kilometres of comparable geology and structural setting across Treasure Island North, we believe we are only beginning to unlock the district-scale potential of this system.\" </i></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/6079/285609_829c944b24f7ead5_001full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

AA is a chronic immune disease that can have an especially devastating social and emotional impact on young patients and their families, as early onset AA can be more severe and lead to extensive and unpredictable hair loss.<sup>1</sup></p><p>\"The positive CHMP opinion supports the potential expansion of Olumiant as a new treatment option for adolescents living with the profound physical and emotional realities of severe alopecia areata,\" said Anabela Cardoso, senior vice president, Lilly Immunology Medical Affairs. \"The depth and rigor of data from BRAVE-AA-PEDS – the first and largest trial designed specifically for these young patients – reflects Lilly's longstanding commitment to advancing care for people with chronic skin diseases who have had limited options for far too long.\"</p><p>Olumiant is a once-daily, oral JAK inhibitor discovered by Incyte and licensed to Lilly. In 2022, the European Commission (EC) and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Olumiant for adult patients with severe AA, making it the first JAK inhibitor approved in these geographies for severe disease. This positive opinion marks the next step toward European regulatory approval of Olumiant for adolescents ages 12 to under 18 with severe AA, and it is now referred to the European Commission for final action. The European Commission's decision is expected in the next one to two months.</p><p>The positive CHMP opinion is supported by 36-week data from the Phase 3 BRAVE-AA-PEDS study evaluating the safety and efficacy of once-daily, oral Olumiant compared with placebo in the cohort of patients ages 12 to under 18. Treatment with Olumiant helped many adolescents achieve near-complete scalp hair regrowth. Additionally, many patients achieved successful eyebrow and eyelash regrowth.<sup>2 </sup></p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"prnbcc\"><tr><td class=\"prnpr2 prnpl2 prnvab prntac prncbts prnbrbrs prnbbbs prnbsbls\" colspan=\"4\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Efficacy results at 36 weeks<span class=\"prnews_span\"><sup>2</sup></span></b></span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prnpr10 prnpl2 prnvab prntar prnsbtb1 prnbrbrs prnbbbs prnbsbls\" colspan=\"1\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" rowspan=\"1\"><br/></td><td class=\"prngen4\" colspan=\"1\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">Dose: 4 mg</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen4\" colspan=\"1\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">Dose: 2 mg</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen4\" colspan=\"1\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">Placebo</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen5\" colspan=\"1\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">Successful (≥<percent>80%</percent>) scalp hair coverage*</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen4\" colspan=\"1\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">42.4 %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen4\" colspan=\"1\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">27.4 %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen4\" colspan=\"1\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">4.5 %</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen5\" colspan=\"1\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">Near-complete (≥<percent>90%</percent>) scalp hair coverage<i>†</i></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen4\" colspan=\"1\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">36.5 %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen4\" colspan=\"1\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">21.4 %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen4\" colspan=\"1\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">2.3 %</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen5\" colspan=\"1\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">Significant eyebrow regrowth<i>‡</i></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen4\" colspan=\"1\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">50.0 %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen4\" colspan=\"1\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">24.1 %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen4\" colspan=\"1\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">0 %</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen5\" colspan=\"1\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">Eyelash regrowth<i>‡</i></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen4\" colspan=\"1\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">42.9 %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen4\" colspan=\"1\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">25.5 %</span></p></td><td class=\"prngen4\" colspan=\"1\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">14.0 %</span></p></td></tr></table></div><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"prnbcc\"><tr><td class=\"prngen6\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><i>* Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score ≤20</i></span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen6\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><i>† SALT score ≤10 </i></span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen6\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><i>‡ Clinician-reported outcome (ClinRO) score of 0 or 1 with a ≥2-point improvement from baseline</i></span></p></td></tr></table></div><p>The safety profile of Olumiant in adolescents with AA was consistent with the safety profile seen in clinical trials for children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.<sup>2</sup></p><p>In addition, 52-week efficacy and safety data demonstrating successful hair regrowth on the scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes in adolescent patients <a href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628763-1&amp;h=858834059&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flilly.mediaroom.com%2F2025-10-24-Lillys-baricitinib-delivered-near-complete-scalp-hair-regrowth-at-one-year-for-adolescents-with-severe-alopecia-areata-in-Phase-3-BRAVE-AA-PEDS-trial&amp;a=were+also+recently+presented\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">were also recently presented</a> at the Fall Clinical Dermatology (FCD) Conference in October 2025.</p><p>Olumiant is the most-researched JAK inhibitor in AA.

We expanded our addressable markets and validated technologies that position us at the center of next-generation satellite and private wireless connectivity. Throughout the year, we have made significant progress with our satellite and ground station partners and are now poised to deploy not only the satellites to replenish our existing constellation but also extend our reach with our third-generation system.\"</p><p>Dr. Jacobs continued, \"As we enter 2026, we believe the momentum we have built gives us a strong foundation to scale. With replacement 2nd generation satellites rolling off the line, continued progress on key regulatory and network infrastructure initiatives, the commercial rollout of two-way IoT capabilities, and traction for XCOM RAN, we are moving decisively from groundwork to growth.

The increase in total revenue was due primarily to performance bonuses earned during the fourth quarter of 2025, as well as higher wholesale capacity services revenue resulting from additional service fees associated with the reimbursement of network-related costs.</p><p>Revenue was also impacted favorably by (1) an increase in Commercial IoT related revenue due to higher average subscribers and device sales, which was offset partially by a decline in Duplex and SPOT driven revenue due to subscriber churn; and (2) revenue recognized under our service agreement with Parsons Corporation as we moved beyond the proof of concept phase during 2025, which was offset by a decrease in revenue from XCOM RAN sales.</p><p><i>Loss from Operations</i></p><p>Loss from operations was <money><money>$0.4 million</money></money> during the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to a loss from operations of <money><money>$4.2 million</money></money> during the prior year's fourth quarter. This improvement was due to higher revenue (as discussed above) offset partially by an increase in operating expenses (as discussed below).</p><p>During the fourth quarter of 2025, higher cost of services, marketing, general and administrative (\"MG&amp;A\") expenses and cost of subscriber equipment sales were offset partially by lower stock-based compensation expenses. Higher cost of services resulted primarily from network operating costs to support the build out of our next-generation satellite and ground network infrastructure, a significant portion of which are reimbursed to us, and this consideration is recognized as revenue. Additionally, costs increased to support the development of XCOM RAN technology and new MSS products. MG&amp;A expense was higher than the prior year's fourth quarter due primarily to legal and professional fees.</p><p>The cost of subscriber equipment sales increased during the fourth quarter of 2025 due to higher hardware sales as well as <money><money>$1.1 million</money></money> in expense related to tariffs on equipment imported and re-exported to foreign subsidiaries. These tariffs were previously recorded as recoverable duty drawbacks but are no longer deemed probable of being refunded.</p><p><i>Net Loss</i></p><p>Net loss was <money><money>$11.6 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to net loss of <money><money>$50.2 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2024. This improvement was due primarily to a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the paydown of the 2023 <percent>13%</percent> Notes recorded during the fourth quarter of 2024. Favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to the remeasurement of intercompany balances as well as a non-cash gain on the quarterly mark-to-market adjustment of our derivative asset gain were offset by higher interest expense resulting from our recognition of non-cash imputed interest related to the 2024 Prepayment Agreement (as defined in our periodic reports).</p><p><i>Adjusted EBITDA</i></p><p>Adjusted EBITDA increased to <money><money>$32.4 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to <money><money>$30.4 million</money></money> for the same period in 2024. This <percent>7%</percent> increase was due to an increase in revenue of <money><money>$10.8 million</money></money> offset partially by a <money><money>$8.8 million</money></money> increase in operating expenses (excluding adjustments for non-cash or non-recurring items).</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information, refer to “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA.”</p><p><b>ANNUAL FINANCIAL REVIEW</b></p><p><i>Revenue</i></p><p>Total revenue was <money><money>$273.0 million</money></money> during the twelve months ended December 31, 2025, including <money><money>$257.3 million</money></money> of service revenue and <money><money>$15.7 million</money></money> of revenue generated from subscriber equipment sales. Total revenue increased <percent>9%</percent> from 2024, reaching a record high for the fourth consecutive year. This increase was due to higher service revenue and higher revenue from subscriber equipment sales.</p><p>Service revenue increased <money><money>$19.6 million</money></money>, or <percent>8%</percent>, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024 due to increases in wholesale capacity services. Revenue from subscriber equipment sales increased <money><money>$3.0 million</money></money>, or <percent>24%</percent>, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024 due to a higher volume of Commercial IoT device sales.</p><p><i>Income (Loss) from Operations</i></p><p>Income from operations was <money><money>$7.4 million</money></money> during 2025 compared to loss from operations of <money><money>$0.9 million</money></money> during 2024 due to higher revenue (as discussed above) offset partially by higher operating expenses (as discussed below).</p><p>Higher cost of services, MG&amp;A expense and cost of subscriber equipment sales were offset partially by lower stock-based compensation expenses. A non-cash loss on disposal of assets during the first quarter of 2025 also increased operating expenses. The drivers of higher cost of services, MG&amp;A expense and cost of subscriber equipment sales for the full year 2025 compared to 2024 are generally consistent with the quarterly increases noted above. Costs incurred to enhance and develop our XCOM RAN product and service offerings were also impacted by our recognition of certain non-cash amortized costs beginning in May 2024.</p><p>Operating expenses were partially offset by employee retention credits received in 2025 as a result of our eligibility under the provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act for 2021. The total credits of <money><money>$3.9 million</money></money> reduced operating expenses during 2025, of which <money><money>$2.7 million</money></money> was allocated to cost of services and <money><money>$1.2 million</money></money> was allocated to MG&amp;A expense, based on the employee costs incurred during the eligible period.</p><p><i>Net Loss</i></p><p>Net loss was <money><money>$8.7 million</money></money> for 2025 compared to <money><money>$63.2 million</money></money> for 2024. This improvement was due primarily to higher revenue (discussed above), net foreign currency gains due to the remeasurement of intercompany balances and non-cash gains on the quarterly mark-to-market adjustment of our derivative asset. This improvement was also due to a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the paydown of the 2023 <percent>13%</percent> Notes recorded during the fourth quarter of 2024. These favorable items were offset partially by higher operating expenses (discussed above) as well as higher interest expense resulting from our recognition of non-cash imputed interest related to the 2024 Prepayment Agreement.</p><p><i>Adjusted EBITDA</i></p><p>Adjusted EBITDA was <money><money>$136.1 million</money></money> in 2025, reaching a record high for the Company and representing a margin of <percent>50%</percent>. This increase from 2024 was due to a <money><money>$22.6 million</money></money> increase in total revenue (for reasons previously discussed), offset partially by a <money><money>$21.9 million</money></money> increase in operating expenses (excluding adjustments for non-cash or non-recurring items) primarily due to investment in growth opportunities. Specifically, while we continue to enhance and develop our XCOM RAN product and service offerings, we incur costs, primarily for personnel, in advance of significant revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information, refer to “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA.\"</p><p><i>Liquidity</i></p><p>As of December 31, 2025, we held cash and cash equivalents of <money><money>$447.5 million</money></money>, compared to <money><money>$391.2 million</money></money> as of December 31, 2024.</p><p>During 2025, net cash flows generated from operations were <money><money>$621.7 million</money></money>, capital expenditures were <money><money>$550.4 million</money></money> and net cash flows used in financing activities were <money><money>$16.2 million</money></money>. Cash and cash equivalents were also positively impacted by a <money><money>$1.2 million</money></money> change in foreign currency exchange rates. Operating cash flows during 2025 included <money><money>$430.6 million</money></money> received in connection with the Infrastructure Prepayment and other cash flows generated from the business. Capital expenditures were primarily associated with our commitments under the Updated Services Agreements related to the deployment of the replacement satellites and Extended MSS Network.</p><p>Adjusted free cash flow during 2025 was <money><money>$171.5 million</money></money> compared to <money><money>$131.9 million</money></money> during 2024. This increase primarily includes <money><money>$45.0 million</money></money> in accelerated service payments received during 2025 as well as higher service payments received pursuant to the Updated Services Agreements, offset partially by higher operating costs (as discussed above). Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure.

These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” \"might,\" \"could,\" “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that could cause or contribute to such differences include, without limitation, those described under Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as may be further updated by subsequent filings with the SEC. Further, new risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risk factors, nor can we accurately assess the ultimate impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this press release to reflect actual results, future events or circumstances or changes in our assumptions, business plans or other changes.</p><p>This press release contains measures such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted free cash flow, which are not recognized under <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to amounts reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are provided in this press release. For forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA margin, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable effort because estimating such GAAP measures and providing a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and requires a level of precision that is unavailable for these future periods and the information needed to reconcile these measures is dependent upon future events, many of which are outside of our control as described above. Forward-looking non-GAAP measures are estimated consistent with the relevant definitions and assumptions.</p><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl bwwidth100\"><tr><td

before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, accretion and derivative (gains)/losses. Adjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash compensation expense, reduction in the value of assets, foreign exchange (gains)/losses, and certain other non-cash or non-recurring charges as applicable. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to manage the Company's business and to compare its results more closely to the results of its peers. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measurements, such as net loss. These terms, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.</p><p class=\"bwcellpmargin\"> </p><p class=\"bwcellpmargin\">The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measurement of its operating performance. The Company believes it best reflects changes across time in the Company's performance, including the effects of pricing, cost control and other operational decisions. The Company's management uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of its annual operating budget. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA also is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies in similar industries. As indicated, Adjusted EBITDA does not include interest expense on borrowed money or depreciation expense on our capital assets or the payment of income taxes, which are necessary elements of the Company's operations. Because Adjusted EBITDA does not account for these expenses, its utility as a measure of the Company's operating performance has material limitations. Because of these limitations, the Company's management does not view Adjusted EBITDA in isolation and also uses other measurements, such as revenues and operating profit, to measure operating performance.</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"bwpadl0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"></td><td class=\"bwpadl0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"></td><td class=\"bwpadl0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> </td></tr><tr><td class=\"bwpadl0 bwpadr0 bwvertalignt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"bwalignr bwcellpmargin\">(2)</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"></td><td class=\"bwvertalignt bwpadl0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"bwcellpmargin\">In connection with the License Agreement with XCOM, the Company entered into a Support Services Agreement (the “SSA”).

Free cash flow as so defined may not be similar to free cash flow as defined by other companies, is not a measurement under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information contained in the Company's consolidated financial statements.

This result reflects the Company's ability to consistently generate value, supported by the strength of its assets and the efficient execution of its operational and comercial strategy.

(MSG) and an average increase of <percent>2.2%</percent> in the RAP of transmission companies wholly owned by Copel GeT for the 2025/2026 cycle, excluding MSG; <b>ii. </b>a decrease of R<money>$ 86.1 million</money> in recurring manageable costs (PMSO) (more details below, in the section on manageable costs); <b>iii. </b>an increase of R<money>$ 34.9 million</money>, resulting from the positive effects on transactions carried out in the Short-Term Market (MCP), in particular the modulation of the hydroelectric generation portfolio, given the behavior of the Settlement Price of Differences (PLD) in the South submarket during the period; and <b>iv. </b>a reduction of R<money>$ 10.8 million</money> in electricity grid usage charges, resulting from the increase in the share of the locational signal in the calculation of the TUST<b>.</b></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">This result was partially offset by the increase in the cost of electricity purchased for resale, as a result of the combination of lower GSF (<percent>67.4%</percent> in 4Q25 versus <percent>79.9%</percent> in 4Q24) and higher PLD (R<money>$ 264.70</money>/MWh in 4Q25, versus R<money>$ 216.36</money>/MWh in 4Q24), as well as a greater deviation in generation and the result of the increase in <i>curtailment</i>, which rose from <percent>15.7%</percent> in 4Q24 to <percent>34.2%</percent> in 4Q25.;</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">(ii)                Elejor's Ebitda increased by R<money>$ 23.6 million</money> when compared to 4Q24, driven by the higher volume of energy traded in bilateral contracts in the period and the increase in the average sale price;</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">(iii)               TradeCo's Ebitda increased by R<money>$ 18.8 million</money> compared to 4Q24, mainly reflecting the <percent>69.7%</percent> increase in energy sales in bilateral contracts (3,824 GWh compared to 2,253 GWh in 4Q24), and the commercialization strategy to mitigate the effects of contracts with generation from intermittent sources, with an impact of approximately R<money>$ 18.0 million</money> in 4Q24;</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">(i)                  the <percent>1.8%</percent> increase in DisCo's Ebitda (+R<money>$ 13.1 million</money>) compared to 4Q24 resulted mainly from the Annual Tariff Adjustment (RTA) in June 2025, with an average effect of <percent>1.3%</percent> on portion B, slightly offset by a <percent>0.1%</percent> reduction in the Billed Wire Market.</p><p>The complete release is available at the Company's website: <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/JkYMBC7OAB\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ir.copel.com</a></p><p><b>Conference Call: February 27</b><sup><b>th</b></sup><b>, 2026 - Friday</b></p><p><b>English: 08:00 a.m. - EST<br/></b>Broadcast through Internet</p><p>Live webcast at <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/GzqKQI0Vya\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ri.copel.com/en/</a> </p><div id=\"contactInfo\"><p>Relações com Investidores<br/>COPEL<br/>+55 41 3331-4011<br/><a href=\"mailto:ri@copel.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ri@copel.com</a></p></div><p id=\"corporateNewsLogoContainer\"><img alt=\"Corporate Logo\" id=\"corporateNewsLogo\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/12133/285624_bfc4d2158411ab91_logo.jpg\"/></p><p id=\"corporateLinkBack\">To view the source version of this press release, please visit <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/Q2pMXtEB7Y\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/285624</a></p><p><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/newsinfo/285624/375\"/></p></article>",
