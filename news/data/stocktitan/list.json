indicators used by management and typically used by our competitors in the SaaS industry. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS. These non-IFRS measures are used to provide investors with alternative measures of our operating performance and liquidity and thus highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures, including SaaS industry metrics, in the evaluation of companies in the SaaS industry. Management also uses non-IFRS measures to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, the preparation of annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of executive compensation. The non-IFRS measures referred to in this press release include “Annual Recurring Revenue”, “Average Contract Value”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted Net Income”, “Adjusted Earnings per Share - Basic and Diluted”, “Working Capital” and “Free Cash Flow”.</p><p><b><i>Key Performance Indicators</i></b></p><p>We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the term of the subscription period under the provisions of our agreements with customers. The terms of our agreements, combined with high customer retention rates, provides us with a significant degree of visibility into our near-term revenues. Management uses a number of metrics, including the ones identified below, to measure the Company’s performance and customer trends, which are used to prepare financial plans and shape future strategy. Our key performance indicators may be calculated in a manner different than similar key performance indicators used by other companies.</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li><i>Annual Recurring Revenue:</i> We define Annual Recurring Revenue as the annualized equivalent value of the subscription revenue of all existing contracts (including Original Equipment Manufacturer contracts) as at the date being measured, excluding non-recurring revenues from implementation, support and maintenance fees. Our customers generally enter into annual or multi-year contracts which are non-cancellable or cancellable with penalty. Accordingly, our calculation of Annual Recurring Revenue assumes that customers will renew the contractual commitments on a periodic basis as those commitments come up for renewal. Subscription agreements may be subject to price increases upon renewal reflecting both inflationary increases and the additional value provided by our solutions. In addition to the expected increase in subscription revenue from price increases over time, existing customers may subscribe for additional features, learners or services during the term. We believe that this measure provides a fair real-time measure of performance in a subscription-based environment. Annual Recurring Revenue provides us with visibility for consistent and predictable growth to our cash flows. Our strong total revenue growth coupled with increasing Annual Recurring Revenue indicates the continued strength in the expansion of our business and will continue to be our focus on a go-forward basis.<br/><br/></li><li><i>Average Contract Value: </i>Average Contract Value is calculated as total Annual Recurring Revenue divided by the number of active customers.</li></ul><p>Annual Recurring Revenue and Average Contract Value as at December 31, 2025 and 2024 were as follows:</p><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl bwwidth100\"><tr><td class=\"bwvertalignb bwpadl0

LAUREL, N.J.</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--InTest Corporation (NYSE American: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/INTT/\" title=\"View INTT stock overview\">INTT</a>), a global supplier of innovative test and process technology solutions for use in manufacturing and testing in key target markets which include semiconductor (“Semi”), Auto/EV, Defense/Aerospace, Industrial, Life Sciences, and Safety/Security, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter of 2025 ended December 31, 2025.</p><p>“Orders remained strong at <money><money>$37.5 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter as Auto/EV customers moved forward with new model year programs coupled with the success we are seeing with the diversification in Life Sciences. We continue to see improved customer spending sentiment across our increasingly diversified markets. As a result, our 2025 year-end backlog was a healthy <money><money>$53.9 million</money></money>, an increase of <percent>36%</percent> from December 31, 2024,” said Nick Grant, President and CEO.</p><p>“Revenue exceeded our guidance range and rebounded in the fourth quarter, reflecting the gradual recovery in customer capital spending we saw taking shape in the middle of the year, particularly in the Industrial and Defense/Aerospace end markets. We also benefited from the continued growing acceptance of new products and approximately <money><money>$2 million</money></money> in shipments which slipped out of the third quarter. Gross margin reached <percent>45.4%</percent>, driven by manufacturing efficiency initiatives undertaken over the course of 2025 and a lift from sales of new products at Alfamation and Acculogic. Notably, we achieved this quarter’s gross margin level despite the sluggishness of our historically significant Semi business,” added Mr. Grant.</p><p>“Operationally, we continued to execute on our Vision 2030 Strategy that centers on driving long-term value through innovation, customer diversity and a broader global presence. We believe the success of our market diversification strategy, which has delivered approximately <percent>20%</percent> compound average growth rate over the last five years, and our growing momentum with new products position InTest for sustainable profitable growth across multiple end markets.”</p><p><b>Fourth Quarter 2025 Review </b><i>(see revenue by market and by segments in accompanying

These non-GAAP financial measures consist of adjusted net earnings (loss), adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share (“<b><span class=\"bwuline\">adjusted EPS</span></b>”), adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin.</p><p>The Company defines these non-GAAP measures as follows:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Adjusted net earnings (loss) is derived by adding acquired intangible amortization, acquired inventory step-up expense, restructuring costs, and the tax effect of the adjusting items, to net earnings (loss).</li><li>Adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share is derived by dividing adjusted net earnings (loss) by diluted weighted average shares outstanding.</li><li>Adjusted EBITDA is derived by adding acquired intangible amortization, acquired inventory step-up expense, restructuring costs, net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, and stock-based compensation expense to net earnings.</li><li>Adjusted EBITDA margin is derived by dividing adjusted EBITDA by revenue.</li></ul><p>These results are provided as a complement to the results provided in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net earnings (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share (“adjusted EPS”) are non-GAAP financial measures presented to provide investors with meaningful, supplemental information regarding our baseline performance before acquired intangible amortization, restructuring costs and inventory step-up charges as management believes these expenses may not be indicative of our underlying operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures presented primarily as a measure of liquidity as they exclude non-cash charges for acquired intangible amortization, acquired inventory step-up, depreciation and stock-based compensation. In addition, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin also exclude the impact of restructuring costs, interest income or expense and income tax expense or benefit, as management believes these expenses may not be indicative of our underlying operating performance.</p><p><b>Management’s Use of Non-GAAP Measures</b></p><p>The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release are used by management to make operational decisions, to forecast future operational results, and for comparison with our business plan, historical operating results and the operating results of our peers. Reconciliations from net earnings (loss) and earnings (loss) per diluted share (“EPS”) to adjusted net earnings (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share (“adjusted EPS”) and from net earnings (loss) and net margin to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, are contained in the tables below.</p><p>Management believes these Non-GAAP financial measures are important in evaluating our performance, results of operations, and financial position. We use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business. Non-GAAP measures as presented in this press release may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.</p><p><b>Key Performance Indicators</b></p><p>In addition to the foregoing non-GAAP measures, management uses orders and backlog as key performance metrics to analyze and measure the Company’s financial performance and results of operations. Management uses orders and backlog as measures of current and future business and financial performance, and these may not be comparable with measures provided by other companies. Orders represent written communications received from customers requesting the Company to provide products and/or services. Backlog is calculated based on firm purchase orders we receive for which revenue has not yet been recognized. Management believes tracking orders and backlog are useful as they are often leading indicators of future performance. In accordance with industry practice, contracts may include provisions for cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the customer.</p><p>Given that each of orders and backlog are operational measures and that the Company’s methodology for calculating orders and backlog does not meet the definition of a non-GAAP measure, as that term is defined by the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Securities and Exchange Commission, a quantitative reconciliation for each is not required or provided.</p><p><b>Forward-Looking Statements</b></p><p>This press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.

New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.</p><p><b>NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES</b></p><p>Management uses \"adjusted net income\", \"adjusted earnings per share,\" \"adjusted segment net loss,\" \"segment earnings per share” and \"adjusted segment earnings per share,\" each of which are non-GAAP financial measures, when evaluating NW Natural Holdings' overall performance. Management uses non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential and performance for management by excluding certain expenses and charges that may not be indicative of our core business operating results and can affect the comparison of period-over-period results. These adjustments may include transaction and business development costs primarily consisting of professional fees including legal, accounting, financial and other professional fees incurred in connection with business combinations and business development activities. In addition to presenting the results of operations and earnings amounts in total, certain financial measures are expressed in cents per share, which are non-GAAP financial measures. All references to EPS are on the basis of diluted shares.</p><p>Such non-GAAP financial measures are used to analyze our financial performance because we believe they provide useful information to our investors and creditors in evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures calculated in accordance with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> GAAP. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of the business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than how such measures are calculated in this report, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided in the tables below.</p><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb

(NYSE:<a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/CRI/\" title=\"View CRI stock overview\">CRI</a>), North America’s largest and most-enduring apparel company exclusively for babies and young children, today reported its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025 results.</p><p>“Carter’s delivered improved fourth quarter results with each of our business segments posting sales growth over last year. We see momentum building behind our products and demand creation initiatives, which have driven an improvement in the rate of traffic, new customer acquisition, higher realized pricing, and increased penetration of the best portions of our product assortments. All of this gives us confidence that our strategies are gaining traction,” said Douglas C. Palladini, Chief Executive Officer &amp; President.</p><p>“2025 was a year of meaningful progress in stabilizing our business while responding to significant new tariffs. We took actions to right-size our cost structure and we launched several important initiatives to improve the productivity of our merchandise assortments and store fleet. We also strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity with the successful refinancing of our long-term debt and a new asset-based revolving credit facility in place.</p><p>“While we’re encouraged by our progress, much work remains. Excluding the recent tariff developments, for 2026 we’re planning growth in net sales as we build on the momentum of our product and demand creation strategies. We’re also planning growth in operating income. We will remain focused and disciplined in our investments and overall spending and expect solid contributions from productivity initiatives. We believe the recent news regarding tariffs will be net positive for Carter’s, but it will take some time to fully understand the implications for our business and the broader marketplace. Our talented and dedicated teams and I are committed to returning Carter’s to long-term sustainable, profitable growth over time.”</p><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl\"><tr><td class=\"bwvertalignt bwpadl0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"bwcellpmargin\">_______________________________</p><p class=\"bwcellpmargin\"><sup>1</sup> Refer to “Business Outlook” section of this release for additional information regarding 2026 tariff assumptions and reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures.</p></td></tr></table><p><b>53rd Week</b></p><p>The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the last day of December, resulting in an additional week of results every five to six years.

Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental financial measures that are not defined or prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for the items described in the footnotes (a) - (f) to the table above.</p><p>We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. These measures are used by the Company’s executive management to assess the Company’s performance.</p><p>The use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA instead of net income or cash flows from operations has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent net income or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by GAAP and do not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. While EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements, these terms are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us for working capital, debt service and other purposes.</p><table

The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that occurred between the comparative periods. Constant currency net sales results are calculated by translating current period net sales in local currency to the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> dollar amount by using the currency conversion rate for the prior comparative period. The Company consistently applies this approach to net sales for all countries where the functional currency is not the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> dollar. The Company believes that the presentation of net sales on a constant currency basis provides useful supplemental information regarding changes in our net sales that were not due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and such information is consistent with how the Company assesses changes in its net sales between comparative periods.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"></td><td

(TSXV: XXIX) (OTCQB: QCCUF) (FSE: 5LW0) (\"<b>XXIX</b>\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to report initial drill results from the Cooke Zone, located approximately 2 kilometres east of the Company's envisioned Opemiska open pit. These early results confirm that Cooke hosts meaningful gold-copper-silver mineralization and highlight the potential for Cooke to emerge as a satellite deposit capable of providing incremental mill feed to the broader Opemiska development concept.</p><p>Importantly, drilling completed to date has identified at least two parallel mineralized zones, intersected in every hole, supporting continuity and strengthening the case for systematic delineation. Cooke is a past-producing mine that currently has no NI 43-101 resource, making it a clear growth opportunity within the broader Opemiska district. Confirming two parallel mineralized zones in early drilling supports the potential to advance Cooke toward a maiden resource, which could translate into incremental, near-surface feed for the envisioned Opemiska operation. If delineated, Cooke could increase overall project scale, improve mine plan flexibility, and enhance development optionality as XXIX works toward the next Opemiska MRE and the project's PFS pathway. </p><p>\"These first holes at Cooke validate the opportunity to add high-value, near-surface ounces and copper to the broader Opemiska story,\" said Guy Le Bel, CEO of XXIX. \"Cooke is a past-producing area with clear room for growth. We're encouraged by the consistency of encountering two parallel zones and we plan to follow up with tighter-spaced drilling to advance Cooke toward a maiden resource.\"</p><p><b>Cooke Crown Pillar Drilling Program: Two Parallel Zones Confirmed</b></p><p>The Company expanded its initial Cooke drill program to target approximately 10,000 metres across the Cooke Zone and Saddle Zone (see news release dated December 8, 2025). The program focused on the near-surface crown pillar, designed to test and better define the previously interpreted North Zone and South Zone over an approximate 700-metre strike length.</p><p>Successful delineation of a mineralized crown pillar at Cooke has the potential to strengthen the overall Opemiska development plan as the Company advances the broader project toward an updated Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) intended to support a Preliminary Feasibility Study (PFS).</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/JkYe1H7OBj\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><b>Location of Cooke Drill Holes – Figure 1</b></a></p><p><b>Interpretation and Next Steps</b></p><p>Cooke appears to reflect a different mineralization style than the Springer and Perry zones that underpin the envisioned Opemiska open pit. Whereas Springer and Perry are characterized by larger, more continuous veins, mineralization at Cooke is interpreted to be hosted within two shear zones containing multiple smaller veins and veinlets, which can produce locally higher-grade (\"nuggety\") intersections and greater variability in grade and thickness. Within the Chibougamau copper zone, drilling intersected narrow, but high copper values as expected.  The Company believes these results justify a follow-up program with narrower drill spacing to support a potential maiden MRE at Cooke.</p><p>Table 1) Selected intersects from Chibougamau Cooke Gold Zone</p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 100%;

The Opemiska Project, one of Canada's highest-grade open pitable copper deposits, spans 21,333 hectares in Quebec's Chapais-Chibougamau region, with strong infrastructure and nearby access to the Horne Smelter. An October 2025 Preliminary Economic Assessment outlined a 12,500 tpd open pit operation over a 17-year mine life, generating an after-tax NPV8% of <money>$505M</money>, IRR of <percent>27.2%</percent>, and a 2.3-year payback period (<money>$4.35</money>/lb copper price, <money>$3,000</money>/oz gold price, <money>$30</money>/oz silver price). The Thierry Project hosts the K1 (near-surface) and the past-producing K2 (underground &amp; surface) zones (see XXIX news release dated October 1, 2024 for details regarding resources). Thierry has significant infrastructure in place including an all-season road, an airport within 5km, a provincial power grid within 8km, and nearby rail. With these two high-potential projects, the Company has solidified its position as a key player in the Canadian copper sector and has established itself as one of Eastern Canada's largest copper developer.</p><div id=\"contactInfo\"><p><b>For further information, please contact:</b></p><p>Guy Le Bel, Chief Executive Officer<br/>Phone: 514.654.8550<br/>Email: <a href=\"mailto:glebel@oregroup.ca\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">glebel@oregroup.ca</a> <br/><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/GzqeZC0V2x\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.xxix.ca</a> </p></div><p><b>Forward-Looking Statements</b></p><p>This news release contains certain forward-looking statements, including statements about the Company's belief that Opemiska has potential for continued growth, various cost, price and production assumptions used to inform the PEA, and outstanding risk factors, including Opemiska's proximity to the Town of Chapais, Historical Assay validation, Geotechnical considerations of open stopes in the eastern pit wall, the Venture sill, the Gwillim fault, host rock competency and Historical Stope Modeling.

The results are tabulated in <b>Table 1</b> and discussed below. Scorpio Gold has drilled 47 drill holes to date from its Phase Two diamond drilling program, 25MN-011 through 25MN-045, 26MN-046 through 26MN-056, and 26MN-048, for a grand total of <b>15,280 m</b>. With the results herein, Scorpio Gold has reported assays on 38 of these (25MN-011 through 25MN-045 and 26MN-046 through 26MN-048), totalling 11,907 m, and assays are pending from 9 holes (26MN-049 through 26MN-056 and 26MN-058), totalling 3,373 m. The pending results will be reported as they become available.</p><p>\"Hole 26MN-048 is a pivotal step-out at Goldwedge that confirms strong gold mineralization along the caldera margin, beyond the current Inferred Resource Constraining Pit. The 28.35 metre interval grading 1.25 g/t gold from 124.75 metres, along with the broader 49.23 metre interval higher in the hole, demonstrates vertical continuity within the Zanzibar Formation and validates our structural model targeting the faulted contact between caldera volcanics and sedimentary units. Importantly, the deeper intervals convert previously uncategorized mineralization, extends the system down-dip, reinforces the openness along strike of the faulted caldera contact, and the prospective nature of the caldera-hosted corridor for further resource expansion,\" stated Harrison Pokrandt, VP Exploration of Scorpio Gold.</p><p>\"These drill results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to advancing Manhattan and delivering meaningful updates to the market on a consistent cadence. With 47 holes completed in Phase Two and assays pending from additional step-outs, we remain committed to generating steady, high-quality technical results as we expand mineralization beyond the current resource footprint. Our objective is clear: build scale methodically and keep shareholders informed with regular, data-driven progress,\" commented Zayn Kalyan, CEO and Director of Scorpio Gold.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9779/285544_9f919869e4a09937_002full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

For the first time, the Company has consolidated Manhattan's past-producing mines under a single entity that holds valuable permitting and water rights. Historically, Manhattan has produced approximately 700,000 ounces of gold from high-grade placer and lode operations dating from the late 1890s through to the mid-2000s.¹ The maiden mineral resource estimate (the \"<b>Maiden MRE</b>\") covering the Goldwedge and Manhattan Pit areas of Manhattan is comprised of 18,343,000 tonnes grading 1.26 g/t gold for a total of 740,000 oz contained gold in the inferred category.² </p><p>A historical mineral resource estimate (the \"<b>Historical MRE</b>\") covers the Black Mammoth, April Fool, Hooligan, Keystone, and Jumbo areas of Manhattan and comprises 1,652,325 tonnes grading 5.89 g/t gold for a total of 303,949 oz contained gold.³ The deposit is interpreted as a low-sulfidation, epithermal, gold-rich system situated adjacent to the Tertiary-aged Manhattan caldera in the Southern Toquima Range of Nevada. A \"Qualified Person\" as defined in National Instrument 43-101 - <i>Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects</i> (\"<b>NI 43-101</b>\") has not done sufficient work to make the Historical MRE current, and the Company is not treating the Historical MRE as current. </p><p><b><font style=\"font-size: 11px;\">Notes</font></b></p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li><font style=\"font-size: 11px;\"><i><b>Adjacent Properties:</b> The Company has no interest in, or rights to, any of the adjacent properties mentioned, including the Round Mountain Gold Mine, and exploration results on adjacent properties are not necessarily indicative of mineralization on the Company's properties.

These results follow the Company's February 25, 2026 release, which demonstrated continuous stock-hosted mineralization over a 1.7 km east-west trend, complementing this significant expansion by further extending mineralization over 500 m south of the Babine porphyry stock.  </p><p>Hole NAK25-80 delivered a standout interval of 618 m averaging <percent>0.77%</percent> copper equivalent (CuEq) from surface. This result confirms strong continuity within the South Zone high-grade core and further supports the concept of a large, coherent mineralized body extending from surface to significant depth, building on prior long-interval drilling in the South Zone (including NAK25-78: 802 m of <percent>0.71%</percent> CuEq from surface).</p><p>Importantly, step-out drilling to the east (NAK25-73, NAK25-75, and NAK25-79) indicates a connected mineralized corridor along the southern margin of the Babine porphyry stock that can now be traced for at least ~750 m eastward from the South Zone/Main Zone area, and ~500 m to the south. This materially increases the mineralized footprint of the South Zone and leaves the corridor open to further expansion to the east and south.</p><p>Together, the February 25 district-scale breakthrough, highlighted by NAK25-70's 901 m of <percent>0.43%</percent> CuEq from surface, and today's South Zone results reinforce a clear growth pathway at NAK: advance the higher-grade South Zone as the near-term core, while systematically expanding and vectoring within a much larger, newly demonstrated mineralized system.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/OARZ3s2DPX\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><b>View NAK Section Map and 3D Model Incorporating February 27 Results</b></a> </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/PqE1LCgAKe\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><b>View Plan Map of Reported Holes</b></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/wE4nWcB01g\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><b>Watch Video Discussing February 27 Results</b></a></p><p><u><b>NAK25-80</b></u></p><p>NAK25-80 was drilled from near the western boundary of the high-grade historical Gold or \"Stockwork Zone\", which was further expanded by the Company in drilling between 2022 and 2025.  The drill hole was collared into rocks of the Babine biotite feldspar porphyry stock, which hosts mineralized stockwork to a depth of 142 m. This interval returned strong gold grades and strongly anomalous copper from surface (101 m of 0.68 g/t Au, 0.14 % Cu). Below 142 m, and down to a depth of 659 meters, the hole intersected sandstone and conglomerate that were intruded by mafic dykes, with mineralization becoming increasingly copper-rich. The mineralization features localized zones of conglomerate clast replacement chalcopyrite and bornite, along with variably dense disseminations, and these are interspersed with quartz-anhydrite veins that host coarse aggregates of bornite and, in some places, molybdenite.  </p><p><u><b>NAK25-80 Assay Results (Table 1)*</b></u></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 100%;

Drill core is halved on site, and samples are submitted to ALS Geochemistry in Langley, British Columbia for preparation and analysis. ALS is accredited to the ISO/IEC 17025 standard for assays. All analytical methods include quality control standards inserted at set frequencies. The entire sample interval is crushed and homogenized, and 250 g of the homogenized sample is pulped. All samples were analyzed for gold, silver, copper, molybdenum and a suite of 45 other major and trace elements. Analysis for gold is by fire assay fusion followed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) on 30 g of pulp. Analysis for silver, copper, and molybdenum and all other major and trace elements are analyzed by four-acid digestion followed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS). </p><p>Internal QA/QC protocols dictate that individual core samples are no less than 70 cm and no greater than 3 m in length. To control standard, blank, and duplicate sample frequency, and to better constrain pass/fail re-analysis intervals, samples are submitted to the lab in 50 sample batches. Within each 50-sample batch, there is one gold-copper standard and two coarse reject duplicates, inserted at regular intervals, and two blank samples, inserted sequentially following well-mineralized samples where possible, for a total of <percent>10%</percent> QA/QC samples. All gold and copper standard analyses from the 2024 program passed within 3 standard deviations of expected values. Where duplicate values differed significantly, the lower values from the resulting re-analyses were used.</p><p><b> About American Eagle's NAK Project</b></p><p>The NAK Project lies within the Babine copper-gold porphyry district of central British Columbia. It has excellent infrastructure through all-season roads and is close to the towns of Smithers, Houston, and Burns Lake, B.C., which lie along a major rail line and Provincial Highway 16. Historical drilling and geophysical, geological, and geochemical work at NAK, which began in the 1960's, tested only to shallow depths. Still, the work revealed a very large near-surface copper-gold system that measures over 1.5 km x 1.5 km. Drilling completed by American Eagle in 2022, 2023, and 2024 returned significant intervals of high-grade copper-gold mineralization that reached beyond and much deeper than the historical drilling, indicating that zones of near-surface and deeper mineralization, locally with considerably higher grades, exist within the broader NAK property mineralizing system. American Eagle Gold completed an aggressive 31,500 metre drill program in 2025 designed to expand and improve the mineral footprint; assays are currently being received.   </p><p>For the latest videos from American Eagle, Ore Group, and all things mining, subscribe to our YouTube Channel: <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/WAV10sMabZ\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">youtube.com/@theoregroup</a></p><p><b>About American Eagle Gold Corp.</b><br/><br/>American Eagle is dedicated to advancing its NAK copper-gold porphyry project in west-central British Columbia, Canada.

Importantly, demand across our higher‑value, premium brands remains resilient, and our diversified product portfolio continues to position us well to navigate an uncertain consumer environment.\"</p><p>Griffin continued, \"As we enter 2026, we are shifting our focus to drive growth while maintaining the operational discipline that delivered our strong performance in 2025. During the fourth quarter we completed the acquisition of AllCornhole, further expanding our presence in a premium, fast‑growing category, and we acquired a 110,000 square foot facility to support growth in our safety and fitness categories. In addition, we completed the integration of the Gold Tip Archery acquisition, which closed in the third quarter and was immediately accretive during the fourth quarter.\"</p><p>\"Our shift to focus on growth is supported by a strong balance sheet and a continued focus on capital efficiency,\" Griffin added. \"In the fourth quarter, we improved our cash flow <percent>21.2%</percent> and reduced our total debt by <percent>27.9%</percent>, resulting in net leverage of 0.3x. Reflecting the confidence we have in the long‑term cash‑generation profile of the business, our Board has approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to <money><money>$0.15</money>25</money> per share.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><strong>Nature Medicine Accepts Manuscript Highlighting Clinical Results from the Company’s Glioblastoma Trial</strong></p><p align=\"justify\">MILAN, Feb.  27, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Genenta Science S.p.A. (Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/GNTA/\" title=\"View GNTA stock overview\">GNTA</a>) in transformation to Saentra Forge (Nasdaq: SAEN), a strategic industrial consolidator focused on biotech, defense, aerospace, and national-security-related technologies, today announced the appointment of <strong>Paolo Salvato</strong> to the <strong>Board of Directors of ATC</strong>, a manufacturer of tactical defense systems representing the Company’s initial entry into defense technology manufacturing. The Company also provided an update on its ongoing evaluation of majority-control acquisition opportunities in regulated national-security sectors.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Mr. Salvato previously served as Chief Executive Officer of <strong>Fiocchi Munizioni</strong> S.p.A. (<strong>CSG Group)</strong>, where he led operational strengthening, international growth initiatives, and strategic positioning within the global defense ecosystem. He brings more than two decades of experience across defense industrial operations, with expertise spanning manufacturing execution, export markets, supply chain management, and regulatory compliance. Prior to Fiocchi Munizioni, he served as Chief Executive Officer of <strong>Thales Italia,</strong> and he held senior leadership roles at <strong>Leonardo</strong> S.p.A., deepening his experience across the European defense and aerospace ecosystem.</p> <p align=\"justify\">As part of its broader strategic transition into Saentra Forge, the Company continues to evaluate <strong>selected acquisition opportunities in the national-security regulated sectors</strong><sup>1</sup>, with the object of building a next-generation strategic industrial consolidator of tech and scale-up companies. Management, now supported by Paolo Salvato, is reviewing potential targets that align with its capital allocation framework, focusing on <strong>profitable</strong>, <strong>majority-controlled</strong>, <strong>privately-held</strong> industrial businesses.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Acquired companies will be able to benefit from additional financial flexibility to support disciplined growth, as the Company may access the U.S. public capital markets through the Company’s Nasdaq listing, subject to market conditions and applicable regulatory requirements. This is further complemented by the strategic network of <strong>Fondazione Praexidia</strong><sup>2</sup>, intended to support the development of institutional relationships and industrial partnerships.</p> <p align=\"justify\">On the biotech side, the Company today announced that <strong>Nature Medicine</strong> has accepted for publication a manuscript describing key clinical findings from its Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) trial. The publication is expected in the coming weeks, subject to the journal’s schedule, and represents an important validation of the Company’s scientific and clinical work.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Pierluigi Paracchi</strong>, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our transformation reflects a deliberate response to evolving market dynamics and long-term industrial opportunities. We believe advanced biotechnology and defense-related technologies increasingly intersect in areas of national resilience and strategic industrial capability, as evidenced by initiatives such as the <strong>NATO Innovation Fund</strong> and investment strategies of frontier-focused firms.”</p> <p align=\"justify\">“Our <strong>biotech</strong> program has reached clinical maturity, where a strategic partnership represents the most efficient path to advance development and maximize its long-term potential. Pursuing combination or registrational studies independently would require substantial additional capital and increase risk exposure. We are therefore evaluating potential partnership opportunities that could provide development expertise, shared risk, and capital support.”</p> <p align=\"justify\">“In parallel, we maintain <strong>financial resources</strong> to execute our industrial aggregation strategy. We are focused on acquiring profitable industrial scale-ups with positive EBITDA. As a publicly listed company, we believe we are well positioned to acquire privately held businesses at <strong>private market valuations</strong> and integrate them within a transparent, listed platform built for operational scale and long-term value creation.”</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>About: </strong>Genenta Science (Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/GNTA/\" title=\"View GNTA stock overview\">GNTA</a>), which will be renamed as Saentra Forge (Nasdaq: SAEN, pending effectiveness), will be a next-generation strategic consolidator focused on privately held specialized companies operating in Italian national security regulated sectors, with activities spanning cybersecurity, defense, aerospace, and biotechnology/biosecurity.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Non-GAAP Information. </strong>This release includes EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><div class=\"xn-content\"><p><span class=\"legendSpanClass\"><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.hayard\">HAYWARD, Calif.</location></span>, <span class=\"legendSpanClass\">Feb. 26, 2026</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/UCTT/\" title=\"View UCTT stock overview\">UCTT</a>) today announced the pricing of its offering of <money><money>$525.0 million</money></money> aggregate principal amount of <percent>0.00%</percent> convertible senior notes due 2031 (the \"notes\") in a private offering to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). The offering size was increased from the previously announced offering size of <money><money>$400.0 million</money></money> aggregate principal amount of notes. The issuance and sale of the notes are scheduled to settle on March 3, 2026, subject to customary closing conditions. Ultra Clean also granted the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a period of 13 days from, and including, the date the notes are first issued, up to an additional <money><money>$75.0 million</money></money> principal amount of notes.</p><div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1\"><p><a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/582701/Ultra_Clean_Holdings_Logo.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"(PRNewsfoto/Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc.)\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/582701/Ultra_Clean_Holdings_Logo.jpg\" title=\"(PRNewsfoto/Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc.)\"/></a></p></div><p>Ultra Clean estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately <money><money>$511.1 million</money></money> (or approximately <money><money>$584.2 million</money></money> if the initial purchasers fully exercise their option to purchase additional notes), after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. Ultra Clean intends to use the net proceeds from the offering as follows:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>approximately <money><money>$21.9 million</money></money> of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the cost of entering into the capped call transactions described below;</li><li>approximately <money><money>$40.0 million</money></money> of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase 672,608 shares of its common stock; and</li><li>the remainder for working capital, prepayment of a portion of the company's outstanding term loan under its amended and restated credit agreement or other general corporate purposes.</li></ul><p>If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, then Ultra Clean intends to use a portion of the additional net proceeds to fund the cost of entering into additional capped call transactions, as described below, and the remainder for the purposes described above.</p><p>The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Ultra Clean. The notes will not bear regular interest and the principal amount of the notes will not accrete. The notes will mature on March 15, 2031, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Before December 16, 2030, noteholders will have the right to convert their notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after December 16, 2030, noteholders may convert their notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. Ultra Clean will settle conversions in cash and, if applicable, shares of its common stock. The initial conversion rate is 11.8001 shares of common stock per <money><money>$1,000</money></money> principal amount of notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately <money><money>$84.75</money></money> per share of common stock. The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately <percent>42.5%</percent> over the last reported sale price of <money><money>$59.47</money></money> per share of Ultra Clean's common stock on February 26, 2026. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. If a \"make-whole fundamental change\" (as defined in the indenture for the notes) occurs, then Ultra Clean will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a specified period of time for holders who convert their notes in connection with that make-whole fundamental change.</p><p>The notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations), for cash at Ultra Clean's option at any time, and from time to time, on or after March 20, 2029 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of Ultra Clean's common stock exceeds <percent>130%</percent> of the conversion price for a specified period of time and certain other conditions are satisfied. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest and additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. If Ultra Clean calls any or all notes for redemption, then holders of notes called for redemption may convert their notes during the related redemption conversion period, and such conversions will also constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to the notes so converted.</p><p>If a \"fundamental change\" (as defined in the indenture for the notes) occurs, then, subject to a limited exception, noteholders may require Ultra Clean to repurchase their notes for cash. The repurchase price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest and additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date.</p><p>In connection with the pricing of the notes, Ultra Clean entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates and certain other financial institutions (the \"option counterparties\"). The capped call transactions will cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the notes, the number of shares of Ultra Clean's common stock initially underlying the notes. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Ultra Clean expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties.</p><p>The cap price of the capped call transactions will initially be <money><money>$104.07</money>25</money> per share, which represents a premium of <percent>75.0%</percent> over the last reported sale price of Ultra Clean's common stock of <money><money>$59.47</money></money> per share on February 26, 2026, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions.</p><p>The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to Ultra Clean's common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or offset any potential cash payments Ultra Clean is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, upon conversion of the notes. If, however, the market price per share of Ultra Clean's common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions.</p><p>Ultra Clean has been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Ultra Clean's common stock and/or purchase shares of Ultra Clean's common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Ultra Clean's common stock or the notes at that time.</p><p>In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Ultra Clean's common stock and/or purchasing or selling Ultra Clean's common stock or other securities of Ultra Clean in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and (x) are likely to do so during the relevant valuation period under the capped call transactions and (y) are likely to do so following any early conversion or repurchase of the notes by Ultra Clean, if Ultra Clean elects to unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions in connection with such early conversion or repurchase). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Ultra Clean's common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the number of shares of common stock and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes.</p><p>Concurrently with the pricing of the notes, Ultra Clean entered into privately negotiated transactions with or through one of the initial purchasers of the notes in this offering to use approximately <money><money>$40.0 million</money></money> of the net proceeds from the notes offering to repurchase shares of Ultra Clean's common stock at a purchase price of <money><money>$59.47</money></money> per share. These share repurchases could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Ultra Clean's common stock or the notes, and could result in a higher effective conversion price for the notes. The offering of the notes is not contingent upon the repurchase of any common stock.</p><p>The offer and sale of the notes and any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, and the notes and any such shares cannot be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, the notes or any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, nor will there be any sale of the notes or any such shares, in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, sale or solicitation would be unlawful.</p><p><b>Forward-Looking Statements</b></p><p>This press release includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the completion of the offering and the share repurchases, the expected amount and intended use of the net proceeds and the effects of entering into the capped call transactions described above. Forward-looking statements represent Ultra Clean's current expectations regarding future events and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied by the forward-looking statements. Among those risks and uncertainties are market conditions, the satisfaction of the closing conditions related to the offering and risks relating to Ultra Clean's business, including those described in periodic reports that Ultra Clean files from time to time with the SEC. Ultra Clean may not consummate the offering described in this press release and, if the offering is consummated, cannot provide any assurances regarding its ability to effectively apply the net proceeds as described above. The forward-looking statements included in this press release speak only as of the date of this press release, and Ultra Clean does not undertake to update the statements included in this press release for subsequent developments, except as may be required by law.</p><p><b>Contact</b></p><p>Rhonda Bennetto<br/>SVP Investor Relations<br/><a href=\"mailto:rbennetto@uct.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">rbennetto@uct.com</a></p><p>SOURCE Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc.</p></div></article>",

Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “project,” “potential,” “seek,” “should,” “think,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions, or they may use future dates. In addition, forward-looking statements in this press release include, without limitation statements regarding: the Proposed Transaction; the Company’s strategies, objectives, business opportunities and plans; anticipated future growth and trends in the Company’s business or key markets and business outlook; return of capital to shareholders (including through the payment of recurring quarterly cash dividends or repurchase of shares of the Company’s common stock); projections of future financial condition, operating results or other financial items; and other characterizations of future events or circumstances as well as other statements that are not statements of historical fact. Forward-looking statements are based on the Company’s current expectations and assumptions regarding its business, the economy and other future conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions, risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, and readers are therefore cautioned that actual results could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially include: the inability to consummate the Proposed Transaction within the anticipated time period, or at all, due to any reason, including the failure to obtain shareholder approval to adopt the transaction agreement, the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals for the Proposed Transaction or the failure to satisfy the other conditions to the consummation of the Proposed Transaction; the risk that the transaction agreement may be terminated in circumstances requiring the Company to pay a termination fee; the risk that the Proposed Transaction disrupts the Company’s current plans and operations or diverts management’s attention from its ongoing business; the effect of the announcement of the Proposed Transaction on the ability of the Company to retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with its customers, suppliers and others with whom it does business; the effect of the announcement of the Proposed Transaction on the Company’s operating results and business generally; the significant costs, fees and expenses related to the Proposed Transaction; the risk that the Company’s stock price may decline significantly if the Proposed Transaction is not consummated; the nature, cost and outcome of any litigation and other legal proceedings, including any such proceedings related to the Proposed Transaction and instituted against the Company and/or its directors, executive officers or other related persons; changes in national, regional and local economic and market conditions (including a continued shutdown of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> government); legislative and regulatory matters; increases in gaming taxes and fees in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates; litigation; increased competition; reliance on key personnel; the Company’s ability to comply with covenants in its debt instruments; terrorist incidents; natural disasters; severe weather conditions; the effects of environmental and structural building conditions; the effects of disruptions to the Company’s information technology and other systems and infrastructure; factors affecting the gaming, entertainment and hospitality industries generally; and other risks and uncertainties discussed in the Company’s filings with the SEC (including in the proxy statement that the Company intends to file with the SEC in connection with the Proposed Transaction), including the “Risk Factors” sections of the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. All forward-looking statements in this press release are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.</p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">Non-GAAP Financial Measures</span></b></p><p>To supplement the Company’s consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location> generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA because it is the primary metric used by its chief operating decision maker and investors in measuring both the Company’s past and future expectations of performance. Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to the users of the Company’s financial statements by excluding specific expenses and gains that the Company believes are not indicative of its core operating results. Further, the Company’s annual performance plan used to determine compensation for its executive officers and employees is tied to the Adjusted EBITDA metric.

(NASDAQ: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/GPRO/\" title=\"View GPRO stock overview\">GPRO</a>) today announced that the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> International Trade Commission (ITC) has upheld the administrative law judge's earlier ruling that Insta360 imported and sold products in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> that infringe on GoPro's intellectual property. This marks a significant reaffirmation of GoPro's design patent rights following the initial determination issued on July 11, 2025.</p><div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1\"><p><a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2448228/GoPro_Almost_Black_Logo.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"GoPro (PRNewsfoto/GoPro, Inc.)\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2448228/GoPro_Almost_Black_Logo.jpg\" title=\"GoPro (PRNewsfoto/GoPro, Inc.)\"/></a></p></div><p>The ITC confirmed that Insta360's action camera products infringe GoPro's design patent for its iconic HERO camera, reinforcing the integrity of GoPro's visual identity in the marketplace. The ITC issued a Limited Exclusion Order to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Customs and Border Protection to prevent further importation of Insta360's infringing products, as well as a Cease and Desist Order to Insta360 prohibiting further importation, sale, and marketing of Insta360's infringing products. The Orders will be effective after Presidential Review.</p><p>The ITC's finding of design patent infringement comes on the heels of several decisions from the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) late last year, which upheld the validity of multiple GoPro utility patents. The PTAB rejected three separate Insta360 challenges to patents covering GoPro's ground-breaking HyperSmooth technology.<br/><br/>GoPro's intellectual property enforcement campaign, including recent positive rulings from the PTAB reaffirming the validity of GoPro's patents, reinforces the strength of GoPro's intellectual property portfolio and highlights GoPro's long-standing record of category-defining innovation, supported by more than 1,500 <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> patents.<br/><br/>\"Innovation is at the heart of everything we do at GoPro. When competitors imitate instead of innovate, we have no choice but to take action to ensure creators everywhere benefit from products built on original ideas, not imitation,\" said Nicholas Woodman, GoPro's founder and CEO. \"By protecting our intellectual property, we can keep pushing boundaries and delivering the industry-leading, breakthrough experiences customers expect from GoPro.\"</p><p><b>About GoPro, Inc.
