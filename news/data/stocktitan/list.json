The webcast will be archived on the website following the completion of the call.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">To supplement the financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, this earnings release presents Adjusted EBITDA, which the Company defines as net loss before depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, interest expense, taxes, share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related costs, restructuring costs, customer credit loss, litigation costs, and debt extinguishment loss. Non-GAAP financial measures such as Adjusted EBITDA are presented in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company’s operating performance and trends, as well as for making planning decisions. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps to identify underlying trends in the Company’s business that may otherwise be masked by the effect of the income and expenses and other items that it excludes in its calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. Accordingly, the Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company’s operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by the Company’s management in their financial and operational decision-making. The Company also presents this non-GAAP financial measure because it believes investors, analysts and rating agencies consider it to be a useful metric in measuring the Company’s performance against other companies and its ability to meet its debt service obligations.</p> <p align=\"justify\">There are limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures such as Adjusted EBITDA because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may exclude significant income and expenses required by GAAP to be recognized in the Company’s financial statements, and may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Company encourages investors to carefully consider its results under GAAP, as well as its supplemental non-GAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand its business. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results is presented below.</p> <p align=\"justify\">*A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net loss on a forward-looking basis is not available without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the items excluded from this non-GAAP measure.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">This press release and statements made during the Company’s earnings call contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the Company’s: 2026 full-year guidance; anticipated liquidity; 2026 Adjusted EBITDA guidance; expected 2026 cash usage decrease; anticipated restoration of revenue growth in the back half of the year; expected increase in product adoptions; continued execution of strategic initiatives; anticipated market position, growth rates and profitability improvement; ability to effectively respond to and mitigate the impact of challenges in the current market environment, including in response to increased competition, evolving surgeon and patient preferences for minimally invasive bunion solutions, changes in tariff and trade policies, protracted government shutdowns, lower patient demand for elective bunion surgery due to macroeconomic uncertainty or soft consumer sentiment; anticipated future product launches and the timing of such product launches; ability to increase procedure volumes, expand surgeon relationships and utilization rate, and increase procedure penetration and market share; sufficiency of its balance sheet to continue executing strategic and growth initiatives for the foreseeable future; anticipated expansion of clinical evidence; ability to protect and enforce its intellectual property rights, including through its patent infringement and unfair competition suits; success in defending against securities class actions and infringement of its intellectual property by third parties, including its competitors; expected seasonality; ability to leverage investments in its commercial organization and control costs in its organizational structure, the amount and timing of orders for our products from stocking distributors and other customers; and anticipated pace of growth in the foot and ankle market. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current assumptions and expectations of future events and trends, which affect or may affect the Company’s business, strategy, operations or financial performance, and actual results and other events may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements due to numerous risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified. Factors that could cause actual results or other events to differ materially from those contemplated in this press release can be found in the Risk Factors section of Treace’s public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025, which was filed with the SEC on February 27, 2026. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. These forward-looking statements speak only as of their date and, except to the extent required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements, whether as a result of any new information, future developments or otherwise. The Company’s results for the year ended December 31, 2025, are not necessarily indicative of its operating results for any future periods.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Internet Posting of Information</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">Treace routinely posts information that may be important to investors in the “Investor Relations” section of its website at <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=c0OAFtKosUKW6OsSxVTwEwY7obOiS7SKNPmzJ-_UVPErzN3Blf4FVudhuaaVx5-UDOeoe_5vxgMezvaMRWeFfErL_9RKAO0FJpfOXJxHQJI=\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>www.treace.com</u></a>.

IBC's consolidated loss of <money>$1.2 million</money> for the six-month period ended December 31, 2025, was lower compared to the same prior-year period, largely due to higher sales revenue in the current period and reduced costs related to the closure of the EM Division's Massachusetts plant.</i></p></li></ul><p><strong id=\"dateline\">FRANKLIN, IN / <a href=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ACCESS Newswire</a> / February 27, 2026 / </strong>IBC Advanced Alloys Corp. (\"<strong>IBC</strong>\" or the \"<strong>Company</strong>\")<strong> (TSXV:IB)(OTCQB:IAALF)</strong> announces its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.</p><p>Stronger demand for IBC copper alloy products boosted revenue in the quarter YOY by <percent>36.6%</percent> in IBC's Copper Alloys Division. Prior quarters saw softer demand largely due to market uncertainty in the application of the U.S. Government's planned copper tariffs. Now that these tariffs have been implemented, product demand appears to be strengthening. The Division also posted gains in the quarter in operating income, Adjusted EBITDA, gross profit, and gross margin over the comparable prior-year period.</p><p>Consolidated loss in the quarter of <money>$480,000</money> narrowed YOY from a loss of <money>$1.4 million</money> in the comparative period, largely driven by higher copper alloys sales revenue and reduced costs at the company's Engineered Materials division, which was closed in 2024.</p><p>\"We saw strong signs of demand recovery in our second fiscal quarter almost across the board in copper alloy products, and those gains appear to be continuing into the current quarter,\" said Mark A. Smith, CEO and Executive Chairman of IBC. \"Additionally, we continue to explore opportunities for sales of aluminum-scandium alloys, which we successfully began producing in October 2025. We see that market growing significantly as the prospect of the first-ever domestic scandium production in the U.S. appears increasingly likely to launch in the near future.\"</p><p><strong>Selected

(NASDAQ:<a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/MRNA/\" title=\"View MRNA stock overview\">MRNA</a>) today announced that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a <a href=\"https://pr.report/j46d\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">positive opinion</a> recommending marketing authorization in the European Union for mCOMBRIAX<sup>®</sup> (mRNA-1083), Moderna's combination vaccine indicated for active immunization for the prevention of influenza and COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 50 years of age and older.</p><p>\"The CHMP's positive opinion represents an important milestone for respiratory virus vaccination and for Moderna, with the introduction of the world's first flu plus COVID combination vaccine. If approved, this would be Moderna's fourth marketed product in Europe,\" said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. \"Combination vaccines have the potential to simplify vaccination and support improved health outcomes. We appreciate the EMA's rigorous scientific review.\"</p><p>mCOMBRIAX builds on the advances of mNEXSPIKE<sup>®</sup>, Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine, and mRNA-1010, Moderna's investigational seasonal influenza vaccine, which has been accepted for review in the United States, the European Union, Canada and Australia.</p><p>The CHMP opinion is supported by results from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3s6\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">NCT06097273</a>), a randomized, observer-blind, active-controlled study evaluating the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mRNA-1083 in two independent age cohorts of approximately 4,000 adults each. One cohort included adults 65 years of age and older and compared mRNA-1083 to co-administered Fluzone HD<sup>®</sup> (licensed in the European Union as Efluelda<sup>®</sup>), a high-dose influenza vaccine, and Spikevax<sup>®</sup>, Moderna's licensed COVID-19 vaccine. The second cohort included adults 50 to 64 years of age and compared mRNA-1083 to co-administered Fluarix<sup>®</sup>, a standard-dose influenza vaccine, and Spikevax.</p><p>All primary endpoints demonstrating the non-inferiority of immune responses were met. Following a single dose, mRNA-1083 elicited statistically significantly higher immune responses against three influenza virus strains (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B/Victoria) and against SARS-CoV-2 in both age cohorts. The B/Yamagata strain, which is no longer recommended for inclusion in seasonal influenza vaccines, was the only strain for which a statistically significantly higher immune response was not observed for adults 65 years of age and older compared to the co-administered licensed comparator vaccines.<sup>[1]</sup></p><p>mRNA-1083 demonstrated an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. The majority of solicited adverse reactions were grade 1 or 2 in severity and consistent with the licensed vaccines used in the trial.</p><p>Following the CHMP's positive opinion, the European Commission will consider the recommendation and is expected to adopt a final decision on marketing authorization. Once the European Commission approves a product, the marketing authorization is valid in all EU Member States as well as in the European Economic Area (EEA) countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Upon European Commission approval, Moderna will work with national regulatory and health authorities to support local access and implementation.</p><p><strong>About Moderna</strong></p><p>Moderna is a pioneer and leader in the field of mRNA medicine.

(\"Dark Star\") to terminate the previously announced purchase agreement dated <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/y4vnNhbZqZ\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">August 7, 2025</a> (the \"Agreement\") relating to the proposed sale of the Company's Namibia assets (the \"Namibia Assets\").</p><p>The Namibia Assets include the Company's interests in the Khan and Cobra uranium projects, located in Namibia's highly prospective Erongo uranium province. Namibia is a well-established mining jurisdiction and one of the world's top uranium-producing countries according to the <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/1KQ8wuRbLX\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">World Nuclear Association</a>, with the Erongo region hosting several operating mines. The Namibia Assets provide exposure to both uranium and copper potential in a jurisdiction with a long history of mineral development.</p><p>The Agreement has been terminated by mutual consent. As part of the termination and unwind, Critical One has agreed to return 14,200,000 common shares of Dark Star previously issued to the Company. No termination fees or other material penalties are payable by either party. In addition, Duane Parnham, Founder, Executive Chairman and CEO of Critical One, has terminated his advisory role with Dark Star effective immediately.</p><p>\"The mutual termination of this agreement was the right outcome for Critical One and our shareholders. With copper and uranium markets continuing to attract renewed pricing strength and investor attention, regaining full control of the Namibia Assets restores meaningful flexibility at the right time,\" said Parnham. \"Our focus remains firmly on the <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/A8qaKFpvWp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Howells Lake Antimony-Gold Project</a> (\"Howells Lake Project\") as we prepare to commence our maiden drill program following the recent approval of an <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/ZEjQ1HMzwp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">exploration permit</a>, and we see real opportunity to responsibly maximize the value of our broader portfolio of critical metals for shareholders.\"</p><p>Critical One's priority remains advancing the Howells Lake Project in the Thunder Bay Mining District of Ontario, Canada. Located approximately 120 kilometres (km) west of the Ring of Fire, Ontario's multi-billion-dollar infrastructure development, the Howells Lake Project is strategically positioned to contribute to Canada's critical minerals strategy, reducing reliance on foreign supplies amid growing global demand and constrained supply. </p><p>The Company intends to pursue the optionality created by the return of the Namibia Assets in a manner that complements its planned program at the Howells Lake Project. </p><p>Critical One will provide further updates as its plan for the Namibia Assets is formalized.</p><p><b>About Critical One Energy Inc.</b></p><p><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/anBO1sMP8X\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Critical One Energy Inc.</a> is a forward-focused critical minerals and upstream energy company, powering the future of clean energy and advanced technologies.

Total net sales declined <percent>2.2%</percent> on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, primarily due to uneven consumer demand across the majority of the Company's product categories, partially offset by improved demand in the archery, billiards, and games categories.</p><p>Escalade reported fourth quarter gross margin of <percent>27.7%</percent>, an increase of 280 basis points versus the prior-year quarter, driven by improved operational efficiencies from lower fixed costs and decreased inventory storage and handling costs.</p><p>Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") increased <percent>9.3%</percent> to <money><money>$6.5 million</money></money> in the fourth quarter 2025, versus <money><money>$5.9 million</money></money> in the prior-year period. The increase in EBITDA compared to the fourth quarter of 2024 primarily reflects improved gross margins and the impact of the Gold Tip acquisition, partly offset by <money><money>$0.5 million</money></money> in non-recurring executive transition expenses.</p><p>During the fourth quarter of 2025, the Company generated <money><money>$14.9 million</money></money> of cash flow from operations, compared to <money><money>$12.3 million</money></money> in the prior-year period.

At the end of the fourth quarter 2025, net debt (total debt less cash) was 0.3x trailing twelve-month EBITDA, down from 0.8x at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024.</p><p>Escalade announced a quarterly dividend of <money><money>$0.15</money>25</money> per share to be paid to all shareholders of record on April 6, 2026 and payable April 13, 2026.</p><p><b>MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY</b></p><p>\"We concluded 2025 with strong margin performance, driven by disciplined operational execution across the business,\" said Patrick Griffin, Interim President and CEO of Escalade. \"Fourth‑quarter margins reflect the cost structure improvements implemented over the last year. Importantly, demand across our higher‑value, premium brands remains resilient, and our diversified product portfolio continues to position us well to navigate an uncertain consumer environment.\"</p><p>Griffin continued, \"As we enter 2026, we are shifting our focus to drive growth while maintaining the operational discipline that delivered our strong performance in 2025. During the fourth quarter we completed the acquisition of AllCornhole, further expanding our presence in a premium, fast‑growing category, and we acquired a 110,000 square foot facility to support growth in our safety and fitness categories. In addition, we completed the integration of the Gold Tip Archery acquisition, which closed in the third quarter and was immediately accretive during the fourth quarter.\"</p><p>\"Our shift to focus on growth is supported by a strong balance sheet and a continued focus on capital efficiency,\" Griffin added. \"In the fourth quarter, we improved our cash flow <percent>21.2%</percent> and reduced our total debt by <percent>27.9%</percent>, resulting in net leverage of 0.3x. Reflecting the confidence we have in the long‑term cash‑generation profile of the business, our Board has approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to <money><money>$0.15</money>25</money> per share. Looking ahead, we remain focused on driving working capital efficiencies and we intend to deploy our strong free cash flow toward organic growth investments, strategic M&amp;A, continued debt reduction, and a disciplined return of capital to shareholders.\"</p><p><b>CONFERENCE CALL</b></p><p>A conference call will be held Friday, February 27, 2026, at 11:00 a.m. ET to review the Company's financial results, discuss recent events and conduct a question-and-answer session.</p><p>A webcast of the conference call and accompanying presentation materials will be available in the Investor Relations section of Escalade's website at <a href=\"http://www.escaladeinc.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.escaladeinc.com</a>.  To listen to a live broadcast, go to the site at least 15 minutes prior to the scheduled start time in order to register, download, and install any necessary audio software.</p><p>To participate in the live teleconference:</p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tr><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Domestic Live:</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">1-833-890-3250</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>International Live:</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">1-412-206-6441</span></p></td></tr></table></div><p>To listen to a replay of the teleconference, which subsequently will be available through March 13, 2026:</p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tr><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Domestic Replay:</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">1-844-512-2921</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>International Replay:</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">1-412-317-6671</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><b>Conference ID:</b></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen2\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">10206528</span></p></td></tr></table></div><p><b>USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES</b></p><p>In addition to disclosing financial statements in accordance with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), this release contains the non-GAAP financial measure known as \"EBITDA.\" A reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure is contained at the end of this press release.

The TSX rules also allow the Company to purchase, once a week, a block of subordinate voting shares not owned by any insiders, which may exceed such daily limit.

In addition, we are proud to have delivered our 52nd consecutive quarterly distribution, marking 13 consecutive years of distribution growth,” Soreq continued. “Looking ahead to 2026, we are increasingly optimistic about the opportunities in front of us, driven by the continued advancement of our integrated acid gas injection and sour gas treating solution at the Libby Complex.

We remain committed to strengthening and growing Delek Logistics through a prudent management of liquidity and leverage, and a continued focus on long-term value creation for our unitholders,\" Mr. Soreq continued.</p><p>Delek Logistics reported fourth quarter 2025 net income of <money><money>$47.3 million</money></money> or <money><money>$0.88</money></money> per diluted common limited partner unit.

Statements concerning current estimates, expectations and projections about future results, performance, prospects, opportunities, plans, actions and events and other statements, concerns or matters that are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements,” as that term is defined under the federal securities laws. These statements contain words such as “possible,” “believe,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “predict,” “plan,” “estimate,” “intend,” “may,” “anticipate,” “will,” “if,” “expect” or similar expressions, as well as statements in the future tense. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, anticipated performance and financial position; statements regarding future growth at Delek Logistics; distributions and the amounts and timing thereof; potential dropdown inventory; projected benefits of the Delaware Gathering, Permian Gathering, H2O Midstream and Gravity Water Midstream acquisitions; expected earnings or returns from joint ventures or other acquisitions; expansion projects; ability to create long-term value for our unit holders; financial flexibility and borrowing capacity; and distribution growth.</p><p>Investors are cautioned that the following important factors, including among others, may affect these forward-looking statements: the fact that a significant portion of Delek Logistics' revenue is derived from Delek US, thereby subjecting us to Delek US' business risks; political or regulatory developments, including tariffs, taxes and changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas, refined products or renewables; risks and costs relating to the age and operational hazards of our assets including, without limitation, costs, penalties, regulatory or legal actions and other effects related to releases, spills and other hazards inherent in transporting and storing crude oil and intermediate and finished petroleum products; Delek Logistics' ability to realize cost reductions; the impact of adverse market conditions affecting the utilization of Delek Logistics' assets and business performance, including margins generated by its wholesale fuel business; risks and uncertainties with respect to the possible benefits of the Delaware Gathering, Permian Gathering, H2O Midstream and Gravity transactions, as well as from integration post-closing; risks related to exposure to Permian Basin crude oil, such as supply, pricing, gathering, production and transportation capacity; uncertainties regarding actions by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producing countries impacting crude oil production and pricing; an inability of Delek US to grow as expected as it relates to our potential future growth opportunities, including dropdowns, and other potential benefits; projected capital expenditures; scheduled turnaround activity; the results of our investments in joint ventures; and other risks as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved.</p><p>Forward-looking information is based on information available at the time and/or management's good faith belief with respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Delek Logistics undertakes no obligation to update or revise any such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur, or which Delek Logistics becomes aware of, after the date hereof, except as required by applicable law or regulation.</p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">DPG Drop</span></b></p><p>On May 1, 2025, Delek Holdings transferred the Delek Permian Gathering purchasing and blending business to Delek Logistics (the \"DPG Dropdown”). In connection with the DPG Dropdown, Delek Logistics assumed all of Delek Holdings’ rights and obligations to purchase crude oil under certain contracts associated with Delek Logistics' existing Midland Gathering System. In addition, line fill inventory amounting to <money><money>$6.9 million</money></money> was transferred to Delek Logistics. Total consideration included the cancellation of <money><money>$58.8 million</money></money> in existing receivables owed to Delek Logistics by Delek Holdings.</p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">Sales-Type Leases</span></b></p><p>During the third quarter of 2024, Delek Logistics and Delek US renewed and amended certain commercial agreements. These amendments required the embedded leases within these agreements to be reassessed under Accounting Standards Codification 842, <i>Leases</i>. As a result of these amendments, certain of these agreements met the criteria to be accounted for as sales-type leases. Therefore, portions of our payments received for minimum volume commitments under agreements subject to sales-type lease accounting are recorded as interest income with the remaining amounts recorded as a reduction in net investment in leases. Prior to the amendments, these agreements were accounted for as operating leases and these minimum volume commitments were recorded as revenues.</p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">Non-GAAP Disclosures</span></b></p><p>Our management uses certain \"non-GAAP\" operational measures to evaluate our operating segment performance and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate past performance and prospects for the future to supplement our financial information presented in accordance with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location> (\"<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location>\") Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). These financial and operational non-GAAP measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") - calculated as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, including amortization of customer contract intangible assets, which is included as a component of net revenues, and proportional interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of equity method investments.</li><li>Adjusted EBITDA - EBITDA adjusted for (i) significant, infrequently occurring transaction costs and (ii) throughput and storage fees associated with the lease component of commercial agreements subject to sales-type lease accounting.</li><li>Distributable cash flow - calculated as net cash flow from operating activities adjusted for changes in assets and liabilities, maintenance capital expenditures net of reimbursements, sales-type lease receipts, net of income recognized and other adjustments not expected to settle in cash.</li><li>Distributable cash flow, as adjusted - calculated as distributable cash flow adjusted to exclude significant, infrequently occurring transaction costs.</li></ul><p>Our EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distributable cash flow, as adjusted, measures are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Delek Logistics' operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, financing methods;</li><li>the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unitholders on a current and on-going basis;</li><li>Delek Logistics' ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and</li><li>the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.</li></ul><p>We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provide information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations and assists in evaluating our ongoing operating performance and liquidity for current and comparative periods. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered alternatives to net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> GAAP. Non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings, net cash provided by operating activities and operating income. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> GAAP financial measures. Additionally, because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distributable cash flow, as adjusted may be defined differently by other partnerships in our industry, our definitions may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other partnerships, thereby diminishing their utility. See the accompanying tables in this earnings release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. However, due to the inherent difficulty and impracticability of estimating certain amounts required by <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> GAAP with a reasonable degree of certainty at this time without unreasonable effort and imprecision, we have not provided a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA guidance.</p><table cellspacing=\"0\"

The Company uses ongoing earnings and ongoing earnings per diluted share to evaluate the operations of the Company and to establish goals, including those used for certain aspects of incentive compensation, for management and employees. While the Company believes these financial measures are appropriate and useful for investors, they are not measures presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not intend for these measures, or any piece of these measures, to represent any financial measure as defined by GAAP. Furthermore, the Company's calculations of these measures as presented may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company uses ongoing earnings guidance to provide investors with management's expectations of ongoing financial performance over the period presented. While the Company believes ongoing earnings guidance is an appropriate measure, it is not a measure presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not intend for ongoing earnings guidance to represent an expectation of net earnings as defined by GAAP. Since the future differences between GAAP and ongoing earnings are frequently outside the control of the Company, management is generally not able to estimate the impact of the reconciling items between forecasted GAAP net earnings and ongoing earnings guidance, nor their probable impact on GAAP net earnings without unreasonable effort, therefore, management is generally not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for ongoing earnings guidance. Reconciliations between GAAP and ongoing earnings are contained in schedules 1-4.               </p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"prnbcc\"><tr><td

The ongoing growth in third-party cash flows has allowed <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/DKL/\" title=\"View DKL stock overview\">DKL</a> to largely separate economically from DK while maintaining its strong organic growth reflected in DKL’s 2026 guidance of <money><money>$520</money></money> to <money><money>$560 million</money></money>. This guidance reflects the durability of <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/DKL/\" title=\"View DKL stock overview\">DKL</a>'s platform, the benefits of <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/DKL/\" title=\"View DKL stock overview\">DKL</a>'s strong three stream business model and its investments in creating a peer leading sour gas gathering and acid gas injection solution.”</p><p>“Looking ahead, we remain focused on operating safely and reliably, successfully completing our ongoing <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.biging\">Big Spring</location> turnaround, advancing our sum-of-the-parts strategy, enhancing cash flow generation, and delivering sustainable long-term value for shareholders while maintaining financial strength and flexibility,”

This measure reflects the economics of each refinery exclusive of the financial impact of inventory price risk mitigation programs and marketing uplift strategies;</li><li>Refining production margin per throughput barrel - calculated as refining production margin divided by our average refining throughput in barrels per day (excluding purchased barrels) multiplied by 1,000 and multiplied by the number of days in the period; and</li><li>Net debt - calculated as long-term debt including both current and non-current portions (the most comparable GAAP measure) less cash and cash equivalents as of a specific balance sheet date.</li></ul><p>We believe these non-GAAP operational and financial measures are useful to investors, lenders, ratings agencies and analysts to assess our ongoing performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable GAAP financial measure, they provide improved relevant comparability between periods, to peers or to market metrics through the inclusion of retroactive regulatory or other adjustments as if they had occurred in the prior periods they relate to, or through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying results and trends. “Net debt,” also a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important measure to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet.</p><p>Non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and operating income. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> GAAP financial measures. Additionally, because Adjusted net income or loss, Adjusted net income or loss per share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Refining Margin and Refining Production Margin or any of our other identified non-GAAP measures may be defined differently by other companies in its industry, Delek US' definition may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. See the accompanying tables in this earnings release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.</p><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb

business transformation focused on enterprise-wide opportunities to improve the efficiency of our cost structure. For the fourth quarter 2025, we recorded restructuring costs totaling <money><money>$18.8 million</money></money> (<money><money>$14.6 million</money></money> after-tax) associated with our business transformation. Restructuring costs of <money><money>$10.4 million</money></money> are recorded in general and administrative expenses, <money><money>$5.7 million</money></money> are included in operating expenses, and <money><money>$2.7 million</money></money> are included in other operating (income) and expense in our condensed consolidated statements of income.</p><p><b><i>General and Administrative Expenses</i></b></p><p>Excluding transaction costs and restructuring costs, general and administrative expenses were <money><money>$43.4 million</money></money> for the three months ended December 31, 2025.</p><p><b><i>Citi Inventory Intermediation Agreement Amendment</i></b></p><p>In the fourth quarter, we amended the Inventory Intermediation Agreement, further reducing interest expense and other associated fees while increasing our flexibility on liquidity and inventory financing options for all refineries associated with the Inventory Intermediation Agreement. We exercised optionality to exclude certain volumes related to the agreement and our obligation under the agreement was reduced by <money><money>$289.2 million</money></money> between December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2025.</p><p><b><i>Other Inventory Impact</i></b></p><p>“Other inventory impact” is primarily calculated by multiplying the number of barrels sold during the period by the difference between current period weighted average purchase cost per barrel directly related to our refineries and per barrel cost of materials and other for the period recognized on a first-in, first-out basis directly related to our refineries. It assumes no beginning or ending inventory, so that the current period average purchase cost per barrel is a reasonable estimate of our market purchase cost for the current period, without giving effect to any build or draw on beginning inventory. These amounts are based on management estimates using a methodology including these assumptions. However, this analysis provides management with a means to compare hypothetical refining margins to current period average crack spreads, as well as provides a means to better compare our results to peers.</p><p><b><i>Small Refinery Exemptions</i></b></p><p>In August of 2025, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) announced its decisions on the backlog of 175 Small Refinery Exemption (“SRE”) petitions from refineries seeking an exemption from their Renewable Fuel Standard obligations. Delek fully complied with Renewable Identification Number (“RIN”) obligations for all years, incurring significant costs to finance our compliance.</p><p>EPA granted Delek full and partial exemptions for substantially all of our 20 petitions for the 2019-2024 calendar years. Because RINs are valid for a one-year period, a majority of the refunded RINs were expired and therefore had no value, and are the subject of ongoing litigation. The RINs received from prior year SREs resulted in a reduction of our Consolidated Net RIN Obligation and therefore a reduction within cost of materials and other of approximately <money><money>$75.3 million</money></money> in the fourth quarter of 2025.</p><p><b><i>Intercompany Leases</i></b></p><p>As a result of amendments to intercompany lease agreements in August 2024, we had to reassess lease classification for the agreements that contain leases under Accounting Standards Codification 842. As a result of these lease assessments, certain of these agreements met the criteria to be accounted for as sales-type leases for Delek Logistics and finance leases for the Refining segment. Therefore, portions of the minimum volume commitments under these agreements subject to sales-type lease accounting are recorded as interest income with the remaining amounts recorded as a reduction in net investment in leases. Prior to the amendments, these agreements were accounted for as operating leases and these minimum volume commitments were recorded as revenues in the Logistics segment. Similarly, these minimum volume commitments were previously recorded as costs of sales for the Refining segment, as the underlying lease was reclassified from an operating lease to a finance lease, and these payments are now recorded as interest expense and reductions in the lease liability. These accounting changes have no impact to the Delek US consolidated results as these amounts eliminate in consolidation.</p><p><b><i>Subsequent Events - Transactions with Delek Logistics</i></b></p><p>In January 2026, we entered into asset purchase agreements with Delek Logistics, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.tyler\">Tyler</location> refinery tank for total consideration of <money><money>$19.0 million</money></money> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ar.eldado\">El Dorado</location> tank and terminal assets for total consideration of <money><money>$66.0 million</money></money>.

Management also believes that these measures are useful to investors in highlighting trends in our operating performance, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments. Management uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS to supplement GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, to establish and award discretionary annual incentive compensation, and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Management supplements GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS are not GAAP measures of our financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of financial performance or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these measures are not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for management’s discretionary use as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax payments, debt service requirements, total capital expenditures, and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Management defines EBITDA as net income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, net and depreciation and amortization. Management also defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, further adjusted to exclude non-cash share-based compensation, acquisition, integration and transaction-related costs, restructuring and divestiture-related and other costs, legal costs and settlements associated with certain historical matters for PharMerica, significant projects, and management fees.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The presentations of these measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company. Please see the end of this press release for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>BrightSpring Contact:</strong></p> <p><strong><em>Investor Relations:</em></strong>                                        <strong><em>Media Contact:</em></strong><br/><em>David Deuchler, CFA</em>                                       <em>Leigh White</em><br/><em>Gilmartin Group LLC</em>                                       <em>leigh.white@brightspringhealth.com</em><br/><em>ir@brightspringhealth.com</em>                              <em>502.630.7412</em></p> <table align=\"center\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;
