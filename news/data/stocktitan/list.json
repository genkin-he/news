            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 27, 2026) - <b>Railtown AI Technologies Inc. (CSE: RAIL) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/RLAIF/\" title=\"View RLAIF stock overview\">RLAIF</a>) </b>(\"<b>Railtown</b>\" or the \"<b>Company</b>\") is issuing the following news release to clarify its disclosure pursuant to a recent review of the Company's continuous disclosure record by the British Columbia Securities Commission (the \"<b>BCSC</b>\").</p><p><u>October 8, 2025 News Release</u></p><p>In this news release, Railtown announced that it had entered into a memorandum of understanding (\"<b>MOU</b>\") with Uniserve Communications Corporation (TSXV: USS) (\"<b>Uniserve</b>\") regarding a strategic partnership. The Company would like to clarify that the MOU is non-binding, is for a term of 12 months beginning on September 23, 2025 but subject to mutually agreeable extensions, and that either party has the right to terminate the MOU upon 30 days' written notice. The primary purpose of the partnership is to allow Uniserve to integrate Railtown's AI frameworks, tools and solutions into Uniserve's offerings, thereby enabling Uniserve's internal sales team to promote and sell AI capabilities to Uniserve's customers.</p><p>Each of Railtown and Uniserve has certain defined obligations under the MOU, pursuant to which the parties have agreed to negotiate and execute separate commercial agreements, statements of work or service orders, as the case may be, in connection with, among other things, customer engagements, revenue sharing and pricing. Neither party is required to pay any fees to the other under the MOU, and Company and Uniserve are currently in the process of modelling their revenue sharing strategy.</p><p>Railtown is capable of readily deploying its technologies to Uniserve's customers, and expects to conclude one or more definitive agreements with Uniserve in the coming months.</p><p><u>September 23, 2022 News Release</u></p><p>In this news release, Railtown announced that it had entered into a service provider license agreement (the \"<b>SPLA</b>\") with Quisitive Technology Solutions Inc. (\"<b>Quisitive</b>\") pursuant to which the Company agreed to provide a white-label version of its technology to Quisitive to be branded and sold as Velocity Insights. The Company would like to clarify that the SPLA was technically an interim agreement with a term of six (6) months and was intended to be superseded by a longer-term definitive license agreement that has yet to be negotiated. In addition, each party had the ability to terminate the SPLA prior to the completion of the term by providing 30 days' written notice to the other party, with certain support obligations of Railtown continuing for a transition period of four (4) months following the effective date of termination.</p><p>The SLPA required the Company to provide a license to the technology and related support services to Quisitive at no cost, and the primary purpose of the agreement was to confirm the viability of the technology for use and integration with Quisitive's products and services, and to test the technology with up to 10 customers of Quisitive.  Despite the expiry of the SPLA and the acquisition of Quisitive by H.I.G. Capital in early 2025, the testing is ongoing and Quisitive continues to offer the technology to its customers.</p><p>Although Railtown has not generated any revenue from Quisitive or its customers to date, the Company anticipates entering into a revenue sharing agreement with Quisitive upon the adoption of any Quisitive technology that includes a version of the company's platform. In the meantime, the Velocity Insights product suite remains available for purchase on a stand-alone basis on Microsoft Marketplace.</p><p><u>June 28, 2024 News Release</u></p><p>In this news release, Railtown announced a strategic partnership with Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute (\"<b>Mila</b>\"). The Company would like to clarify that, under the partnership agreement governing the relationship between the parties, Railtown paid Mila the sum of <money>$10,000</money> plus applicable taxes - Mila's standard fee for new partners - in exchange for certain privileges typically provided to Mila's partners including having the Company's name or logo appear on Mila's website and certain promotional documents, and the ability to access and use certain of Mila's resources, including research, talent and intellectual property (such as, for example, Mila's expertise on advanced computing technologies, Mila's students for internship purposes, and a presence for Railtown in Mila's artificial intelligence \"hub\").  </p><p>The partnership agreement was for a term of 12 months and automatically terminated on June 19, 2025; however, the Company continues to engage with Mila and anticipates partnering again with Mila in the future.</p><p><u>July 23, 2024 News Release</u></p><p>In this news release, the Company announce that it had entered into a co-development agreement with the Alberta Machine Learning Institute (\"<b>Amii</b>\") pursuant to which the parties agreed to partner on a specific project and build related to Railtown's core technology. The Company would like to clarify that the relationship was governed by Amii's customary services contract and an accompanying statement of work (\"<b>SOW</b>\"), and that the term of the relationship was the longer of 14 months or one (1) month following the final day of employment of the Amii machine learning resident dedicated to the project (the \"<b>ML Resident</b>\").</p><p>In consideration for the services of both Amii and the ML Resident under the program covered by the agreement and SOW, Railtown paid Amii an aggregate of <money>$100,000</money> plus GST, being Amii's standard fee for programs of this nature. Although the Company no longer has access to Amii's resources following the automatic termination of the relationship in July 2025, the ML Resident was hired by Railtown following the completion of the program and is currently a full time employee.</p><p><u>June 9, 2025 News Release</u></p><p>In this news release, the Company announced a strategic partnership with ESGAI Technologies Inc. (\"<b>ESGAI</b>\") to co-develop an advanced suite of intelligent ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) software agents. The Company would like to clarify that the partnership is structured as a MOU between the parties that anticipates the execution and delivery of a formal license agreement (the \"<b>License Agreement</b>\") whereby ESGAI will license certain software technology owned and developed by Railtown in connection with the development of the agents.</p><p>The effective date of the MOU is June 6, 2025, and it automatically terminates upon the earlier of (a) the execution of the License Agreement, (b) the mutual written agreement of the parties, and (c) 180 days from the effective date. The Company complied with each of its obligations under the MOU; however, the parties were unable to negotiate the terms of the License Agreement prior to the automatic termination of the MOU on December 3, 2025, largely because such terms were predicated on ESGAI establishing a market for the agents first.</p><p>Regardless, Railtown remains committed to developing the ESG agent suite with ESGAI as circumstances allow. </p><p><u>July 28, 2025 News Release</u></p><p>In this news release, Railtown announced a strategic joint partnership with Braiyt AI Inc. (\"<b>Braiyt</b>\") to deliver AI technologies to Dubai and the broader Middle East region. The Company would like to retract the overly promotional disclosure in the news release and confirm that the partnership is structured as a MOU between Braiyt, Railtown and AIP, pursuant to which Braiyt agreed, for a term of three years, to promote the products and services of each of the Company, AIP and any affiliates of AIP in the Middle East as opportunities arise. In exchange, Braiyt is entitled to enter into a finder's fee arrangement with the relevant selling party on terms to be negotiated between the parties.</p><p><u>General</u></p><p>In certain of Railtown's previously filed continuous disclosure documents, the Company has used phrases such as \"<i>selling its AI services and solutions</i>\" that the BCSC believes may potentially be misleading given the lack of revenue reflected in the Company's financial statements at the time. While the Company acknowledges that the language may have been less than perfect and that a phrase such as \"<i>the AI services and solutions are available for sale</i>\" may technically have been more accurate, the Company would like to clarify that it has in fact generated nominal (i.e., non-material) sales revenue from paying customers.</p><p>In addition, the BCSC has expressed its concern over the accuracy of phrases such as \"<i>the platform is fully trained on clients' applications</i>\" (from Railtown's news release dated December 6, 2023), and that the system \"<i>continually trains on a client's application</i>\" and \"<i>automates a wide range of tasks associated with the client's application</i>\" (from Railtown's management discussion and analysis for the period ended June 30, 2025), because the Company either had no customers or a limited number of customers at the relevant time. The Company would like to clarify that it was using the word \"client\" in a general sense in this disclosure - that is, as a substitute for \"user\" and not in relation to a specific customer - and that the language was intended to convey how the Company's technology works once a customer downloads and connects to the platform. More specifically, once a customer downloads the Company's Railtracks agentic framework and connects to Conductr, the platform runs on the customer's own cloud infrastructure or on the customer's local computers or servers, with the result that the AI agent is able to access to the customer's data stored in those locations and learn by ingesting the data in real time.</p><p>Finally, Railtown would like to take this opportunity to confirm that the Company's primary focus for 2026 will be the building out of its Canadian agent development and deployment ecosystem with the Company's Canadian partners.</p><p><b>About Railtown</b></p><p>Railtown AI Technologies Inc. builds AI developer tools and agentic frameworks that power the next generation of intelligent applications. Its Platform - including real-time ingestion (Railengine), agent development frameworks (Railtracks ADK), and advanced observability (Conductr) - helps teams build, deploy, and operate AI agents with confidence and at scale.</p><p>For more information, visit <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/jNY0DHOLGV\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.railtown.ai</a>.</p><p><b>Follow us on social media</b></p><ul><li>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/vEzGBTojL1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/railtown-ai/</a> </li></ul><p><b>SUBSCRIBE FOR INVESTOR NEWS</b></p><p><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/JkYOjC7OXn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Click here</a> to receive our latest investor news alerts.</p><p><b>ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD</b></p><p>\"Cory Brandolini\" <br/>Cory Brandolini, Chief Executive Officer</p><p><b>INVESTOR CONTACT</b></p><div id=\"contactInfo\"><p>Rebecca Kerswell<br/>Investor Relations Contact<br/>Email: <a href=\"mailto:investors@railtown.ai\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">investors@railtown.ai</a> <br/>Phone: 1-604-417-4440</p></div><p><i>This news release contains forward-looking statements relating to the future operations of the Company and other statements that are not historical facts.

L3Harris is investing billions of dollars into modernizing and expanding its sites across the nation to significantly increase solid rocket motor production, including for Munitions Acceleration Council programs.</p><p>“Thank you for being the backbone of our department and our great nation, for having the backs of our warfighters because what you build right here in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ar.camden\">Camden</location> is absolutely central to the 21st Century Arsenal of Freedom,” Secretary Hegseth said. “You are the patriots ensuring that our warriors are never, ever in a fair fight. The more than 115,000 solid rocket motors that you’re building every single year can’t be matched.”</p><p>“Industrial capacity has become a strategic element of deterrence; the ability to deliver at scale, with speed and reliability, directly impacts how effectively <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> can deter threats and project peace through strength,” said Christopher Kubasik, Chairman and CEO, L3Harris. “Thank you, Secretary Hegseth, for reinforcing to our <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ar.camden\">Camden</location> team that what L3Harris builds here directly contributes to the safety of our warfighters and our homeland.”</p><p>During the visit, Secretary Hegseth engaged employees who produce the propulsion systems that power the PAC-3 air and missile defense system and met with the teams who manufacture the large solid rocket motors for strategic deterrence, interceptors, hypersonic systems and target missiles. He also reviewed construction progress on the company’s new Arkansas Advanced Propulsion Facilities (AAPF).</p><p>The AAPF facilities are an expansive new campus that will support medium and large solid rocket motor production. The 110-acre campus will include more than 20 new buildings and increase large solid rocket motor manufacturing capacity sixfold. The expansion incorporates advanced manufacturing technologies, automation and digital process controls L3Harris designed to improve safety, efficiency and throughput while providing long-term, domestic surge capacity.</p><p>The <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ar.camden\">Camden</location> site produces thousands of solid rocket motors a year that support a wide range of Department of War programs.

The company’s 2,000-acre <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ar.camden\">Camden</location> site is one of the nation’s largest solid rocket motor manufacturing centers and has supported national and allied defense missions for more than four decades.</p><p>L3Harris acquired the solid rocket motor business in 2023 and has transformed and grown its production operations to align with the Department of War’s increasing demand for missile programs. L3Harris intends to pursue an initial public offering of the solid rocket motor business in the second half of the year.</p><p><b>About L3Harris Technologies</b></p><p>L3Harris is the Trusted Disruptor in defense tech.

The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV to shareholders for the calendar year that will describe how to report the Fund’s distributions for federal income tax purposes.</b></p><p>The determination of the actual source of distributions can only be made at year-end. The actual source amounts of all Fund distributions will be included in the Fund’s annual or semi-annual reports. In addition, the tax treatment may differ from the accounting treatment used to calculate the source of the Fund’s distributions as shown on shareholders’ statements. Shareholders should refer to their Form 1099-DIV for the character and amount of distributions for income tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after December 31, 2026 and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV early in 2027. Since each shareholder’s tax situation is unique, it may be advisable to consult a tax advisor as to the appropriate treatment of Fund distributions.</p><p>Effective on January 1, 2024, Saba Capital Management, L.P. replaced Franklin Templeton Advisers, Inc. as the investment adviser to Saba Capital Income &amp; Opportunities Fund II (formerly known as the Templeton Global Income Fund).

The level of distribution amount shown is not guaranteed and special dividends may or may not be paid in the future. Further, no conclusions should be drawn about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount or rate of distribution shown.</p><p><b>Managed Distribution Plan. </b>The above distribution was declared in accordance with the Fund’s currently effective managed distribution plan (the “Plan”), whereby the Fund will make monthly distributions to shareholders at a fixed amount of <money><money>$0.05</money>8</money> per share. Thus, the distribution amount shown excludes special dividends (which are not paid pursuant to the plan). The Fund will generally distribute amounts necessary to satisfy the Fund’s Plan and the requirements prescribed by excise tax rules and Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan is intended to provide shareholders with a constant, but not guaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value of the Fund’s common shares, but there is no assurance that the Plan will be successful in doing so.</p><p>Under the Plan, to the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution rate. As a result, long-term capital gains and/or return of capital may be a material source of any distribution. No conclusions should be drawn about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of the Fund’s distributions or from the terms of the Fund’s Plan. The Board of Trustees (the “Board”) may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to Fund shareholders. No level of distribution can be guaranteed. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund’s common shares. The Plan is subject to the periodic review by the Board, including a yearly review of the annual minimum fixed rate to determine if an adjustment should be made.</p><p><b>Past Performance is No Assurance of Future Results. </b>Investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Investors should consider the investment objective, risks and expenses carefully.

There can be no assurance that the Fund will meet its investment objective. The Fund seeks to achieve this objective by investing globally in debt and equity securities of public and private companies, which includes, among other things, investments in closed‐end funds, special purpose acquisition companies (“SPACs”), reinsurance, and public and private debt instruments. The Fund also may utilize derivatives including but not limited to total return swaps, credit default swaps, options and futures, in seeking to enhance returns and/or to reduce portfolio risk.</p><p>The value of the Fund’s investments in equity securities of public and private, listed and unlisted companies and equity derivatives generally varies with the performance of the issuer and movements in the equity markets more generally. As a result, the Fund may suffer losses if it invests in equity instruments of issuers whose performance diverges from the Fund’s investment manager’s expectations or if equity markets generally move in a single direction and the Fund has not hedged against such a general move. The Fund invests in closed-end funds and SPACs, which are subject to additional risks and considerations. The performance of reinsurance-related securities and the reinsurance industry itself are tied to the occurrence of various triggering events, including but not limited to weather, natural disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, etc.), non-natural large catastrophes and other specified events causing physical and/or economic loss. To the extent the Fund invests in reinsurance-related securities for which a triggering event occurs, losses associated with such event could result in losses to the Fund’s investment, and a series of major triggering events affecting a large portion of the reinsurance- related securities held by the Fund could result in substantial losses to the Fund’s investment. The Fund may invest in high yield securities, which are speculative in nature and are subject to additional risk factors such as increased possibility of default, illiquidity of the security, and changes in value based on changes in interest rates. Changes in short-term market interest rates may directly affect the yield on the Fund’s common shares. If such rates fall, the Fund’s yield may also fall. If interest rate spreads on bonds and loans owned by the Fund decline in general, the yield on the bonds and loans will likely fall and the value of such bonds and loans may decrease. When short-term market interest rates rise, because of the lag between changes in such short-term rates and the resetting of the floating rates on bonds and loans in the Fund’s portfolio, the impact of rising rates will be delayed to the extent of such lag. Because of the limited secondary market for certain bonds and loans, the Fund’s ability to sell such securities in a timely fashion and/or at a favorable price may be limited. An increase in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the rate of interest payable on new bonds and loans acquired by the Fund, and it may also increase the price of bonds and loans purchased by the Fund in the secondary market. A decrease in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the price of bonds and loans in the Fund’s portfolio, which would cause the Fund’s net asset value to decrease. Investment in foreign borrowers involves special risks, including but not limited to potentially less rigorous accounting requirements, differing legal systems and potential political, social and economic adversity. The Fund may engage in currency exchange transactions to seek to hedge, as closely as practicable, all of the economic impact to the Fund arising from foreign currency fluctuations. Other risks include, but are not limited to, the use of derivatives, the potential lack of diversification in the Fund’s portfolio, and the fact that the Fund’s portfolio may be concentrated in a small group of industries or industry sectors from time to time. Investors should consult the Fund’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the materials on the Fund’s website for a more detailed discussion of these or other risk factors that affect the Fund.</p><p><b>About Saba Capital Income &amp; Opportunities Fund II. </b>Saba Capital Income &amp; Opportunities Fund II is a publicly-traded registered closed-end management investment company.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 27, 2026) - Gelum Resources Ltd. (CSE: GMR) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/GMRCF/\" title=\"View GMRCF stock overview\">GMRCF</a>) (\"Gelum\" or the \"Company\") reports that it has entered into an letter of intent under which Gelum can earn a <percent>100%</percent> interest in the Las Tinajas Gold Project (\"Las Tinajas\") covering 2,600 hectares (the \"Concessions\") in the north end of the Maricunga Gold Belt, Chile. Las Tinajas is located 120km northeast of Copiapó, in the Atacama Region of northern Chile (Figure 1).</p><p>Gelum CEO Henk Van Alphen stated, <i>\"Gelum is entering a new phase of corporate development. The acquisition of Las Tinajas is an event that will radically transform Gelum into a premier gold exploration company with a South American focus. We have had the people and partners within Gelum, and now we have the asset to greatly add shareholder value.\"</i></p><p><b>Las Tinajas Highlights</b></p><p>Las Tinajas is located at the north end of the Maricunga Belt, the largest gold belt in Chile, extending for 200 km with both porphyry and high-sulphidation types of mineralization containing a total of 103 million ounces<sup>*</sup>. The Las Tinajas 2600 Ha claim block lies between 3,600-4,000 metres above sea level and is accessible via a Codelco-maintained mining road. Gold mineralization at Las Tinajas is associated with silicified porphyry intrusions and associated diatreme breccias. Skarn features also occur in adjacent metasedimentary units. Since 1986, 64 drillholes totaling 10,990m have been drilled in three campaigns, the most recent being 16 holes totaling 2,831m drilled in 2024-2025 by Horizon Mining SA. Multiple historical holes have significant intervals of &gt;1g/t gold, with several ending in ≥1g/t gold, including (all are end of hole):</p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li>43m of 1.18 g/t Au (DT06)</li><li>35m of 1.23 g/t Au (TT014)</li><li>26m of 2.09 g/t Au (TT004)</li><li>58m of 1.42 g/t Au (TT027)</li><li>82m of 0.93 g/t Au (TDH-010)</li></ul><p>Only a small portion of the claim block has been drilled. There is significant potential to expand the known mineralized centres associated with the diatreme breccia. In addition, the drilling has not tested the favourable contact between the diatreme breccia and calcareous, reactive metasediments to the west. A thin layer of post-mineral volcanic material covers about <percent>40%</percent> of the claims and obscures broad zones of hydrothermal and skarn alteration.</p><p>Readers are cautioned that descriptions of historical drilling results reported here should be viewed primarily as a guidance for exploration drilling. The qualified person for this release has not done sufficient work to independently verify the historical sampling results described above.</p><p><b>Las Tinajas Details</b></p><p>Gold is associated with potassic, silicic and sericite alteration of a central, dacitic, diatreme breccia, with alteration/mineralization extending into adjacent calcareous sedimentary units. Gold occurs freely and as inclusions within disseminated pyrite-sphalerite-tennantite. The most intense sericitic alteration coincides with gold-zinc mineralization and a gold soil anomaly of &gt;500 ppb. The diatreme and associated surface alteration clearly extends to the west, north and east and offers excellent potential to increase the target size as indicated by numerous drill holes ending in mineralization. </p><p>Porphyry-style quartz veinlets with anomalous gold values occur in one drill hole that intercepted a weakly mineralized dacite porphyry plug and rhyolite dikes, suggesting presence of an Au-Cu-Mo dacite porphyry at depth, below the limits of historical drilling. In addition, clasts within the diatreme breccia host quartz stockworks that are closely similar in character to those in the porphyry gold deposits of the Maricunga belt.</p><p>An IP survey (dipole-dipole) completed in 1994 outlined two strong (&gt;40 millirad) northwest-trending chargeability zones spaced one kilometre apart, of which the southern anomaly coincided with known mineralization but was only drill-tested at the northwest end. The anomaly remains open and untested to the southeast.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/6458/285772_6af85e3194aee98c_002full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund’s Plan (as defined below). The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of the Fund’s distribution to shareholders may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that a shareholder invested in a Fund is paid back to them. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income.” The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV to shareholders for the calendar year that will describe how to report the Fund’s distributions for federal income tax purposes.</b></p><p>The determination of the actual source of distributions can only be made at year-end. The actual source amounts of all Fund distributions will be included in the Fund’s annual or semi-annual reports. In addition, the tax treatment may differ from the accounting treatment used to calculate the source of the Fund’s distributions as shown on shareholders’ statements. Shareholders should refer to their Form 1099-DIV for the character and amount of distributions for income tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after December 31, 2026 and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV early in 2027. Since each shareholder’s tax situation is unique, it may be advisable to consult a tax advisor as to the appropriate treatment of Fund distributions.</p><p>Effective after the close of business on June 4, 2021, Saba Capital Management, L.P. replaced Voya Financial as the investment adviser to Saba Capital Income &amp; Opportunities Fund (formerly known as the Voya Prime Rate Trust).

The level of distribution amount shown is not guaranteed and special dividends may or may not be paid in the future. Further, no conclusions should be drawn about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount or rate of distribution shown.</p><p><b>Managed Distribution Plan. </b>The above distribution was declared in accordance with the Fund’s currently effective managed distribution plan (the “Plan”), whereby the Fund will make monthly distributions to shareholders at a fixed amount of <money><money>$0.08</money>5</money> per share. Thus, the distribution amount shown excludes special dividends (which are not paid pursuant to the plan). The Fund will generally distribute amounts necessary to satisfy the Fund’s Plan and the requirements prescribed by excise tax rules and Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan is intended to provide shareholders with a constant, but not guaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value of the Fund’s common shares, but there is no assurance that the Plan will be successful in doing so.</p><p>Under the Plan, to the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution rate. As a result, long-term capital gains and/or return of capital may be a material source of any distribution. No conclusions should be drawn about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of the Fund’s distributions or from the terms of the Fund’s Plan. The Board of Trustees (the “Board”) may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to Fund shareholders. No level of distribution can be guaranteed. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund’s common shares. The Plan is subject to the periodic review by the Board, including a yearly review of the annual minimum fixed rate to determine if an adjustment should be made.</p><p><b>Past Performance is No Assurance of Future Results. </b>Investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Investors should consider the investment objective, risks and expenses carefully.

There can be no assurance that the Fund will meet its investment objective. The Fund seeks to achieve this objective by investing globally in debt and equity securities of public and private companies, which includes, among other things, investments in closed‐end funds, special purpose acquisition companies (“SPACs”), reinsurance, and public and private debt instruments. The Fund also may utilize derivatives including but not limited to total return swaps, credit default swaps, options and futures, in seeking to enhance returns and/or to reduce portfolio risk.</p><p>The value of the Fund’s investments in equity securities of public and private, listed and unlisted companies and equity derivatives generally varies with the performance of the issuer and movements in the equity markets more generally. As a result, the Fund may suffer losses if it invests in equity instruments of issuers whose performance diverges from the Fund’s investment manager’s expectations or if equity markets generally move in a single direction and the Fund has not hedged against such a general move. The Fund invests in closed-end funds and SPACs, which are subject to additional risks and considerations. The performance of reinsurance-related securities and the reinsurance industry itself are tied to the occurrence of various triggering events, including but not limited to weather, natural disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, etc.), non-natural large catastrophes and other specified events causing physical and/or economic loss. To the extent the Fund invests in reinsurance-related securities for which a triggering event occurs, losses associated with such event could result in losses to the Fund’s investment, and a series of major triggering events affecting a large portion of the reinsurance- related securities held by the Fund could result in substantial losses to the Fund’s investment. The Fund may invest in high yield securities, which are speculative in nature and are subject to additional risk factors such as increased possibility of default, illiquidity of the security, and changes in value based on changes in interest rates. Changes in short-term market interest rates may directly affect the yield on the Fund’s common shares. If such rates fall, the Fund’s yield may also fall. If interest rate spreads on bonds and loans owned by the Fund decline in general, the yield on the bonds and loans will likely fall and the value of such bonds and loans may decrease. When short-term market interest rates rise, because of the lag between changes in such short-term rates and the resetting of the floating rates on bonds and loans in the Fund’s portfolio, the impact of rising rates will be delayed to the extent of such lag. Because of the limited secondary market for certain bonds and loans, the Fund’s ability to sell such securities in a timely fashion and/or at a favorable price may be limited. An increase in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the rate of interest payable on new bonds and loans acquired by the Fund, and it may also increase the price of bonds and loans purchased by the Fund in the secondary market. A decrease in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the price of bonds and loans in the Fund’s portfolio, which would cause the Fund’s net asset value to decrease. The Fund’s use of leverage, if any, through borrowings or issuance of preferred shares can adversely affect the yield on the Fund’s common shares. Investment in foreign borrowers involves special risks, including but not limited to potentially less rigorous accounting requirements, differing legal systems and potential political, social and economic adversity. The Fund may engage in currency exchange transactions to seek to hedge, as closely as practicable, all of the economic impact to the Fund arising from foreign currency fluctuations. Other risks include, but are not limited to, the use of derivatives, the potential lack of diversification in the Fund’s portfolio, and the fact that the Fund’s portfolio may be concentrated in a small group of industries or industry sectors from time to time. Investors should consult the Fund’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the materials on the Fund’s website for a more detailed discussion of these or other risk factors that affect the Fund.</p><p><b>About Saba Capital Income &amp; Opportunities Fund. </b>Saba Capital Income &amp; Opportunities Fund is a publicly-traded registered closed-end management investment company.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><i><strong>THIS NEWS RELEASE IS NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO U.S. NEWSWIRE SERVICES FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES</strong></i></p><p><strong id=\"dateline\">VANCOUVER, BC / <a href=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ACCESS Newswire</a> / February 27, 2026 / </strong>Algo Grande Copper Corp. (\"Algo Grande\") (TSXV:ALGR)(OTC:<a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/KNDYF/\" title=\"View KNDYF stock overview\">KNDYF</a>)(FRA:KM00) announces the closing of its previously announced non-brokered private placement and the election of three new directors at its Annual General Meeting held on February 25, 2026.</p><p>Pursuant to its news releases dated February 11, 2026 and February 19, 2026, the Company has closed its previously announced non-brokered private placement (the \"Offering\") of common shares in the capital of the Company (the \"Shares\"), at a deemed price of <money>$0.65</money> per Share. The Offering consisted of 10,037,020 Shares for aggregate gross proceeds of <money>$6,524,063.</money></p><p>The Offering will fund the next phase of exploration at the Company's <percent>100%</percent>-owned Adelita Project in Sonora, Mexico, focused on a Phase II drill program. Phase I drilling at the Cerro Grande skarn intersected multiple stacked Cu-Au-Ag skarn horizons at depth, including skarn zones that had not been identified by historic drilling. The upcoming program will target expansion drilling at Cerro Grande and first-pass drilling along an approximately 6-kilometre prospective limestone corridor hosting multiple, undrilled, outcropping skarn targets. Proceeds from the Offering will also be used for additional operating costs and general working capital requirements.</p><p>Commenting on the opportunity at Adelita, newly elected Director Raymond Jannas stated: \"The Adelita Project exhibits many of the characteristics we look for in emerging district-scale systems, high-grade skarn mineralization with clear geological vectors toward a deeper potential porphyry source. What excites me most is the combination of compelling geology and a focused, determined team that is executing with discipline. With capital in place and a clear exploration roadmap, Algo Grande is well positioned to unlock the broader potential of this system.\"</p><p>In connection with the closing of the Offering, the Company paid certain eligible finders (each, a \"Finder\") aggregate cash commissions of <money>$169,605.44</money>, being equal to <percent>7%</percent> of the aggregate gross proceeds raised from those purchasers introduced by such Finder, and issued 355,863 common share purchase warrants (each, a \"Finder Warrant\") being equal to <percent>7%</percent> of the number of Shares purchased by those purchasers introduced by such Finder. Each Finder Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire a Share (each, a \"Finder's Warrant Share\") at an exercise price of <money>$0.65</money> per Finder's Warrant Share until the date that is three years after issuance.</p><p>Additionally, Canaccord Genuity Corp. (\"Canaccord\") acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Offering. The Company paid Canaccord a corporate finance fee of <money>$50,000</money> (the \"Corporate Finance Fee\"). The Corporate Finance Fee was settled through the issuance of 76,923 Shares at a deemed price of <money>$0.65</money> per Share.</p><p>Securities issued in the Offering are subject to a four-month hold period in accordance with applicable securities laws, which will expire four months and one day from the date of closing of the Offering. The Offering is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, receipt of all necessary approvals, including approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.</p><p>The Company also announces that at its Annual General Meeting held on February 25, 2026, shareholders approved all matters brought before the meeting, including the election of three new directors:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><p>Raymond Jannas</p></li><li><p>Hunter Scharfe</p></li><li><p>Enrico Gay</p></li></ul><p>The appointments follow the Company's previously announced board strengthening initiatives (see news release dated February 11, 2026).</p><p>Certain directors of the Company (the \"Insiders\") subscribed for an aggregate of 77,155 Shares for aggregate gross proceeds of <money>$50,150.75</money> in the Offering. The Insiders' participation constitutes a \"related party transaction\" within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - <i>Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions</i> (\"MI 61-101\"). The Company is relying on the exemption from the valuation requirements and minority shareholder approvals in MI 61-101 pursuant to subsections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101, respectively, as the value of the Insiders' participation in the Offering does not represent more than <percent>25%</percent> of the Company's market capitalization, as determined in accordance with MI 61-101.</p><p>This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities in the United States. The securities have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"U.S. Securities Act\"), or any state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons unless registered under the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or an exemption from such registration is available.</p><p><strong>About Algo Grande Copper Corp.</strong><br/>Algo Grande Copper Corp. is a growth-focused mineral exploration company advancing the Adelita Project, a district-scale, multi-system copper-gold-silver opportunity positioned in the prolific Arizona-Sonora copper belt.</p><p>The company is dedicated to unlocking the full potential of this under-explored corridor through disciplined data-driven exploration, technical excellence, and a firm commitment to value creation for shareholders. The 5,895-hectare Adelita Project is anchored by the high-grade Cerro Grande Cu-Au-Ag skarn discovery, which exhibits strong continuity along a defined corridor extending over 6 kilometers. Reprocessing of legacy geophysical data and field mapping indicate the presence of a potential porphyry system at depth, suggesting a classic skarn-porphyry mineralization model similar to major deposits found throughout northwestern Mexico.</p><p>ON BEHALF OF ALGO GRANDE COPPER CORP.</p><p>Enrico Gay<br/>Chief Executive Officer</p><p>For more information, please contact:</p><p>E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:info@algo-grande.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">info@algo-grande.com</a></p><p>Website: <a href=\"https://pr.report/j58y\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.algo-grande.com</a></p><p><strong>Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information</strong></p><p><i>NEITHER THE TSX VENTURE EXCHANGE NOR ITS REGULATION SERVICES PROVIDER (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN THE POLICIES OF THE TSX VENTURE EXCHANGE) ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS RELEASE.</i></p><p><i>This news release contains statements and information that, to the extent that they are not historical fact, constitute \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable securities legislation.

Continued approval for this indication, which was based on an improvement in annualized growth velocity (AGV), may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).</p> <p>Achondroplasia is a rare genetic condition causing skeletal dysplasia and, for many affected individuals, an increased risk of muscular, neurological, and cardiorespiratory complications. YUVIWEL is a prodrug of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) administered once weekly, designed to provide continuous exposure of active CNP to receptors on tissues throughout the body to counteract the overactive FGFR3 signaling in achondroplasia.</p> <p>“The approval of once-weekly YUVIWEL is a major step forward in the treatment of children with achondroplasia, giving physicians for the first time the option of prescribing a once-weekly medicine backed by compelling efficacy and excellent tolerability data from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials,” said Carlos A. Bacino, MD, FACMG, Professor of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children’s Hospital. “My goal is to help children and parents develop care plans tailored to their individual needs and objectives, and I look forward to adding YUVIWEL to my discussions with them.”</p> <p>“Little People of America, the largest national advocacy and support organization for people with dwarfism, is committed to ensuring that the voices of people with dwarfism remain central in conversations about research and medical options such as YUVIWEL,” said the Board of Directors of Little People of America. “We champion dwarf and disability pride, advocate for inclusion and respect, and foster open dialogue across diverse perspectives. Our goal is to empower individuals and families to make healthcare decisions that reflect their own values and experiences, while pushing for research efforts and new treatment options such as this that could have the potential to support outcomes that truly matter to our community.”</p> <p>The FDA based its approval of YUVIWEL on their review of the clinical package for TransCon CNP submitted with the Company’s New Drug Application, which included safety and efficacy data from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials and up to three years of open-label extension data. The pivotal ApproaCH Trial data is available in <em>JAMA Pediatrics</em>.<sup>i</sup></p> <p>“We are confident in YUVIWEL’s potential to transform the treatment of achondroplasia and are deeply grateful to patients, clinicians, and advocates for their many contributions to this important milestone,” said Jan Mikkelsen, President and Chief Executive Officer at Ascendis Pharma. “We have listened to advocacy groups for people with dwarfism to ensure we address what the community actually cares about. This reflects our ongoing commitment to pursue outcomes that patient communities have told us are important to them, and gives the achondroplasia community a new way to look at the promise of pharmacological treatment options.”</p> <p>Ascendis expects to make YUVIWEL available through prescribing physicians in the United States during the early part of the second quarter of 2026. Ascendis plans to offer a suite of patient services for YUVIWEL through its U.S. Ascendis Signature Access Program (A.S.A.P.), including support navigating the treatment journey and financial assistance programs for eligible patients.</p> <p>With this approval, the FDA also issued a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV), which confers priority review to a subsequent drug application that would not otherwise qualify for priority review. This program is designed to encourage development of new drugs and biologics for the prevention or treatment of rare pediatric diseases.</p> <p><strong>Conference Call and Webcast Information</strong><br/>Ascendis will host a call to review the FDA approval of YUVIWEL on Monday, March 2, 2026, at 8:00 am ET.

While historically considered a bone growth disorder, the FGFR3 variant seen in achondroplasia is expressed in tissues throughout the body, and is associated with an increased risk of muscular, neurological, and cardiorespiratory complications in addition to skeletal dysplasia. Medical complications of achondroplasia can vary from individual to individual and across different stages of life. Throughout infancy and childhood, observed complications include spinal abnormalities, enlarged brain ventricles, impaired muscle strength and reduced stamina, hearing deficits and chronic ear infections, upper airway obstructions, sleep-disordered breathing, hip problems, leg bowing, and chronic pain; some of which persist or worsen in adulthood. These medical complications can affect quality of life, physical well-being, influenced by a range of clinical, social, and individual factors. Some individuals with achondroplasia require multiple procedures and surgeries to address specific functional or anatomical concerns.</p> <p><strong>About Ascendis Pharma A/S</strong><br/>Ascendis Pharma is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on applying our innovative TransCon technology platform to make a meaningful difference for patients.
