Rock-chip channel results there returned up to 6 meters at 2.3 grams per tonne gold and 70.9 ppm silver and individual rock-chip assays returned a maximum of 6.1 grams per tonne gold and 165 ppm silver (gold minimum 0.01 and mean 0.2 grams per tonne; silver minimum 0.01 and mean: 6.2 ppm). RC drilling intersected elevated bismuth, silver and tellurium over 10-15-meter intervals but did not replicate the surface gold grades. The Company interprets this geochemical signature as potentially indicative of a deeper intrusion-related gold system beneath the exposed vein array, warranting further evaluation.</p><p><b>Strategic Outlook</b></p><p>This phase of exploratory drilling has confirmed the potential of both gold-dominant sheeted vein systems and zinc-polymetallic skarn-style mineralization within the Jabal Sahabiyah project area.</p><p>The Company is currently reviewing strategic options for advancing the project. Given the distinct geological styles identified, Royal Road is evaluating pathways that could optimize value creation, including the potential introduction of a partner with specific expertise in zinc-polymetallic systems, while maintaining meaningful exposure to the gold exploration upside across the broader project area.</p><p>\"These results further confirm the presence of two distinct mineral systems at Jabal Sahabiyah,\" said Tim Coughlin, Royal Road's President and CEO. \"Through disciplined, low-cost exploration we have efficiently tested multiple targets and demonstrated meaningful gold continuity at Ash Shajjah and down-plunge zinc-polymetallic grades at Hanash North. The project now warrants focused follow-up. We are assessing the most effective pathway to advance Jabal Sahabiyah, potentially alongside a partner with specific zinc expertise while ensuring we retain meaningful exposure to the broader gold upside. Our approach remains grounded in technical rigor and disciplined capital allocation.\"</p><p><i><b>About Royal Road Minerals:</b></i></p><p><i>Royal Road Minerals is a mineral exploration and development company with its head office and technical-operations center located in Jersey, Channel Islands.

estimate or predict with reasonable certainty certain discrete tax items, which could significantly impact that financial measure. </p><p><b>Operational and Financial Metrics</b></p><p><b><i>Adjusted EBITDA </i></b>is net income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, net interest expense, other income (expense), income tax (expense) benefit, (gain) loss on foreign currency, (gain) loss on transfer of assets, reorganization costs, and other supplemental adjustments. Other supplemental adjustments include certain non-operating items such as stock-based compensation, executive severance costs, debt refinancing costs, acquisition-related expenses and other non-recurring charges. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when considered along with other performance measures, is a useful measure as it reflects certain operating drivers of the business, such as sales growth, operating costs, selling and administrative expense, and other operating income and expense. We believe Adjusted EBITDA helps provide a more complete understanding of the underlying operating results and trends and an enhanced overall understanding of our financial performance and prospects for the future. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements, such as unearned passenger revenues, capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments, and tax payments. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other companies within the industry.</p><p>The following metrics apply to the Lindblad segment:</p><p><b><i>Adjusted Net Cruise Cost </i></b>represents Net Cruise Cost adjusted for Non-GAAP other supplemental adjustments which include certain non-operating items such as stock-based compensation, reorganization costs and acquisition-related expenses.</p><p><b><i>Available Guest Nights </i></b>is a measurement of capacity available for sale and represents double occupancy per cabin (except single occupancy for a single capacity cabin) multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period.

(NYSE: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/VLN/\" title=\"View VLN stock overview\">VLN</a>). Valens Semiconductor posted 4Q25      revenue of <money>$19.4M</money>, significantly above guidance of <money>$18.2</money>-<money>$18.9M</money>, marking its seventh consecutive quarter of growth and up from <money>$17.3M</money> in 3Q25 and <money>$16.7M</money> in 4Q24.

            "title": "Antelope Enterprise Holdings Limited Launches “Genius Plan”，a Structured Digital Asset Management Strategy Amid BTC Market | AEHL Stock News",
            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p align=\"justify\">NEW YORK, NY, Feb.  26, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Antelope Enterprise Holdings Limited (NASDAQ: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/AEHL/\" title=\"View AEHL stock overview\">AEHL</a>, or the “Company”), today announced the launch of a structured digital asset management strategy - the “Genius Plan”, designed to establish a disciplined Bitcoin (BTC) allocation and capital recycling framework, as global markets focus on Bitcoin’s sharp decline and investor sentiment rapidly shifts toward fear, which clears the way for AEHL’s BTC deployment.</p> <p align=\"justify\">With BTC retreating from recent highs to nearly half its peak value, the Company views the current market zone as a strategically compelling entry opportunity. The “Genius Plan” represents not only an evolution of AEHL’s strategic treasury reserves and capital management framework, but also the potential emergence of a new crypto-equity linkage model between Wall Street and the digital asset ecosystem. The Company believes this initiative may inject renewed confidence into the currently subdued BTC market and serve as a guiding beacon for traditional capital entering the digital asset space.</p> <p align=\"justify\">AEHL believes that during periods of extreme market volatility, long-term outcomes are not determined by short-term emotional reactions, but by rigorous data analysis and structured execution systems.</p> <p>The “Genius Plan” will be implemented in five core phases:</p> <p><b>Step One: Establish Strategic Positioning</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">The Company will initiate its strategy with a <money>$1 million</money> BTC purchase as its starting position, executing an initial one-time acquisition. Subsequent purchases will be conducted in tranches rather than through a single concentrated allocation, gradually building a structured BTC holding framework.</p> <p align=\"justify\">On February 27, the Company will announce the first objective approved by its Board of Directors. Through phased accumulation, each tranche will create an independent cost anchor, providing a clear and disciplined basis for future strategic execution.</p> <p><b>Step Two: Activate the “Genius Harvester” Mechanism</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">When the market price rises <percent>1%</percent> relative to a specific cost anchor, the system will trigger a predefined partial-sale mechanism. For example, if a <money>$1 million</money> position appreciates to <money>$1.01 million</money>, the Company would sell <money>$10,000</money> worth of BTC.</p> <p align=\"justify\">This mechanism is designed to break down consolidation phases and high-volatility environments into quantifiable and executable trading units. By repeatedly capturing small wave movements, the Company aims to accumulate incremental gains — building layer upon layer — rather than passively waiting for a single “tsunami” move.</p> <p><b>Step Three: Launch the “Genius Recycler” Mechanism</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">Fifty percent of realized gains generated through the “Genius Harvester” will be specifically allocated toward the Company’s share repurchase program. Subject to Board authorization and applicable regulatory frameworks, the repurchase program will serve as a core pathway in AEHL’s shareholder return structure.</p> <p align=\"justify\">AEHL believes that if realized gains do not ultimately return to and reinforce shareholder value, capital strategy loses its fundamental meaning.</p> <p><b>Step Four: From “Zombie Holding” to Dynamic Management</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">AEHL emphasizes that it does not intend to become a passive holder that fails to realize gains during upswings and simply absorbs losses during downturns. Long-term conviction does not conflict with phased realization. Discipline does not contradict strategic vision.</p> <p>The Company chooses to rely on data-driven models rather than emotion-driven decision-making.</p> <p><b>Step Five: Real-Time Transparency</b></p> <p align=\"justify\">Management stated that relevant holdings and strategy execution data will be disclosed in real time through official channels including X, Momo, Tiger Trade, Snowball, LinkedIn, Weibo, and Rednote, ensuring transparency and timely communication with global investors.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Ms. <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TPCUEDcSsNg-8ByeOEucIgbCI6GN757aQSKa0IQKMqVKbgpUHvpzBCoEpht61bD9i3OEnH1WpiIoNSZupQDopt8y3PssZSKAv_niNxwWqd0q69fkNI-hz3Xqwt2RAZOA63eTXzQ_4MbaBf-UVbg4rVviGbA-4xioqyh18MaAmXJi58ow-1WskOp8peXTmtxnYOq2QnHkSqzJLR4OPDnN2dTzsSPVliuD0oulzhzyTlcdftrUEBpWYQysLxM30E6CIIbhYYzE3K_mY5vHCac-uL4-jAJezAsf_vGACVj_DZq14b1Wcg9_VJcxYG3vyTPcFPq_Mf__RdUzonxA1TGAjgncyy9OOmnskMt2dMo7PPmePcsDZaPk1RKvK33y879wKPiwOkc454EJTfuBx8Vbp4NquDjTwNsAukpE0zUYTShOe2Ex3bFIQAkxRaynB4vorQuORhrj-46iJG8MfR6KTDeNHghwkGwb_bOKdaYDCBF5xNAF1PjE5wwL2Yy4gSOB8UJNguAqU-kVbkoS-u-J5pmBRcAemBPriLgB7EGDVttU6NfgkDSW99ZB5UPFVIYAF8Ctr7eRS_gUWXQfqW_x0LTR0CbCxjg4ON8QK8d-0ctbKgSp92QQPtisgQmZYMMN0mOAO9xSiam13pvr2Pq5_BFWG-0Tt7TJEHkcVKqVzYBK7Nh0dqIEbNdOQkn8HoZR947P_Pil7c99Dh3XKWpiVg==\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tingting Zhang</a>, Chief Executive Officer of Antelope Enterprise Holdings Limited, commented: “We are committed to building a structured capital loop connecting digital assets and equity markets: Financing → Digital Asset Allocation → Profit Realization → Share Repurchase → Enterprise Value Enhancement → Refinancing.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Markets may swing violently, but companies must maintain structural clarity.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Tel Aviv, Israel, Feb.  26, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Jeffs' Brands Ltd (“Jeffs’ Brands” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/JFBR/\" title=\"View JFBR stock overview\">JFBR</a>, <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/JFBRW/\" title=\"View JFBRW stock overview\">JFBRW</a>), a data-driven e-commerce company operating on the Amazon Marketplace expanding into the global homeland security sector through advanced artificial intelligence (“AI”) – driven solutions, today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, KeepZone AI Inc. (“KeepZone”), has entered into a Channel Partner Agreement (the “Agreement”) with SENSORZTECH Ltd.,(“Sensorz”) an Israeli-based innovator in AI-native radio Frequency (“RF”) spectrum intelligence technology.</p> <p>Under the terms of the Agreement, KeepZone was granted non-exclusive rights to promote, market and resell Sensorz’s SWORD AI Spectrum Intelligence Platform and related systems to approved customers in Mexico, subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, including customer approval and acceptance of purchase orders.</p> <p>The SWORD platform delivers real-time, wideband RF spectrum monitoring, automated signal detection and classification, and precision geolocation across dense and contested electromagnetic environments. Built for government, defense, and homeland security operations, the system is designed to enable rapid identification of unauthorized or potentially malicious wireless activity - including tactical communications, SATCOM devices, autonomous systems, jamming sources, private cellular infrastructure, and other emerging RF-based threats.</p> <p>The Agreement is intended to support Mexican government agencies, military units, national guard forces, and critical infrastructure operators seeking to modernize spectrum awareness capabilities and strengthen operational readiness in an increasingly dynamic wireless landscape, subject to customer approvals, procurement processes, and execution of purchase orders.</p> <p>\"This Agreement marks a significant step in KeepZone's expansion into advanced RF monitoring solutions, aligning with our mission to deliver cutting-edge AI-driven security technologies to high-stakes markets,\" said Alon Dayan, CEO of KeepZone. “As wireless-enabled risks continue to evolve, governments are seeking intelligent, automated tools that provide real-time spectrum visibility and actionable insights. Collaborating with Sensorz positions us to offer advanced AI-driven RF intelligence capabilities to Mexico, enhancing protection of national assets and critical infrastructure. We look forward to driving adoption and creating value for our stakeholders through this collaboration.\"</p> <p>Meir Friedland, CEO of Sensorz, added: “Mexico is facing escalating security challenges, including the ongoing fight against organized crime and drug trafficking networks, alongside preparations for major international events such as the FIFA World Cup. These factors significantly heighten the sensitivity of the electromagnetic domain. Sensorz’s AI-native architecture is designed to adapt to newly introduced and evolving signal types, while substantially reducing the level of specialized expertise traditionally required to operate advanced spectrum intelligence systems. Through our collaboration with KeepZone, we are committed to helping customers maintain airwave integrity, rapidly identify anomalous activity, and respond decisively to RF-based risks.”</p> <p>As wireless proliferation accelerates and spectrum congestion intensifies, the electromagnetic domain has become a critical pillar of national security. The KeepZone–Sensorz collaboration is intended to facilitate potential deployment of advanced RF intelligence capabilities across Mexico, strengthening resilience, operational control, and public safety.</p> <p><b>About Jeffs’ Brands</b></p> <p>Jeffs’ Brands is a data-driven company that has recently pivoted into the global homeland security sector through its wholly-owned subsidiary, KeepZone AI Inc., following the entry into the definitive distribution agreement with Scanary Ltd., in December 2025.

Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe the Company’s future plans, strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as “believe,” “expect,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “seek,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “estimate,” “anticipate” or other comparable terms. For example, the Company is using forward-looking statements when discussing the anticipated benefits of the Agreement, the potential distribution of Sensorz’s products in Mexico, the expected demand for RF spectrum intelligence solutions, potential customer engagements, and the Company’s strategy to expand into the global homeland security market. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company’s control.

Attendees visiting meeting room 2L8MR in Hall 2 will see demonstrations of how MaxLinear’s Sierra single-chip radio SoC helps OEMs develop new innovative Open RAN Radio Units (O-RUs) addressing the key challenges faced by Mobile Network Operators (MNO). MaxLinear will showcase how Sierra’s embedded Passive Intermodulation (PIM) cancellation technology enables development of smaller and lighter Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) Massive MIMO O-RUs as well as several new highly compact and power-efficient O-RUs powered by Sierra.</p><div id=\"bwbodyimg\" style=\"width: 480px; float:left; padding-left:0px; padding-right:20px; padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;\"><img alt=\"Sierra Radio SoC Enables FDD mMIMO with Embedded Active PIM Cancellation\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20260226557346/en/2731965/4/MWC_FDD_mMIMO_PR-Linkedin1280_720.jpg\"/><p style=\"font-size:85%;\">Sierra Radio SoC Enables FDD mMIMO with Embedded Active PIM Cancellation</p></div><p>Uplink traffic is rapidly becoming the next major network bottleneck as user behavior shifts toward high-bandwidth uploads such as live video and social content. MNOs are pursuing FDD Massive MIMO as a targeted way to address uplink-constrained networks. However, FDD Massive MIMO radio unit size, weight, and cost have remained key barriers to deployment.</p><p>“Uplink traffic is growing faster than downlink traffic and will accelerate in the era of Physical AI. There’s a strong need for uplink capacity in the critical low bands where FDD mMIMO can make all kinds of devices work better. This integration makes FDD Massive MIMO more practical for real-world upgrades,” said Joe Madden, Principal Analyst at Mobile Experts.</p><p>Sierra helps address these challenges at the architecture level with embedded PIM cancellation. In FDD systems, downlink transmission generates PIM products that fall directly into the uplink receive band and reduce receiver throughput. Traditional FDD systems use high performance cavity filters to minimize PIM effects, but these filters are large, heavy, and expensive. By being able to cancel up to 20dB of PIM on each receive path with advanced signal processing, Sierra enables the use of smaller, lighter and cheaper ceramic filters instead of bulky cavity filters.</p><p>“Uplink demand is rising faster than network capacity, driving operators to look at FDD Massive MIMO as a practical way to relieve uplink congestion. But OEMs are challenged to deliver that capability without excessive cost and complexity,” said Puneet Sethi, Senior Vice President of MaxLinear’s Network Infrastructure &amp; Carrier BU. “Sierra is already a proven carrier grade solution for single- and multi-band macro radio units. Now, by using PIM cancellation to eliminate the need for bulky cavity filters, Sierra is enabling OEMs to build simpler, lighter FDD Massive MIMO radios that operators can deploy at scale to address the uplink demand challenge.”</p><p>At Mobile World Congress, MaxLinear will demonstrate these capabilities live, highlighting Sierra’s PIM cancellation performance and showcasing multiple Sierra-driven radios. The demonstrations will take place in Hall 2, meeting room 2L8MR.</p><p>For more information on Sierra, visit <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.maxlinear.com%2Fsierra&amp;esheet=54434359&amp;newsitemid=20260226557346&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.maxlinear.com%2Fsierra&amp;index=2&amp;md5=5d58a03617dc9c4d0c36ed586333c9b2\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">www.maxlinear.com/sierra</a>.</p><p><b>About MaxLinear, Inc.</b></p><p>MaxLinear, Inc.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>MINNEAPOLIS, Feb.  26, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OneMedNet Corporation (Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/ONMD/\" title=\"View ONMD stock overview\">ONMD</a>), a leading provider of regulatory-grade, AI-ready Real-World Data (RWD), today announced a strategic partnership with ViuHealth, a digital health company specializing in autoimmune disease populations.</p> <p>This partnership expands OneMedNet’s autoimmune clinical ontology, to the OneMedNet iRWD™ platform—powered by Palantir Foundry—further increasing the scale, diversity, and longitudinal depth of its regulatory-grade Real-World Data. Under the agreement, ViuHealth will provide ongoing, longitudinal autoimmune disease data, strengthening OneMedNet’s portfolio of high-value specialty datasets and supporting research, AI model development, HEOR initiatives, and regulatory-aligned use cases.</p> <p>Autoimmune Real-World Data is highly sought after by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies developing innovative therapies for these chronic conditions. The addition of ViuHealth’s longitudinal dataset—capturing patient journeys, treatment adherence, flares, and outcomes—enables pharma partners to accelerate drug discovery, support label expansions, demonstrate real-world effectiveness in competitive markets, and inform pricing or reimbursement strategies in a therapeutics segment projected to exceed <money>$166 billion</money> globally in 2026<sup>1</sup>.</p> <p><strong>Driving Recurring Revenue Growth</strong></p> <p>This partnership advances OneMedNet’s subscription revenue strategy by integrating high-value, disease-specific longitudinal data into the iRWD™ platform.</p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li><strong>Subscription License:</strong> Partnerships like this add high-value, disease-specific longitudinal data (e.g., autoimmune patient journeys from ViuHealth's virtual care), making the iRWD™ platform more attractive for ongoing subscriptions rather than one-time sales.</li><li><strong>Revenue Impact:</strong> Pharma/biotech companies (targeting the <money>$166B</money>+ autoimmune therapeutics market<sup>2</sup>) subscribe for access to enriched datasets to support drug development, HEOR, AI training, and regulatory evidence—creating predictable Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), higher retention, and upsell opportunities through expanded data feeds.</li><li><strong>Strategic Fit:</strong> Network expansion historically drives bookings and inbound demand as previously reported with the November 17, 2025 press release reporting <percent>815%</percent> YoY bookings growth and a 4.5X inbound increase.<br/></li></ul> <p>Autoimmune diseases affect an estimated ~<percent>8%</percent> of the U.S. population, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health<sup>2</sup>, representing tens of millions of individuals. These chronic conditions are often associated with long diagnostic timelines, complex disease progression, and significantly reduced quality of life—creating strong demand across life sciences, digital health, and AI markets for deeper, longitudinal real-world data for research into new products and solutions to help these patients live more comfortable longer lives.</p> <p>OneMedNet’s iRWD™ platform—powered by Palantir Foundry—enables rapid cohort identification, multimodal data curation, and secure delivery of de-identified, regulatory-grade datasets. This infrastructure allows OneMedNet to efficiently acquire new disease-specific data sources and quickly translate them into commercially relevant data products.</p> <p>“This partnership reflects our continued focus on expanding high-value, disease-specific data pipelines for subscription sales to fuel our long-term growth,” said Aaron Green, CEO and President of OneMedNet. “Autoimmune diseases impact millions of lives, and by integrating ViuHealth’s specialized, continuous data flows into our iRWD platform, we are enabling researchers, life sciences companies, and AI developers to generate actionable insights – while building durable, recurring revenue streams that deliver predictable value for our shareholders and partners.”</p> <p>“We partnered with OneMedNet because they offered the fastest and most scalable path to commercializing high-quality autoimmune data,” said Kwaku Owusu, CEO of ViuHealth. “The OneMedNet iRWD platform, powered by Palantir Foundry, allows researchers to quickly identify valuable autoimmune cohorts and deliver market-ready datasets without compromising privacy, quality, or compliance. This partnership accelerates our mission while creating meaningful value for the broader healthcare ecosystem.”</p> <p>This colloboration reinforces OneMedNet’s expanding role as a trusted data infrastructure provider in specialty disease areas, strengthening its position within the rapidly growing real-world data and AI-enabled healthcare markets. It further advances the Company’s strategy of building repeatable, subscription-oriented data partnerships that generate continuous data flows rather than one-time transactions, while enhancing its ability to deliver fit-for-purpose cohorts that reflect real-world patient journeys at scale.</p> <ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\"><li>https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/autoimmune-disease-therapeutics-market#:~:text=The%20global%20autoimmune%20disease%20therapeutics%20market%20is,to%20approximately%20USD%<percent>20226.2%</percent>20billion%20by%202035.</li><li>https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/autoimmune-diseasesHYPERLINK \"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/auto\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/auto<br/></li></ol> <p><strong>About OneMedNet Corporation</strong></p> <p>OneMedNet is revolutionizing how the world unlocks Real-World Data (RWD), harnessing the untapped potential of over 2,130 healthcare sites through its iRWD™ platform.

As a 360-degree aerial platform, the A1 captures its entire surroundings in high-resolution 8K video. Its dual-lens system, mounted above and below the fuselage, removes the drone from the final footage, enabling creators to capture every angle in a single flight, allowing users to revisit and reframe footage during post-production. This feature can help reduce the need for additional flights, potentially conserving time and battery resources. When paired with Vision Goggles, users can view the footage in an immersive 360-degree environment, freely looking in any direction. With the A1, users move beyond traditional piloting to experience a more dynamic perspective of flight.</p><p>\"Our customers are continually looking for tools that improve efficiency while expanding what's possible from the air,\" said Jeremy Schneiderman, CEO of Drone Nerds. \"The Antigravity A1 addresses both needs by enabling full-scene capture in a single flight and giving creators greater control in post-production. This addition strengthens our product portfolio with a differentiated solution designed for immersive content creation.\"</p><p>\"Partnering with Drone Nerds enables us to bring Antigravity A1 to a broader community of professional creators,\" said Michael Shabun, CEO of Antigravity. \"The A1 represents a new approach to aerial storytelling, designed to give creators greater creative control and flexibility while simplifying the capture process. For hobbyists, it offers a new way to experience the world from an aerial perspective, reflecting the sense of exploration and flight that has inspired generations.\"</p><p><b>Immersive 8K 360 Capture and Intuitive Flight Experience <br/></b>The Antigravity A1 is an all-in-one aerial imaging platform designed to support immersive content creation.

Other revenue, which includes hospitality, freight and licensing, comprised <percent>20.3%</percent> of total F1 revenue.</p><p>There were 24 and 7 races held in the full year and fourth quarter of 2025, respectively, compared to 24 and 6 races held in the full year and fourth quarter of 2024, respectively. In the fourth quarter of both 2025 and 2024, F1 directly promoted the Las Vegas Grand Prix and recognized the revenue (ticketing, sponsorship, hospitality) and costs related to the event.</p><p>Primary F1 revenue grew for the full year with increases across all primary revenue streams. Sponsorship revenue grew due to recognition of revenue from new sponsors, contractual increases from existing sponsors and growth in digital advertising revenue. Media rights revenue increased due to contractual increases in fees, the continued growth in F1 TV subscription revenue and recognition of one-time revenue associated with the F1 movie. Race promotion revenue grew primarily due to contractual increases in fees.</p><p>Primary F1 revenue increased in the fourth quarter primarily driven by one additional race and the higher proportionate recognition of season-based income (7/24 races took place in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to 6/24 in the fourth quarter of 2024) and underlying contractual increases across all primary revenue streams. Additionally, sponsorship revenue grew driven by revenue from new sponsors. Media rights revenue increased due to continued growth in F1 TV.</p><p>Other F1 revenue increased in the full year driven by growth in hospitality revenue, licensing income, freight income and revenue generated from new activities at the Grand Prix Plaza in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nv.lasveg\">Las Vegas</location>. Other F1 revenue increased in the fourth quarter due to higher hospitality revenue, including growth associated with the Las Vegas Grand Prix.</p><p>Operating income and Adjusted OIBDA<sup>(2)</sup> grew for the full year as revenue growth outpaced an increase in team payments, other cost of motorsport revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses. Team payments increased for the full year driven by the growth in F1 profitability and the associated impact on the calculation of the team payments. Team payments as a percent of pre-team payment Adjusted OIBDA decreased from <percent>61.5%</percent> in 2024 to <percent>59.7%</percent> in 2025. Other cost of F1 revenue is largely variable in nature and is mostly derived from servicing both Primary and Other F1 revenue opportunities. These costs increased in the full year primarily due to higher commissions and partner servicing costs associated with servicing Primary F1 revenue streams, increased hospitality and freight costs, increased costs related to servicing the Grand Prix Plaza and higher travel and race promotion costs to support the servicing of new sponsors. Selling, general and administrative expense increased for the full year driven by higher personnel and marketing costs, including costs related to the 75<sup>th</sup> O2 event in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\">London</location>.</p><p>Operating income and Adjusted OIBDA increased in the fourth quarter primarily due to the increase in revenue from one additional race held, offsetting an increase in team payments, other cost of motorsport revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses. Team payments increased due to the higher pro rata recognition of payments across the race season and an increase in team payment costs based on full year results. Other cost of F1 motorsport revenue increased in the fourth quarter primarily due to higher commissions and partner servicing costs and increased travel expenses. Selling, general and administrative expense increased in the fourth quarter primarily due to higher personnel costs.</p><p><span class=\"bwuline\">MotoGP Operating Results</span></p><p>“MotoGP finished 2025 with record attendance and fan engagement and we are confident in our sport’s potential for expansion in existing and new geographies,” said Carmelo Ezpeleta, MotoGP CEO. “We continue investing in our commercial and marketing functions while working to elevate the race experience and diversify our race calendar.

are subject to translational impacts from foreign exchange fluctuations. For constant currency comparison, MotoGP calculates the effects of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the prior period’s currency exchange rates. The table of results above includes both US dollar and constant currency<sup>(4)</sup> growth rates for revenue, Adjusted OIBDA and Operating income (loss).</p><p>Primary MotoGP revenue represents the majority of MotoGP’s revenue and is derived from (i) media rights fees, (ii) race promotion fees and (iii) sponsorship fees. For the year ended December 31, 2025, these revenue streams comprised <percent>41.2%</percent>, <percent>33.7%</percent> and <percent>12.7%</percent>, respectively, of total MotoGP revenue. Other revenue, which includes revenue from ancillary motorcycle racing championships, hospitality and licensing, comprised <percent>12.4%</percent> of total MotoGP revenue.</p><p>There were five races held in the fourth quarter of both 2025 and 2024. There were 22 races held in 2025 and 20 races held in 2024. The 2025 calendar has a different order, mix and number of events compared to the prior year, which impacted season-based revenue recognition as well as year-over-year revenue and cost comparisons.</p><p>Primary MotoGP revenue increased for the full year with increases across all primary revenue streams. Race promotion revenue increased primarily due to two more races held in 2025 and the effect of contractual rate increases. Media rights revenue increased primarily due to contractual increases in fees and growth in VideoPass subscription revenue. Sponsorship revenue increased primarily due to contractual increases. All primary revenue streams benefitted from the impact of favorable currency exchange rates.</p><p>Primary MotoGP revenue increased in the three months ended December 31, 2025 primarily due to an increase in race promotion revenue and the impact of favorable currency exchange rates partially offset by a reduction in media rights and sponsorship revenue. Race promotion revenue increased primarily due to race mix. The decline in media rights revenue was primarily driven by the lower proportionate recognition of season-based income (5 out of 22 races took place in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to 5 out of 20 races in the fourth quarter of 2024). Sponsorship revenue declined primarily due to race-related sponsorship and lower proportionate recognition of season-based income.</p><p>Other MotoGP revenue represents revenue generated from other motorcycle racing championships including the FIM World Superbike Championship (“WorldSBK”), hospitality and licensing revenue. Other MotoGP revenue increased for the full year, primarily driven by hospitality revenue from two additional MotoGP races held and increased attendance and the impact of favorable exchange rates, partially offset by a decrease in contractual fees related to the MotoE Championship (“MotoE”). For the three months ended December 31, 2025, Other MotoGP revenue decreased primarily due to the decline in fees related to WorldSBK, primarily attributable to a one-time termination penalty received in 2024, partially offset by an increase in hospitality revenue and the impact of favorable currency exchange rates.</p><p>Operating income and Adjusted OIBDA increased for the full year. Cost of MotoGP motorsport revenue grew for the year, primarily driven by two additional MotoGP races held as well as a higher mix of overseas races held in 2025, resulting in higher International Road-Racing Teams Association (“IRTA”), freight, hospitality and production costs in addition to unfavorable currency exchange rates. Selling, general and administrative expenses declined slightly for the year, primarily driven by reduced bad debt expense, partially offset by higher marketing and personnel costs and unfavorable currency exchange rates.</p><p>Operating income and Adjusted OIBDA increased during the fourth quarter primarily driven by an increase in motorsport revenue from higher race promotion revenue and a decline in selling, general and administrative expense from reduced bad debt expense. This was partially offset by an increase in cost of MotoGP motorsport revenue primarily driven by a one-time termination penalty related to the cancellation of MotoE and an increase in IRTA costs as well as the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates, partially offset by a decrease in freight costs attributable to a lower mix of overseas races held in the fourth quarter of 2025.</p><p><span class=\"bwuline\">Corporate and Other Operating Results</span></p><p>Corporate and Other revenue grew in the full year and fourth quarter due to the increase in Quint revenue as well as <money><money>$33 million</money></money> and <money><money>$14 million</money></money> of rental income related to the Grand Prix Plaza recognized in the full year and fourth quarter, respectively.

MEASURES</b></p><p>SCHEDULE 1</p><p>To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, this press release includes a presentation of Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, together with reconciliations to operating income, as determined under GAAP. Liberty Media defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, Concorde incentive payments and restructuring, acquisition and impairment charges.</p><p>Liberty Media believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business’ performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Because Adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance, Liberty Media views operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP measure, but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information that Liberty Media's management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of its assets.</p><p>The following table provides a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA for Liberty Media to operating income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP for the three months and years ended December 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.</p><table cellspacing=\"0\"

Sales for the quarter were up <percent>12.2%</percent>, and up <percent>22.4%</percent> for the full year. Excluding the impact of Nissens Automotive, sales for the quarter and year were up <percent>4.3%</percent> and <percent>4.0%</percent>, respectively. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were up <percent>19.1%</percent> for the quarter and <percent>26.8%</percent> for the year.\"</p><p><b>Fourth Quarter Highlights:<br/></b><b>North American Aftermarket</b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li><b>Vehicle Control </b>sales increased <percent>3.3%</percent> in the fourth quarter, with full-year performance of <percent>3.0%</percent> growth. The solid results in the quarter were due to a combination of factors including favorable customer order patterns, general strength across our non-discretionary categories, and the on-going benefit from our customers' footprint expansion activities. Customer POS remained healthy in the quarter, continuing a trend we have seen throughout the year.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Temperature Control</b> sales increased an impressive <percent>5.9%</percent> in the quarter versus a challenging compare of <percent>30%</percent> in last year's fourth quarter and finished the year up <percent>12.2%</percent>. This has been another very strong year for the segment, as the season for this business appears to be starting earlier and lasting longer. In addition to weather patterns that drive demand, we believe our strong brand recognition among professional installers has helped increase our customers' share of the market.<br/><br/></li><li>Both North American aftermarket segments experienced a modest sales lift from tariff passthroughs implemented in the second half of the year, tempered by some compression of gross margins from passing through tariffs at cost.</li></ul><p><b>Nissens<br/></b>Nissens delivered another solid quarterly performance with sales of <money><money>$64.1 million</money></money>. For 2025, Nissens contributed <money><money>$305.4 million</money></money> in sales with an adjusted EBITDA margin of <percent>15.9%</percent>.  Nissens continues to gain share in its markets driven by strong brand awareness and operational excellence, and we expect this outperformance to continue.  In November, we completed our first full year of ownership, and heading into 2026 we expect to begin to realize some of the benefits from synergy and integration efforts, including a modest uplift from recently launched new product categories and expanding growth synergies through cross-selling opportunities.      </p><p><b>Engineered Solutions<br/></b>Engineered Solutions sales saw some rebound in the quarter with <percent>6.3%</percent> growth over last year's quarter, primarily driven by timing of orders in our powersports-related categories. For the full year, the segment posted a <percent>3.8%</percent> decline in sales as it was impacted by cyclical softness across global end markets, but we were pleased to see sequential recovery in the second half of the year. We also made the decision to wind down certain customer programs in the quarter, for which we incurred some one-time costs. We believe the segment has seen demand stabilize and should experience more stable quarterly performance moving into 2026.</p><p><b>Profitability &amp; Balance Sheet<br/></b>Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased to <money><money>$37.4 million</money></money>, an improvement of 130 bps to <percent>9.7%</percent> of net sales.  On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA increased to <money><money>$200.9 million</money></money>, showing an improvement of 160 bps to <percent>11.2%</percent> of net sales, exceeding our guidance of <percent>10.5%</percent> - <percent>11%</percent>.  The increases were driven by strong performance in our North American and Nissens aftermarket businesses. Nissens contributed <money><money>$6.5 million</money></money> and <money><money>$48.5 million</money></money> of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively.        </p><p>From a balance sheet perspective, our cash flows and borrowings were in line with expectations. Total net debt at quarter-end stood at <money><money>$546.7 million</money></money>, primarily reflecting additional borrowings related to our Nissens acquisition and seasonal working capital build. Our debt leverage stood at 2.7x at the end of the quarter and we continue to target reducing debt levels to 2.0x adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2026.              </p><p><b>2026 Guidance<br/></b>Our outlook for the full year of 2026 includes an expectation that sales growth will be in the low to mid-single digit range driven by ongoing tailwinds for professional grade non-discretionary products in the North American aftermarket, continuing momentum in our European business, and while always the most volatile, a more stable performance in Engineered Solutions. Further, we expect Adjusted EBITDA will be in a range of <percent>11.0%</percent>-<percent>12.0%</percent> that should be aided by initiatives we have underway to drive ongoing profitability gains.  As we lap the implementation of tariff-related pricing, we expect a slight increase in sales from higher pricing, but some continued margin compression from pass-through at our cost.  </p><p>This guidance is based on tariffs in place before the recent Supreme Court ruling on IEEPA tariffs and the announcement of new Section 122 tariffs, and any impact thereof.  We will continue to monitor the shifting tariff landscape, and plan to implement changes as necessary.</p><p><b>Dividends<br/></b>The Board of Directors has approved an increase in its quarterly common stock dividend from <money>thirty-one cents</money> per share to <money>thirty-three cents</money> per share, payable on March 2, 2026, to shareholders of record on February 16, 2026. </p><p><b>Closing Remarks<br/></b>In closing, Mr. Sills commented, \"Our North American and Nissens aftermarket businesses led the way in this year's strong performance. The global aftermarket continues to be resilient and demand for our products remains strong, driven by the quality, brand recognition and high levels of customer service we provide. We are optimistic heading into 2026 and think we are well positioned to capitalize on favorable trends to drive growth and increased shareholder value. I would like to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment to our continued success.\"        </p><p><b><i>Conference Call<br/></i></b>Standard Motor Products, Inc. will hold a conference call at 11:00 AM, Eastern Time, on Thursday, February 26, 2026.  This call will be webcast and can be accessed on our website at <a href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4627918-1&amp;h=1782732098&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smpcorp.com%2F&amp;a=www.smpcorp.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.smpcorp.com</a> and clicking on the <a href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4627918-1&amp;h=362346893&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fjoin.eventcastplus.com%2Feventcastplus%2Fstandard-motor-products-4th-quarter-2025-earnings-call&amp;a=SMP+Q4%2725+Earnings+Call\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SMP Q4'25 Earnings Call</a> Webcast link.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><strong>Results from IV Phase 1 SAD/MAD Trial Expected in 2026</strong></p><p align=\"justify\">JERSEY CITY, N.J., Feb.  26, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SCYNEXIS, Inc. (NASDAQ: <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mSeZoQ_cufkP4DI7zTgXRx7C0KjHxTMEVM8XHwRhaB8rdiEO-TM9SF97PVAWYsro9UHP9vh04tSDw1ofkcFgcda0iRk0Ne3fHw4SPV8hzCWf2sdT7G34cnzdPgT28qJ_\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SCYX</a>), a biotechnology company pioneering innovative medicines to overcome and prevent difficult-to-treat and drug-resistant infections, today announced that the first participants have been dosed in a Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) trial evaluating the intravenous formulation (IV) of its second-generation triterpenoid antifungal therapy, SCY-247, which is being developed as a treatment for invasive candidiasis (IC) and as a prophylaxis therapy for invasive fungal disease. Results from this trial are expected in 2026.</p> <p align=\"justify\">“Following the FDA’s recent decision to grant SCY-247 both Qualified Infections Disease Product and Fast Track designations, we are pleased to announce the dosing of the first cohort of participants in our Phase 1 SAD/MAD trial of IV SCY-247,” said David Angulo, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of SCYNEXIS. “An IV formulation of SCY-247 would provide additional flexibility for the optimal management of patients with invasive candidiasis and we are excited by the achievement of this important development milestone, which moves this innovative antifungal closer towards meeting the needs of patients suffering from difficult to treat severe fungal diseases.\"</p> <p align=\"justify\">In September 2025, the Company announced positive SAD/MAD data for the oral formulation of SCY-247, demonstrating its excellent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Oral SCY-247 also achieved target exposures for invasive fungal disease at doses lower than first generation fungerps, which may confer distinct tolerability advantages. Based on its differentiated attributes and its potential role to counter health security threats posed by the continuous rise of antifungal resistance, SCYNEXIS continues to explore potential non-dilutive funding opportunities to further support the SCY-247 program.</p> <p align=\"justify\">On January 21, 2026, the Company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted SCY-247 both Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) and Fast Track designations.</p> <p><strong>About SCYNEXIS</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">SCYNEXIS, Inc. (NASDAQ: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/SCYX/\" title=\"View SCYX stock overview\">SCYX</a>) is a biotechnology company pioneering innovative medicines to help millions of patients worldwide overcome and prevent difficult-to-treat infections that are becoming increasingly drug-resistant. SCYNEXIS is developing the company’s proprietary antifungal platform “fungerps.” Ibrexafungerp, the first representative of this novel class, has been licensed to GSK. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved BREXAFEMME<sup>®</sup> (ibrexafungerp tablets) for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and for reduction in the incidence of recurrent VVC. The second generation fungerp SCY-247 is currently in clinical stages of development and has received QIDP and Fast Track designation from the FDA. Additional antifungal assets from this novel class are currently in pre-clinical and discovery phases.
