As of September 30, 2025, the Company’s portfolio based on fair value consisted of <percent>89.8%</percent> first-lien debt investments, <percent>8.1%</percent> subordinated debt investments, and <percent>2.1%</percent> equity investments.</p><p>As of December 31, 2025 and September 30, 2025, the weighted average Internal Risk Rating of the portfolio at fair value was 4.2 and 4.2 (4.0 being the initial rating assigned at origination), respectively. As of December 31, 2025, there were investments in four portfolio companies on non-accrual status representing <percent>0.5%</percent> of total investments at fair value (or <percent>1.2%</percent> of total investments at cost). As of September 30, 2025, there were investments in three portfolio companies on non-accrual status representing <percent>0.4%</percent> of total investments at fair value (or <percent>0.9%</percent> of total investments at cost).</p><p><b>PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY</b></p><p><b>Full Year</b></p><p>For the year ended December 31, 2025, the Company funded <money><money>$350.7 million</money></money> of portfolio investments and received <money><money>$456.2 million</money></money> of proceeds from principal repayments and sales, compared to <money><money>$863.6 million</money></money> and <money><money>$430.0 million</money></money>, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024.</p><p><b>Fourth Quarter</b></p><p>For the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company funded <money><money>$80.4 million</money></money> of portfolio investments and received <money><money>$84.3 million</money></money> of proceeds from principal repayments and sales, compared to <money><money>$36.3 million</money></money> and <money><money>$61.3 million</money></money>, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2025.</p><p><b>RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FULL YEAR AND FOURTH QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2025</b></p><p><b>Investment Income</b></p><p><b>Full Year</b></p><p>Investment income decreased to <money><money>$207.9 million</money></money> for the year ended December 31, 2025 from <money><money>$224.0 million</money></money> for the year ended December 31, 2024.

As of December 31, 2025, the weighted average yield of our debt and income producing investments decreased to <percent>9.48%</percent> from <percent>10.33%</percent> as of December 31, 2024, at cost, primarily due to overall tightening of spreads in newly originated investments, the refinancing or repricing of existing portfolio companies, and the decline in base interest rates.</p><p><b>Fourth Quarter</b></p><p>Investment income for the three months ended December 31, 2025 was <money><money>$50.0 million</money></money> compared to <money><money>$57.1 million</money></money> for the three months ended December 31, 2024.</p><p><b>Net Expenses</b></p><p><b>Full Year</b></p><p>Net expenses before excise taxes increased to <money><money>$114.3 million</money></money> for the year ended December 31, 2025 from <money><money>$101.1 million</money></money> for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to an increase in management fees and income-based incentive fees. The increase in management fees was primarily attributable to the increase in the management fee base rate from <percent>0.75%</percent> to <percent>1.00%</percent>, effective March 31, 2025, pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement. Additionally, effective March 31, 2025, the Adviser's waiver of incentive fees on income and on capital gains expired pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2025, income-based incentive fees totaled <money><money>$11.2 million</money></money>, of which <money><money>$2.3 million</money></money> was waived during the first quarter of 2025 when the fee waiver was in effect. Interest and debt financing expenses decreased primarily due to a lower average interest rate, partially offset by higher average daily borrowings and one-time costs associated with debt facility refinancings completed during the first quarter of 2025.</p><p><b>Fourth Quarter</b></p><p>Net expenses before excise taxes increased to <money><money>$28.2 million</money></money> for the three months ended December 31, 2025 from <money><money>$26.4 million</money></money> for the three months ended December 31, 2024.</p><p><b>Net Realized Gain (Loss) and Net Change in Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments</b></p><p>For the year ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded a net realized loss on investments of <money><money>$(6.0) million</money></money>, compared to a net realized loss of <money><money>$(13.2) million</money></money> for the year ended December 31, 2024. The net realized loss for the year ended December 31, 2025 was primarily driven by the restructuring of an underperforming debt position, partially offset by realized gains from full or partial repayments and sales of investments in portfolio companies. The Company recorded a net change in unrealized loss of <money><money>$(21.6) million</money></money> for the year ended December 31, 2025, compared to a net change in unrealized gain of <money><money>$7.3 million</money></money> for the year ended December 31, 2024. The increase in total net change in unrealized loss for the year ended December 31, 2025, compared to the total net change in unrealized gain for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily resulted from decreases in fair value of certain underperforming portfolio companies, partially offset by the reversal of unrealized loss on a debt position that was restructured during the year.</p><p>For the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded a net realized gain on investments of <money><money>$2.1 million</money></money> compared to a net realized loss of <money><money>$(11.7) million</money></money> for the three months ended December 31, 2024. The Company recorded a net change in unrealized loss of <money><money>$(7.5) million</money></money> for the three months ended December 31, 2025 compared to a net change in unrealized gain of <money><money>$11.3 million</money></money> for the three months ended December 31, 2024.</p><p><b>Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources</b></p><p>As of December 31, 2025, the Company had <money><money>$62.5 million</money></money> in cash and cash equivalents and <money><money>$1.1 billion</money></money> in total aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding. Subject to borrowing base and other conditions, the Company had approximately <money><money>$259.0 million</money></money> available for additional borrowings under its revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2025. At December 31, 2025, the Company's debt to equity ratio was 1.27x (1.20x net debt to equity ratio) compared to 1.25x (1.20x net debt to equity ratio) at September 30, 2025.</p><p><b>CONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST INFORMATION</b></p><p>Nuveen Churchill Direct Lending Corp. will hold a conference call to discuss its full year and fourth quarter 2025 financial results today at 10:00 AM Eastern Time.

(CSE: LIBR) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/LIBRF/\" title=\"View LIBRF stock overview\">LIBRF</a>) (FSE: W0R0) (\"<b>Libra</b>\" or the \"<b>Company</b>\") is pleased to provide an update on its <percent>100%</percent>-owned Penelope Project (\"<b>Penelope</b>\" or the \"<b>Project</b>\"), located within the Minas Gerais District in Brazil. Following a comprehensive review of historical data and recent geochemical sampling, the Company announces a strategic pivot in its exploration focus at Penelope, upgrading the Project's prospectivity for Rare Earth Elements (REEs), Niobium, Tantalum, and Gallium (Ga), while downgrading its priority as a primary lithium target.</p><p><i>\"Exploration is about listening to what the rocks are telling you, not forcing a model that doesn't fit,\" said Koby Kushner, Chief Executive Officer of Libra. \"While Penelope was originally acquired as part of our wider lithium portfolio, our technical team has identified a distinct geochemical signature that sets it apart. The ratios we are seeing suggest we are looking at a highly fractionated system with significant REE potential, rather than a lithium-bearing pegmatite. Given our focus as a primary lithium explorer, we intend to monetize or option out Penelope to another party with a dedicated focus on REEs.\"</i></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9331/285413_ebbe27af545f2bdc_001full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

Soil sampling across the property has returned consistent anomalies average 230 parts per million (ppm) total REE, indicative of regolith enrichment in a subtropical weathering environment favourable for IAC (Ionic Absorption Clay) style mineralization where REEs can absorb onto clays in deeper horizons. Elevated Gallium is also observed on the Project with returned values of up to <b>65.2 ppm</b> Ga in rock chip samples (Selene target), <b>62 ppm</b> Ga in chip panel samples (Elena target), and <b>43 ppm</b> Ga in soil samples (Nice target). </p><p>Geologically, this signature is characteristic of NYF-type (Niobium-Yttrium-Fluorine) pegmatites or similar REE-enriched systems, rather than the LCT-type (Lithium-Cesium-Tantalum) systems typically associated with bulk spodumene mineralization. As a result, the Company will be deprioritizing lithium-specific workstreams at Penelope. </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9331/285413_ebbe27af545f2bdc_002full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

(TSXV: CNVI) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/CNVIF/\" title=\"View CNVIF stock overview\">CNVIF</a>) (“Conavi” or the “Company”), a medical device company focused on designing, manufacturing, and marketing imaging technologies to guide minimally invasive cardiovascular procedures, today reported financial results and provided an operational update for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2025 (Fiscal Q1 2026).</p> <p>“Conavi is approaching a key inflection point with anticipated U.S. FDA 510(k) clearance of our next-generation Novasight Hybrid™ system in the first half of 2026,” said Thomas Looby, President and Chief Executive Officer of Conavi Medical. “With growing clinical validation, strengthened guideline support, and increased adoption for intravascular imaging by interventional cardiologists in the U.S., we believe Conavi is well-positioned for this next phase of growth.”</p> <p><strong>Fiscal Q1 2026 Business and Operational Highlights</strong><br/><u>Closing of <money>$12M</money> Public Offering</u><br/>On January 13, 2026, Conavi closed its previously announced equity offering for gross proceeds of approximately <money>$12 million</money>. The offering included the issuance of 26,666,670 common shares at a price of <money>$0.45</money> per share. Proceeds will support FDA 510(k) clearance efforts, targeted U.S. market release preparation, and general corporate purposes.</p> <p><u>Peer-Reviewed Publication Highlights Clinical Value of Hybrid Imaging</u><br/>A peer-reviewed publication in Cardiovascular Research demonstrating that a hybrid IVUS-OCT deep-learning classifier outperformed single-modality IVUS, single-modality OCT, and expert readers in plaque characterization. The study analyzed matched histology and hybrid imaging data from 10 cadaveric human hearts and reinforces the clinical value of hybrid intravascular imaging. The publication includes contributions from Dr. Brian Courtney, co-inventor of the hybrid IVUS-OCT technology underlying Conavi’s platform.</p> <p><u>Termination of Outstanding Loan Agreement </u><br/>The Company also announces that it has entered into a termination agreement with MaRS Investment Accelerator Fund Inc. (“MaRS IAF”), pursuant to which the Company and MaRS IAF have agreed to terminate the <money>$270,000</money> loan agreement dated June 1, 2011. Under the termination agreement, the indebtedness will be satisfied through the issuance of 75,000 common shares, which shares shall be subject to a four‑month statutory hold period.</p> <p><strong>Upcoming Conferences</strong><br/>Conavi announces its attendance at LSI USA ’26, taking place March 16–20, 2026, at the Waldorf Astoria Monarch Beach Resort &amp; Club in Dana Point, California.

Operating loss for the quarter was <money>$5.1 million</money>, versus <money>$0.3 million</money> in the prior-year period. Net loss for Fiscal Q1 2026 was <money>$2.7 million</money>, or <money>$0.04</money> per common share, compared to a net loss of <money>$7.0 million</money>, or <money>$0.18</money> per common share, in Fiscal Q1 2025.</p> <p>Cash and cash equivalents were <money>$1.0 million</money> as of December 31, 2025. Subsequent to quarter-end, the Company completed a <money>$12 million</money> equity offering on January 13, 2026.</p> <p>For additional information regarding the Company’s financial performance, including management’s discussion and analysis, readers are encouraged to review Conavi Medical’s filings on SEDAR+ and on the Company’s website at <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=28qFxdI8tti6v7Gw1VoLXMiQLlPPZPyowK1Js-5jrqeBP_1uReWKzkQbdII58ZQ1mCLzPGp7E9E-3mWv1DyCRA==\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.conavi.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>About Conavi Medical</strong><br/>Conavi Medical is focused on designing, manufacturing, and marketing imaging technologies to guide common minimally invasive cardiovascular procedures.

Gross margin expanded to <percent>63%</percent>, driven by favorable product mix and operating leverage. Commercial Channel revenue increased <percent>22%</percent> year over year driven by timing of 2025 shipments to international customers and growth in the Integrity™ Implant System, while OEM Channel revenue declined <percent>12%</percent>, reflecting anticipated U.S. OA Pain Management pricing dynamics.</p> <p>For the full year 2025, total revenue was <money>$112.8 million</money>, a decrease of <percent>6%</percent> compared to 2024, in line with expectations. Commercial Channel revenue increased <percent>15%</percent> year over year, supported by continued Integrity growth and international OA Pain Management performance. OEM Channel revenue declined <percent>17%</percent> for the year driven by lower Monovisc® and Orthovisc® pricing in the U.S. The Company delivered <percent>57%</percent> gross margin for the year and generated <money>$11.2 million</money> in operating cash flow and <money>$4.4 million</money> in free cash flow.</p> <p>“We closed 2025 with a strong fourth quarter, with top‑line growth led by our Commercial Channel and company‑wide results that included expanded gross margin, and positive operating income and free cash flow,” said Steve Griffin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Anika Therapeutics. “Our operating income performance in the fourth quarter and full year underscores the strength of our core OA Pain Management business despite U.S. pricing headwinds in 2025 and establishes a foundation for improved profitability.</p> <p>2025 was an important year for advancing our product portfolio, highlighted by more than doubling Integrity procedures, the filing of the Hyalofast PMA with the FDA, and continued progress on the remaining filing requirements, the toxicity and bioequivalence studies, for the Cingal® NDA. Cingal and Hyalofast remain core strategic priorities for 2026 as we prepare for future U.S. market launches.</p> <p>I’m proud to lead this organization as we build upon a strong foundation and deliver results for patients and shareholders. Looking ahead, our priorities are driving revenue and volume growth, including building on the momentum in our Commercial Channel; advancing our R&amp;D pipeline; and improving execution – supported by rigorous expense management and productivity improvements at our manufacturing facility – to enhance profitability.”</p> <p><strong>Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2025 Business Highlights and Current Business Updates</strong></p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"margin-bottom:2.6pt;\">International OA Pain Management grew <percent>28%</percent> and <percent>12%</percent> in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, led by the international sales team’s continued regional expansion and improved market share.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:2.6pt;\">Integrity continued to demonstrate strong momentum, with procedures increasing for the seventh consecutive quarter and revenue more than doubling in 2025 to <money>$6 million</money>, driven by sustained surgeon adoption in the U.S., new line extensions, and expanding international penetration.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:2.6pt;\">Hyalofast PMA responses were received from the FDA in January 2026 as expected, and the Company is preparing responses to PMA deficiencies.

Furthermore, the Company’s definition of non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company’s reported results of operations, Anika strongly encourages investors to review the Company’s consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because it uses them as supplemental measures in internally assessing the Company’s operating performance, and, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, it is set as a key performance metric to determine executive compensation. The Company also recognizes that these non-GAAP measures are commonly used in determining business performance more broadly and believes that they are helpful to investors, securities analysts, and other interested parties as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period.</p> <p><em>Adjusted EBITDA </em><br/>Adjusted EBITDA is defined by the Company as GAAP net income (loss) from continuing operations excluding depreciation and amortization, interest and other income (expense), income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, and shareholder activism costs.</p> <p><em>Adjusted Net Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations and Adjusted EPS from Continuing Operations</em><br/>Adjusted net income (loss) is defined by the Company as GAAP net income from continuing operations, on a tax effected basis, excluding stock-based compensation. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations is defined by the Company as GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations excluding stock-based compensation.</p> <p>A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations to net income (loss) from continuing operations and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations to diluted EPS from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is shown in the tables at the end of this release.</p> <p><strong>Forward-Looking Statements </strong><br/><em>This press release may contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, concerning the Company's expectations, anticipations, intentions, beliefs or strategies regarding the future which are not statements of historical fact, </em><em>including statements in Mr. Griffin’s quote about revenue and volume growth, the Company’s portfolio and improving profitability, statements about the clinical and regulatory pathway with respect to Hyalofast in the U.S., statements about the anticipated regulatory pathway for the NDA filing for Cingal, statements about potential savings associated with the reduction of general and administrative expenses, statements regarding the timing of the share repurchase program, and statements in the sub-headings and the section titled “Fiscal 2026 </em><em>Guidance” regarding 2026 revenue and adjusted EBITDA</em><em>.

(NASDAQ: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/VCTR/\" title=\"View VCTR stock overview\">VCTR</a>) (“Victory Capital” or the “Company”) today sent another letter to the Special Committee of Janus Henderson Group plc’s (NYSE: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/JHG/\" title=\"View JHG stock overview\">JHG</a>) (“Janus Henderson”) Board of Directors, delivering a fully financed, actionable proposal to acquire Janus Henderson on compelling terms that provide meaningfully higher value than the transaction currently contemplated with Trian Fund Management, L.P. and its affiliated funds (“Trian”).<sup>1</sup></p><p>Under the terms of this “best-of-both-worlds” proposal, Janus Henderson shareholders would receive total consideration of <money><money>$57.04</money></money> per share, consisting of <money><money>$30.00</money></money> in cash and a fixed exchange ratio of 0.350 shares of Victory Capital common stock, based on Victory Capital’s closing stock price as of February 25, 2026. This proposal represents a <percent>37%</percent> premium to Janus Henderson’s unaffected share price as of October 24, 2025 and an approximately <percent>16%</percent> premium to Janus Henderson’s currently contemplated transaction with Trian.</p><p>Following the transaction, Janus Henderson shareholders are expected to own approximately <percent>38%</percent> of the combined company, which would have a total enterprise value of approximately <money><money>$16 billion</money></money>.<sup>2</sup> This would provide substantial potential upside as benefits from synergies and growth are realized, while also delivering significant upfront cash proceeds to Janus Henderson shareholders.</p><p>A combination between Victory Capital and Janus Henderson would build on Victory Capital’s highly successful track record of acquiring and integrating investment firms into its platform, creating a global investment management business with exceptional diversification and distribution capabilities that is better positioned to compete at scale against the largest asset managers in the world. Additionally, Victory Capital’s proposal provides stability for clients as it intends to retain investment professionals, preserve the Janus Henderson brand and minimize disruption.</p><p>Victory Capital strongly believes that its proposal constitutes a “Company Superior Proposal” under the Trian merger agreement due to its higher value and minimal execution risk. Victory Capital has materially improved non-price terms compared to the currently contemplated transaction with Trian, including no financing outs, full specific performance protection for Janus Henderson, a lower client consent closing condition, a lower termination fee, and no requirement for Janus Henderson to make a payment to Victory Capital if Janus Henderson shareholders do not approve the transaction with Victory Capital. Accordingly, Victory Capital believes that the Special Committee should determine that the proposal constitutes (or would reasonably be expected to result in) a “Company Superior Proposal” and engage with Victory Capital as permitted under the merger agreement with Trian.</p><p>David C. Brown, Chairman and CEO of Victory Capital, said, “We are confident that combining Victory Capital and Janus Henderson, two similarly sized, complementary organizations, would create a more competitive platform that would deliver superior value for shareholders, employees and clients alike. Our proposal is fully financed and provides Janus Henderson shareholders with meaningful long‑term upside through ownership of a stronger, more competitive organization. We have a proven track record of successfully and thoughtfully integrating businesses, supporting investment firms, unlocking value through synergy realization, and growth, as recently demonstrated by our acquisition of Pioneer. We firmly believe Janus Henderson stakeholders would similarly benefit from the strategic alignment and long‑term value creation enabled by bringing our two firms together, and are ready to move forward expeditiously toward a transaction.”</p><p>Victory Capital’s November and December 2025 proposals to Janus Henderson’s Special Committee clearly provided superior value to Janus Henderson shareholders. Despite being the only credible, unaffiliated bidder, Victory Capital was not granted any meaningful engagement or any access to information that would have allowed the Company to further refine its proposal before Janus Henderson moved forward with an insider proposal. Victory Capital’s review of Janus Henderson’s and Trian’s public filings released after the announcement of the currently contemplated transaction with Trian has only strengthened Victory Capital’s conviction that it is uniquely positioned to deliver greater value to Janus Henderson and its shareholders.</p><p>Mr. Brown continued, “Despite submitting multiple superior proposals and repeatedly attempting to engage with Janus Henderson prior to the signing of the Trian merger agreement, the Janus Henderson Special Committee declined any meaningful dialogue. The letter we sent to the Special Committee today should clear up any misperception concerning the strength of our proposal and ability to complete a transaction. We believe it is important that both the Special Committee and Janus Henderson investors have correct and complete information about our compelling and actionable proposal. We are confident that a thorough evaluation will demonstrate that our proposal represents a superior alternative with minimal execution risk, and we urge the Janus Henderson Special Committee to fulfill its fiduciary duties and act in the best interest of Janus Henderson shareholders by promptly engaging with us.”</p><p>PJT Partners is serving as financial advisor to Victory Capital and Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher LLP is serving as legal advisor.</p><p>The full text of the letter sent today to Janus Henderson’s Special Committee can be found below:</p><p>February 26, 2026</p><p>To: The Special Committee of the Board of Directors, Janus Henderson Group plc</p><p>We have long believed that a combination of Victory Capital Holdings, Inc. (“Victory”) and Janus Henderson Group plc (“Janus Henderson” or the “Company”) would be transformative for both companies. The combination brings together two industry leaders to create a scaled, more competitive asset manager with exceptional diversification and distribution capabilities. We firmly believe that Victory is the right partner for Janus Henderson, and that a transaction with Victory is undoubtedly the value maximizing path for Janus Henderson shareholders.</p><p>The actionable proposals we put forth on November 24, 2025, December 8, 2025, and December 22, 2025 were clearly superior to any alternative proposals available to Janus Henderson, including the Trian transaction that was announced on December 22, 2025. We provided higher, more compelling value with minimal execution risk and a “best-of-both-worlds” transaction structure, where Janus Henderson shareholders would receive majority upfront consideration in cash while retaining meaningful ownership to participate in significant long-term value creation from synergies and strategic alignment.</p><p>Notwithstanding the fact that we were the only credible, unaffiliated party that expressed interest and indicated a valuation range in excess of Trian’s proposal, we were denied the opportunity to engage in any meaningful dialogue and not provided access to any information to refine our proposal, prior to Janus Henderson entering into an agreement with Trian (a Company insider).</p><p>Having reviewed public filings that have been made available subsequent to the announcement of the Trian transaction – information that could easily have been furnished to us if you had chosen to engage – as well as observing industry developments in the interim, our conviction that we are uniquely positioned to deliver superior value for Janus Henderson and its shareholders has only strengthened.</p><p>As outlined below, we are proposing a higher day one value with no financing risk, opportunity for Janus Henderson shareholders to participate in meaningful upside, and materially improved terms with minimal execution risk.</p><p><b>Proposed Higher Value and “Best-of-Both-Worlds” Transaction Structure</b></p><p>Specifically, our proposal is:</p><ol class=\"bwlistlowroman\"><li>Cash consideration of <money><money>$30.00</money></money> per share</li><li>Fixed exchange ratio of 0.350 of a Victory share for each Janus Henderson share, reflecting <money><money>$27.04</money></money> per Janus Henderson share and translating to <percent>38%</percent> pro forma ownership in the combined company</li></ol><p>This day one value of <money><money>$57.04</money></money> is <percent>16%</percent> higher than the currently contemplated transaction with Trian and at a <percent>37%</percent> premium to the Company’s unaffected share price (as of 10/24/2025). We would also highlight that unlike the Trian offer, our proposal offers attractive premiums consistent with recently announced acquisitions in the industry, for example, the acquisition of Schroders by Nuveen.</p><p>In addition to material upfront consideration delivered in cash, our proposal provides Janus Henderson shareholders significant ownership stake in the pro forma company, allowing them to participate in significant upside as markets recognize the value of the combination. As benefits around synergies and growth are realized and the Victory trading multiple appropriately reflects the pro forma company’s future prospects, Janus Henderson shareholders will share in the meaningful long-term value creation.</p><p><b>Fully Financed Offer with No Financing Risk</b></p><p>We intend to fund the transaction with cash on hand and committed financing. As previously stated, our offer is not subject to any financing conditions. We have attached a customary commitment letter from each of our debt financing sources, consisting of two of the most reputable global investment banks. We will have sufficient committed capital to consummate the proposed acquisition.</p><p>Pro forma for the combination, Victory’s gross leverage will be 3.5x 2025 EBITDA, excluding synergies and 2.6x 2025 EBITDA, including synergies. Based on our review of publicly available information regarding the Trian transaction, we believe our proposed transaction represents lower pro forma leverage versus the currently contemplated transaction (4.6x gross debt, including preferred equity, to 2025 EBITDA).</p><p>Under the contemplated transaction with Trian’s acquisition vehicle, Trian’s sole obligation in the case of a debt financing failure (or a preferred equity financing failure) is to have the vehicle’s various equity investors pay Janus Henderson a <money><money>$222.85m</money></money> “reverse” termination fee (<percent>3%</percent> of equity value as compared to a more customary 5<percent>-6%</percent>); Trian cannot be compelled to close in that situation. Our proposal, in contrast, has no financing outs and provides Janus Henderson with a full specific performance remedy if there were a failure in Victory’s financing.</p><p><b>Setting up the Company for Success</b></p><p>Victory believes that success in asset management relies on the quality and engagement of its people. Victory anticipates retaining substantially all Janus Henderson investment professionals, as we have done in substantially all our prior acquisitions. Our past acquisitions also stand testimony to the fact that once businesses are brought onto the Victory platform, client experience and investment performance have not been disrupted. In our recent acquisition of Pioneer, performance of the platform, which was strong, has further improved under our ownership. Pioneer has also continued to experience organic growth and is net flow positive since the transaction closed, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining excellence of investment teams and processes. More broadly, as a firm, Victory has achieved excellent investment performance, evident in our recent earnings reports.</p><p>In light of Victory’s successful long-term acquisition track record and plans to retain investment professionals, we do not believe that there is any meaningful risk of key employee attrition from our transaction. Further, we believe our revenue share-based compensation structure for investment professionals is highly attractive and a significant opportunity for investment professionals to participate in the success of the platform.</p><p>Following the combination, we also envision retaining key non-investment Janus Henderson employees for meaningful leadership roles. We also intend to retain the brand.</p><p><b>Anticipated Meaningful Synergies and Value Creation</b></p><p>A combination would result in considerable synergies and significant value creation for both companies’ shareholders. Our preliminary estimated cost synergies of <money><money>$500m</money></money> are driven primarily by efficiencies in the middle and back office, operational and administrative infrastructure, vendor consolidation and duplication, and leveraging the economies of scale of the combined platform. Sources of synergies identified here are similar to those in Victory’s past acquisitions and are not likely to cause client concerns.</p><p>Our stellar track record for realizing synergies speaks for itself. In all past transactions, we have not only delivered on meaningful cost synergies but often exceeded what we initially planned. We have also realized meaningful revenue synergies in our previous acquisitions, which have resulted in material upside for shareholders.</p><p>The public market has validated our success:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Victory’s share price increased ~<percent>120%</percent> in the year following the USAA Asset Management announcement and over <percent>800%</percent> to-date.</li><li>Victory’s share price has increased ~<percent>80%</percent> following the announcement of the Pioneer Memorandum of Understanding.</li><li>Victory is the best performing traditional asset manager since its IPO, with a TSR of ~<percent>600%</percent>.</li><li>Moreover, since our MBO in 2013, the TSR is over 2,<percent>000%</percent>.</li><li>Since Trian initially disclosed its investment in Janus Henderson in October 2020, Victory has outperformed Janus Henderson in excess of <percent>200%</percent> TSR for its shareholders.</li></ul><p><b>Minimal Disruption and Client Consent Risk</b></p><p>A combination of both firms lays the strategic foundation for the creation of a diversified global investment management business that is better positioned to compete at scale against the largest asset managers in the world. The combined platform will offer stability and participation in potential long-term value creation for shareholders and employees – key tenets that are absent in a transaction with a financial buyer such as Trian.</p><p>Multiple changes of ownership driven by monetization goals of a financial buyer create uncertainty for clients and employees that will be avoided with Janus Henderson’s inclusion within the Victory platform. As highlighted above, Victory plans to retain and support key investment professionals and minimize any impact on the investment process.</p><p>We also have substantial experience in successfully executing acquisitions requiring client consent. Our Pioneer and USAA Asset Management transactions were acquisitions of asset managers with large mutual fund complexes, and we successfully obtained the required mutual fund consents. With this combination of a successful history of obtaining mutual fund consents and our retaining Janus Henderson investment professionals, we believe that our proposal poses no client concerns. To demonstrate our conviction that our proposal raises no client consent concerns, we will reduce the client closing condition in the merger agreement from the <percent>80%</percent> standard in the Trian agreement to <percent>75%</percent>. This change provides Janus Henderson with meaningfully more closing certainty than the Trian transaction. From our review of the preliminary proxy statement, we note that the <percent>75%</percent> threshold is what the Special Committee had sought from Trian.</p><p><b>Expeditious Due Diligence Timeline</b></p><p>We expect to conduct confirmatory financial, legal, operational and business due diligence.</p><p>Even though we were given no opportunities to conduct due diligence to-date or engage with Company management, we expect to complete our diligence expeditiously and be in a position to enter into a merger agreement shortly thereafter, provided the requisite access to information and Janus Henderson management is provided in a timely manner.</p><p><b>No Trian Voting Agreement Required</b></p><p>Consistent with our proposals on December 8, 2025 and December 22, 2025, we reaffirm that we do not require a voting agreement from Trian to consummate a transaction. With the compelling and superior proposal we are presenting, we are confident that Janus Henderson shareholders will overwhelmingly vote in favor of our transaction and satisfy the two-thirds voting standard for approving a merger under Jersey law. The specter of a <percent>20%</percent> conflicted shareholder should not prevent the board of directors and the Special Committee from acting to provide all Janus Henderson shareholders with the opportunity to receive the benefits of a far superior transaction.</p><p>Our proposal will require a vote of our shareholders to approve the contemplated issuance of shares in the transaction as required under Nasdaq rules. Given the anticipated strength of the combined company, we are confident that our shareholders will approve the issuance of shares just as they overwhelmingly approved our share issuance in our 2025 acquisition of Pioneer.</p><p><b>Improvements to Trian Merger Agreement</b></p><p>The merger agreement for our proposal will be substantially the same as the Trian agreement but will reflect the increase in the purchase price and the stock consideration and reflect the following changes that materially increase deal certainty compared to the Trian deal.</p><p>In our merger agreement, we will:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Decrease the threshold in the client consent condition from the <percent>80%</percent> in the Trian agreement to <percent>75%</percent>.</li><li>Eliminate the unusual provision in the Trian agreement requiring Janus Henderson to pay the buyer <money><money>$111.42m</money></money> in expense reimbursements (a highly off-market <percent>1.5%</percent> of equity value) if Janus Henderson shareholders fail to approve the merger. In our merger agreement, Janus Henderson would not be required to make a payment to us if Janus Henderson shareholders do not approve our transaction.</li><li>Reduce the termination fee from the <percent>4%</percent> in the Trian agreement to the <percent>3%</percent> that the Special Committee sought from Trian.</li><li>Provide Janus Henderson with full recourse against Victory if there were a financing failure as opposed to Janus Henderson’s sole remedy of a <money><money>$222.85m</money></money> reverse termination fee payable by the equity investors in the Trian acquisition vehicle.</li></ul><p><b>No Adjustment to Proposal as a Result of <percent>4%</percent> Termination Fee Payable to Trian Acquisition Vehicle</b></p><p>When the Janus Henderson board terminates the Trian merger agreement to accept our superior proposal, a <money><money>$297.13m</money></money> termination fee (<percent>4%</percent> of equity value) will be due to Trian, a Company insider, under the agreed terms of the Trian merger agreement. This leakage of value to an inside shareholder is unfortunate and could have been avoided had the Special Committee engaged with us prior to signing the merger agreement with Trian. Nonetheless, we have not reduced the value of our proposal, and our <money><money>$57</money></money> per share proposal takes into account that this fee is payable to the Trian acquisition vehicle.</p><p><b>Our Proposed Transaction is a Superior Proposal</b></p><p>For the reasons stated in this letter, we believe that our proposed transaction is a superior proposal to Janus Henderson shareholders compared to the Trian transaction. Consistent with your fiduciary duties as directors and the terms of the Trian merger agreement, we believe your board of directors (acting on the recommendation of the Special Committee) should determine that this proposal constitutes (or would reasonably be expected to result in) a “Company Superior Proposal” (as defined in the Trian merger agreement) and engage in negotiations and discussions with us regarding this proposal and furnish us with information relating to the Company. We are prepared to enter into a confidentiality agreement with the Company in the form contemplated by the Trian merger agreement.</p><p><b>Closing Remarks; Next Steps</b></p><p>We have tremendous respect for Janus Henderson’s global franchise, leadership team, and brand and continue to remain very excited about this opportunity. We hope that this letter clears up any apparent misperceptions concerning the strength of our proposal and ability to complete a transaction. We, and our financial advisor PJT Partners, stand prepared to answer any further questions relating to our proposal.</p><p>We urge the Special Committee to fulfill its fiduciary duties and act in the best interest of Janus Henderson shareholders. Even though we were denied the opportunity to engage previously, the Special Committee can and must now discharge those duties by promptly beginning negotiations with us to deliver superior value to Janus Henderson shareholders.</p><p>We look forward to discussions with you and your advisors.</p><p>Given the market speculation that Victory is “Party A” referred to in your proxy materials and our belief that it is in the best interests of your and our shareholders to have current and complete information about our proposal and the reasons we believe that it is a compelling and actionable opportunity, we plan to make this letter publicly available concurrently with this submission to you.</p><p>This Proposal is solely an indication of interest, and does not constitute an offer, or the solicitation for an offer, or any commitment on our part to submit a definitive proposal at any time in the future or to proceed with any potential transaction. No obligations will be imposed on any person unless and until a written merger agreement that is mutually acceptable is entered into with respect to a transaction.</p><p>Very truly yours,</p><p>Victory Capital Holdings, Inc.</p><p>By: /s/ David C.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><strong id=\"dateline\">TORONTO, ON / <a href=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ACCESS Newswire</a> / February 26, 2026 / </strong><strong>White Gold Corp. (TSX.V:WGO)(OTCQX:WHGOF)(FRA:29W</strong> ) (the \"Company\") is pleased to report additional assay results from its 2025 diamond drilling program at the flagship Golden Saddle and Arc deposits, located on the White Gold Property in west-central Yukon (Figure 1 and 2). Hole WHTGS25D0216 successfully intersected high-grade gold mineralization, returning 3.23 g/t Au over 56.10m, expanding the width of the high-grade core by more than 50m to the west at a vertical depth of 350m, and further demonstrating the potential for additional growth of the high-grade core in multiple directions. The same hole also intersected the Footwall breccia zone beneath the current pit shell, confirming continuity of key mineralization, lithology, and structural features down plunge and along strike. Furthermore, multiple lenses of gold mineralization were intersected in the shallow hanging wall zone, again further supporting recent 3D modeling refinements that capture this mineralization in the hanging wall more consistently, and confirming prospectivity of assaying unsampled historic drill intervals throughout this zone. At the Arc deposit, drilling successfully intersected high grade gold mineralization, including 2.73 g/t Au over 4.35m in WHTAR25D038, as well as multiple other gold intercepts in parallel mineralized panels. Prior to this drilling, Arc mineralization was defined along 1.5 km striking northwest to southeast, and only to an average vertical depth of approximately 120m. These drill results represent the first step in significantly extending Arc mineralization down plunge, which has now been extended by at least 100 m, with the zone remaining open for further expansion. These results form part of the Company's fully funded work program supported by strategic partners including Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (TSX:AEM, NYSE:AEM).</p><p>All of the Company's deposits remain open in multiple directions for further expansion which will be the primary focus of the Company's upcoming fully funded 2026 exploration program. The 2026 exploration program is anticipated to be the largest drill program in the history of the Company and is being designed with the objective of significantly increasing the size of the Company's known large high-grade gold resource and making new gold and critical mineral discoveries across the Company's district scale land package. Further details on the 2026 exploration program will be announced in due course.</p><p>The company's flagship White Gold project hosts four near-surface gold deposits, which collectively contain an estimated 1,732,300 ounces of gold in indicated resources (35.2 million tonnes grading 1.53 grams per tonne gold) and 1,265,900 ounces of gold in inferred resources (32.2 million tonnes grading 1.22 g/t Au), with significant expansion potential on the resource itself and in the immediately surrounding area. The Golden Saddle Main Zone hosts a consistent high-grade core containing 1,100,000 oz Indicated (12.3 Mt @ 2.84 g/t Au) and 93,000 oz Inferred (1.4 Mt @ 2.03 g/t Au) at a 1.0 g/t cut-off. At 3.0 g/t cut-off, this core contains 695,000 oz Indicated (4.4 Mt @ 4.88g/t Au) and 35,000 oz Inferred (269 kt @ 4.07 g/t Au) (see the Company's news release dated October 6, 2025).</p><p>In addition to the White Gold project, the Company's district-scale exploration portfolio comprised of 21 properties includes a robust pipeline of early stage to discovery stage exploration targets, including gold and other critical minerals. Regional exploration work has also produced several new discoveries and prospective targets on the Company's claim packages which border other sizable gold deposits including the Coffee project owned by Fuerte Metals Corporation (TSXV:FMT) and Western Copper and Gold Corporation's (TSX:WRN)(NYSE:WRN) Casino project.</p><p>CEO of White Gold Corp., David D'Onofrio stated \"These results clearly demonstrate that Golden Saddle and Arc deposits remain highly expandable with strong and uniquely high-grade gold continuity. Expanding the Golden Saddle high-grade core and significantly extending the plunge direction at Arc further confirms the geological modelling and validates our strategy of systematically demonstrating resource growth potential. With a fully funded 2026 exploration program being designed to significantly increase resources and make new discoveries on our district scale portfolio in the Yukon's prolific White Gold District, our maiden PEA on track for release in Q2 and several other near term catalysts, we believe that 2026 has the potential to be a transformative year for White Gold Corp.\"</p><p>Dylan Langille, VP of Exploration, added \"The 2025 drilling results successfully achieved our stated goals of proving structural targets and validating recent model refinements as we aim to aggressively grow our total gold resources. Today's announcement demonstrates a significant expansion to the width of the high-grade core by 50m to the west at depth, further validating the potential for additional growth of the high-grade core. As previously released, we also encountered some of the highest grades to date on the project in 2025 (6.89g/t over 50.2m in hole WHTGS25D0218A) providing more evidence of the deposit's unique high-grade potential. At Arc, this was the first meaningful down-plunge test beneath the current resource envelope and it successfully intersected strong mineralization as well as several other parallel panels of mineralization. With multiple zones at Golden Saddle, Arc and our other deposits remaining open and underexplored, we look forward to hitting these deposits with a very sizable drill program in the coming months, and the Company's largest program to date, to further increase the size of the resources and to also drill test other exciting earlier stage targets on our large property package in 2026.\"</p><p><strong><u>Highlights:</u></strong></p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><p><strong>WHTGS25D0216 broadens high-grade core at the Golden Saddle main zone by 50m to the west, intersecting 3.23 g/t Au over 56.10 m at a vertical depth of 350 m (Figure 3 and 4).</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Confirmation of continued mineralization in the footwall breccia with the intersection including the presence of visible gold.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Intersection of multiple lenses of mineralization confirms confidence of hanging wall mineralization recently captured in the new geological model and updated mineral resource estimate. The Hanging Wall Mineralization will be further supported by a relogging and sampling program of significant amounts of historical un-assayed core in the vicinity of previously encountered hanging wall mineralization, which will also aid in the future exploration of these domains at depth.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>100m down-plunge extension of Arc gold mineralization with an intercept of 2.73 g/t over 4.35 m, paving the way for significant growth in 2026 along the deposit's 1.5 km strike length (Figure 5 and 6).</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Given the relatively under drilled nature of each deposit and the understanding of structurally controlled and hosted orogenic gold deposit models, significant growth potential (Figure 7) remains untested at depth and along strike.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Additional exploration results from the Company's exploration program on its district scale portfolio to be released in due course.</strong></p></li></ul><p>To view images, please click below:</p><p><a href=\"https://pr.report/j39k\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">District Mapping</a></p><p><a href=\"https://pr.report/j39l\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Topographic Collar Locations</a></p><p><a href=\"https://pr.report/j39m\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Golden Saddle Main Zone Long Section</a></p><p><a href=\"https://pr.report/j39n\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Cross Section Hole</a></p><p><a href=\"https://pr.report/j39o\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Arc Long Section</a></p><p><a href=\"https://pr.report/j39p\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Cross Section WHTAR25D038_F</a></p><p><a href=\"https://pr.report/j39q\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Resource Growth Potential</a></p><p><strong><u>PDAC 2026</u></strong></p><p>White Gold Corp. will be exhibiting at PDAC 2026 Investors Exchange.

At the Arc deposit drilling was designed to test the down-plunge extent of gold mineralization below 120 m vertical, as well as provide material for metallurgical test work programs as contribution towards a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA), expected to be published in Q2 of 2026.</p><p><strong>Table 1: Significant Intervals</strong></p><div align=\"center\"

zones define mineralization over a 1,500 m strike length and up to a maximum 500 m vertical depth based on drilling done to date, which continues to remain open for expansion in multiple directions. Gold mineralization at the Golden Saddle deposit is hosted in a metavolcanic and metaintrusive assemblage broadly consisting of felsic orthogneiss, amphibolite, and ultramafic units. Gold generally occurs as micron-scale blebs along fractures or encapsulated by pyrite, and as visible gold (less than 5 mm in size) located as free grains in quartz. Mineralization is present in quartz veins and stockwork or breccia with disseminated pyrite. Drill hole intersected gold mineralization is spatially co-incident with structures, or faults which are interpreted to be the primary conduits for hydrothermal fluids responsible for gold deposition. A series of north-south striking thrust faults and a large east-west strike-slip sinistral fault act as both mineralizing pathways and controls on the geometry of gold mineralization. The 2025 drilling program was successful in demonstrating the robust nature of mineralization at all three zones.</p><p><u>Main Zone Mineralization</u></p><p>The Golden Saddle Main Zone hosts a consistent high-grade core containing 1,100,000 oz Indicated (12.3 Mt @ 2.84 g/t Au) and 93,000 oz Inferred (1.4 Mt @ 2.03 g/t Au) at a 1.0 g/t cut-off. At 3.0 g/t cut-off, this core contains 695,000 oz Indicated (4.4 Mt @ 4.88g/t Au) and 35,000 oz Inferred (269 kt @ 4.07 g/t Au). The intersection of 6.89g/t over 50.2 m in hole WHTGS25D0218A (see Company press release dated November 4, 2025), infilled a 75 m gap and increased the grade of this high-grade core. WHTGS25D0216 released herein, intersected 3.23 g/t over 56.10 m, extending the high-grade core 50 metres westward at depth and confirming continuity along the interpreted plunge direction (47° toward 285°). These results demonstrate that the high-grade domain remains open along strike and down plunge.</p><p><u>Foot Wall Mineralization</u></p><p>The high-grade footwall breccia zone that was previously identified in historic drilling, but remained underexplored, was intersected by all three 2025 diamond drill holes targeting the Golden Saddle Deposit. Previously released hole WHTGS25D0218A intersected 6.89 g/t Au over 2.80 m (with roughly 2 m of lost core), while WHTGS25D0216 and WHTGS25D0217 intersected 1.02 g/t Au over 8.85 m and 0.75 g/t Au over 7.00 m, respectively. The consistent geological signature - strongly hematized semi-matrix supported breccia with carbonate veining and fracture-controlled pyrite - confirms the Footwall Zone as a compelling future resource growth target.</p><p><u>Hanging Wall Mineralization</u></p><p>Inthe Hanging Wall Zone, gold mineralization occurs in quartz-carbonate-sulphide veins contained throughout strongly oxidized orthogneiss and amphibolite units. Multiple lenses of parallel gold mineralization have been identified and captured by recent reinterpretation and modelling exercises (see press release dated August 21, 2025). The three Golden Saddle diamond holes drilled in 2025 have intersected multiple very shallow mineralized gold domains that strengthen modelled gold wire frames. The Hanging Wall results outlined in Table 1 reiterate the importance of the relogging and sampling program to be carried out on historic unassayed drill holes.</p><p><strong><u>Arc Deposit</u></strong></p><p>The Arc deposit is located 400 m south of the Golden Saddle and consists of two zones, the Arc Main and Arc Footwall zones, both with an arcuate shape trending E-W and NW-SE and dipping to the north and north-east at approximately 50 degrees. Mineralization at the Arc is defined along a 1.5km strike length and to an average vertical depth of approximately 120 m.</p><p>The 2025 diamond drilling program completed the first meaningful down-plunge test of the system, intersecting 2.73 g/t Au over 4.35m 100 m down plunge, extending the vertical depth of mineralization by nearly double the length. This result opens a substantial vertical growth corridor beneath the existing resource shell. The Arc system remains open below 120 m vertical depth across its entire 1.5km strike length.</p><p><strong><u>2025 Exploration Program Update</u></strong></p><p>The 2025 exploration season was strategically focused on advancing and expanding the Company's flagship White Gold Project, following a renewed emphasis on resource growth opportunities within and adjacent to the existing deposits. The program has been successful in:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><p>Testing the continuity, grade and extent of the high-grade main zone of the Golden Saddle Deposit. Achieving a 50 m expansion to the west at a vertical depth of 350 m with the intersection of 3.23 g/t gold over 56.10 m.</p></li><li><p>Infilled a 75 m gap and increased the grade of the Golden Saddle main zone within 150 m of surface, intersecting one of the best holes to date with WHTGS25D0218A returning 6.89 g/t over 50.1 m (see press release dated November 4, 2025)</p></li><li><p>Confirming the potential for high-grade ore bodies to exist internal to the broader mineralization envelope, with significant room to test for growth / expansion down plunge and along strike.</p></li><li><p>Intersecting high-grade mineralization 100 m down plunge on the Arc Deposit for the first time, breaking way for significant down=plunge growth along a 1.5 km strike length.</p></li><li><p>Delivering material across all four deposits (Golden Saddle, Arc, Ryan's Surprise, and VG) for metallurgical test work programs contributing to maiden PEA (Preliminary Economic Assessment) to be release in Q2 2026.</p></li></ul><p>These results validate the technical strategy implemented this year, which targeted the footwall breccia, multiple hanging wall zones, and high-grade core continuity at Golden Saddle. It has demonstrated the presence of multiple parallel zones of mineralization that remain open along strike and at depth, supporting confidence for targeted resource growth. The Company's Phase II work has also advanced key metallurgical and geotechnical studies across the Golden Saddle and Arc deposits in preparation for a future preliminary economic assessment (PEA), while district-wide data compilation and target generation continued in parallel to define the next pipeline of drill-ready prospects.</p><p>The success of the 2025 drilling reinforces the excellent exploration potential that remains across the White Gold Project and provides a strong foundation for the Company's fully funded 2026 exploration program currently being designed following the completion of a <money>$23 million</money> private placement (see Company press release dated October 15, 2025). These results mark an encouraging start to the next chapter of systematic resource expansion and discovery across the Company's district-scale portfolio in Yukon's premier mining jurisdiction.</p><p>Phase I of the 2025 exploration program is a continuation of the Company's successful expanded exploration focus beyond gold, targeting critical metals including copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), antimony (Sb) and bismuth (Bi) amongst others. Geophysical work was conducted on three of the Company's highly prospective critical mineral targets - the Bridget target on the Pedlar Property, the Guilder target of the Loonie Property, and the Mt. Hart target on the Nolan Property. The program included both gradient and dipole-dipole induced polarization (IP) surveys designed to refine high-priority porphyry style targets for drill testing. Results on the Bridget target of the Pedlar property (see Company press release dated December 16, 2025) demonstrated favourable chargeability and resistivity anomalies favourable for porphyry style mineralization systems residing directly beneath strong surface soil geochemistry signatures. Results from the other two properties are expected to be released in the near future.</p><p><strong><u>Preliminary 2026 Outlook</u></strong></p><p>Heading into 2026 with a fully funded exploration program significantly larger than the previous years, the primary objective remains resource growth and expansion within, adjacent and in close proximity to the Golden Saddle, Arc, Ryan's Surprise, and VG deposits. All four deposits remain open for expansion along strike and down-dip. In addition to resource growth, the company will look to advance discovery-stage targets such as Betty Ford, Vertigo, and Chris Creek as well as assess high priority early-stage prospects for discovery potential. In addition, the Company is working toward a maiden Preliminary Economic Assessment on the White Gold Project, expected to be released in Q2 of 2026.</p><p><strong><u>Resource Growth</u></strong></p><p>All four of White Gold's near-surface deposits, which form the <strong>White Gold Project</strong> , are interpreted to represent <strong>structurally controlled orogenic gold systems</strong> . These deposits collectively form the Company's gold resource base in the heart of its extensive land package and all <strong>remain open for expansion</strong> . Additional information on each of these deposits can be found below.</p><p><u>Golden Saddle Deposit</u></p><p>The Golden Saddle contains an open-pit resource of 1.614 M oz Indicated (31.03 Mt @ 1.62 g/t Au) and 268.7 k oz Inferred (7.84 Mt @ 1.07 g/t Au) defined by 210 drill holes for a total of approximately 61,000 m. Significant growth opportunity exists with parallel zones of mineralization in the hanging wall and footwall zones, the plunge of the high-grade ore shoots, and extension along strike toward Golden Saddle West and beyond.</p><p><u>Arc Deposit</u></p><p>The Arc deposit contains 115,800 oz Indicated (4.113 Mt @ 0.88 g/t Au) and 397,000 oz Inferred (12.25 Mt @ 1.01 g/t) across a 1.5 km strike length and down to an average vertical depth of approximately 100 m defined by 73 drill holes for a total of approximately 15,000 m. Limited drilling on mineralization, particularly below 120 m vertical, presents an exceptional potential growth opportunity to add additional ounces to the mineral resource estimate.</p><p><u>VG Deposit</u></p><p>The VG deposit is located approximately 85 km south of Dawson City and 11 km north of the Golden Saddle deposit. Gold mineralization at the VG deposit is hosted in quartz ± carbonate veins, stockwork and breccia zones, and pyrite veinlets, including cubic pyrite and visible gold, associated with intense-quartz-carbonate-sericite alteration, pervasive K-spar and hematite emplaced along en-echelon faults or shear zones. Visually, the style of gold mineralization and alteration appears identical to the Golden Saddle deposit, along with similar dominant host rocks of biotite-feldspar (± augen)-quartz gneisses.</p><p>To date, the VG deposit comprises 296,000 oz Inferred (6.285 Mt @ 1.46 g/t Au) defined by 65 drill holes for a total of approximately 7,600 m. Gold mineralization is modelled to a maximum vertical depth of 200 m, with the geometry of the modelled mineralization being cone shaped due to limited drilling across the deposit. A large drill campaign in 2026 will look to deliver meaningful growth to the existing resource estimate as well as explore additional targets on the QV Property, including the Chris Creek target.</p><p><u>Ryan's Surprise Deposit</u></p><p>Ryan's Surprise is located 1.5 km west of the Golden Saddle deposit, along a 6.5 km long x 1 km wide north-northwest trend of anomalous gold and arsenic in soils (\"Ryan's Trend\"), which also hosts several other prospective early-stage targets in close proximity with significant surface gold mineralization and represent further potential for expansion of this project. Gold mineralization at the Ryan's Surprise deposit is primarily hosted within a meta-sedimentary sequence dominated by banded (graphitic) quartzite and interbedded pelitic biotite schist cross-cut by numerous felsic - intermediate dikes and sills. Gold mineralization appears to be focused within breccia and shear zones that have been affected by hydrothermal alteration and sulphide mineralization.</p><p>The mineralization footprint at the Ryan's Surprise deposit measures approximately 550 m north-south by 500 m east-west to a vertical depth of 650 m remains open along strike and at depth. To date, the Ryan's Surprise deposit contains 280,300 oz Inferred (5.693 Mt @ 1.53 g/t Au) defined by 35 drill holes for a total of approximately 8,370 m.</p><p><strong>Overall, given the relatively under drilled nature of each deposit and the understanding of structurally controlled and hosted orogenic gold deposit models, significant growth potential remains untested at depth and along strike.</strong></p><p><strong><u>Discovery-Stage Projects</u></strong></p><p><u>QV Property and Chris Creek Target</u></p><p>The Chris Creek target forms a 2.2 km+ long east-northeast trending gold-in-soil anomaly, located approximately 9 km northwest of the VG deposit and appears to be similar geochemically to the Company's VG and Golden Saddle deposits. The anomaly was originally identified in 2023 and follow-up exploration work early in the 2024 field season included infill and extension soil sampling, rock sampling, and 2D inversions of ground VLF-EM survey lines.</p><p>A maiden 2024 diamond drill program at Chris Creek identified a broad zone of gold mineralization dipping moderately (30°) to the NNW (see Company press release dated February 27, 2025). The geological features of Chris Creek closely resemble those of the Golden Saddle and VG deposits, all of which remain open for expansion. At Golden Saddle and VG, gold is hosted within brittle-ductile fault zones, quartz vein breccias, and stockwork veining, like the structures seen at Chris Creek. Initial rock sampling results suggest Chris Creek shares many of the same features as the Golden Saddle and VG deposits. The strong similarities between Chris Creek, which remains underexplored and open for expansion, and the established Golden Saddle and VG deposits, represent substantial potential for future discoveries within the Chris Creek system. With multiple mineralization styles (Au-Te-Ag, As-Sb, Mo-bearing quartz-carbonate veins, and skarn) across a large structural corridor, there is significant opportunity for continued geophysical surveys, trenching, and drilling to further define and expand the mineralized zones.</p><p><u>Betty Property</u></p><p>The Betty Property represents one of the Company's most strategically positioned and geologically compelling discovery-stage assets in the White Gold District. Located along the eastern strike extension of the Coffee Creek Fault - the principal structural control on Fuerte Metals's multi-million-ounce Coffee deposit - Betty occupies a highly prospective corridor between the Coffee gold deposit and Western Copper and Gold's Casino porphyry system.</p><p>Drilling at the Betty Ford target which is located in close proximity to the Coffee Project has consistently returned broad zones of near-surface high grade gold mineralization hosted within polylithic breccia units along east-west splay structures related to the Coffee Creek Fault. Recent diamond drilling has delivered multiple significant intercepts including:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><p>3.38 g/t Au over 53 m</p></li><li><p>2.96 g/t Au over 46.5 m including 5.03 g/t Au over 25 m</p></li><li><p>5.04 g/t Au over 20.85 m</p></li><li><p>3.46 g/t Au over 50 m</p></li><li><p>8.94 g/t Au over 18.29 m</p></li></ul><p>Mineralization remains open for expansion, with gold traced approximately 175 m along strike and to 75 m vertical depth to date. The scale and consistency of near-surface mineralization suggest strong potential for a bulk-tonnage style system with room for expansion.</p><p>Beyond Betty Ford, the property hosts multiple additional high-priority targets including Betty Ford West, Mascot, Black Betty, and Betty White East - each defined by strong gold-in-soil anomalies and structural controls along the Coffee Creek Fault corridor.</p><p>The Betty Property offers exposure to multiple deposit styles including orogenic gold, intrusion-related gold systems, and porphyry copper-gold mineralization, positioning it as a potential new district-scale discovery opportunity within the Company's broader land package.</p><p><u>Vertigo Target</u></p><p>The Vertigo target, located on the JP Ross property approximately 75 km south of Dawson City, represents an advanced discovery-stage gold system characterized by multiple mineralized structures over a 1.5 km by 650 m corridor.</p><p>Vertigo comprises at least six west-northwest striking, steeply south-dipping mineralized structures consisting of quartz veining, brecciation, and fracture-controlled sulphide mineralization including arsenopyrite, galena, and pyrite with locally visible gold.</p><p>Historical RAB and RC drilling has returned significant near-surface high-grade intercepts including:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><p>23.44 g/t Au over 24.38 m from surface</p></li><li><p>9.46 g/t Au over 22.86 m from surface</p></li><li><p>14.23 g/t Au over 6.10 m</p></li><li><p>8.11 g/t Au over 18.29 m</p></li></ul><p>More recently, diamond drilling confirmed the presence of broader bulk-tonnage style mineralization, including:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><p>1.4 g/t Au over 58.4 m, including 9.10 g/t Au over 2.85 m and 6.68 g/t Au over 4.80 m</p></li></ul><p>Structural reinterpretation has identified multiple vein arrays with varying orientations, suggesting previous drilling only partially tested the system. The target remains largely shallow-tested and open along strike and at depth. Given the combination of high-grade vein zones and emerging bulk-tonnage potential, Vertigo represents a compelling 2026 drill candidate with significant discovery upside.</p><p><strong><u>Resources &amp; Opportunities in the White Gold District</u></strong></p><p>West-central Yukon is host to several highly prospective mineral districts, including the <strong>White Gold</strong> , <strong>Dawson Range</strong> , <strong>Klondike</strong> , and <strong>Sixtymile</strong> districts. The Klondike was the epicenter of the historic Klondike Gold Rush in 1896, with over <strong>20 million ounces of placer gold</strong> production having occurred in the region since that time.</p><p>The Company's property portfolio, which covers large portions of the White Gold District, was assembled by renowned prospector <strong>Shawn Ryan</strong> , and represents the <strong>largest contiguous claim package</strong> in the region.</p><p>Two other significant advanced-stage projects border the Company's claims to the south:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><p>The <strong>Coffee Project</strong> , owned by <strong>Fuerte Metals</strong> with Measured and Indicated Resources of 80.0.2 Mt grading 1.15 g/t Au for 2.96 million ounces of gold, and Inferred Resources of 21.2 Mt grading 1.17 g/t Au for 0.80 million ounces gold<sup> (2) (3)</sup> .

Analytical work on the half core was performed by Bureau Veritas, an internationally recognized analytical services provider, at its South Vancouver, British Columbia laboratory. Sample preparation was carried out at its Whitehorse, Yukon facility. All diamond drill core samples were prepared using the PRP70-250 package, where samples were weighed, dried, and crushed to greater than <percent>70%</percent> passing a 2mm sieve, then pulverized to greater than <percent>85%</percent> passing 75 microns. Samples were then analyzed in accordance with BV's FA430 and MA250 packages, for both gold analysis by fire assay (30g fire assay with AAS finish) and ultra-trace multi-element ICP analysis (0.25g, 4 acid digestion and ICP-MS analysis).</p><p>The reported diamond drilling sampling program was completed using industry standard procedures, including a quality assurance/quality control (\"QA/QC\") program consisting of insertion of standard, blank, and duplicate samples into the sample stream.

Forward-looking statements convey management’s expectations as to the future of HGV, and are based on management’s beliefs, expectations, assumptions and such plans, estimates, projections and other information available to management at the time HGV makes such statements. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts, and may be identified by terminology such as the words “outlook,” “believe,” “expect,” “potential,” “goal,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “seeks,” “approximately,” “projects,” “predicts,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “future,” “guidance,” “target,” or the negative version of these words or other comparable words, although not all forward-looking statements may contain such words. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release include statements related to HGV’s revenues, earnings, taxes, cash flow and related financial and operating measures, and expectations with respect to future operating, financial and business performance and other anticipated future events and expectations that are not historical facts.</p><p>HGV cautions you that our forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those that are beyond HGV’s control, which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from the future results. Any one or more of these risks or uncertainties, could adversely impact HGV’s operations, revenue, operating profits and margins, key business operational metrics, financial condition or credit rating.</p><p>For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in HGV’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, which may be supplemented and updated by the risk factors in HGV’s quarterly reports, current reports and other filings HGV makes with the SEC.</p><p>HGV’s forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this communication or as of the date they are made. HGV disclaims any intent or obligation to update any “forward-looking statement” made in this communication to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time.</p><p><b>Presentation of Financial Information</b></p><p>Financial information discussed in this press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures such as Adjusted Net Income or Loss, Adjusted Net Income or Loss Attributable to Stockholders, Adjusted Diluted EPS, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Attributable to Stockholders, EBITDA profit margin, Adjusted EBITDA profit margin, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, profits and profit margins for HGV’s key activities - real estate, financing, resort and club management, and rental and ancillary services.</p><p>Please see the tables in this press release and “Definitions” for additional information and reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures.</p><p>These non-GAAP financial measures differ from reported GAAP results and are intended to illustrate what management believes are relevant period-over-period comparisons. The Company believes these additional measures are also important in helping investors understand the performance and efficiency with which we are able to convert revenues for each of these key activities into operating profit, both in dollars and as margins, and are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as one of common performance measures to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry. Management also internally uses these measures to assess our operating performance, both absolutely and in comparison to other companies, and in evaluating or making selected compensation decisions. Exclusion of items in the Company's non-GAAP presentation should not be considered an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.</p><p>The Company refers to Adjusted EBITDA guidance excluding deferrals and recognitions, which does not take into account any future deferrals of revenues and direct expenses related to the sales of VOIs under construction that are recognized, only on a non-GAAP basis, as the quantification of reconciling items to the most directly comparable <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> GAAP financial measure is not readily available without unreasonable effort due to uncertainties associated with the timing and amount of such items.

Fee-for-service commissions represents Fee-for-service commissions, package sales and other fees, which corresponds to the applicable line item from our consolidated statements of income, adjusted by marketing revenue and other fees earned primarily from discounted marketing related packages which encompass a sales tour to prospective owners. <b>Real estate expense</b><i> </i>represents costs of VOI sales and <b>Sales and marketing expense, net.</b> Sales and marketing expense, net represents sales and marketing expense, which corresponds to the applicable line item from our consolidated statements of income, adjusted by marketing revenue and other fees earned primarily from discounted marketing related packages which encompass a sales tour to prospective owners. Both fee-for-service commissions and brand fees and sales and marketing expense, net, represent non-GAAP measures. We present these items net because it provides a meaningful measure of our underlying real estate profit related to our primary real estate activities which focus on the sales and costs associated with our VOIs.</p><p><b>Real estate profit</b> represents sales revenue less real estate expense. Real estate margin is calculated as a percentage by dividing real estate profit by sales revenue. We consider real estate profit margin to be an important non-GAAP operating measure because it measures the efficiency of our sales and marketing spending, management of inventory costs, and initiatives intended to improve profitability.</p><p><b>Financing profit</b> represents financing revenue, net of financing expense, both of which correspond to the applicable line items from our consolidated statements of income. Financing profit margin is calculated as a percentage by dividing financing profit by financing revenue. We consider this to be an important non-GAAP operating measure because it measures the efficiency and profitability of our financing business in connection with our VOI sales.</p><p><b>Resort and club management profit</b> represents resort and club management revenue, net of resort and club management expense, both of which correspond to the applicable line items from our consolidated statements of income. Resort and club management profit margin is calculated as a percentage by dividing resort and club management profit by resort and club management revenue. We consider this to be an important non-GAAP operating measure because it measures the efficiency and profitability of our resort and club management business that support our VOI sales business.</p><p><b>Rental and ancillary services profit</b> represents rental and ancillary services revenues, net of rental and ancillary services expenses, both of which correspond to the applicable line items from our consolidated statements of income. Rental and ancillary services profit margin is calculated as a percentage by dividing rental and ancillary services profit by rental and ancillary services revenue. We consider this to be an important non-GAAP operating measure because it measures our ability to convert available inventory and unoccupied rooms into revenue and profit by transient rentals, as well as profitability of other services, such as food and beverage, retail, spa offerings and other guest services.</p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">Real Estate Metrics</span></b></p><p><b>Contract sales </b>represents the total amount of VOI products (fee-for-service, just-in-time, developed, and points-based) under purchase agreements signed during the period where we have received a down payment of at least <percent>10%</percent> of the contract price. Contract sales differ from revenues from the Sales of VOIs, net that we report in our consolidated statements of income due to the requirements for revenue recognition, as well as adjustments for incentives. While we do not record the purchase price of sales of VOI products developed by fee-for-service partners as revenue in our consolidated financial statements, rather recording the commission earned as revenue in accordance with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> GAAP, we believe contract sales to be an important operational metric, reflective of the overall volume and pace of sales in our business and believe it provides meaningful comparability of HGV’s results the results of our competitors which may source their VOI products differently. HGV believes that the presentation of contract sales on a combined basis (fee-for-service, just-in-time, developed, and points-based) is most appropriate for the purpose of the operating metric; additional information regarding the split of contract sales, included in “—Real Estate” included in Item 7 in the Annual Report on form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025.

Our results for the fourth quarter yet again exceeded our guidance, with revenue reaching <money><money>$177.2 million</money></money>, bringing our full-year revenue to <money><money>$614.8 million</money></money>. This represents a remarkable <percent>28%</percent> year-over-year increase, driven by successful growth in both advertising and query revenue, fueled by in particular e-commerce and expanding our monetization of user intent. We have paired this rapid growth with strong profitability, generating full-year adjusted EBITDA of <money><money>$142.5 million</money></money>. These results demonstrate the strength of our business model as we continue to scale efficiently while returning significant value to our shareholders. To further underscore our strong cash generation and confidence in Opera's future, our Board has authorized a major <money><money>$300 million</money></money> share repurchase program, which will serve as a powerful complement to our recurring dividend,\" said Lin Song, CEO.</p><p>\"With Opera browsers having always been tailored for the most demanding users, we are excited about our opportunity to create the best orchestration layer possible for end-users to benefit from the rapidly expanding ecosystem of AI platforms and services. We are excited about our industry partnerships in this space, and how we leverage third-party LLMs and our agentic based engine to provide a native AI experience directly from the browser — one that is context-aware while maintaining privacy and control in the hands of our users. We've redefined the browsing experience with the launch of two new browsers in 2025, Air and Neon, tailored to distinct audiences in the same way as Opera One and Opera GX. Beyond the browser, our MiniPay <span>wallet</span> has seen explosive growth, reaching 13 million activated wallets. Through our expanded partnership with <span>Tether</span> we are providing seamless financial access and innovative digital utility to emerging markets globally,\" continued Mr.

Following the call, a replay will be available at the same website.</p><p>We also provide announcements on our investor relations website at <u><a href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4628151-1&amp;h=253496995&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.opera.com%2F&amp;a=investor.opera.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">investor.opera.com</a></u> regarding our financial performance and other matters, including SEC filings, press releases, slide presentations, business blog posts and information on corporate governance.</p><p><b><u>Non-IFRS Financial Measures</u></b></p><p>In addition to revenue, net income, net cash flow from operating activities and other financial measures presented in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, we use adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted diluted earnings per share and free cash flow from operations to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance, and allocate resources. We believe adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of recurring core business operating results. We believe free cash flow from operations provides useful information regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, and for distributions to our shareholders, even though free cash flow from operations does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.</p><p>We define adjusted net income as net income excluding (i) profit (loss) from discontinued operations, (ii) gain (loss) on investments in unconsolidated entities, (iii) non-recurring expenses, (iv) impairment of non-financial assets, (v) amortization of acquired intangible assets, (vi) share-based compensation expenses, and (vii) the income tax effect of these adjustments. Adjusted net income margin is calculated as adjusted net income divided by revenue, whereas adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated as adjusted net income divided by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding.</p><p>We define adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding (i) profit (loss) from discontinued operations, (ii) income tax expense, (iii) net finance income (expense), (iv) gain (loss) on long-term investments in unconsolidated entities, (v) non-recurring expenses, (vi) impairment of non-financial assets, (vii) depreciation and amortization, (viii) share-based compensation expenses, and (ix) other operating income. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.</p><p>We define free cash flow from operations as net cash flows from (used in) operating activities less (i) purchases of fixed and intangible assets, (ii) development expenditure and (iii) payment of lease liabilities.</p><p>We believe the non-IFRS financial measures defined above are useful to investors both because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and because they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. However, these non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered substitutes for, or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. Our calculations of adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted diluted earnings per share and free cash flow from operations may differ from similarly-titled non-IFRS measures, if any, reported by our peers. In addition, the non-IFRS financial measures may be limited in their usefulness because they do not present the full economic effects of certain items of income, expenses and cash flows. We compensate for these limitations by providing reconciliations of our non-IFRS financial measures to the most closely related financial measures in IFRS Accounting Standards in the section titled \"Reconciliations of Non-IFRS Financial Measures\" included at the end of this earnings press release. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our reported non-IFRS financial measures in conjunction with net income and net cash flow from operating activities.</p><p><b><u>Forward-Looking Statements</u></b></p><p>This press release contains statements of a forward-looking nature.

As a result commission revenue and the associated ceding commission expense for policies issued through the Markel Fronting Arrangement will be eliminated in consolidation. Although we expect the arrangement to result in increased profitability (as reflected in Adjusted EBITDA), reported commission revenue and ceding commission expense will be significantly lower than prior periods, affecting period-to-period comparability. 2025 commission revenue associated with our alliance agreement with Markel was <money><money>$437 million</money></money> and ceding commission expense related to the Company's reinsurance quota share agreement with Markel was <money><money>$344 million</money></money> in 2025.</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"prngen22\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\"><sup>2</sup></span></p></td><td class=\"prngen22\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"prnml4\"><span class=\"prnews_span\">The projected Net Loss includes approximately <money><money>$190 million</money></money> of transitional, non-cash costs related to the Markel Fronting Arrangement representing deferred ceding commissions paid to Markel in 2025 for policies written prior to January 1, 2026, which will be fully amortized ratably over the remaining term of those policies throughout 2026.

All statements we provide, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements, including those regarding Hagerty's future operating results and financial position, Hagerty's business strategy and plans, products, services, and technology implementations, market conditions, growth and trends, expansion plans and opportunities, and Hagerty's objectives for future operations. The words \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"envision,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"plan,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"target,\" \"potential,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"continue,\" \"ongoing,\" \"contemplate,\" and similar expressions, and the negatives of these expressions, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.</p><p>Hagerty has based these forward-looking statements largely on current expectations about future events, which may not materialize. Actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in forward-looking statements. These factors include, among other things, Hagerty's ability to: (i) compete effectively within Hagerty's industry and attract and retain insurance policyholders and paid Hagerty Drivers Club (\"HDC\") subscribers; (ii) maintain key strategic relationships with Hagerty's insurance distribution and underwriting carrier partners; (iii) prevent, monitor, and detect fraudulent activity; (iv) manage risks associated with disruptions, interruptions, outages, or other issues with Hagerty's technology platforms or use of third-party services; (v) accelerate the adoption of Hagerty's membership and marketplace products and services, as well as any new insurance programs and products offered; (vi) successfully implement the fronting arrangement consummated with Markel and realize the anticipated benefits while also managing the increased exposure to underwriting volatility, catastrophes, reinsurance counterparty risk, and legal, compliance, and regulatory risks resulting from the shift to Hagerty Re assuming <percent>100%</percent> of the risk for policies written through this arrangement; (vii) underwrite and price new products, including Enthusiast+, consistent with expected loss ratios and risk tolerances; (viii) execute Broad Arrow's private sale, auction, and financing strategies; (ix) manage the cyclical nature of the insurance business and broader macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, and potential recessionary pressures; (x) achieve Hagerty's investment objectives and avoid losses in the investment portfolio; (xi) address unexpected increases in the frequency or severity of claims, including catastrophe losses; and (xii) comply with numerous laws and regulations applicable to Hagerty's business, including without limitation state, federal, and foreign laws relating to insurance and rate increases, privacy and cybersecurity, marketing and advertising, digital services, accounting matters, tax, anti-money laundering, and economic sanctions.</p><p>The forward-looking statements in this release represent Hagerty's views as of the date hereof. You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment and new risks emerge from time to time. This presentation should be read in conjunction with the information included in filings with the SEC and press releases. Understanding the information contained in these filings is important in order to fully understand Hagerty's reported financial results and business outlook for future periods.

income, excluding Interest expense and other, net, Income tax expense (benefit), and Depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, further adjusted to (i) exclude net investment gains and losses; (ii) deduct interest expense related to the State Farm Term Loan; (iii) exclude net gains and losses related to our warrant liabilities prior to the Warrant Exchange; (iv) exclude share-based compensation expense; and when applicable, exclude (v) restructuring, impairment and related charges; (vi) gains, losses and impairments related to divestitures; and (vii) certain other unusual items.</p><p><i>How This Measures is Useful</i></p><p>When used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of operating performance that we believe is a useful measure to evaluate our performance period over period and relative to our competitors and peers. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance on a consistent basis, as it removes the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations. We believe the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties with a supplemental view of our operating performance that enhances their understanding of our business and our results operations, as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic initiatives.</p><p><i>Limitations of the Usefulness of This Measure</i></p><p>Adjusted EBITDA may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation, which could reduce the usefulness of this non-GAAP financial measure when comparing our performance to that of other companies. Presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be considered in isolation or a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

In addition, we revised and renamed our non-GAAP measure previously titled \"Adjusted EPS\" to \"Adjusted Diluted EPS\". The revised measure uses Adjusted Net Income as the numerator in the calculation and updated the most comparable GAAP measure from Basic EPS to Diluted EPS. We believe that the revised calculation better reflects the potential dilution from these securities and enhances comparability with industry peers.</p><p>Adjusted Net Income represents Net income attributable to Class A Common Stockholders, assuming the full exchange of all outstanding THG units and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for shares of Class A Common Stock, adjusted to exclude (i) net investment gains and losses; (ii) changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities prior to the Warrant Exchange; (iii) changes in the TRA Liability; (iv) gains and losses related to divestitures; and (v) certain other unusual items, each of which we do not believe are directly related to our core operations and may not be indicative of our ongoing performance. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the weighted average shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding, assuming the full exchange of all outstanding THG units, Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, and unvested share-based compensation awards. Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for additional information regarding the Warrant Exchange.</p><p><i>How These Measures Are Useful</i></p><p>When used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS are supplemental measures of operating performance that we believe are useful measures to evaluate our performance period over period and relative to our competitors and peers. Management uses Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS to evaluate our operating performance on a consistent basis to make strategic and operational decisions. We believe these measures provide management and investors with useful information regarding trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures. By assuming the full exchange of all outstanding THG units and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, we believe these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies that have different organizational and tax structures, as well as comparisons period over period because it eliminates the effect of any changes in Net income attributable to Class A Common Stockholders driven by increases in Hagerty, Inc.'s ownership in THG, which is unrelated to our operating performance, and excludes items that are unusual or may not be indicative of our ongoing performance.</p><p><i>Limitations of the Usefulness of These Measures</i></p><p>Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Presentation of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS should not be considered alternatives to Net income attributable to Class A Common Stockholders and Diluted EPS, as determined under GAAP. While these measures are useful in evaluating our performance, they assume the full exchange of all outstanding THG units and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for shares of Class A Common Stock, which has not occurred and may not occur. Further, the adjustments made to arrive at Adjusted Net Income exclude certain expenses and income that may recur in the future. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS should be evaluated in conjunction with our GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income to Net income attributable to Class A Common Stockholders, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the computation of Adjusted Diluted EPS are presented below.</p><div><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"prnbcc\"><tr><td class=\"prngen35\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><br/></td><td class=\"prngen35\" colspan=\"1\"

(NYSE: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/INSW/\" title=\"View INSW stock overview\">INSW</a>) (the “Company,” “Seaways,” or “INSW”), one of the largest tanker companies worldwide providing energy transportation services for crude oil and petroleum products, today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year 2025.</p><p><b>HIGHLIGHTS &amp; RECENT DEVELOPMENTS</b></p><p><b>Annual and Quarterly Results:</b></p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Net income for the fourth quarter of 2025 was <money><money>$128 million</money></money>, or <money><money>$2.56</money></money> per diluted share.

In 2026 to date, the Company has sold or agreed to sell seven vessels with an average age of 17 years for proceeds of approximately <money><money>$216 million</money></money>.</li><li>Four of the six LR1 newbuildings are on track to deliver in 2026. Two vessels delivered in 2025: <i>Seaways Alacran</i> in the third quarter and <i>Seaways Balboa</i> in the fourth quarter.</li></ul><p><b>Healthy Balance Sheet:</b></p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Total liquidity was <money><money>$724 million</money></money> as of December 31, 2025, including total cash<sup>(1)</sup> of <money><money>$167 million</money></money> and <money><money>$557 million</money></money> undrawn revolving credit capacity.</li><li>Net loan-to-value remained low at approximately <percent>13%</percent> as of December 31, 2025.</li><li>Unencumbered six VLCCs following the fourth quarter repayment of sale leaseback arrangements using proceeds from the September Norwegian bond issuance.

Zabrocky, International Seaways President and CEO commented, “We concluded 2025 with our strongest quarter since the first quarter of 2024, with solid contributions from both the crude and product segments and a return of VLCCs as leaders in tanker earnings. Our fleet renewal activity in 2025 reflects the disciplined approach we strive to take across the cycles: monetizing older assets at attractive values while securing modern tonnage that positions the fleet for long-term trading opportunities. We remained active through the fourth quarter and into the start of the year highlighted by the sales of older vessels, the strategic consolidation of Tankers International, and substantial returns to shareholders amid the strength of the tanker markets.”</p><p>Ms. Zabrocky continued, “Strong market fundamentals remain the underlying driver of tanker earnings, while today’s geopolitical environment has served as a powerful catalyst. Beneath the geopolitical headlines, we continue to see healthy oil demand growth of more than one million barrels per day, alongside supply growth from the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/am\">Americas</location> and OPEC+. On the supply side, while the orderbook stands at more than <percent>15%</percent> of the existing fleet, nearly half of the fleet is expected to reach 20 years of age by the time those vessels deliver. At the same time, we are seeing increased enforcement actions targeting sanctioned tonnage, which now exceeds the size of the orderbook, and we expect this to constrain effective fleet growth in compliant trades. Against this backdrop, Seaways remains well positioned with our significant operating leverage to convert positive market dynamics into strong cash flow generation, supporting the continued execution of our disciplined capital allocation strategy.”</p><p>Jeff Pribor, the Company’s CFO stated, “Following the placement of <money><money>$250 million</money></money> in senior unsecured bonds, we repaid higher-cost debt and unencumbered six additional vessels. Over the course of the year, we took advantage of our financial strength and flexibility to renew the fleet without stretching the balance sheet, funding investments through sales of older vessels and attractively priced financing, while reducing our net loan-to-value ratio to <percent>13%</percent> and returning nearly <money><money>$150 million</money></money> to shareholders. With continued strength in tanker markets into 2026, we remain focused on deploying cash flow toward fleet renewal and shareholder returns.”</p><p><b>FOURTH QUARTER 2025 RESULTS</b></p><p>Net income for the fourth quarter of 2025 was <money><money>$128 million</money></money>, or <money><money>$2.56</money></money> per diluted share, compared to net income of <money><money>$36 million</money></money>, or <money><money>$0.72</money></money> per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2024. The increase in results was primarily driven by higher TCE revenues<sup>(1)</sup> from spot earnings across the fleet, with weighted average spot rates increasing by approximately <money><money>$15,400</money></money> per day, and the impact of fleet optimization, reflected in lower vessel expenses and gains on vessel sales compared with a non-cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2024.</p><p>Shipping revenues for the fourth quarter were <money><money>$268 million</money></money>, compared to <money><money>$195 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2024. Consolidated TCE revenues<sup>(1)</sup> for the fourth quarter were <money><money>$260 million</money></money>, compared to <money><money>$191 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2024.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA<sup>(1)</sup> for the fourth quarter was <money><money>$175 million</money></money>, compared to <money><money>$95 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2024.</p><p><b>Crude Tankers</b></p><p>Shipping revenues for the Crude Tankers segment were <money><money>$151 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to <money><money>$96 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2024. TCE revenues<sup>(1)</sup> were <money><money>$147 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter, compared to <money><money>$93 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2024. This increase was attributable to higher spot earnings across the segment, with weighted average spot rates increasing by over <money><money>$26,000</money></money> per day and higher time charter revenues, reflecting incremental profit sharing of approximately <money><money>$36,900</money></money> per day on our dual-fuel VLCCs.</p><p><b>Product Carriers</b></p><p>Shipping revenues for the Product Carriers segment were <money><money>$117 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to <money><money>$99 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2024. TCE revenues<sup>(1)</sup> were <money><money>$113 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to <money><money>$97 million</money></money> for the fourth quarter of 2024. The increase was driven by higher spot earnings across the product segment, with weighted average spot rates increasing by over <money><money>$8,000</money></money> per day.</p><p><b>FLEET OPTIMIZATION PROGRAM</b></p><p>On January 27, 2026, the Company acquired sole ownership of Tankers International, a leading shipping pool founded in 2000, providing commercial management of modern, independent VLCC tonnage. Tankers International has formed a new pool to expand its commercial management into the Suezmax class, to which the Company expects to contribute its Suezmax vessels trading in the spot market.</p><p>During the fourth quarter of 2025, the Company took delivery of <i>Seaways Gibbs Hill</i>, a 2020-built, scrubber-fitted VLCC. In August 2025, the Company agreed to purchase the vessel for <money><money>$119 million</money></money>, of which <money><money>$12 million</money></money> was paid during the third quarter in connection with the agreement.</p><p>In the fourth quarter, the Company sold three MR vessels with an average age of 18.5 years for net proceeds of <money><money>$36 million</money></money>. During the year ended December 31, 2025, the Company sold ten vessels, eight MRs and two LR1s, with an average age of 18.0 years for proceeds of approximately <money><money>$131 million</money></money>, excluding two vessels that were swapped in early 2025. The vessel swap exchanged two older VLCCs and <money><money>$3 million</money></money> in cash for three younger MRs through a series of vessel sales and purchase agreements spanning over the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025.</p><p>Between December 2025 and February 2026, the Company sold or entered into agreements to sell seven vessels for aggregate proceeds of approximately <money><money>$216 million</money></money>, net of commissions and fees. The vessels are among the oldest remaining in the fleet, consisting of five MRs with an average age of 18 years and two VLCCs with an average age of 15 years. The Company expects to close these transactions during the first quarter of 2026 and recognize gains from the vessel sales of approximately <money><money>$80 million</money></money>.</p><p>During the fourth quarter of 2025, the Company took delivery of the <i>Seaways Balboa</i>, the second of six LR1 newbuildings under construction in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/kr\">Korea</location> with K Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. The aggregate contract price for the six scrubber-fitted, dual-fuel ready LR1 vessels is approximately <money><money>$359 million</money></money>. As of December 31, 2025, the Company has approximately <money><money>$188 million</money></money> in remaining construction costs, of which approximately <money><money>$158 million</money></money> is expected to be drawn from the ECA Credit Facility (as defined below) in accordance with the delivery schedule. In the first quarter of 2026, the Company paid approximately <money><money>$30 million</money></money> in installment payments related to the construction of these vessels.</p><p>In the fourth quarter, the Company entered into a time charter agreement for one year on a 2012-built Suezmax that commenced in November 2025. As of January 1, 2026, the Company has 13 vessels on time charter agreements with an average duration of 1.4 years and total future contracted revenues through expiry of approximately <money><money>$210 million</money></money>, excluding any applicable profit share.</p><p><b>BALANCE SHEET ENHANCEMENTS</b></p><p>In September 2025, the Company successfully issued <money><money>$250 million</money></money> of senior unsecured bonds maturing in 2030 in the Norwegian bond market at a coupon rate of <percent>7.125%</percent>. Proceeds from the bonds were used in the exercise of declared purchase options on existing sale leaseback arrangements bearing interest at SOFR plus 405 basis points with an 18-year amortization profile. The purchase options were paid in November 2025 for <money><money>$258 million</money></money>, which unencumbered six VLCCs, reduced interest expense and eliminated approximately <money><money>$22 million</money></money> in annual mandatory principal payments.</p><p>In August 2025, the Company entered into a Korean export agency-backed financing with DNB Bank and K-Sure for up to <money><money>$240 million</money></money>, secured by six LR1 newbuildings delivering between the third quarter of 2025 and the third quarter of 2026 (the “ECA Credit Facility”). The 12-year facility combines for a 20-year amortization profile and a blended interest rate of SOFR plus 125 basis points across two tranches. Funds will be drawn under the facility in connection with the delivery of each vessel. During 2025, the Company drew <money><money>$82 million</money></money> in connection with the delivery of two vessels.</p><p>In the year ended December 30, 2025, the Company repaid <money><money>$145 million</money></money> on its revolving credit facilities, composed of <money><money>$69 million</money></money>, primarily borrowed for timing differences in connection with the vessel swap and <money><money>$76 million</money></money> to offset capacity reductions in our revolving credit facilities.</p><p><b>RETURNING CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS</b></p><p>In December 2025, the Company paid a combined dividend of <money><money>$0.86</money></money> per share of common stock, composed of a regular quarterly dividend of <money><money>$0.12</money></money> per share of common stock and a supplemental dividend of <money><money>$0.74</money></money> per share.</p><p>On February 25, 2026, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a combined dividend of <money><money>$2.15</money></money> per share of common stock, composed of a regular quarterly dividend of <money><money>$0.12</money></money> per share of common stock and a supplemental dividend of <money><money>$2.03</money></money> per share of common stock. Both dividends will be paid on March 30, 2026, to shareholders with a record date at the close of business on March 20, 2026.</p><p>In October 2025, the Company’s Board of Directors extended the expiry of the <money><money>$50 million</money></money> share repurchase program to the end of 2026.</p><p><sup>(1) </sup>This is a non-GAAP financial measure used throughout this press release; please refer to the section “Reconciliation to Non-GAAP Financial Information” for explanations of our non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of reported GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures.</p><p><b>CONFERENCE CALL</b></p><p>The Company will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2025 results at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, February 26, 2026.

Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA adjusted for the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent, and should not be a substitute for, net income or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations are: (i) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and (iii) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used as a measure of operating results and performance, neither of them is necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation. The following table reconciles net income as reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:</p><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb

The Company possesses fantastic brands and has strong category growth tailwinds at its back. I see a clear path to create tremendous value for our shareholders and intend to make a sizable open-market purchase of Nomad shares in the coming weeks to express my confidence and align my interests with our shareholders. The value creation, however, will not be immediate and we have work to do to unlock our full potential. We have a number of opportunities to address in the organization, and we will be focused on these in the coming months. We continue to streamline the organization to increase our speed, agility, focus and accountability. We believe this will help us improve our commercial execution while unlocking additional resources for reinvestment. We are also ensuring that the right talent, sourced both internally and externally, is in the right roles to help us succeed. We believe we can and will deliver better results, but we anticipate 2026 being a transition year as our financial outlook reflects the time required to implement and manage change. I am excited to show investors what Nomad Foods is capable of once we see the results of our new approach.\"</p><p>Noam Gottesman, Nomad Foods' Co-Chairman and Founder, commented, \"While it has only been a few months, I am encouraged by the rapid changes being implemented at Nomad Foods and the multi-year vision that is beginning to unfold. Dominic and his team have a lot of work ahead of them, but they are starting from a good place. The company's portfolio is strong, category growth is robust and retail-sell out in 2025 delivered modest growth. The opportunity ahead is substantial. Dominic and his team have the Board's full support during this transition year and I am excited to see him unlock significant underappreciated value in Nomad Foods for shareholders.\"</p><p><b><i>Fourth Quarter of 2025 results compared to the Fourth Quarter of 2024</i></b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li><b>Revenue</b> decreased <percent>2.6%</percent> to <money>€773 million</money>. <b>Organic revenue</b> decrease of <percent>1.3%</percent> was driven by a <percent>0.2%</percent> price/mix decline and by <percent>1.1%</percent> volume decline.</li><li><b>Adjusted gross profit </b>decreased <percent>11%</percent> to <money>€202 million</money>.

In addition, we exclude other adjustments such as the impact of share based payment expenses and related employer payroll taxes, and non-operating M&amp;A related costs, because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs, can vary significantly in amount and frequency, and are unrelated to our underlying operating performance. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA provides important comparability of underlying operating results, allowing investors and management to assess operating performance on a consistent basis.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to profit/(loss) for the period, determined in accordance with IFRS, as an indicator of the Company's operating performance.</p><p>Adjusted Profit for the period is defined as profit for the period excluding, when they occur, the impacts of exited markets, acquisition purchase price adjustments and exceptional items such as restructuring charges, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, net financing income/(cost) on amendment of terms of debt, interest cost on tax relating to legacy tax audits, foreign exchange translation gains/(losses), foreign exchange gains/(losses) on derivatives, as well as certain other items considered unusual or non-recurring in nature. In addition, we exclude other adjustments such as the impact of share based payment expenses and related employer payroll taxes, and non-operating M&amp;A related costs, because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs, can vary significantly in amount and frequency, and are unrelated to our underlying operating performance. The Company believes Adjusted Profit for the period provides important comparability of underlying operating results, allowing investors and management to assess operating performance on a consistent basis.</p><p>Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share excluding, when they occur, the impacts of exited markets, acquisition purchase price adjustments and exceptional items such as restructuring charges, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, net financing income/(cost) on amendment of terms of debt, interest cost on tax relating to legacy tax audits, foreign exchange translation gains/(losses), foreign exchange gains/(losses) on derivatives, certain one-time credits on the recognition of deferred tax assets, as well as certain other items considered unusual or non-recurring in nature. In addition, we exclude other adjustments such as the impact of share based payment expenses and related employer payroll taxes, and non-operating M&amp;A related costs, because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs, can vary significantly in amount and frequency, and are unrelated to our underlying operating performance. The Company believes Adjusted EPS provides important comparability of underlying operating results, allowing investors and management to assess operating performance on a consistent basis.</p><p>Organic revenue growth/(decline) is an adjusted measurement of our operating results. The comparison for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2025 and 2024 presented in this press release takes into consideration only those activities that were in effect during both time periods. Organic revenue growth/(decline) reflects reported revenue adjusted for currency translation and non-comparable trading items such as expansion, acquisitions, disposals, closures, trading day impacts or any other event that artificially impacts the comparability of our results period over period.</p><p>Adjusted Gross Profit and adjusted gross margin exclude accelerated depreciation associated with restructuring programs within cost of goods sold.</p><p>Adjustments for currency translation are calculated by translating data of the current and comparative periods using a budget foreign exchange rate that is set once a year as part of the Company's internal annual forecast process.</p><p>Adjusted Free Cash Flow is the amount of cash generated from operating activities less cash flows related to exceptional items (as described above), non-operating M&amp;A related costs and working capital movements on employer taxes associated with share based payment awards, plus capital expenditure (on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets), net interest paid, proceeds/(payments) on settlement of derivatives where hedge accounting is not applied and payments of lease liabilities. Adjusted free cash flow reflects cash flows that could be used for payment of dividends, repayment of debt or to fund acquisitions or other strategic objectives.</p><p>Cash flow conversion is Adjusted Free Cash Flow as a percentage of Adjusted Profit for the period.</p><p>Adjusted and Organic non-IFRS financial information should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements of Nomad Foods included in this press release as well as the historical financial statements of the Company previously filed with the SEC.</p><p>Nomad Foods believe its non-IFRS financial measures provide an important additional measure with which to monitor and evaluate the Company's ongoing financial results, as well as to reflect its acquisitions. Nomad Foods' calculation of these financial measures may be different from the calculations used by other companies and comparability may therefore be limited. The Adjusted and Organic financial information presented herein is based upon certain assumptions that Nomad Foods believes to be reasonable and is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of any anticipated financial position or future results of operations that the Company will experience. You should not consider the Company's non-IFRS financial measures an alternative or substitute for the Company's reported results and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these results and information as they may not be representative of our actual or future results as a Company.</p><p>Please see on pages 9 to 18, the non-IFRS reconciliation tables attached hereto and the schedules accompanying this release for an explanation and reconciliation of the Adjusted and Organic financial information to the most directly comparable IFRS measure.
