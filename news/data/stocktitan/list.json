of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund’s Plan (as defined below). The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of the Fund’s distribution to shareholders may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that a shareholder invested in a Fund is paid back to them. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income.” The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV to shareholders for the calendar year that will describe how to report the Fund’s distributions for federal income tax purposes.</b></p><p>The determination of the actual source of distributions can only be made at year-end. The actual source amounts of all Fund distributions will be included in the Fund’s annual or semi-annual reports. In addition, the tax treatment may differ from the accounting treatment used to calculate the source of the Fund’s distributions as shown on shareholders’ statements. Shareholders should refer to their Form 1099-DIV for the character and amount of distributions for income tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after December 31, 2026 and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV early in 2027. Since each shareholder’s tax situation is unique, it may be advisable to consult a tax advisor as to the appropriate treatment of Fund distributions.</p><p>Effective after the close of business on June 4, 2021, Saba Capital Management, L.P. replaced Voya Financial as the investment adviser to Saba Capital Income &amp; Opportunities Fund (formerly known as the Voya Prime Rate Trust).

The level of distribution amount shown is not guaranteed and special dividends may or may not be paid in the future. Further, no conclusions should be drawn about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount or rate of distribution shown.</p><p><b>Managed Distribution Plan. </b>The above distribution was declared in accordance with the Fund’s currently effective managed distribution plan (the “Plan”), whereby the Fund will make monthly distributions to shareholders at a fixed amount of <money><money>$0.08</money>5</money> per share. Thus, the distribution amount shown excludes special dividends (which are not paid pursuant to the plan). The Fund will generally distribute amounts necessary to satisfy the Fund’s Plan and the requirements prescribed by excise tax rules and Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan is intended to provide shareholders with a constant, but not guaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value of the Fund’s common shares, but there is no assurance that the Plan will be successful in doing so.</p><p>Under the Plan, to the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution rate. As a result, long-term capital gains and/or return of capital may be a material source of any distribution. No conclusions should be drawn about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of the Fund’s distributions or from the terms of the Fund’s Plan. The Board of Trustees (the “Board”) may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to Fund shareholders. No level of distribution can be guaranteed. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund’s common shares. The Plan is subject to the periodic review by the Board, including a yearly review of the annual minimum fixed rate to determine if an adjustment should be made.</p><p><b>Past Performance is No Assurance of Future Results. </b>Investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate.

There can be no assurance that the Fund will meet its investment objective. The Fund seeks to achieve this objective by investing globally in debt and equity securities of public and private companies, which includes, among other things, investments in closed‐end funds, special purpose acquisition companies (“SPACs”), reinsurance, and public and private debt instruments. The Fund also may utilize derivatives including but not limited to total return swaps, credit default swaps, options and futures, in seeking to enhance returns and/or to reduce portfolio risk.</p><p>The value of the Fund’s investments in equity securities of public and private, listed and unlisted companies and equity derivatives generally varies with the performance of the issuer and movements in the equity markets more generally. As a result, the Fund may suffer losses if it invests in equity instruments of issuers whose performance diverges from the Fund’s investment manager’s expectations or if equity markets generally move in a single direction and the Fund has not hedged against such a general move. The Fund invests in closed-end funds and SPACs, which are subject to additional risks and considerations. The performance of reinsurance-related securities and the reinsurance industry itself are tied to the occurrence of various triggering events, including but not limited to weather, natural disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, etc.), non-natural large catastrophes and other specified events causing physical and/or economic loss. To the extent the Fund invests in reinsurance-related securities for which a triggering event occurs, losses associated with such event could result in losses to the Fund’s investment, and a series of major triggering events affecting a large portion of the reinsurance- related securities held by the Fund could result in substantial losses to the Fund’s investment. The Fund may invest in high yield securities, which are speculative in nature and are subject to additional risk factors such as increased possibility of default, illiquidity of the security, and changes in value based on changes in interest rates. Changes in short-term market interest rates may directly affect the yield on the Fund’s common shares. If such rates fall, the Fund’s yield may also fall. If interest rate spreads on bonds and loans owned by the Fund decline in general, the yield on the bonds and loans will likely fall and the value of such bonds and loans may decrease. When short-term market interest rates rise, because of the lag between changes in such short-term rates and the resetting of the floating rates on bonds and loans in the Fund’s portfolio, the impact of rising rates will be delayed to the extent of such lag. Because of the limited secondary market for certain bonds and loans, the Fund’s ability to sell such securities in a timely fashion and/or at a favorable price may be limited. An increase in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the rate of interest payable on new bonds and loans acquired by the Fund, and it may also increase the price of bonds and loans purchased by the Fund in the secondary market. A decrease in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the price of bonds and loans in the Fund’s portfolio, which would cause the Fund’s net asset value to decrease. The Fund’s use of leverage, if any, through borrowings or issuance of preferred shares can adversely affect the yield on the Fund’s common shares. Investment in foreign borrowers involves special risks, including but not limited to potentially less rigorous accounting requirements, differing legal systems and potential political, social and economic adversity. The Fund may engage in currency exchange transactions to seek to hedge, as closely as practicable, all of the economic impact to the Fund arising from foreign currency fluctuations. Other risks include, but are not limited to, the use of derivatives, the potential lack of diversification in the Fund’s portfolio, and the fact that the Fund’s portfolio may be concentrated in a small group of industries or industry sectors from time to time. Investors should consult the Fund’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the materials on the Fund’s website for a more detailed discussion of these or other risk factors that affect the Fund.</p><p><b>About Saba Capital Income &amp; Opportunities Fund. </b>Saba Capital Income &amp; Opportunities Fund is a publicly-traded registered closed-end management investment company.

We were thrilled to have the opportunity to present this technology and the trial design to leaders in the field at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, where we received positive feedback and encouraging interest.\"</p><p>\"ATR-04 has previously been granted Fast Track designation from the FDA, signaling the potential for this candidate to help the approximately 150,000 people in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> annually who are impacted by major dermatologic toxicities associated with EGFR inhibitor treatments. Though an impactful treatment for various serious cancers, EGFR inhibition can result in adverse skin reactions that can make it difficult for patients to stay on these effective therapies.\"</p><p>Mr. Salva added: \"For our lead program, ATR-12, we continue to be encouraged by the promising safety data generated thus far in our Phase 1b trial and are optimistic that this candidate has the potential to be a life-changing innovation for people with Netherton syndrome, a rare, autosomal recessive disease, a chronic condition characterized by severe inflammation, pruritus, scaling, red, and dehydrated skin with no known cure and limited treatment options.\"</p><p>Mr. Salva continued: \"Also in 2025, we presented positive preclinical data for our ATR-01 program targeting ichthyosis vulgaris. Impacting approximately 1.3 million in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> with no treatment options beyond symptom management, ichthyosis vulgaris, is an autosomal semidominant genetic disorder caused by missing or abnormal filaggrin levels. The condition is characterized by generalized xerosis and fine, white to gray scales that are prominent on the abdomen, chest, and extensor surfaces of the extremities.\"</p><p>Mr. Salva concluded: \"2026 promises to be an important year for Azitra with several anticipated milestones including topline data for both our Phase 1b study in Netherton Syndrome and the Phase 1/2 study in EGFRi-associated rash. We also look forward to completing IND-enabling studies for ATR-01. We remain excited and optimistic as we work towards these key events, which we believe can help build significant value for our shareholders in 2026, while we progress innovative and potentially transformative treatments for patients with severe and life-altering dermatological conditions.\"</p><p><b><u>Pipeline Achievements and Upcoming Milestones</u></b></p><p><b>ATR-12 - Advancing Phase 1b Clinical Trial in Netherton Syndrome</b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>In June 2025, Azitra reported promising safety data with <percent>50%</percent> of patients enrolled.</li><li>ATR12-351, a live precision dermatology therapeutic candidate has been generally safe and well-tolerated with occasional, transient, mild to moderate symptoms at application site to date.</li><li>Topline data from the Phase 1b trial is anticipated H2 2026.</li></ul><p><b>ATR-04 – Addressing an Unmet Need for Cancer Patients in a Multi-billion Dollar Market Opportunity</b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>Dosed first patient in Phase 1/2 Trial for ATR-04 program targeting oncology patients with EGFRi-associated rash in Q3 2025.</li><li>Topline data from first cohort of Phase 1/2 trial expected around mid-2026.</li></ul><p><b>ATR-01 – Targeting Ichthyosis Vulgaris Which Impacts 1.3 million in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location></b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>Announced positive preclinical data for ATR-01 program in Q3 2025, demonstrating delivery of active, functional filaggrin through human stratum corneum and repair of damaged model skin</li><li>IND-enabling studies continue in 2026.</li></ul><p><b>Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2025</b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li><b>Research and Development (R&amp;D) expenses:</b> R&amp;D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2025, were <money><money>$4.8 million</money></money> compared to <money><money>$4.7 million</money></money> for the fiscal year 2024.<br/><br/></li><li><b>General and Administrative (G&amp;A) expenses: </b>G&amp;A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2025, were <money><money>$6.2 million</money></money> compared to <money><money>$6.3 million</money></money> for the fiscal year 2024.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Net Loss </b>was <money><money>$11.0 million</money></money> for the year ended December 31, 2025, compared to <money><money>$9.0 million</money></money> for the fiscal year 2024.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Cash and cash equivalents: </b> As of December 31, 2025, Azitra had cash and cash equivalents of <money><money>$2.1 million</money></money>.</li></ul><p><b>About Azitra, Inc.</b></p><p>Azitra, Inc. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative therapies for precision dermatology. Azitra's lead program, ATR-12, uses an engineered strain of <i>S. epidermidis</i> designed to treat Netherton syndrome, a rare, chronic skin disease with no approved treatment options. Netherton syndrome may be fatal in infancy with those living beyond a year having profound lifelong challenges. The ATR-12 program includes a Phase 1b clinical trial in adults with Netherton syndrome. ATR-04, Azitra's additional clinical program, utilizes another engineered strain of <i>S. epidermidis</i> for the treatment of EGFR inhibitor (\"EGFRi\") associated skin toxicity; a Phase 1/2 clinical trial has been initiated for this program. Azitra has received Fast Track designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration for this program to treat EGFRi associated rash, which impacts approximately 150,000 people in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>. The ATR-12 and ATR-04 programs were developed from Azitra's proprietary platform of engineered proteins and topical live biotherapeutic products that includes a microbial library comprised of approximately 1,500 bacterial strains. The platform is augmented by artificial intelligence and machine learning technology that analyzes, predicts, and helps screen the library of strains for drug like molecules.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p> </p><p> <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">NEW YORK</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BlackRock Utilities, Infrastructure, &amp; Power Opportunities Trust (NYSE: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/BUI/\" title=\"View BUI stock overview\">BUI</a>) (the \"Fund\") today announced the terms of transferable rights (\"Rights\") to be issued to the holders of the Fund's common shares of beneficial interest (par value <money><money>$0.00</money>1</money> per share) (\"Shares\") as of March 9, 2026 (the \"Record Date\"). Holders of Rights will be entitled to subscribe for additional Shares (the \"Offer\") at a discount to the market price of the Shares.</p><p>After considering a number of factors, including potential benefits and costs, the Fund’s Board of Trustees (the “Board”) and the Fund's investment adviser, BlackRock Advisors, LLC (the \"Adviser\"), have determined that it is in the best interests of both the Fund and its shareholders to conduct the Offer and increase the assets of the Fund available to take advantage of existing and future investment opportunities that are consistent with the Fund’s investment objectives to provide total return and income through a combination of current income and long-term capital appreciation.</p><p><b>All expenses of the Offer will be borne by the Adviser, and not by the Fund or any of the Fund's shareholders.</b></p><p>The Adviser believes this is an attractive time to raise additional assets for the Fund based on several factors, including the following potential benefits:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li><b>Infrastructure: </b>Infrastructure<b> </b>sits at the intersection of three structural mega forces - the Artificial Intelligence buildout, national security priorities, and the transition to a lower carbon economy - creating sustained investment opportunities. Additionally, listed infrastructure valuations are attractive relative to history, providing a compelling entry point for new capital.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Utilities:</b> Utilities have a pressing need to raise significant capital. Rising power demand and reshoring of power supply chains are stressing existing grids and triggering the largest utility capex cycle in decades, and the Adviser believes the Fund is well-positioned to deploy capital into these opportunities.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Reward</b>: Rights provide shareholders with an opportunity to buy new shares below market price or potentially realize value from the sale of Rights.<br/><br/></li><li><b>No offering fees</b>: The Adviser, not the Fund, is paying for the expenses of the Offer.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Lower expense ratio</b>: The Offer is anticipated to spread fixed operating costs across a larger asset base.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Enhanced liquidity</b>: The Offer creates the potential for increased trading volume and liquidity of Shares.</li></ul><p><b>The Fund expects to maintain its current distribution level following the Offer.</b> Shares issued pursuant to the Offer will be entitled to receive the monthly distribution expected to be payable in April 2026, but will <span class=\"bwuline\">not</span> be eligible for the distribution payable in March 2026.</p><p>Certain key terms of the Offer include:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li><b>Rights ratio:</b> Holders of Shares on the Record Date (\"Record Date Shareholders\") will receive one Right for each outstanding Share owned on the Record Date. Rights entitle the holder to purchase one new Share for every 4 Rights exercised (1-for-4); however, any Record Date Shareholder who owns fewer than four Shares as of the Record Date will be entitled to subscribe for one Share. Fractional Shares will not be issued upon the exercise of Rights.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Pricing formula:</b> The subscription price per Share (the \"Subscription Price\") will be determined on the expiration date of the Offer, which is currently expected to be April 2, 2026, unless extended by the Fund (the \"Expiration Date\"), and will be equal to <percent>95%</percent> of the average of the last reported sales price per Share on the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") on the Expiration Date and each of the four (4) immediately preceding trading days provided that, if such price is equal to or above net asset value (“NAV”) at the Expiration Date, it shall be reduced to <money><money>$0.01</money></money> below NAV on the Expiration Date (the \"Formula Price\"). If, however, the Formula Price is less than <percent>95%</percent> of the Fund's NAV per Share at the close of trading on the NYSE on the Expiration Date, the Subscription Price will be <percent>95%</percent> of the Fund's NAV per Share at the close of trading on the NYSE on the Expiration Date. The Subscription Price will be determined by the Fund on the Expiration Date.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Over-subscription privilege:</b> Record Date Shareholders who fully exercise all Rights issued to them can subscribe, subject to certain limitations and allotment, for any additional Shares which were not subscribed for by other holders of Rights at the Subscription Price, provided that the Board may eliminate this over-subscription privilege. Investors who are not Record Date Shareholders but who otherwise acquire Rights in the secondary market are not entitled to participate in the over-subscription privilege. If sufficient Shares are available, all Record Date Shareholders' over-subscription requests will be honored in full. If these requests exceed available Shares, they will be allocated pro rata among those fully exercising Record Date Shareholders who over-subscribe based on the number of Rights originally issued to them by the Fund.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Transferable rights:</b> Rights are transferable and are expected to be admitted for trading on the NYSE under the symbol \"<a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/BUI/\" title=\"View BUI stock overview\">BUI</a> RT\" during the course of the Offer and will cease trading April 1, 2026, one trading day before the Expiration Date. During this time, Record Date Shareholders may choose to sell their Rights if they do not intend to subscribe for additional Shares.</li></ul><p>The Offer will be made only by means of a prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus. The Fund expects to mail subscription certificates evidencing the Rights and a copy of the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus for the Offer to Record Date Shareholders within <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> shortly following the Record Date. To exercise their Rights, shareholders who hold their Shares through a broker, custodian or trust company should contact such entity to forward their instructions to either exercise or sell their Rights on their behalf. Shareholders who do not hold Shares through a broker, custodian, or trust company should forward their instructions to either exercise or sell their Rights by completing the subscription certificate and delivering it to the subscription agent for the Offer, together with their payment, at one of the locations indicated on the subscription certificate or in the prospectus supplement.</p><p><b>The information in this press release is not complete and is subject to change.

Each Warrant will entitle its holder to acquire an additional common share of the Company at a price of <money>$0.65</money> per share for 24 months following the date of issuance.</p><p>The Company has executed a binding term sheet with two arm's length institutional investors (collectively, the \"<b>Investors</b>\") in connection with the Private Placement for aggregate gross proceeds of <money>$6,000,000</money> (CAD) (the \"<b>Investors' Proceeds</b>\"). In connection with the Private Placement, the Investors' Proceeds and the Units will be deposited in escrow in advance of closing pursuant to an escrow agreement (the \"<b>Escrow Agreement</b>\"). Upon closing, the Units will be released from escrow and delivered to the Investors or as they may direct, and the Investors' Proceeds will be released from escrow and deposited as credit support pursuant to an ISDA Credit Support Annex, and released to the Company in monthly cash tranches of <money>$333,333</money> (CAD) over an 18-month period (the \"<b>Term</b>\"), pursuant to the terms and conditions of a sharing agreement (the \"<b>Sharing Agreement</b>\") to be dated and executed on the closing of the Private Placement. Settlements under the Sharing Agreement shall commence five months after closing. </p><p>Pursuant to the Sharing Agreement, Shares will be released in equal monthly installments of approximately 606,060 Shares over the 18-month Term, with each release contingent upon the corresponding cash payment being delivered to the Company. The Sharing Agreement shall provide that the Company's economic interest will be determined in 18 monthly settlement tranches as measured against a benchmark price of <money>$0.73</money>32 (CAD) per Share (the \"<b>Benchmark Price</b>\"). If, at the time of settlement, the settlement price (determined monthly based on a 20-day volume-weighted average trading price of the Company's shares on the CSE) exceeds the Benchmark Price, the Company shall receive more than <percent>100%</percent> of the monthly settlement due, on a pro rata basis, with no upper limit on additional proceeds. If the settlement price is below the Benchmark Price, the Company will receive less than <percent>100%</percent> of the monthly settlement due, on a pro rata basis. In no event will a decline in the settlement price result in an increase in the number of Shares being issued to the Investors. As a result, the Company may ultimately receive more or materially less than the original proceeds of <money>$6,000,000. T</money>he final amount received will depend on the Company's future share price, which is subject to market fluctuations and may vary over time. Accordingly, there is no assurance as to the total amount the Company will receive under the Sharing Agreement. </p><p>All 10,909,091 Warrants to be issued shall be exercisable at an exercise price of <money>$0.65</money> (CAD) per Share for a period of 24 months following the date of issuance. The Warrants will include an equity blocker provision that prohibits the holder from exercising any portion of the Warrants if such exercise would result in the holder owning more than <percent>9.99%</percent> of the Company's outstanding Shares.</p><p>The Investors will receive a corporate finance fee of <money>$360,000</money> (CAD) in connection with the Sharing Agreement, payable in cash or via the issuance of 654,546 Units at the Private Placement price, at the election of the Company (the \"<b>Fee</b>\").</p><p>The Company has agreed to pay a non-refundable deposit of <money>$65,000</money> (CAD) (the \"<b>Deposit</b>\") upon receipt of approval from the CSE in connection with the Private Placement. The Deposit shall be satisfied by the issuance of 118,182 Units at the Private Placement price. </p><p>Defence intends to use the proceeds from the Private Placement to advance its Antibody Drug Conjugate (\"ADC\") and Radiopharmaceutical programs, to develop partnerships and for working capital purposes. The Company may pay a finder's fee in connection with the offering to eligible arm's-length finders in accordance with the policies of the Canadian Securities Exchanges. </p><p>Pursuant to applicable Canadian securities laws and in accordance with the Exchange policies, all securities issued under this Private Placement will be subject to applicable resale restrictions under applicable securities laws. The closing of the Private Placement is expected on or about March 6, 2026, subject to the approval of the CSE.  </p><p>The Units described herein have not been, and will not be, registered under the <i>U.S. Securities Act</i> or any state securities laws, and accordingly, may not be offered or sold within the United States except in compliance with the registration requirements of the <i>U.S. Securities Act</i> and applicable state securities requirements or pursuant to exemptions there from.

We now have positive operating cash flow bolstered partly by the cash proceeds from our options strategy. The strength of our balance sheet has enabled the company to rigorously carry out our mergers and acquisitions strategy while launching new products and services such as our Truth.Fi financial products. We look forward to continuing our momentum in 2026 and beyond, positioning TMTG as a leader in the America First economy.\"</p> <p>For 2025, TMTG had a <money>$712.3 million</money> consolidated net loss, most of which comprised unrealized losses stemming from a drop in the price of digital assets and digital asset related securities.

These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Words such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"plan,\" \"project,\" \"should,\" \"will\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, though not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words, and the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about future events or conditions that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this communication, including, but not limited to, risks related to TMTG's or TAE's ability to demonstrate and execute on commercial viability of its technology; legal proceedings; ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all; changes in digital asset valuations; disruption to TMTG's operations; TMTG's ability to develop and maintain key strategic relationships; competition in TMTG's industry; ability to access required materials at acceptable costs; delays in the development and manufacturing of fusion power plants and related technology; ability to manage growth effectively; possibility of incurring losses in the future and not being able to achieve or maintain profitability; potential generation capacities of specific reactor designs; regulatory outlook; future market conditions; success of strategic partnerships; developments in the capital and credit markets; future financial, operational and cost performance; revenue generation; demand for nuclear energy; economic outlook and public perception of the nuclear energy industry; changes in laws or regulations; ability to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at al; ability to protect intellectual property; adverse economic or competitive conditions; and other risks and uncertainties. In addition, TMTG cautions you that the forward-looking statements contained in this communication are subject to the following factors: (i) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could delay site selection or the Proposed Transaction or give rise to the termination of the agreements related thereto; (ii) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against TMTG or TAE with respect to site selection or the Proposed Transaction; (iii) the inability to complete the Proposed Transaction due to the failure to obtain approval of the shareholders of TMTG or TAE, or other conditions to closing in the merger agreement; (iv) the risk that the Proposed Transaction disrupts TMTG's current plans and operations as a result of the announcement of the Proposed Transaction; (v) TMTG's ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Proposed Transaction, which may be affected by, among other things, competition and the ability of TMTG to grow and manage growth profitably following the Proposed Transaction; and (vi) costs related to the Proposed Transaction, site selection or construction. The forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon information available to TMTG as of the date of this press release and, while TMTG believes such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, these statements are inherently uncertain, and you are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. Except as required by applicable law, TMTG does not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this press release, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise. Additional information concerning these and other factors that may impact the operations and projections discussed herein can be found in TMTG's periodic filings with the SEC, including TMTG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2025, TMTG's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and in the Form S-4, when filed, and in other documents filed by TMTG from time to time with the SEC. TMTG's SEC filings are available publicly on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. These filings do or will identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that TMTG presently knows or that TMTG currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.</p> <p>Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and TMTG assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or revise these forward‑looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. TMTG does not give any assurance that TMTG will achieve its expectations. The inclusion of any statement in this communication does not constitute an admission by TMTG or any other person that the events or circumstances described in such statement are material.</p> <p><strong>No Offer or Solicitation </strong></p> <p>This communication is not intended to and does not constitute an offer to buy or sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any securities, or a solicitation of any vote or approval, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.
