            "title": "Waste Energy Corp to Present at Clean Energy & Renewables Virtual Investor Conference on March 5th; Highlights Permian Basin Deployment and 2026 Operational Roadmap | WAST Stock News",
            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><strong id=\"dateline\">MIDLAND, TX / <a href=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ACCESS Newswire</a> / February 26, 2026 / </strong>Waste Energy Corp (OTCQB:WAST) (\"WEC\" or the \"Company\"), a clean-energy company converting non-recyclable waste into usable fuel and renewable energy products, today announced that is will present at the Clean Energy &amp; Renewables Virtual Investor Conference on March 5, 2026, hosted by OTC Markets Group. Management will walk through the Company's waste conversion model, its first facility in Midland, Texas, and the operational milestones it expects to hit as commissioning draws near.</p><p><strong>Permian Basin: A Deliberate Starting Point</strong></p><p>The Midland facility wasn't placed in the Permian Basin by accident. The region offers something most early-stage energy infrastructure companies spend years chasing established distribution networks, industrial-scale fuel demand, and a deep base of energy capital that understands long-cycle infrastructure investment. Waste tire feedstock is also concentrated in the area, reducing inbound logistics costs and simplifying supply chain management.</p><p>Management sees the Permian not just as a first market, but as a template. If the model works here, it travels.</p><p><strong>What the Facility Actually Does</strong></p><p>Running Phase 1 at full capacity 30 tons per day, 330 days a year, the Midland plant is designed to process around 10,000 tons of waste tires annually. That's north of 300,000 passenger tires, or roughly 140,000 heavy truck tires, every year. Beyond the headline fuel output, the process recovers carbon black, syngas to run the system and high grade steel, all of which have established regional buyers. Steel alone could represent 990 to 1,485 tons of recoverable material annually, based on typical tire composition.</p><p>The Company is also working with local partners on landfill diversion and tire stockpile remediation in the Permian Basin, a community angle that has drawn interest from regional stakeholders.</p><p><strong>Rethinking How Carbon Credits Get Made</strong></p><p>The voluntary carbon market has a credibility problem. Credits get challenged, methodologies get disputed, and human reporting introduces errors that undermine confidence in the underlying asset. Waste Energy Corp has filed a patent for a system designed to fix that at the source.</p><p>The Company's patent-pending carbon credit automation system uses on-site video monitoring and sensor data to capture the conversion process in real time. That data is then run through a carbon credit algorithm when a match is confirmed, a credit is created automatically, minted as an NFT, and deposited directly into a digital wallet. The credits will be tradeable on the Company's own blockchain-based platform.</p><p>The logic is straightforward: remove the human from the reporting chain, and you remove the most common source of error and dispute. The result is a carbon credit with a verifiable, immutable record of exactly how and when it was generated, something the market has struggled to produce consistently.</p><p>For investors, this matters beyond the environmental angle. A carbon credit with a clean chain of custody and blockchain-based provenance is a more defensible asset. It's also a potential competitive advantage as regulators and institutional buyers apply increasing scrutiny to voluntary market integrity.</p><p><strong>The Carbon Credit Opportunity</strong></p><p>Based on combustion-equivalent emission factors, full-capacity throughput at the Midland facility could translate to roughly 12,800 metric tons of CO₂e annually. Whether that supports a meaningful credit position still depends on third-party validation and registry methodology, a process that hasn't concluded. Conservative estimates put potential annual credits in the 7,000 to 17,000 range, with a theoretical ceiling around 22,000 to 28,000. Management isn't booking that revenue yet, but the automated issuance system is designed to make the validation process faster, cleaner, and more defensible when it does get there.</p><p><strong>Midland Facility Commissioning &amp; Timelines</strong></p><p>The Midland facility is approaching commissioning. Management has committed to regular updates tied to actual milestones production ramp, first revenue, and expansion decisions rather than forward-looking timelines that tend to slip.</p><p>\"We are building Waste Energy Corp around disciplined execution and measurable results,\" said Scott Gallagher, Chairman &amp; CEO. \"Our first priority is to demonstrate a model that works operationally and economically. The Permian Basin deployment is not simply a site launch, it is the foundation for a scalable environmental infrastructure platform designed to generate diversified revenue streams, including fuel, recovered materials, and carbon-linked assets.\"</p><p>Gallagher continued, \"As we move toward commissioning, transparency becomes increasingly important. During the March 5th presentation, I will provide a clear framework outlining our expected path to revenue for the Midland facility. Shareholder value is created through execution, consistency, and scale and our focus in 2026 is to deliver on each of those.\"</p><p>The broader context isn't lost on the Company either. U.S. electricity demand hit record highs in 2025 and is projected to keep climbing, driven largely by the data center and AI infrastructure buildout that shows no sign of slowing. Data center electricity demand has grown more than <percent>400%</percent> over the past decade. Carbon credits, and U.S. data center power demand is forecast to reach 134 gigawatts by 2030, nearly triple current levels. That kind of structural demand creates a sustained need for new domestic energy sources, particularly ones that don't require greenfield grid infrastructure.

            "title": "Riverside Resources Expands Porphyry Copper Targets at Ariel Project, Sonora, Mexico | RVSDF Stock News",
            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 26, 2026) - Riverside Resources Inc. (TSXV: RRI) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/RVSDF/\" title=\"View RVSDF stock overview\">RVSDF</a>) (FSE: 5YY0) (\"<b>Riverside</b>\" or the \"<b>Company</b>\"), is pleased to announce early 2026 assay and porphyry Cu exploration results at the <percent>100%</percent>-owned Ariel Copper Project (the \"Ariel Project\" or \"Ariel\") in Sonora, Mexico. Ariel is a drill-permitted, district-scale porphyry copper-gold set of targets located approximately 18 km east-southeast of the La Caridad copper mining complex in the highly productive Laramide-age Arizona-Sonora copper mining belt. </p><p><b>2026 Exploration Highlights</b></p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li><p>High-grade base metals with <percent>5.4%</percent> Pb, 320 g/t Ag in veins both as targets and high-level, lateral indicators for the Ariel Porphyry Cu target</p></li><li><p>Sampling of veins in the north as shown on maps and cross section below link for the upgrade porphyry Cu target linking Maria Luisa and Ariel targets</p></li><li><p>Age dating at Ariel provides similar age to La Caridad and Cananea Mine host rocks further linking the geologic comparisons for the project to major copper districts</p></li><li><p>Applying spectral mineral analysis (near-infrared/short-wave infrared methods) to map alteration minerals commonly associated with porphyry and high-sulphidation systems, including advanced argillic assemblages and breccia-related alteration styles documented at Ariel. </p></li><li><p>Integrating mapping, alteration interpretation, and regional geophysical datasets to prioritize drill collars within permitted areas with full drive-up easy access.</p></li><li><p>Riverside sees the project ready for partnering and moving ahead as it has multiple partnerships with diverse companies on the Riverside portfolio, Ariel is now ready for partnering and drilling toward making a major copper discovery.</p></li></ul><p>Building on Riverside's consolidation of the Ariel Project through acquisition of the adjacent Maria Luisa concessions, the Company has now conducted expanded early 2026 field work and has received high grade silver and lead samples from veins, porphyry style alterations, and turquoise mines that are all part of the advancing target definition work with detailed mapping, sampling, alteration mineral studies summarized in the graphics below.   These high grades are significant because they are comparable to those seen in other major Arizona-Sonora mining camps, where early mining of silver veins later evolved into major copper discoveries at more than a dozen large mines, including Cananea, La Caridad, Bisbee, Resolution, Morenci, and Ray, to name a few.</p><p>\"Riverside early 2026 field program at the Ariel and Maria Luisa mineral concessions now consolidated into a single, fully permitted drill-ready project area found high grade precious and base metals typical of the major copper mines in the region and now the targets at Ariel continue to improve as the Company derisks the project with systematic fieldwork to sharpen targeting and prepare it for partnering and immediate drilling,\" said John-Mark Staude, CEO of Riverside Resources. \"The combination of geologic mapping, geochemistry, alteration mineral studies, and integrated geophysics is providing stronger vectors into the most prospective zones. Ariel remains a compelling, undrilled copper district target in a premier belt, with excellent access, safety and infrastructure. The recent geochemistry continues to enhance the porphyry Cu target potential at Ariel.\"</p><p><b>Exploration Work and Targeting Progress</b></p><p>Riverside has full mineral title for the Ariel property and has advanced copper exploration through database compilations, field mapping, sampling, remote sensing, mineral concession consolidation and regional geophysical data interpretation, leading to the definition of two principal porphyry target areas (Ariel and Maria Luisa). The project has seen limited to no historical drilling to Riverside's knowledge, and the Company considers Ariel a high-quality, drill-stage copper district target with extensive exposed targets and additional areas masked by shallow post-mineral cover. The Project is available for partnership per the Company's business model of project generation; however, the Company could choose to drill the project given the quality exploration district. </p><p><b>Project Highlights</b></p><ul><li><p>District-scale, consolidated footprint: Ariel totals 1,640 hectares (16 km²) across five fully titled concessions in good standing, including the Maria Luisa area, providing multiple priority target zones for drill testing. </p></li><li><p>Two priority target styles defined: Ongoing work continues to refine (1) a porphyry copper target with near surface copper sulphides and oxides, and (2) an epithermal arget interpreted as the upper portion of a porphyry system, consistent with alteration, veining and breccia styles with walk up safe, easy access on private ranch land. </p></li><li><p>Modern scientific exploration tools improving vectoring: Riverside is applying portable geochemical and mineralogical tools (including portable XRF and short-wave/infrared spectral mineral scanning) to distinguish vein and alteration assemblages and prioritize drill-ready areas. </p></li><li><p>Strategically located in the Sonora, Mexico Laramide copper belt and less than 20km from the La Caridad Cu-Mo porphyry mining complex, with additional regional porphyry prospects in the district. </p></li><li><p>Ariel is underlain by Late Cretaceous volcanic rocks of the Tarahumara Formation intruded by Paleocene (ca. 57 Ma) porphyritic intrusions comparable in age to regional porphyry mineralization events similar to many of the mines in the Arizona- Sonora Belt which includes over 10 significant copper operations.</p></li></ul><p><b>2026 Sampling North Area - \"Maria Luisa\" Epithermal Target</b></p><p>New exploration geochemistry results from the early 2026 program for the Maria Luisa part of the Ariel Project have high grade Ag and Pb typical of lateral expressions of porphyry copper like those in Arizona at Resolution, Globe-Miami and Bingham in Utah. Here, silver values reach up to &gt;10 oz/t Ag and Pb values reach up to <percent>5.4%</percent>, along with gold anomalies of up to 0.4 g/t Au, as shown in the Table, Summary Map, and Cross Section figures in this news release.  The sampling showed multiple sets of parallel veining consistent with what is common in major copper districts. Chip samples ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 m were taken by cutting the veins perpendicularly.

The exercise price for each TORM A-share is <money>DKK 167.14</money>, corresponding to the average of 90 calendar days preceding the publication of TORM plc's 2025 Annual Report plus a <percent>15%</percent> premium.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p> <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.oldick\">OLDWICK, N.J.</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--<b>AM Best </b>has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating of A+ (Superior) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of “aa-” (Superior) of Primerica Life Insurance Company (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tn.nashvl\">Nashville, TN</location>) and its affiliates, National Benefit Life Insurance Company (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.lonity\">Long Island City, NY</location>) and Primerica Life Insurance Company of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location> (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.on.misuga\">Mississauga, Ontario</location>), collectively referred to as Primerica Group. Additionally, AM Best has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of “a-” (Excellent) of Primerica, Inc. (Primerica) (headquartered in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ga.duluth\">Duluth, GA</location>) [NYSE: PRI], which is the holding company for the group’s insurance and non-insurance operating companies. AM Best also has affirmed the Long-Term Issue Credit Rating of “a-” (Excellent) on <money><money>$600 million</money></money>, <percent>2.8%</percent> senior unsecured notes, due 2031, of Primerica. The outlook of all these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.</p><p>The ratings reflect Primerica Group’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its very strong operating performance, favorable business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management.</p><p>Primerica’s credit ratings continue to recognize the group’s strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). The company’s balance sheet remains a core strength, characterized by strong liquidity and financial flexibility. Primerica has an investment profile that focuses on fixed-income assets, while maintaining only modest exposure to commercial mortgage-backed securities. However, the company’s business model does rely heavily on the use of reinsurance.</p><p>Primerica reinforced its position as an industry leader, consistently reporting high levels of earnings and top-tier return-on-equity measures among its peers. Steady premium growth, fueled by a vast and geographically diversified distribution system spanning the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> and Canadian marketplaces, continues to improve the company's operational strength. Primerica has extensive agent recruitment and a well-established monitoring system to ensure compliance and steady premium growth. Primerica’s use of highly rated reinsurance partners mitigates term life insurance mortality risk, a core component of its strong balance sheet management.</p><p>The group’s business profile is focused on its core term life insurance offering, particularly the investments made in its simplified issue product. Beyond the Primerica Group, Primerica also offers the distribution of primarily third-party investment and savings products and other non-life products.</p><p><b>This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

Orezone, to this day, has not responded to Abitibiwinni's letter.</p><p>\"The sale of Hecla Quebec and Casa Berardi marks an important transition in our continued efforts to reconcile the sustainable development of our lands with our stewardship responsibilities,\" said Chief Chantal Kistabish. \"Abitibiwinni's priority is to ensure that the sale, once finalized, leads us to constructive dialogue aimed at ensuring that fairness is restored in terms of our relationship with the mine and its owner and guaranteeing that further development only proceeds responsibly and with appropriate environmental safeguards.\"</p><p>The Casa Berardi mine is located entirely on Abitibiwinni's traditional lands, lands over which it has existing Aboriginal and Treaty rights. The mine is currently subject to an Impacts and Benefits Agreement (IBA) between Abitibiwinni and Hecla, but because of Hecla's refusal to allow the agreement to factor in the sharp rise in gold prices, the very foundation of the partnership between Hecla and the First Nation has been undermined.</p><p>In its letter, Abitibiwinni also raised concerns about the impact of mining activities in the region on woodland caribou. Given the species' cultural significance and ongoing decline, Abitibiwinni is moving to establish a network of protected areas in the region surrounding the Casa Berardi mine to protect the Detour-Kesagami caribou herd. Abitibiwinni expects both compagnies to support this initiative and insists that no further exploration or the possible expansion of the project can occur without its free and informed consent.</p><p>Abitibiwinni is therefore asking that Hecla and Orezone engage promptly in good-faith discussions to work toward a respectful and constructive path forward.</p><p>SOURCE Abitibiwinni First Nation Council</p></div></article>",

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 26, 2026) - <b>Masivo Silver Corp. (TSXV: MASS) (OTC Pink: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/GNYPF/\" title=\"View GNYPF stock overview\">GNYPF</a>) (FSE: R74) (</b>\"<b>Masivo\" or the </b>\"<b>Company\")</b> is pleased to announce that the Company's Phase I diamond drill program has begun at its Cerro Colorado Project in Sonora, Mexico.</p><p>The initial phase of the program consists of approximately eight (8) diamond drill holes totaling an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 meters. The program is designed to systematically test high-priority silver-copper targets identified through geological mapping, surface sampling, and historical data compilation.</p><p>David G. Coburn, CEO and Director, commented:</p><p>\"The start of drilling at Cerro Colorado is a pivotal moment for Masivo. We are now systematically testing what we have evidence at surface of being at least 1.2 km structurally controlled, expanding silver-copper system with clear evidence of scale at surface. These first holes are designed to validate our geological model and demonstrate continuity at depth. We believe this program has the potential to materially expand the footprint of mineralization and unlock significant value for shareholders.\" </p><p><b>Hole A</b> targets a depth of 130 meters, with the objective of hitting a zone of polymetallic sulfides that may correspond to an anomaly of high chargeability found in the geophysics program or induced polarization (\"IP\") at a depth of 100 meters below surface. There is strong potential for significantly higher values of silver (Ag), gold (Au), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn).</p><p><b>Hole B </b>is planned approximately 500 meters northeast of Hole A, targeting a depth of 150 meters. The objective is to test a high chargeability anomaly and follow up on high-grade values identified in sulfide material from the dumps of historic mine workings, which returned assays of 1,840 g/t silver (Ag), 4.82 g/t gold (Au), <percent>3.06%</percent> copper (Cu), <percent>4.55%</percent> lead (Pb), and <percent>2.92%</percent> zinc (Zn).</p><p><b>Holes C, D &amp; E</b> are planned between Holes A and B, with the objective of testing the high chargeability anomaly within the same mineralized structure. Hole C and E are designed to reach a target depth of 150 meters, while hole D is planned to extend deeper to 200 meters.</p><p><b>Holes F &amp; G</b> are planned to reach depths of 150 to 300 meters northeast of Hole B. Their objective is to test the high chargeability anomaly and assess the continuity of the mineralized structure along a well-defined southwest-to-northeast (SW-NE) trend.</p><p><b>Hole H</b> is oriented in a different direction, targeting a southeast-to-northwest (SE-NW) structural system that is perpendicular to the main southwest-to-northeast (SW-NE) trend.</p><p>This secondary structural system hosts a gold-copper-silver (Au-Cu-Ag) mineralization style, observed in several near-surface historic artisanal workings developed by local \"Gambusinos.\" These small-scale mines have returned high-grade values, including over 20 g/t gold (Au), 95 g/t silver (Ag), and <percent>0.8%</percent> copper (Cu). The planned depth for these holes is 120 meters.</p><p>The Cerro Colorado Project hosts numerous historic workings and surface exposures of silver-copper mineralization. Previous surface sampling has returned encouraging silver and copper values associated with quartz veining, breccia zones, and structurally controlled shear zones. The current drill program represents the first systematic test of several priority targets at depth and is intended to confirm continuity of mineralization below surface exposures.</p><p><b>Historic Drill Results (2015)</b></p><p>Historic drilling completed by Minera Gold Zone in 2015 on the southwestern margin of the Cerro Colorado system returned broad, near-surface, polymetallic silver and base-metal mineralization, including the following intercepts:</p><ul><li><b>ETCC-15-01:</b> 29.65 m @ 50.74 g/t Ag, <percent>0.607%</percent> Zn, <percent>0.131%</percent> Pb, <percent>0.053%</percent> Cu, and 0.062 g/t Au (48.80-78.45 m), including 5.05 m @ 254 g/t Ag and 2.95 m @ 384 g/t Ag.<br/><br/></li><li><b>ETCC-15-04</b>: 35.80 m @ 23.44 g/t Ag and <percent>0.406%</percent> Zn (44.50-80.30 m), including 3.15 m @ 159.06 g/t Ag and 0.60 m @ 577 g/t Ag (with associated base metals and gold).</li></ul><p>These historic intercepts, together with recent mapping and surface sampling, support the current Phase I drill program designed to test the continuity and structural controls of mineralization at depth.</p><p>Please visit the following link for drill program map and information. </p><p><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/DOy4gCPZEa\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://masivosilver.com/cerro-colorado</a></p><p>The Company will provide updates as the program progresses.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Brian Brewer, PGeo, is Masivo Silver's qualified person for the company's projects in Mexico and Nevada and has approved this news release.</p><div id=\"contactInfo\"><p>About Masivo Silver Corp.</p><p>Masivo is a Canadian junior silver and gold mining exploration company based in Vancouver, Canada.
