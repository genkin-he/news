The program remains focused on extending known mineralization and further refining mine planning, setting the stage for the 2026 exploration program, which is now underway with the objective of extending mine life.</p><p>Building on these developments, the Company has commenced work to expand the existing leach pad by adding capacity for an additional 3 million tonnes of ore. In addition, detailed engineering and permitting for a new leach pad are undergoing final review. Together, these initiatives are expected to extend leaching capacity through 2033.</p><p>To support anticipated production requirements, the mobile fleet will be increased by three additional haul trucks, bringing the total fleet size to twelve during 2026. Golden Queen also replaced the stacker and the agglomeration drum, improvements that enhanced ore stacking quality. The agglomeration process improved the quality of the stacked material, while the new stacker enhanced blending and reduced fine particle segregation. These improvements are expected to result in higher solution percolation rates and reduced particle migration. The Merrill-Crowe Plant is undergoing an upgrade from a capacity of approximately 3,000 gallons per minute (GPM) to 4,000 GPM, with commissioning planned for the fourth quarter. This upgrade is expected to increase gold and silver production from the leach pad by approximately 6 to <percent>10%</percent> by directing a higher proportion of lower-grade solution to the Merrill-Crowe process and reducing the volume sent to the operating pond.</p><p><b>San Bartolome Outlook</b></p><p>In 2025, San Bartolome advanced its ore supply strategy by establishing new ore purchase agreements with local communities, supporting long-term operational stability while broadening its network of business partners. In addition, the Company finalized a long-term agreement with COMIBOL to acquire up to 7 million tonnes of oxide ore within a 250-kilometre radius of the processing facility. The first delivery of ore is anticipated by the end of 2026, increasing the diversity of feed sources over the long term and enhancing future feed strategies.</p><p>Transportation logistics at San Bartolome were notably improved in 2025, contributing to a <percent>21%</percent> increase in processing throughput compared to the previous year. Building on this progress, the focus in 2026 will be on improving processing recoveries through automation initiatives and the construction of an additional thickener, scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2027. These process improvements are expected to improve recovery rates by approximately <percent>0.5%</percent> to <percent>1.0%</percent>.</p><p><b>2026 Guidance </b></p><p>At Golden Queen, capital investment in 2026 is primarily directed toward infrastructure and mine development initiatives supporting exploration results and potential mine life extension. Planned expenditures include the expansion of the existing leach pad, detailed engineering and permitting for the construction of a new leach pad, acquisition of three additional haul trucks, deferred waste stripping, and upgrades to the Merrill-Crowe facility. These investments are intended to ensure sufficient processing capacity and operational flexibility to support anticipated future production requirements.</p><p>At San Bartolome, capital spending in 2026 is focused on processing enhancements and sustaining infrastructure. Planned capital expenditures include the construction of an additional thickener and related plant optimization initiatives designed to improve overall plant performance.</p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align: start;

It is approved for use in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), relapsed or refractory Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), and in locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma.</p><p>A Phase III study (NCT06127407) is now underway in adults (18+) with locally advanced or metastatic conventional chondrosarcoma carrying an IDH1 mutation. Eligible participants may be either treatment-naïve or have received one previous systemic therapy. Primary completion is anticipated in February 2028.</p><p><b>Inhibrx Biosciences' Ozekibart (INBRX-109)</b> is a tetravalent agonist that targets human Death Receptor 5 (DR5) to induce tumor-selective programmed cell death. Built using Inhibrx's single-domain antibody platform, it is engineered to optimize both agonistic activity and safety. DR5 is a receptor for TRAIL (Tumor Necrosis Factor–related Apoptosis-inducing Ligand). The US FDA has granted Fast Track Designation to INBRX-109 for patients with unresectable or metastatic conventional chondrosarcoma. A Phase II trial of ozekibart (NCT04950075) is currently recruiting patients with unresectable or metastatic conventional chondrosarcoma, according to ClinicalTrials.gov.</p><p>The anticipated launch of these emerging therapies are poised to transform the chondrosarcoma market landscape in the coming years.

It most commonly affects the bones of the pelvis, hip, and shoulder, but it can occur in any cartilage-bearing area of the body. Unlike some other bone cancers, chondrosarcoma typically grows slowly; however, certain aggressive forms can metastasize to other parts of the body. Symptoms often include persistent pain, swelling, or a noticeable lump near the affected bone. Treatment usually focuses on surgery to remove the tumor, as chondrosarcoma is often resistant to chemotherapy and radiation.</p><p><b>Chondrosarcoma Epidemiology Segmentation</b></p><p>The chondrosarcoma epidemiology section provides insights into the historical and current chondrosarcoma patient pool and forecasted trends for the leading markets.

The Birch-to-Taylor Expansion includes a new 95-kilometre pipeline and facility upgrades that will add approximately 120,000 barrels per day (\"bpd\") of capacity in that corridor. The initial scope of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.bc.taylor\">Taylor</location>-to-Gordondale Expansion includes new and upgraded pump stations downstream of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.bc.taylor\">Taylor, British Columbia</location> and a new 16-kilometre pipeline connecting production in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.ab\">Alberta</location> to the Gordondale pump station.</li></ul><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li><b>Cedar LNG</b> - as previously disclosed, during the quarter, Pembina entered into long-term agreements with a subsidiary of Petroliam Nasional Berhad (\"PETRONAS\") and Ovintiv Inc.

Reliable, cost‑effective, and responsibly developed and operated infrastructure that supports access to high value markets has never been more essential. Pembina is meeting this need with an integrated value chain that continues to demonstrate resilience, efficiency, and the ability to convert Western Canada’s resource strength into durable value for its customers, employees, communities, and investors.</p><p>The Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (\"WCSB\") is one of the world’s most prolific hydrocarbon regions and continues to experience production growth driven by dynamic new catalysts. The development of LNG export facilities, including Pembina and the Haisla Nation's Cedar LNG Project, continues to unlock new global markets for Canadian natural gas, creating long-term demand and incentivizing production growth. New pipeline capacity improves crude oil egress and drives the need for incremental condensate production. Expanding petrochemical facilities in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.ab\">Alberta</location> are increasing demand for ethane,<b> </b>while Alberta’s developing new data centre industry may emerge as a significant new source of natural gas-powered electricity demand.</p><p>Supporting this growth outlook, Pembina has observed a shift in tone from government policy makers that could positively impact how the Canadian energy industry evolves. At both the federal and provincial level, there is momentum building towards reshaping Canada’s energy strategy in a way that could unlock its abundant and diverse energy resources. Recent policy signals and regulatory initiatives demonstrate a renewed commitment to supporting responsible energy infrastructure development, recognizing the vital role Canadian energy plays in global supply security and economic prosperity.</p><p>Pembina stands at the heart of the WCSB and is responding to growing production and an evolving energy landscape with a clear and focused strategy - to provide safe, reliable, responsible, and cost-effective energy infrastructure solutions that connect producers to high value global markets.</p><p>Pembina is the only Canadian energy infrastructure company with an integrated value chain providing a full suite of midstream and transportation services across all commodities - natural gas, NGL (ethane, propane and butane), condensate, and crude oil. Pembina's scope, scale, and access to premium North American and global markets, differentiate the Company and uniquely position it to capture incremental new volumes in the WCSB, while unlocking new avenues for sustainable growth beyond its strong legacy businesses.</p><p>Further, Pembina's approach to capital allocation remains disciplined, targeting investments that enhance long‑term fee‑based cash flow per share growth and support a sustainable and growing dividend. The Company is focused on ensuring the long-term resilience of the business and providing investors with visibility to attractive long‑term fee‑based EBITDA per share growth through the end of the decade and beyond.</p><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">2025 Accomplishments</span></b></p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li><span class=\"bwuline\">Strong Financial and Operational Results:</span> adjusted EBITDA of <money><money>$4.3 billion</money></money>, within the Company's original 2025 guidance range; achieved record Pipelines and Facilities volumes of 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.</li></ul><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li><span class=\"bwuline\">Safety &amp; Environment:</span> strong execution with Pembina exceeding its internal 2025 targets, highlighted by improved performance across key safety and environmental indicators relative to 3-year averages.</li></ul><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li><span class=\"bwuline\">Pipeline Contracting Success Supports Long-Term Resilience:</span> renewed existing contracts, and executed incremental new contracts, totaling over 200,000 bpd of conventional pipeline transportation capacity; significantly strengthened Alliance's long-term contractual profile as shippers elected a new 10-year toll option on approximately 96 percent of available capacity; and contracted the remaining capacity available on the 100,000 bpd Nipisi Pipeline, which was reactivated in 2023 to serve the growing <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.bc.cleter\">Clearwater</location> heavy oil play.</li></ul><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li><span class=\"bwuline\">Responding to Growing Demand for Condensate and NGL Transportation:</span> progressed development of a multi-year plan that includes up to approximately <money><money>$1 billion</money></money> of potential conventional pipeline expansions to reliably and cost-effectively meet rising transportation demands from growing production in the WCSB.</li></ul><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li><span class=\"bwuline\">Enhanced Propane Exports:</span> Through a new 30,000 bpd LPG export agreement with AltaGas at its West Coast terminals, and the sanctioning of the Prince Rupert Terminal Optimization project, Pembina ensured access to 50,000 bpd of highly competitive propane export capacity to premium price markets, including in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/asp\">Asia</location>, for Pembina's own and customers’ propane.</li></ul><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li><span class=\"bwuline\">Cedar LNG Construction and Commercial Execution:</span> advanced construction of the floating LNG vessel to over 35 percent complete; significantly progressed onshore construction activities; and completed remarketing of Pembina's 1.5 mtpa of Cedar LNG capacity with PETRONAS, an LNG industry leader, and Ovintiv, one of the largest, liquids-rich natural gas producers in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada's</location> <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.bc.monney\">Montney</location> play.

The project has an estimated cost of approximately <money><money>$310 million</money></money>, and an anticipated in-service date in the fourth quarter of 2027. The expansion will be supported by a cost-of-service commercial structure.<br/><br/>\"This milestone reflects strong collaboration with both Indigenous and local communities built on trust and open engagement,\" said Scott Burrows, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"It also reflects strong engagement with the Government of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.bc\">British Columbia</location> and the BC Energy Regulator, whose guidance and regulatory oversight have helped establish a clear and responsible path forward for this project and for sustainable development in the region in the future.\"<br/><br/>Pembina is also proceeding with a phased approach to the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.bc.taylor\">Taylor</location>-to-Gordondale Expansion, which is being optimized to meet customers' near-term transportation needs while maintaining Pembina's track record of disciplined capital investment.<br/><br/>Pembina<sup>3</sup> has sanctioned the initial scope of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.bc.taylor\">Taylor</location>-to-Gordondale Expansion, which includes new and upgraded pump stations downstream of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.bc.taylor\">Taylor, British Columbia</location> and a new 16-kilometre pipeline connecting production in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.ab\">Alberta</location> to the Gordondale pump station. The initial scope of the project has an estimated cost of approximately <money><money>$115 million</money></money>, with an anticipated in-service date in the first quarter of 2027, subject to regulatory approval. The expansion will be supported by long-term take-or-pay and other commercial agreements.<br/><br/>The remaining scope of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.bc.taylor\">Taylor</location>-to-Gordondale Expansion includes a new approximately 89 kilometer, 16-inch pipeline being proposed by Pembina<sup>4</sup> to connect mostly condensate volumes from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.bc.taylor\">Taylor, British Columbia</location> to the Gordondale, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.ab\">Alberta</location> area. On February 10, 2026, the Canada Energy Regulator (\"CER\") issued a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the CER regulated <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.bc.taylor\">Taylor</location>-to-Gordondale Pipeline Project. This was the final federal regulatory approval required for the pipeline.

Both projects are expected to be placed in service by the end of the first quarter of 2026. The Wapiti Expansion is on time and on budget, and will increases natural gas processing capacity at the Wapiti Plant by 115 mmcf/d (gross to PGI). The K3 Cogeneration Facility is on time and trending under budget, and will reduce overall operating costs by providing power and heat to the gas processing facility, while reducing customers' exposure to power prices.</li></ul><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>On January 29, Dow Inc.

Further, Dow provided a revised timeline that includes a Phase 1 start-up by year-end 2029, and a Phase 2 start-up by year-end 2030.<br/><br/>As part of Dow's broader portfolio of assets and ethane supply requirements, the Path2Zero project supports Pembina's previously announced long-term agreement with Dow to supply up to 50,000 bpd of ethane. Pembina continues to evaluate its options to invest in new infrastructure required to meet its ethane supply commitments in the most capital efficient manner, given the revised Path2Zero timing. A final investment decision on new ethane supply infrastructure is expected in 2026.<br/><br/>Path2Zero is a positive development for WCSB producers as it will catalyze significant new ethane demand, the extraction of which is expected to also increase the supply of other associated NGL - propane, butane and condensate. The resulting volume growth across the WCSB is expected to benefit Pembina by supporting higher utilization and potential expansions of its assets.</li></ul><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl bwwidth100\"><tr><td class=\"bwvertalignt bwpadl0 bwwidth98\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"bwcellpmargin\">[1] Pouce Coupé Pipe Line Ltd. and Plateau Pipe Line Ltd.</p><p class=\"bwcellpmargin\">[2] Plateau Pipe Line Ltd.</p><p class=\"bwcellpmargin\">[3] Plateau Pipe Line Ltd. and Pembina</p><p class=\"bwcellpmargin\">[4] Pouce Coupé Pipe Line Ltd.</p></td></tr></table><p><b><span class=\"bwuline\">Priorities for the Year Ahead</span></b></p><p>Operational &amp; Project Execution Excellence</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Foremost priority of continued safe and reliable operations, focusing on employee and contractor safety, and high asset availability and reliability.</li></ul><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Continued safe, on-time, and on-budget execution of inflight construction projects.</li></ul><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Placing the RFS IV Expansion, Wapiti Expansion, and K3 Cogeneration Facility into service.</li></ul><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Under previously announced funding agreements, PGI in collaboration with certain producer customers, expects to place approximately <money><money>$725 million</money></money> (<money><money>$435 million</money></money> net to Pembina) of new infrastructure into service throughout 2026; the new infrastructure is being constructed, and will be operated, by the customers, while PGI will own the assets, which are supported by long-term take-or-pay agreements.</li></ul><p>Commercial &amp; Strategic Excellence</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Maintaining a long-term, durable cash flow stream through ongoing contracting of existing assets, including Pembina's Peace Pipeline system and Redwater Complex, as well as PGI's assets.</li></ul><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Making a final investment decision on an ethane supply project to support growing market demand.</li></ul><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Advancing development and making a final investment decision on the Greenlight Electricity Centre.</li></ul><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Evaluating opportunities to increase egress capacity, including the optimization or expansion of the Nipisi Pipeline and the re-purposing of existing underutilized assets, to respond to growing volumes from the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.bc.cleter\">Clearwater</location> area and strong customer demand for incremental service.</li></ul><p>Financial Excellence</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Achieving results within Pembina's 2026 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of <money><money>$4.12</money>5 billion</money> to <money><money>$4.42</money>5 billion</money>; the midpoint of the 2026 guidance range represents 2023 to 2026 fee-based adjusted EBITDA per share compound annual growth of approximately five percent, positioning Pembina to deliver on the target provided at its 2024 Investor Day.</li></ul><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Enhancing Pembina's long-term sustainability and competitiveness through a disciplined focus on costs and productivity.</li></ul><p><b>Financial &amp; Operational Highlights</b></p><p><b>Adjusted EBITDA</b></p><p>Pembina reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA of <money><money>$1,075 million</money></money> in the fourth quarter and full year adjusted EBITDA of <money><money>$4,289 million</money></money>.

Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization</span></i></p><p><i>Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated as earnings before net finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (included in gross profit and general and administrative expense), and unrealized gains or losses from derivative instruments. The exclusion of unrealized gains or losses from derivative instruments eliminates the non-cash impact of such gains or losses.</i></p><p><i>Adjusted EBITDA also includes adjustments to earnings for non-controlling interest, losses (gains) on disposal of assets, transaction costs incurred in respect of acquisitions, dispositions and restructuring, impairment charges or reversals in respect of goodwill, intangible assets, investments in equity accounted investees and property, plant and equipment, certain non-cash provisions and other amounts not reflective of ongoing operations. These additional adjustments are made to exclude various non-cash and other items that are not reflective of ongoing operations. Following completion of Pembina acquiring a controlling ownership interest in Alliance and Aux Sable on April 1, 2024, Pembina revised the definition of adjusted EBITDA to deduct earnings for the 14.6 percent non-controlling interest in the Aux Sable <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> operations. Pembina's subsequent acquisition of the remaining interest in Aux Sable's <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> operations in the third quarter of 2024 resulted in all of Aux Sable's results being included in the adjusted EBITDA calculation beginning on August 1, 2024.</i></p><p><i>Management believes that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors as it is an important indicator of Pembina's ability to generate liquidity through cash flow from operating activities and equity accounted investees. Management also believes that adjusted EBITDA provides an indicator of operating income generated from capital expenditures, which includes operational finance income and gains from lessor lease arrangements. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by investors and analysts for assessing financial performance and for the purpose of valuing Pembina, including calculating financial and leverage ratios. Management utilizes adjusted EBITDA to set objectives and as a key performance indicator of the Company's success. Pembina presents adjusted EBITDA as management believes it is a measure frequently used by analysts, investors and other stakeholders in evaluating the Company's financial performance. The most directly comparable financial measure to adjusted EBITDA that is specified, defined and determined in accordance with GAAP and disclosed in Pembina's financial statements is earnings.</i></p><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl bwwidth100\"><tr><td class=\"bwvertalignb bwtopsingle bwpadl1 bwwidth28\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p

per Common Share</span></i></p><p><i>Adjusted cash flow from operating activities is a non-GAAP measure which is defined as cash flow from operating activities adjusting for the change in non-cash operating working capital, adjusting for current tax and share-based compensation payments, and deducting distributions to non-controlling interests and preferred share dividends paid. Adjusted cash flow from operating activities deducts distributions to non-controlling interest and preferred share dividends paid because they are not attributable to common shareholders. The calculation has been modified to exclude current tax expense and accrued share-based payment expense, and to include the impact of cash paid for taxes and share-based compensation, as it allows management to better assess the obligations discussed below.</i></p><p><i>Management believes that adjusted cash flow from operating activities provides comparable information to investors for assessing financial performance during each reporting period. Management utilizes adjusted cash flow from operating activities to set objectives and as a key performance indicator of the Company's ability to meet interest obligations, dividend payments and other commitments. Adjusted cash flow from operating activities per common share is a non-GAAP financial ratio which is calculated by dividing adjusted cash flow from operating activities by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.</i></p><p><i>Following completion of Pembina acquiring a controlling ownership interest in Alliance and Aux Sable on April 1, 2024, Pembina revised the definition of adjusted cash flow from operating activities to deduct distributions related to non-controlling interest in the Aux Sable <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> operations.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><i><strong>Albany Graphite uniquely positioned at intersection of NATO, federal, and provincial critical minerals mandates; Company accelerating path to Pre-Feasibility Study</strong></i></p><p><strong id=\"dateline\">GUELPH, ON / <a href=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ACCESS Newswire</a> / February 26, 2026 / </strong>Zentek Ltd. (TSXV:ZEN)(NASDAQ:<a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/ZTEK/\" title=\"View ZTEK stock overview\">ZTEK</a>) (\"Zentek\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to provide shareholders with an update on its strategic government engagement and its accelerating path toward a Pre-Feasibility Study (\"PFS\") for the Albany Graphite Project.</p><p><strong>Government Engagement and Strategic Positioning</strong></p><p>Albany Graphite is uniquely positioned at the intersection of multiple government priorities across federal, provincial, and allied-nation mandates. The Company is actively engaged with all levels of government to advance its project and secure non-dilutive funding.</p><p><strong>NATO and Allied Defence Supply Chains</strong></p><p>In December 2024, NATO released its first-ever list of 12 defence-critical raw materials, which includes graphite. NATO identified graphite as essential for the production of main battle tanks, naval vessels, and submarine components, noting that disruptions in graphite supply could impact the production of essential defence equipment.</p><p>Canada's first Defence Industrial Strategy, launched by Prime Minister Carney on February 17, 2026, explicitly highlighted Canada's role as a reliable source of NATO defence-critical minerals, noting that Canada already produces 10 of the 12 minerals on NATO's list - including graphite. The strategy established a Defence Investment Agency to provide single-point coordination for defence-related mineral sourcing with fast-track approval processes.</p><p>Zentek's Albany Graphite has demonstrated nuclear-grade material purity and physical properties (<percent>99.9992%</percent> purity, equivalent boron concentration of 2.60 ppm) through independent laboratory-scale testing conducted in collaboration with American Energy Technologies Company as previously disclosed by the Company on September 22, 2025, meeting key benchmarks for nuclear-grade graphite blocks including strength, density, electrical performance, and extremely low impurity levels. This positions Albany as a potential domestic source of defence-critical graphite for NATO allied supply chains.</p><p><strong>Federal Government Programs</strong></p><p>The Company is actively engaged with multiple federal funding programs aligned with Canada's Critical Minerals Strategy:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Strategic Resource Fund: </strong>Canada's <money>$2</money>-billion Critical Minerals Sovereign Fund provides equity investments, loan guarantees, and offtake agreements to advance strategic mining projects. Albany Graphite's nuclear-grade credentials and domestic supply chain positioning align directly with the Fund's mandate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Critical Minerals Research, Development and Demonstration Program </strong>(\"CMRDD\")<strong>: </strong>Extended to March 31, 2028, the CMRDD supports scale-up of transformative processing technologies - directly relevant to Zentek's proprietary fluidized bed reactor (\"FBR\") thermal purification process.</p></li><li><p><strong>Clean Technology Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit: </strong>Provides a refundable tax credit of up to <percent>30%</percent> on eligible capital expenditures for critical mineral processing equipment, applicable to future FBR capital deployment.</p></li><li><p><strong>G7 Critical Minerals Production Alliance: </strong>Canada has unlocked 26 new investments and partnerships with nine allied countries to secure critical minerals supply chains. Graphite is among the eligible commodities, with several Canadian graphite projects already receiving support under this framework.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Provincial Government - Ontario</strong></p><p>Ontario's Critical Minerals Strategy (2022-2027) and the Ministry of Energy and Mines' 2025-2026 mandate provide a comprehensive framework that directly supports Albany Graphite's advancement:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Critical Minerals Processing Fund: </strong>Ontario's landmark <money>$500 million</money> fund, announced in the 2025 provincial budget, supports processing facility development directly applicable to the Company's planned FBR processing operations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Critical Minerals Innovation Fund: </strong>An additional <money>$25 million</money> to accelerate commercialization and reduce reliance on foreign sources, supporting research, innovation, and industry partnerships.</p></li><li><p><strong>Invest Ontario: </strong>The Company continues discussions with Invest Ontario regarding potential project support. Ontario has positioned itself as the top jurisdiction in Canada for mineral exploration and development.</p></li><li><p><strong>\"One Project, One Process\" (1P1P): </strong>Ontario's new permitting framework, launched in late 2025, is designed to cut approval times in half through a coordinated single-window approach - potentially accelerating Albany's path through the permitting process.</p></li></ul><p>Ontario's nuclear advantage is particularly relevant: with nuclear power supplying approximately <percent>50%</percent> of the province's electricity and the construction of the first grid-scale Small Modular Reactor in the G7, Ontario is creating growing demand for nuclear-grade graphite that Albany is uniquely positioned to supply from within the province.</p><p><strong>United States - Defence and Stockpiling</strong></p><p>In 2025, the US Department of Defense announced its intent to procure up to <money>$1 billion</money> USD in stockpile materials, including graphite, with the Trump Administration announcing a <money>$12 billion</money> USD critical minerals stockpile initiative. As a near-border project with demonstrated nuclear-grade performance, Albany Graphite is positioned to potentially supply into US defence and energy supply chains.</p><p><strong>Accelerating Toward Pre-Feasibility</strong></p><p>The Company is taking concrete steps to de-risk the Albany Graphite Project and advance toward a Pre-Feasibility Study (\"PFS\") on the most reasonable timeline possible:</p><p><strong>New Preliminary Economic Assessment (\"PEA\")</strong></p><p>The Company intends to mandate an established engineering firm with prior knowledge of the Albany deposit to prepare a new PEA reflecting current market conditions, the Company's proprietary FBR purification technology, and the expanded market opportunity in nuclear-grade, battery-grade, and defence applications. A PEA was previously completed in 2015 and is not current under NI 43-101, having been prepared under a different market and technology paradigm. A new PEA is a Gate 1 requirement for multiple government funding programs and is expected to be a significant catalyst for the Company and its shareholders. The Company is targeting engagement in the current fiscal quarter.</p><p><strong>Second-Year Environmental Baseline Work</strong></p><p>The Company plans to initiate the second year of environmental baseline studies at the Albany site. This work is a prerequisite for the Environmental Assessment process and is required to advance toward a PFS and ultimately a construction decision. Early initiation of this workstream is intended to avoid unnecessary delays in the overall project timeline.</p><p><strong>Path to Pre-Feasibility Study</strong></p><p>Collectively, these activities - the new PEA, environmental baseline work, FBR engineering advancement, and government funding engagement - are designed to systematically de-risk the Albany Graphite Project and position the Company to initiate a PFS in the most reasonable timeline possible.</p><p><strong>Management Commentary</strong></p><p>\"Albany sits at the intersection of everything Western governments are prioritizing right now: NATO defence supply chains, nuclear energy, battery materials, and domestic critical minerals production. The breadth of government programs aligned with our project is unlike anything we've seen in the sector, and we intend to move through them systematically,\" said Mohammed (Moe) Jiwan, CEO of Zentek. \"The updated PEA is a pivotal step. The previous study was completed in 2015 under entirely different market conditions and without our FBR purification technology. A new economic evaluation reflecting today's graphite market, expanded nuclear and defence applications, and our proprietary processing approach, is expected to provide an updated preliminary assessment of Albany's economic potential.\"</p><p>Mr. Peter Wood, P.Eng., P.Geo., Vice President of Development of the Company's wholly owned subsidiary Albany Graphite Corp., a \"Qualified Person\" under NI 43-101, has reviewed and approved the technical information contained in this news release.</p><p><strong>About Zentek</strong></p><p>Zentek Ltd. is a Canadian IP development and commercialization company focused on next-generation healthcare solutions and the development of the Albany Graphite deposit, a unique source of high-purity graphite located in Northern Ontario.

Walcott and Associates from an Induced Polarization (IP) program conducted in February 2026 to follow up excellent prior results from both surface sampling and historical drilling at the Sappho Critical Minerals Target (Figure 1). In light of the current escalating metal prices for critical minerals/metals including copper (Cu), platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), gold (Au) and silver (Ag), the Sappho Skarn/Porphyry Target warrants follow-up exploration including drilling. A total of four lines of IP for 4.5 line-kms were completed. Further IP work is being planned prior to the commencement of drilling.

A total of five new showings of copper oxide mineralization were found during the 2022 program (Figure 1). Previous surface sampling and drilling by Grizzly has yielded significant anomalous copper, gold, silver along with platinum and palladium.

These higher grade zones were contained within a 63.5 m core length zone logged as a pyroxene - sulphide skarn with a grade approaching <percent>0.7%</percent> copper equivalent derived from current metal prices for Cu, Au, Ag, Pt and Pd. Drillhole 10SP03  targeted  a  magnetic  anomaly  and  had  no  indications of surface mineralization at the time of drilling.

The NCIB will be effected in accordance with the TSX NCIB rules and/or Rule 10b-18 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which contain restrictions on the number of common shares that may be purchased on a single day, subject to certain exceptions for block purchases, based on the average daily trading volumes of Obsidian Energy's common shares on the applicable exchange.</p><p>The total number of common shares Obsidian Energy is permitted to purchase on the TSX is subject to a daily purchase limit of 59,759 common shares, representing 25 percent of the average daily trading volume of 239,036 common shares on the TSX calculated for the six-month period ended January 31, 2026. However, the Company may make one block purchase per calendar week on the TSX which exceeds such daily repurchase restrictions. Any common shares that are purchased under the NCIB will be cancelled upon their purchase by Obsidian Energy.</p><p>The actual number of common shares that may be purchased under the NCIB and the timing of any such purchases will be determined by Obsidian Energy. The Company believes that, at times, the prevailing share price does not reflect the underlying value of our common shares and the repurchase of our common shares for cancellation represents an attractive opportunity to enhance Obsidian Energy's per share metrics, and thereby increase the underlying value of the Company's common shares for our shareholders.  </p><p>Obsidian Energy has established an automatic securities purchase plan with a designated broker whereby common shares may be repurchased at times when such purchases would otherwise be prohibited pursuant to regulatory restrictions or self-imposed blackout periods. Under the automatic securities purchase plan and before entering into a self-imposed blackout period, the Company may, but is not required to, request that the designated broker make purchases under the NCIB. Such purchases will be made at the discretion of the designated broker, within parameters established by Obsidian Energy prior to the blackout periods. Outside of the blackout periods, purchases are made at the discretion of the Company's management. The automatic securities purchase plan constitutes an \"automatic plan\" for purposes of applicable Canadian securities legislation and has been pre-cleared by the TSX.</p><p>The Company is permitted to repurchase up to 7,144,408 common shares under its current NCIB that commenced on March 3, 2025, and will expire on March 2, 2026. As at February 17, 2026, Obsidian Energy had repurchased 7,144,408 common shares on the open market, which was the maximum allowed under our expiring NCIB, at a volume weighted average price per common share of approximately <money>$7.16</money> per share.                             </p><p><b>ABOUT OBSIDIAN ENERGY</b></p><p>Obsidian Energy is an intermediate-sized oil and gas producer with a well-balanced portfolio of high-quality assets, primarily in the Peace River, Willesden Green and Viking areas in Alberta.

The use of any of the words \"expect\", \"anticipate\", \"continue\", \"estimate\", \"objective\", \"ongoing\", \"may\", \"will\", \"project\", \"should\", \"believe\", \"plans\", \"intends\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or information. More particularly and without limitation, this news release contains forward-looking statements and information concerning: the timing, methods and quantity of any purchases by Obsidian Energy of its common shares under the NCIB; and the Company's belief that the repurchase of common shares under the NCIB will increase the underlying value of common shares held by shareholders.</p><p>The forward-looking statements and information are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by Obsidian Energy, including: the duration and impact of tariffs that are currently in effect on goods exported from or imported in Canada,  and that other than such tariffs, neither the U.S. nor Canada (i) increases the rate or scope of such tariffs, reenacts tariffs that are currently suspended, or imposes new tariffs, on the import of goods from one country to the other, including on oil and natural gas, and/or (ii) imposes any other form of tax, restriction or prohibition on the import or export of products from one country to the other, including on oil and natural gas; Obsidian Energy's views with respect to its financial condition and prospects, the stability of general economic and market conditions, currency exchange rates and interest rates; the availability of cash or other financing sources to fund repurchases of common shares under the NCIB and our ability to comply with applicable terms and conditions under the Company's debt agreements; the existence of alternative uses for Obsidian Energy's cash and other financial resources.</p><p>The future acquisition by the Company of the Company's common shares pursuant to its share buyback program (including through its NCIB), if any, and the level thereof is uncertain. Any decision to acquire common shares of the Company pursuant to the share buyback program will be subject to the discretion of the board of directors of the Company and may depend on a variety of factors, including, without limitation, the Company's business performance, financial condition, financial requirements, growth plans, expected capital requirements and other conditions existing at such future time including, without limitation, contractual restrictions and satisfaction of the solvency tests imposed on the Company under applicable corporate law. There can be no assurance of the number of common shares of the Company that the Company will acquire pursuant to its share buyback program, if any, in the future.</p><p>Although Obsidian Energy believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking statements and information are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements and information because Obsidian Energy can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. By its nature, such forward-looking statements and information are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which could cause the actual results and expectations to differ materially from the anticipated results or expectations expressed. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the risk that: (i) the tariffs that are currently in effect on goods exported from or imported into Canada continue in effect for an extended period of time, the tariffs that have been threatened are implemented, the tariffs that are currently suspended are reactivated, the rate or scope of tariffs are increased, or new tariffs are imposed, including on oil and natural gas, (ii) the U.S. and/or Canada imposes any other form of tax, restriction or prohibition on the import or export of products from one country to the other, including on oil and natural gas, and (iii) the tariffs imposed or threatened to be imposed by the U.S. on other countries and retaliatory tariffs imposed or threatened to be imposed by other countries on the US, will trigger a broader global trade ware which  could have a material adverse effect on the Canadian, U.S. and global economies, and by extension the Canadian oil and natural gas industry and the Company, including by decreasing demand for (and the price of) oil and natural gas, disrupting supply chains, increasing costs, causing volatility in global financial markets, and limiting access to financing; our inability to repurchase common shares under the NCIB in the amounts permitted or at all due to a lack of financial resources; the inability to comply with our debt agreements; legal restrictions on share repurchases; competing demands for our financial resources; the anticipated benefits of repurchasing our shares under the NCIB do not materialize; Obsidian Energy's future capital requirements; general economic and market conditions; demand for Obsidian Energy's products; and unforeseen legal or regulatory developments and other risk factors detailed from time to time in Obsidian Energy reports filed with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.  Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. Readers are cautioned that the assumptions used in the preparation of such forward-looking statements and information, although considered reasonable at the time of preparation, may prove to be imprecise and, as such, undue reliance should not be placed on such forward-looking statements and information. Obsidian Energy gives no assurance that any of the events anticipated will transpire or occur, or, if any of them do, what benefits Obsidian Energy will derive from them.

Such dividends are generally treated by shareholders as interest income, so that each shareholder is in the same position as if the mortgage investments made by the company had been made directly by the shareholder.
