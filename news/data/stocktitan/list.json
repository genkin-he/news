            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><div class=\"xn-content\"><p><span class=\"legendSpanClass\">PIKOGAN, QC</span>, <span class=\"legendSpanClass\">Feb. 26, 2026</span> /PRNewswire/ - Abitibiwinni First Nation (hereinafter \"Abitibiwinni\") is calling on Hecla Mining Company (NYSE: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/HL/\" title=\"View HL stock overview\">HL</a>) (\"Hecla\") and Orezone Gold Corporation (TSX: ORE) (ASX: ORE) (OTCQX: ORZCF) (\"Orezone\") to ensure a smooth and fair transition that respects its Aboriginal rights and aligns future operations with current economic and environmental realities as part of the proposed sale of Hecla's subsidiary \"Hecla Quebec\" and its Casa Berardi Mine to Orezone.</p><div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1\"><p><a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2921356/Abitibiwinni_First_Nation_Council_CANADIAN_FIRST_NATION_SEEKS_TO.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Abitibiwinni First Nation (CNW Group/Abitibiwinni First Nation Council)\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2921356/Abitibiwinni_First_Nation_Council_CANADIAN_FIRST_NATION_SEEKS_TO.jpg\" title=\"Abitibiwinni First Nation (CNW Group/Abitibiwinni First Nation Council)\"/></a></p></div><p>These concerns were raised by Abitibiwinni in a letter sent to the presidents of both Hecla and Orezone on February 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2026, concerns which were largely dismissed and ignored by Hecla in its response dated February 16, 2026. Orezone, to this day, has not responded to Abitibiwinni's letter.</p><p>\"The sale of Hecla Quebec and Casa Berardi marks an important transition in our continued efforts to reconcile the sustainable development of our lands with our stewardship responsibilities,\" said Chief Chantal Kistabish. \"Abitibiwinni's priority is to ensure that the sale, once finalized, leads us to constructive dialogue aimed at ensuring that fairness is restored in terms of our relationship with the mine and its owner and guaranteeing that further development only proceeds responsibly and with appropriate environmental safeguards.\"</p><p>The Casa Berardi mine is located entirely on Abitibiwinni's traditional lands, lands over which it has existing Aboriginal and Treaty rights. The mine is currently subject to an Impacts and Benefits Agreement (IBA) between Abitibiwinni and Hecla, but because of Hecla's refusal to allow the agreement to factor in the sharp rise in gold prices, the very foundation of the partnership between Hecla and the First Nation has been undermined.</p><p>In its letter, Abitibiwinni also raised concerns about the impact of mining activities in the region on woodland caribou. Given the species' cultural significance and ongoing decline, Abitibiwinni is moving to establish a network of protected areas in the region surrounding the Casa Berardi mine to protect the Detour-Kesagami caribou herd. Abitibiwinni expects both compagnies to support this initiative and insists that no further exploration or the possible expansion of the project can occur without its free and informed consent.</p><p>Abitibiwinni is therefore asking that Hecla and Orezone engage promptly in good-faith discussions to work toward a respectful and constructive path forward.</p><p>SOURCE Abitibiwinni First Nation Council</p></div></article>",

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 26, 2026) - <b>Masivo Silver Corp. (TSXV: MASS) (OTC Pink: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/GNYPF/\" title=\"View GNYPF stock overview\">GNYPF</a>) (FSE: R74) (</b>\"<b>Masivo\" or the </b>\"<b>Company\")</b> is pleased to announce that the Company's Phase I diamond drill program has begun at its Cerro Colorado Project in Sonora, Mexico.</p><p>The initial phase of the program consists of approximately eight (8) diamond drill holes totaling an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 meters. The program is designed to systematically test high-priority silver-copper targets identified through geological mapping, surface sampling, and historical data compilation.</p><p>David G. Coburn, CEO and Director, commented:</p><p>\"The start of drilling at Cerro Colorado is a pivotal moment for Masivo. We are now systematically testing what we have evidence at surface of being at least 1.2 km structurally controlled, expanding silver-copper system with clear evidence of scale at surface. These first holes are designed to validate our geological model and demonstrate continuity at depth. We believe this program has the potential to materially expand the footprint of mineralization and unlock significant value for shareholders.\" </p><p><b>Hole A</b> targets a depth of 130 meters, with the objective of hitting a zone of polymetallic sulfides that may correspond to an anomaly of high chargeability found in the geophysics program or induced polarization (\"IP\") at a depth of 100 meters below surface. There is strong potential for significantly higher values of silver (Ag), gold (Au), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn).</p><p><b>Hole B </b>is planned approximately 500 meters northeast of Hole A, targeting a depth of 150 meters. The objective is to test a high chargeability anomaly and follow up on high-grade values identified in sulfide material from the dumps of historic mine workings, which returned assays of 1,840 g/t silver (Ag), 4.82 g/t gold (Au), <percent>3.06%</percent> copper (Cu), <percent>4.55%</percent> lead (Pb), and <percent>2.92%</percent> zinc (Zn).</p><p><b>Holes C, D &amp; E</b> are planned between Holes A and B, with the objective of testing the high chargeability anomaly within the same mineralized structure. Hole C and E are designed to reach a target depth of 150 meters, while hole D is planned to extend deeper to 200 meters.</p><p><b>Holes F &amp; G</b> are planned to reach depths of 150 to 300 meters northeast of Hole B. Their objective is to test the high chargeability anomaly and assess the continuity of the mineralized structure along a well-defined southwest-to-northeast (SW-NE) trend.</p><p><b>Hole H</b> is oriented in a different direction, targeting a southeast-to-northwest (SE-NW) structural system that is perpendicular to the main southwest-to-northeast (SW-NE) trend.</p><p>This secondary structural system hosts a gold-copper-silver (Au-Cu-Ag) mineralization style, observed in several near-surface historic artisanal workings developed by local \"Gambusinos.\" These small-scale mines have returned high-grade values, including over 20 g/t gold (Au), 95 g/t silver (Ag), and <percent>0.8%</percent> copper (Cu). The planned depth for these holes is 120 meters.</p><p>The Cerro Colorado Project hosts numerous historic workings and surface exposures of silver-copper mineralization. Previous surface sampling has returned encouraging silver and copper values associated with quartz veining, breccia zones, and structurally controlled shear zones. The current drill program represents the first systematic test of several priority targets at depth and is intended to confirm continuity of mineralization below surface exposures.</p><p><b>Historic Drill Results (2015)</b></p><p>Historic drilling completed by Minera Gold Zone in 2015 on the southwestern margin of the Cerro Colorado system returned broad, near-surface, polymetallic silver and base-metal mineralization, including the following intercepts:</p><ul><li><b>ETCC-15-01:</b> 29.65 m @ 50.74 g/t Ag, <percent>0.607%</percent> Zn, <percent>0.131%</percent> Pb, <percent>0.053%</percent> Cu, and 0.062 g/t Au (48.80-78.45 m), including 5.05 m @ 254 g/t Ag and 2.95 m @ 384 g/t Ag.<br/><br/></li><li><b>ETCC-15-04</b>: 35.80 m @ 23.44 g/t Ag and <percent>0.406%</percent> Zn (44.50-80.30 m), including 3.15 m @ 159.06 g/t Ag and 0.60 m @ 577 g/t Ag (with associated base metals and gold).</li></ul><p>These historic intercepts, together with recent mapping and surface sampling, support the current Phase I drill program designed to test the continuity and structural controls of mineralization at depth.</p><p>Please visit the following link for drill program map and information. </p><p><a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/DOy4gCPZEa\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://masivosilver.com/cerro-colorado</a></p><p>The Company will provide updates as the program progresses.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Brian Brewer, PGeo, is Masivo Silver's qualified person for the company's projects in Mexico and Nevada and has approved this news release.</p><div id=\"contactInfo\"><p>About Masivo Silver Corp.</p><p>Masivo is a Canadian junior silver and gold mining exploration company based in Vancouver, Canada.

Drilling in the West Zone intersected broad levels of gold mineralization in multiple holes, with long intervals of gold mineralization encountered in two of the six holes completed during the program, complementing the spring 2023 discovery hole of 48.5m of 0.85 g/t Au starting at 316.5m (see News Release dated 2023-Jun-06).</p><p><b>Highlights:</b></p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li>IMGW-25-06 returned 0.424 g/t gold over 278.35 metres from 45.1 to 323.45 metres, which included several sub-intervals, including:<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\"><li><b>1.019 g/t gold over 7.4 metres</b> from 118.75 to 126.15 metres</li><li><b>0.566 g/t over 80 metres</b> from 154 to 234 metres</li><li><b>0.610 g/t gold over 62.45</b> <b>metres</b> from 261 to 323.45 metres, including<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\"><li><b>1.239 g/t gold over 16.65 metres</b> from 289.35 to 306 metres</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>IMGW-25-01 returned <b>0.419 g/t gold over 65.75</b> <b>metres </b>from 276.7 to 342.45 metres, including<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\"><li><b>0.868 g/t gold over 8 metres</b> from 296.5 to 304 metres</li><li><b>0.786 g/t gold over 5.8 metres</b> from 315.95 to 321.75 metres</li></ul></li><li>IMGW-25-03 returned <b>1.116 g/t gold over 6.2 metres</b> from 342.75 to 348.95 metres</li><li>McFarlane Lake Mining Limited, contiguous to the northwest has identifed a parallel zone to it's Juby Zone within the regional Ridout-Tyrrell Deformation Zone, the 826 Zone, which appears to trend into the West Zone.</li></ul><p>\"These results continue to expand the gold system at Gowganda West and demonstrate both broad mineralization and higher-grade internal intervals,\" stated Saf Dhillon, President &amp; CEO of iMetal. \"The scale of the mineralized envelope, combined with its proximity to the Juby Deposit and the emerging 826 Zone, reinforces the structural significance of this corridor. We look forward to incorporating these results into our ongoing geological model and planning the next phase of drilling!\" commented iMetal President &amp; CEO Saf Dhillon. </p><p>The drilling intersected the targeted host rocks that exhibited alteration patterns and mineralization similar to that which was intersected in the 2023 drill program. The dominant rock type intersected is a matrix supported greenish polymictic conglomerate composed of heterogenous centimetric to pluricentimetric round clasts with different colors. A percentage of the red clasts are magnetic but the matrix is not. Zones of moderate to pervasive hematization /potassic alteration, sericitization and silicification were noted in the drill holes. Mineralization included disseminated and clast-replacement controlled pyrite, while a few holes also intersected local chalcopyrite vein fractures or plurimillimetric clusters. Alteration intensity appears to be a control on elevated gold values. Pyrite content also shows a relationship with elevated gold values and intensity of alteration.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/7946/285465_table1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

Successive drill programs advancing to the southwest continued to intersect increasing alteration and gold values in suspected NW trending zones and lead directly to the IMGW23-04 discovery hole. The 48.5m gold interval is characterized by a coarse-grained to boulder-sized conglomerate, with moderate to pervasive silica alteration associated with a large intermediate-mafic dyke. Ther 2022 and 2023 drill programs appear to suggest a strong correlation between the intensity of the silica alteration and increased gold grades.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/7946/285465_6b2a3af7241a6a98_002full.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

With a portfolio that includes reusable, industry-leading templates, clause libraries, KPI and SLA catalogs, real-time market benchmarks and a staged process that spans strategy, transition and ongoing governance, the ISG revenue cycle management framework can help healthcare providers reduce rework and staffing costs, ensure compliance and improve financial stability.</p><p>It also leverages AI-based platforms and services to manage administrative tasks and increase efficiency, which can save healthcare organizations nearly 50 percent of their operations costs and drive millions of dollars in increased net patient revenue. In recent client engagements, the ISG revenue cycle management framework saved a children’s healthcare system <money><money>$15 million</money></money> over a five-year IT services contract and delivered a Midwest hospital network 50 percent savings and <money><money>$45 million</money></money> in annual revenue uplift.</p><p>“U.S. healthcare providers are entering a period of intensified financial and operational pressure, making revenue cycle performance a must-have,” Burke said. “Properly structured, negotiated and governed revenue cycle transformation agreements have been proven to build structurally lower-cost enterprises that can fund transformation through self-generated savings.”</p><p>ISG is the world’s leading sourcing advisor and the industry pioneer.

ISAC is an innovative technology that enables use cases across commercial, public safety and defense scenarios, enabling faster adoption of new emerging technologies like autonomous systems and drone delivery in commercial settings. From a defense scenario, it augments national security and provides an additional layer of safety.</p><p>ISAC integrates sensing and spatial location of passive (not connected) objects into the mobile communication network - extending network functionality beyond connectivity by enabling the detection and characterization of objects and movement using existing infrastructure. The capability is progressing in 3GPP with initial studies in Release 19 and is expected to form part of early 6G standardization, showing the foundation for broad, scalable sensing applications.</p><p>\"ISAC represents a transformative leap forward, merging advanced communications and sensing capabilities into a unified platform,\" said Dr. Tom Rondeau, Principal Director for the DoW's FutureG Office. \"By using communication signals to sense the physical world in real-time, ISAC gives wireless networks a new dimension of environmental awareness, enabling groundbreaking applications that advance both <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> national security and commercial interests, and solidifying America's leadership in the race to 6G.\"</p><p>\"Today, we showed how ISAC can unlock a new class of applications - from safer skies to smarter cities - by introducing a powerful new sensing platform as an added layer to the existing telecom network,\" said Yossi Cohen, President and CEO of Ericsson Americas. \"By transforming deployed radio sites and spectrum to support both communications and sensing, we give networks the ability to truly perceive their surroundings. We can introduce these capabilities efficiently and responsibly, accelerating time to value for operators and their customers. As a trusted supplier and long-term partner worldwide, Ericsson brings the scale, reliability, and security to help service providers realize these benefits from day one.\"</p><p>During this proof of concept, Ericsson engineers showcased how network-based sensing supports use cases such as drone detection and airspace safety. We continue to explore how sensing can be used for automotive and transportation assistance; industrial automation and worker protection - use cases that benefit from the network's wide-area perspective and ability to \"see around corners.\"</p><p>Why it matters:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>Safer, smarter infrastructure: Network-based sensing can support use cases by augmenting local sensors with wide-area network awareness.</li><li>Efficient path to scale: ISAC is designed to reuse existing mobile network sites, spectrum, and hardware, enabling pragmatic introduction and coverage at scale.</li><li>Road to 6G: 3GPP studies have begun, with ISAC poised to become a foundational capability in the 6G era.</li></ul><p>The proof of concept underscores Ericsson's commitment to advancing 6G-era capabilities and collaborating with the broader ecosystem to validate real-world scenarios and deployment approaches across sites, spectrum, and hardware integration levels.</p><p><b>Ericsson in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location></b></p><p>Ericsson has operated in the US for more than 120 years and continues to expand its footprint across research, manufacturing, and operations.
