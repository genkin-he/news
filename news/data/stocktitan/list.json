(Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/XTIA/\" title=\"View XTIA stock overview\">XTIA</a>) (\"XTI\" or the \"Company\"), an aerospace technology company focused on building and scaling its Drone Nerds, LLC (\"Drone Nerds\") subsidiary, a drone platform serving enterprise and government customers, today announced the addition of the Antigravity A1, an all-in-one 8K 360 drone designed for immersive flight, to its product lineup.</p><div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1\"><p><a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2921188/XTIA_DroneNerds_Antigravity.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Antigravity A1 drone in flight, designed for 360-degree scene capture.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2921188/XTIA_DroneNerds_Antigravity.jpg\" title=\"Antigravity A1 drone in flight, designed for 360-degree scene capture.\"/></a></p></div><p>Antigravity A1 represents a new approach to creator drones. As a 360-degree aerial platform, the A1 captures its entire surroundings in high-resolution 8K video. Its dual-lens system, mounted above and below the fuselage, removes the drone from the final footage, enabling creators to capture every angle in a single flight, allowing users to revisit and reframe footage during post-production. This feature can help reduce the need for additional flights, potentially conserving time and battery resources. When paired with Vision Goggles, users can view the footage in an immersive 360-degree environment, freely looking in any direction. With the A1, users move beyond traditional piloting to experience a more dynamic perspective of flight.</p><p>\"Our customers are continually looking for tools that improve efficiency while expanding what's possible from the air,\" said Jeremy Schneiderman, CEO of Drone Nerds. \"The Antigravity A1 addresses both needs by enabling full-scene capture in a single flight and giving creators greater control in post-production. This addition strengthens our product portfolio with a differentiated solution designed for immersive content creation.\"</p><p>\"Partnering with Drone Nerds enables us to bring Antigravity A1 to a broader community of professional creators,\" said Michael Shabun, CEO of Antigravity. \"The A1 represents a new approach to aerial storytelling, designed to give creators greater creative control and flexibility while simplifying the capture process. For hobbyists, it offers a new way to experience the world from an aerial perspective, reflecting the sense of exploration and flight that has inspired generations.\"</p><p><b>Immersive 8K 360 Capture and Intuitive Flight Experience <br/></b>The Antigravity A1 is an all-in-one aerial imaging platform designed to support immersive content creation.

(ii) media rights fees and (iii) sponsorship fees. For the year ended December 31, 2025, these revenue streams comprised <percent>26.7%</percent>, <percent>31.3%</percent> and <percent>21.7%</percent>, respectively, of total F1 revenue. Other revenue, which includes hospitality, freight and licensing, comprised <percent>20.3%</percent> of total F1 revenue.</p><p>There were 24 and 7 races held in the full year and fourth quarter of 2025, respectively, compared to 24 and 6 races held in the full year and fourth quarter of 2024, respectively. In the fourth quarter of both 2025 and 2024, F1 directly promoted the Las Vegas Grand Prix and recognized the revenue (ticketing, sponsorship, hospitality) and costs related to the event.</p><p>Primary F1 revenue grew for the full year with increases across all primary revenue streams. Sponsorship revenue grew due to recognition of revenue from new sponsors, contractual increases from existing sponsors and growth in digital advertising revenue. Media rights revenue increased due to contractual increases in fees, the continued growth in F1 TV subscription revenue and recognition of one-time revenue associated with the F1 movie. Race promotion revenue grew primarily due to contractual increases in fees.</p><p>Primary F1 revenue increased in the fourth quarter primarily driven by one additional race and the higher proportionate recognition of season-based income (7/24 races took place in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to 6/24 in the fourth quarter of 2024) and underlying contractual increases across all primary revenue streams. Additionally, sponsorship revenue grew driven by revenue from new sponsors. Media rights revenue increased due to continued growth in F1 TV.</p><p>Other F1 revenue increased in the full year driven by growth in hospitality revenue, licensing income, freight income and revenue generated from new activities at the Grand Prix Plaza in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nv.lasveg\">Las Vegas</location>. Other F1 revenue increased in the fourth quarter due to higher hospitality revenue, including growth associated with the Las Vegas Grand Prix.</p><p>Operating income and Adjusted OIBDA<sup>(2)</sup> grew for the full year as revenue growth outpaced an increase in team payments, other cost of motorsport revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses. Team payments increased for the full year driven by the growth in F1 profitability and the associated impact on the calculation of the team payments. Team payments as a percent of pre-team payment Adjusted OIBDA decreased from <percent>61.5%</percent> in 2024 to <percent>59.7%</percent> in 2025. Other cost of F1 revenue is largely variable in nature and is mostly derived from servicing both Primary and Other F1 revenue opportunities. These costs increased in the full year primarily due to higher commissions and partner servicing costs associated with servicing Primary F1 revenue streams, increased hospitality and freight costs, increased costs related to servicing the Grand Prix Plaza and higher travel and race promotion costs to support the servicing of new sponsors. Selling, general and administrative expense increased for the full year driven by higher personnel and marketing costs, including costs related to the 75<sup>th</sup> O2 event in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\">London</location>.</p><p>Operating income and Adjusted OIBDA increased in the fourth quarter primarily due to the increase in revenue from one additional race held, offsetting an increase in team payments, other cost of motorsport revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses. Team payments increased due to the higher pro rata recognition of payments across the race season and an increase in team payment costs based on full year results. Other cost of F1 motorsport revenue increased in the fourth quarter primarily due to higher commissions and partner servicing costs and increased travel expenses. Selling, general and administrative expense increased in the fourth quarter primarily due to higher personnel costs.</p><p><span class=\"bwuline\">MotoGP Operating Results</span></p><p>“MotoGP finished 2025 with record attendance and fan engagement and we are confident in our sport’s potential for expansion in existing and new geographies,” said Carmelo Ezpeleta, MotoGP CEO. “We continue investing in our commercial and marketing functions while working to elevate the race experience and diversify our race calendar.

are subject to translational impacts from foreign exchange fluctuations. For constant currency comparison, MotoGP calculates the effects of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the prior period’s currency exchange rates. The table of results above includes both US dollar and constant currency<sup>(4)</sup> growth rates for revenue, Adjusted OIBDA and Operating income (loss).</p><p>Primary MotoGP revenue represents the majority of MotoGP’s revenue and is derived from (i) media rights fees, (ii) race promotion fees and (iii) sponsorship fees. For the year ended December 31, 2025, these revenue streams comprised <percent>41.2%</percent>, <percent>33.7%</percent> and <percent>12.7%</percent>, respectively, of total MotoGP revenue. Other revenue, which includes revenue from ancillary motorcycle racing championships, hospitality and licensing, comprised <percent>12.4%</percent> of total MotoGP revenue.</p><p>There were five races held in the fourth quarter of both 2025 and 2024. There were 22 races held in 2025 and 20 races held in 2024. The 2025 calendar has a different order, mix and number of events compared to the prior year, which impacted season-based revenue recognition as well as year-over-year revenue and cost comparisons.</p><p>Primary MotoGP revenue increased for the full year with increases across all primary revenue streams. Race promotion revenue increased primarily due to two more races held in 2025 and the effect of contractual rate increases. Media rights revenue increased primarily due to contractual increases in fees and growth in VideoPass subscription revenue. Sponsorship revenue increased primarily due to contractual increases. All primary revenue streams benefitted from the impact of favorable currency exchange rates.</p><p>Primary MotoGP revenue increased in the three months ended December 31, 2025 primarily due to an increase in race promotion revenue and the impact of favorable currency exchange rates partially offset by a reduction in media rights and sponsorship revenue. Race promotion revenue increased primarily due to race mix. The decline in media rights revenue was primarily driven by the lower proportionate recognition of season-based income (5 out of 22 races took place in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to 5 out of 20 races in the fourth quarter of 2024). Sponsorship revenue declined primarily due to race-related sponsorship and lower proportionate recognition of season-based income.</p><p>Other MotoGP revenue represents revenue generated from other motorcycle racing championships including the FIM World Superbike Championship (“WorldSBK”), hospitality and licensing revenue. Other MotoGP revenue increased for the full year, primarily driven by hospitality revenue from two additional MotoGP races held and increased attendance and the impact of favorable exchange rates, partially offset by a decrease in contractual fees related to the MotoE Championship (“MotoE”). For the three months ended December 31, 2025, Other MotoGP revenue decreased primarily due to the decline in fees related to WorldSBK, primarily attributable to a one-time termination penalty received in 2024, partially offset by an increase in hospitality revenue and the impact of favorable currency exchange rates.</p><p>Operating income and Adjusted OIBDA increased for the full year. Cost of MotoGP motorsport revenue grew for the year, primarily driven by two additional MotoGP races held as well as a higher mix of overseas races held in 2025, resulting in higher International Road-Racing Teams Association (“IRTA”), freight, hospitality and production costs in addition to unfavorable currency exchange rates. Selling, general and administrative expenses declined slightly for the year, primarily driven by reduced bad debt expense, partially offset by higher marketing and personnel costs and unfavorable currency exchange rates.</p><p>Operating income and Adjusted OIBDA increased during the fourth quarter primarily driven by an increase in motorsport revenue from higher race promotion revenue and a decline in selling, general and administrative expense from reduced bad debt expense. This was partially offset by an increase in cost of MotoGP motorsport revenue primarily driven by a one-time termination penalty related to the cancellation of MotoE and an increase in IRTA costs as well as the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates, partially offset by a decrease in freight costs attributable to a lower mix of overseas races held in the fourth quarter of 2025.</p><p><span class=\"bwuline\">Corporate and Other Operating Results</span></p><p>Corporate and Other revenue grew in the full year and fourth quarter due to the increase in Quint revenue as well as <money><money>$33 million</money></money> and <money><money>$14 million</money></money> of rental income related to the Grand Prix Plaza recognized in the full year and fourth quarter, respectively.

MEASURES</b></p><p>SCHEDULE 1</p><p>To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, this press release includes a presentation of Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, together with reconciliations to operating income, as determined under GAAP. Liberty Media defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, Concorde incentive payments and restructuring, acquisition and impairment charges.</p><p>Liberty Media believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business’ performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Because Adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance, Liberty Media views operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP measure, but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information that Liberty Media's management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of its assets.</p><p>The following table provides a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA for Liberty Media to operating income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP for the three months and years ended December 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.</p><table cellspacing=\"0\"

Excluding the impact of Nissens Automotive, sales for the quarter and year were up <percent>4.3%</percent> and <percent>4.0%</percent>, respectively. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were up <percent>19.1%</percent> for the quarter and <percent>26.8%</percent> for the year.\"</p><p><b>Fourth Quarter Highlights:<br/></b><b>North American Aftermarket</b></p><ul type=\"disc\"><li><b>Vehicle Control </b>sales increased <percent>3.3%</percent> in the fourth quarter, with full-year performance of <percent>3.0%</percent> growth. The solid results in the quarter were due to a combination of factors including favorable customer order patterns, general strength across our non-discretionary categories, and the on-going benefit from our customers' footprint expansion activities. Customer POS remained healthy in the quarter, continuing a trend we have seen throughout the year.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Temperature Control</b> sales increased an impressive <percent>5.9%</percent> in the quarter versus a challenging compare of <percent>30%</percent> in last year's fourth quarter and finished the year up <percent>12.2%</percent>. This has been another very strong year for the segment, as the season for this business appears to be starting earlier and lasting longer. In addition to weather patterns that drive demand, we believe our strong brand recognition among professional installers has helped increase our customers' share of the market.<br/><br/></li><li>Both North American aftermarket segments experienced a modest sales lift from tariff passthroughs implemented in the second half of the year, tempered by some compression of gross margins from passing through tariffs at cost.</li></ul><p><b>Nissens<br/></b>Nissens delivered another solid quarterly performance with sales of <money><money>$64.1 million</money></money>. For 2025, Nissens contributed <money><money>$305.4 million</money></money> in sales with an adjusted EBITDA margin of <percent>15.9%</percent>.  Nissens continues to gain share in its markets driven by strong brand awareness and operational excellence, and we expect this outperformance to continue.  In November, we completed our first full year of ownership, and heading into 2026 we expect to begin to realize some of the benefits from synergy and integration efforts, including a modest uplift from recently launched new product categories and expanding growth synergies through cross-selling opportunities.      </p><p><b>Engineered Solutions<br/></b>Engineered Solutions sales saw some rebound in the quarter with <percent>6.3%</percent> growth over last year's quarter, primarily driven by timing of orders in our powersports-related categories. For the full year, the segment posted a <percent>3.8%</percent> decline in sales as it was impacted by cyclical softness across global end markets, but we were pleased to see sequential recovery in the second half of the year. We also made the decision to wind down certain customer programs in the quarter, for which we incurred some one-time costs. We believe the segment has seen demand stabilize and should experience more stable quarterly performance moving into 2026.</p><p><b>Profitability &amp; Balance Sheet<br/></b>Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased to <money><money>$37.4 million</money></money>, an improvement of 130 bps to <percent>9.7%</percent> of net sales.  On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA increased to <money><money>$200.9 million</money></money>, showing an improvement of 160 bps to <percent>11.2%</percent> of net sales, exceeding our guidance of <percent>10.5%</percent> - <percent>11%</percent>.  The increases were driven by strong performance in our North American and Nissens aftermarket businesses. Nissens contributed <money><money>$6.5 million</money></money> and <money><money>$48.5 million</money></money> of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively.        </p><p>From a balance sheet perspective, our cash flows and borrowings were in line with expectations. Total net debt at quarter-end stood at <money><money>$546.7 million</money></money>, primarily reflecting additional borrowings related to our Nissens acquisition and seasonal working capital build. Our debt leverage stood at 2.7x at the end of the quarter and we continue to target reducing debt levels to 2.0x adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2026.              </p><p><b>2026 Guidance<br/></b>Our outlook for the full year of 2026 includes an expectation that sales growth will be in the low to mid-single digit range driven by ongoing tailwinds for professional grade non-discretionary products in the North American aftermarket, continuing momentum in our European business, and while always the most volatile, a more stable performance in Engineered Solutions. Further, we expect Adjusted EBITDA will be in a range of <percent>11.0%</percent>-<percent>12.0%</percent> that should be aided by initiatives we have underway to drive ongoing profitability gains.  As we lap the implementation of tariff-related pricing, we expect a slight increase in sales from higher pricing, but some continued margin compression from pass-through at our cost.  </p><p>This guidance is based on tariffs in place before the recent Supreme Court ruling on IEEPA tariffs and the announcement of new Section 122 tariffs, and any impact thereof.  We will continue to monitor the shifting tariff landscape, and plan to implement changes as necessary.</p><p><b>Dividends<br/></b>The Board of Directors has approved an increase in its quarterly common stock dividend from <money>thirty-one cents</money> per share to <money>thirty-three cents</money> per share, payable on March 2, 2026, to shareholders of record on February 16, 2026. </p><p><b>Closing Remarks<br/></b>In closing, Mr. Sills commented, \"Our North American and Nissens aftermarket businesses led the way in this year's strong performance. The global aftermarket continues to be resilient and demand for our products remains strong, driven by the quality, brand recognition and high levels of customer service we provide. We are optimistic heading into 2026 and think we are well positioned to capitalize on favorable trends to drive growth and increased shareholder value. I would like to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment to our continued success.\"        </p><p><b><i>Conference Call<br/></i></b>Standard Motor Products, Inc. will hold a conference call at 11:00 AM, Eastern Time, on Thursday, February 26, 2026.  This call will be webcast and can be accessed on our website at <a href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4627918-1&amp;h=1782732098&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smpcorp.com%2F&amp;a=www.smpcorp.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.smpcorp.com</a> and clicking on the <a href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4627918-1&amp;h=362346893&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fjoin.eventcastplus.com%2Feventcastplus%2Fstandard-motor-products-4th-quarter-2025-earnings-call&amp;a=SMP+Q4%2725+Earnings+Call\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SMP Q4'25 Earnings Call</a> Webcast link.

(NASDAQ: <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mSeZoQ_cufkP4DI7zTgXRx7C0KjHxTMEVM8XHwRhaB8rdiEO-TM9SF97PVAWYsro9UHP9vh04tSDw1ofkcFgcda0iRk0Ne3fHw4SPV8hzCWf2sdT7G34cnzdPgT28qJ_\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SCYX</a>), a biotechnology company pioneering innovative medicines to overcome and prevent difficult-to-treat and drug-resistant infections, today announced that the first participants have been dosed in a Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) trial evaluating the intravenous formulation (IV) of its second-generation triterpenoid antifungal therapy, SCY-247, which is being developed as a treatment for invasive candidiasis (IC) and as a prophylaxis therapy for invasive fungal disease. Results from this trial are expected in 2026.</p> <p align=\"justify\">“Following the FDA’s recent decision to grant SCY-247 both Qualified Infections Disease Product and Fast Track designations, we are pleased to announce the dosing of the first cohort of participants in our Phase 1 SAD/MAD trial of IV SCY-247,” said David Angulo, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of SCYNEXIS. “An IV formulation of SCY-247 would provide additional flexibility for the optimal management of patients with invasive candidiasis and we are excited by the achievement of this important development milestone, which moves this innovative antifungal closer towards meeting the needs of patients suffering from difficult to treat severe fungal diseases.\"</p> <p align=\"justify\">In September 2025, the Company announced positive SAD/MAD data for the oral formulation of SCY-247, demonstrating its excellent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Oral SCY-247 also achieved target exposures for invasive fungal disease at doses lower than first generation fungerps, which may confer distinct tolerability advantages. Based on its differentiated attributes and its potential role to counter health security threats posed by the continuous rise of antifungal resistance, SCYNEXIS continues to explore potential non-dilutive funding opportunities to further support the SCY-247 program.</p> <p align=\"justify\">On January 21, 2026, the Company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted SCY-247 both Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) and Fast Track designations.</p> <p><strong>About SCYNEXIS</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">SCYNEXIS, Inc. (NASDAQ: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/SCYX/\" title=\"View SCYX stock overview\">SCYX</a>) is a biotechnology company pioneering innovative medicines to help millions of patients worldwide overcome and prevent difficult-to-treat infections that are becoming increasingly drug-resistant. SCYNEXIS is developing the company’s proprietary antifungal platform “fungerps.” Ibrexafungerp, the first representative of this novel class, has been licensed to GSK. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved BREXAFEMME<sup>®</sup> (ibrexafungerp tablets) for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and for reduction in the incidence of recurrent VVC. The second generation fungerp SCY-247 is currently in clinical stages of development and has received QIDP and Fast Track designation from the FDA. Additional antifungal assets from this novel class are currently in pre-clinical and discovery phases.

Forward-looking statements can often be identified by words such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"should\" and similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the Company's business, strategy and industry in general, first quarter 2026 guidance, including net income, net income attributable to common stockholders, EAD, CAD, EAD and CAD per diluted common share and related coverage ratios and related assumptions and estimates, the Company's intent to not settle Series B or Series C Preferred redemptions in shares of common stock when the Company's common stock price is below book value and the Company's approach to capital allocation that reflects delivering durable, risk-adjusted returns to shareholders and expansion into sectors underpinned by strong demographic and structural demand trends and the Company's continued focus on positioning to capitalize on market dislocations, grow book value and provide investors with a clear and consistent view of the Company's earnings trajectory and long-term value creation strategy. They are not guarantees of future results and forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement, including those described in greater detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), particularly those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

A \"non-GAAP financial measure\" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the Company. The non-GAAP financial measures used within this press release are EAD, CAD, EAD and CAD per diluted common share and adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted.</p><p>EAD is defined as net income (loss) attributable to our common stockholders computed in accordance with GAAP, including realized gains and losses not otherwise included in net income (loss), excluding any unrealized gains or losses or other similar non-cash items that are included in net income (loss) for the applicable reporting period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income (loss), or in net income (loss) and adding back amortization of stock-based compensation. The Company also adjusts EAD to remove the income/(losses) from equity method investments as they represent changes in the equity value of our investment rather than distributable earnings. The Company will include income from equity method investments to the extent that we receive cash distributions and upon realizing gains and/or losses. Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders may also be adjusted for the effects of certain GAAP adjustments and transactions that may not be indicative of our current operations. In addition, EAD in this press release includes the dilutive effect of non-controlling interests. We use EAD to evaluate our performance and to assess our long-term ability to pay distributions. We believe providing EAD as a supplement to GAAP net income (loss) to our investors is helpful to their assessment of our performance and our long-term ability to pay distributions. We also use EAD as a component of the management fee paid to our external manager. EAD does not represent net income or cash flows from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income, an indication of our GAAP cash flows from operating activities, a measure of our liquidity or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. Our computation of EAD may not be comparable to EAD reported by other REITs.</p><p>We calculate CAD by adjusting EAD by adding back amortization of premiums, depreciation and amortization of real estate investment and amortization of deferred financing costs and by removing accretion of discounts. We use CAD to evaluate our performance and our current ability to pay distributions. We also believe that providing CAD as a supplement to GAAP net income (loss) to our investors is helpful to their assessment of our performance and our current ability to pay distributions. CAD does not represent net income or cash flows from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income, an indication of our GAAP cash flows from operating activities, a measure of our liquidity or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. Our computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other REITs.</p><p>EAD per diluted common share and CAD per diluted common share are based on adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding – diluted. Adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted is calculating by subtracting the dilutive effect of potential redemptions of Series B and Series C Preferred shares for shares of our common stock from weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted. We believe providing adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted to our investors is helpful in their assessment of our performance without the potential dilutive effective of the Series B or Series C Preferred shares. We have the right to redeem the Series B and Series C Preferred shares for cash or shares of our common stock. Additionally, Series B and Series C Preferred redemptions are capped at <percent>2%</percent> of the outstanding Series B or Series C Preferred shares per month, <percent>5%</percent> per quarter and <percent>20%</percent> per year, respectively. The Company maintains sufficient liquidity to pay cash to cover any redemptions up to the quarterly redemption cap. Further, it is the Company's intent to not settle Series B or Series C Preferred redemptions in shares of common stock when the Company's common stock price is below book value.</p><p>Adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding – diluted should not be considered as an alternative to the GAAP measure. Our computation of adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding – diluted may not be comparable to adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted reported by other companies. </p><p><b>Contact:  <br/></b>Kristen Griffith<br/>Investor Relations<br/><u><a href=\"mailto:IR@nexpoint.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">IR@nexpoint.com</a><br/></u></p><p>Media: <a href=\"mailto:Comms@nexpoint.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Comms@nexpoint.com</a></p><p> </p><p>SOURCE NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc.</p></div></article>",

We achieved a <money><money>$2 billion</money></money> improvement in profitability in our first full year under the Back-to-Basics strategy, driven by meaningful gains in revenue, utilization, unit economics, and customer experience.”</i></p><p><i>\"With a healthier fleet and improving residual performance, we are building from a position of strength and have begun to expand retail and mobility capabilities bolstering the Hertz platform. Spanning Rent-A-Car, Service, Fleet, and Mobility, we believe these businesses will generate value well beyond traditional rental, and ultimately redefine the role Hertz plays in the future of mobility.”</i></p><p> <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.estero\">ESTERO, Fla.</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/HTZ/\" title=\"View HTZ stock overview\">HTZ</a>) (\"Hertz,\" \"Hertz Global,\" or the \"Company\") today reported results for its fourth quarter and full year 2025.</p><p><b>Q4 AND FULL YEAR 2025 HIGHLIGHTS</b></p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Revenue totaled <money><money>$2.0 billion</money></money> in the fourth quarter and <money><money>$8.5 billion</money></money> for full-year 2025, reflecting sequential improvement in pricing and resulting in Hertz's strongest year-over-year revenue performance since Q1 2024.</li></ul><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Year-over-year Revenue per Unit (RPU) and Revenue Per Day (RPD) metrics improved sequentially through 2025. This momentum has continued into Q1 2026 as the Company expects to deliver mid-single digit revenue growth, driven by continued progress on internal revenue management initiatives and a positive industry pricing environment.</li></ul><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Profitability improved more than <money><money>$2 billion</money></money> year over year, with net loss totaling <money><money>$194 million</money></money> in Q4 and <money><money>$747 million</money></money> for the full year; Diluted EPS showed a significant year-over-year improvement, landing at <money><money>$(0.72)</money></money> for the quarter and <money><money>$(2.43)</money></money> for 2025.</li></ul><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Adjusted Corporate EBITDA for Q4 was <money><money>$(205) million</money></money>, an improvement of approximately <money><money>$150 million</money></money> year-over-year. This includes more than a <money><money>$100 million</money></money> impact from several transitory headwinds. Full year Adjusted Corporate EBITDA was <money><money>$(339) million</money></money>, an improvement of more than <money><money>$1 billion</money></money> year over year as revenue optimization, utilization gains, and cost controls took hold.</li></ul><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Utilization was <percent>78%</percent> in the fourth quarter and averaged <percent>81%</percent> for the full year, a year-over-year improvement of 200 basis points, driving improved RPU.</li></ul><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Depreciation per Unit per Month (DPU) was <money><money>$330</money></money> in Q4 and <money><money>$300</money></money> for the full year, representing a year-over-year improvement of <percent>44%</percent>, supported by disciplined fleet rotation. Depreciation was weighed down by an approximately <money><money>$60 million</money></money> non-cash charge driven by a revised third party forecast of residual values.</li></ul><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Q4 adjusted Direct Operating Expense (DOE) per transaction day improved by <percent>6%</percent> year over year through rigorous cost control and operational discipline. DOE declined <percent>3%</percent> year over year in the fourth quarter and <percent>4%</percent> for the full year while Transaction Days declined <percent>1%</percent> and <percent>3%</percent> respectively.</li></ul><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Customer experience continued to improve in 2025, with Net Promoter Score increasing nearly <percent>50%</percent> year-over-year, reflecting measurable gains in rental ease, fleet quality, and service reliability.</li></ul><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Hertz ended the fourth quarter with approximately <money><money>$1.5 billion</money></money> of liquidity and potential access to more than <money><money>$1 billion</money></money> of liquidity enhancements.</li></ul><p><b>Transitory Q4 Headwinds</b></p><p>A number of compounding external events impacted EBITDA in the fourth quarter by more than <money><money>$100 million</money></money>. This included a government shutdown coupled with FAA flight cancellations, multiple technology vendor outages, and a nearly 3 times higher than normal level of vehicles on recall.</p><p>DPU was in line with the Company’s full-year North Star target, but above its quarterly target due to a revised Black Book residual outlook and softer seasonal wholesale pricing amid elevated OEM and rental de-fleeting activity. This resulted in an approximately <money><money>$60 million</money></money> non-cash depreciation charge. Looking ahead, the Company sees a more normalized residual value outlook for 2026.</p><p>Excluding these items, our core EBITDA production was in line with our expectations, reflecting continued progress on our revenue and cost initiatives.</p><p><b>2025 Summary</b></p><p>2025 was a critical year in the Hertz transformation, and underscored that the structural improvements the Company is making are permanent while the headwinds it faces are transitory. The traditional rental car business is improving, guided by its North Star metrics of DPU sub <money><money>$300</money></money>, RPU over <money><money>$1,500</money></money>, and DOE per transaction day in the low <money>$30</money>s.</p><p>Over the course of the year, Hertz completed its fleet rotation and successfully secured model year 2026 buys at its target prices and volumes. This enabled model year 2025 sales through Hertz Car Sales, continuing the Company’s short-hold strategy and introducing a richer, more optimized car-class mix to its fleet. Hertz's average fleet age was less than ten months and the lowest its been in almost a decade.</p><p>Through these actions, Hertz achieved a full year EBITDA improvement of more than <money><money>$1 billion</money></money> year over year. The Company drove sequential improvements in revenue, RPU, and RPD, while also improving utilization and driving DPU down in line with the North Star target. Hertz also brought DOE per transaction day down despite lower volumes and saw a nearly <percent>50%</percent> improvement in customer satisfaction – a result of an intentional effort to improve operations and customer experience.</p><p><b>Q1 2026 Insights</b></p><p>Hertz’s early first quarter performance indicates that its commercial strategy continues to deliver sustained value in 2026. January revenue results show meaningful improvement year over year, with February trending more positively and March continuing that trajectory. The Company expects a mid-single digit increase in revenue for the quarter, supported by a constructive demand environment and increased year-over-year RPD. With respect to the fleet, the Company also sees signs that residual values are improving from Q4’s seasonal lows. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, the Company remains focused on growing the off-airport and mobility business and accelerating revenue growth while staying disciplined on costs.</p><p><b>Platform for Growth</b></p><p>The Company is building on the transformation of the core rental car business by establishing a diversified, value-creating platform for growth. This platform spans four strategic areas – Rent-a-Car, Service, Fleet, and Mobility – each with unique potential to scale. The Company is focused on developing capabilities across its platform, including continuing the digital evolution of Hertz Car Sales in Fleet, exploring growth and franchise opportunities in Rent-a-Car, piloting new offerings in Service, and expanding revenue channels, assets, and capabilities in Mobility.</p><p><b>EARNINGS WEBCAST INFORMATION</b></p><p>Hertz Global's live webcast and conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2025 results will be held on February 26, 2026 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

“GAAP” refers to accounting principles generally accepted in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>. Adjusted EBITDA is the Company's segment measure of profitability and complies with GAAP when used in that context.</p><p><b><i>NON-GAAP MEASURES</i></b></p><p>Non-GAAP measures are not recognized measurements under GAAP. When evaluating the Company's operating performance or liquidity, investors should not consider non-GAAP measures in isolation of, superior to, or as a substitute for measures of the Company's financial performance as determined in accordance with GAAP.</p><p><b><i>Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share (\"Adjusted EPS\")</i></b></p><p>Adjusted Net Income (Loss) represents income or loss attributable to the Company as adjusted to eliminate the impact of GAAP income tax; vehicle and non-vehicle debt-related charges; restructuring and restructuring related charges; acquisition accounting-related depreciation and amortization; unrealized (gains) losses on financial instruments; change in fair value of Public Warrants and certain other miscellaneous or non-recurring items on a pre-tax basis. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) includes a provision (benefit) for income taxes derived utilizing a combined statutory rate. The combined statutory rate is management's estimate of the Company's long-term tax rate. Its most comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss).</p><p>Adjusted EPS represents Adjusted Net Income (Loss) on a per diluted share basis using the weighted-average number of diluted shares outstanding for the period. Its most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings (loss) per share.</p><p>Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS are important operating metrics because they allow management and investors to assess operational performance of the Company's business, exclusive of the items mentioned above that are not operational in nature or comparable to those of the Company's competitors.</p><p><b><i>Adjusted Corporate EBITDA and Adjusted Corporate EBITDA Margin</i></b></p><p>Adjusted Corporate EBITDA represents income or loss attributable to the Company as adjusted to eliminate the impact of GAAP income tax; non-vehicle depreciation and amortization; non-vehicle debt interest, net; vehicle debt-related charges; restructuring and restructuring related charges; unrealized (gains) losses on financial instruments; change in fair value of Public Warrants and certain other miscellaneous or non-recurring items.</p><p>Adjusted Corporate EBITDA Margin is calculated as the ratio of Adjusted Corporate EBITDA to total revenues.</p><p>Management uses these measures as operating performance metrics for internal monitoring and planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company's annual operating budget and monthly operating reviews, and analysis of investment decisions, profitability and performance trends. These measures enable management and investors to isolate the effects on profitability of operating metrics most meaningful to the business of renting and leasing vehicles. They also allow management and investors to assess the performance of the entire business on the same basis as its reportable segments. Adjusted Corporate EBITDA is also utilized in the determination of certain executive compensation. Its most comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss) attributable to the Company.</p><p><b><i>Adjusted operating cash flow and adjusted free cash flow</i></b></p><p>Adjusted operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities net of the non-cash add back for vehicle depreciation and reserves, and exclusive of bankruptcy related payments made post emergence. Adjusted operating cash flow is an important performance measure to management and investors as it provides useful information about the amount of cash generated from operations when fully burdened by fleet costs.</p><p>Adjusted free cash flow represents adjusted operating cash flow plus the impact of net non-vehicle capital expenditures and net fleet growth after financing. Adjusted free cash flow is an important performance measure to management and investors as it provides useful information about the amount of cash available for, but not limited to, the reduction of non-vehicle debt, share repurchase and acquisition.</p><p>The most comparable GAAP measure for adjusted operating cash flow and adjusted free cash flow is net cash provided by (used in) operating activities.</p><p><b><i>Net Fleet Growth After Financing</i></b></p><p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> and International Rental Car segments Fleet Growth is defined as revenue earning vehicles expenditures, net of proceeds from disposals, plus vehicle depreciation and net vehicle financing, which includes borrowings, repayments and the change in restricted cash associated with vehicles. Fleet Growth is important as it allows the Company to assess the cash flow required to support its investment in revenue earning vehicles.</p><p><b><i>Net Non-vehicle Debt</i></b></p><p>Net Non-vehicle Debt is calculated as non-vehicle debt as reported on the Company's balance sheet, excluding the impact of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with non-vehicle debt, less cash and cash equivalents. Non-vehicle debt consists of the Company's Senior Term Loans, Senior RCF, First Lien Senior Notes, Second Lien Exchangeable Notes, Senior Unsecured Notes, Promissory Notes and certain other non-vehicle indebtedness of its domestic and foreign subsidiaries. Net Non-vehicle Debt is important to management and investors as it helps measure the Company's corporate leverage. Net Non-vehicle Debt also assists in the evaluation of the Company's ability to service its non-vehicle debt without reference to the expense associated with the vehicle debt, which is collateralized by assets not available to lenders under the non-vehicle debt facilities.</p><p><b><i>Net Vehicle Debt</i></b></p><p>Net Vehicle Debt is calculated as vehicle debt as reported on the Company's balance sheet, excluding the impact of unamortized debt issue costs associated with vehicle debt, less restricted cash associated with vehicles. Restricted cash associated with vehicle debt is restricted for the purchase of revenue earning vehicles and other specified uses under the Company's vehicle debt facilities. Net Vehicle Debt is important to management, investors and ratings agencies as it helps measure the Company's leverage with respect to its vehicle assets.</p><p><b><i>Total Net Debt</i></b></p><p>Total Net Debt is calculated as total debt, excluding the impact of unamortized debt issuance costs, less total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash associated with vehicle debt. Unamortized debt issuance costs are required to be reported as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt obligation under GAAP. Management believes that eliminating the effects that these costs have on debt will more accurately reflect the Company's net debt position. Total Net Debt is important to management, investors and ratings agencies as it helps measure the Company's gross leverage.</p><p><b><i>Net Corporate Leverage</i></b></p><p>Net Corporate Leverage is calculated as non-vehicle net debt divided by Adjusted Corporate EBITDA for the last twelve months. Net Corporate Leverage is important to management and investors as it measures the Company's corporate leverage net of unrestricted cash. Net Corporate Leverage also assists in the evaluation of the Company's ability to service its non-vehicle debt with reference to the generation of Adjusted Corporate EBITDA.</p><p><b><i>KEY METRICS</i></b></p><p><b><i>Adjusted Direct Operating Expense per Transaction Day (“adjusted DOE per day”)</i></b></p><p>Adjusted DOE per day is calculated as Direct Operating Expenses - as reported, exclusive of the impacts of foreign currency exchange rates and adjustments for certain other miscellaneous or non-recurring items, divided by the number of Transaction Days during the period. Adjusted DOE per day is important to management and investors as it measures the Company’s cost efficiency on a per unit basis excluding the impact of variable direct operating expense fluctuations attributable to changes in volume, so as not to affect the comparability of underlying trends.</p><p><b><i>Available Car Days</i></b></p><p>Available Car Days represents Average Rentable Vehicles multiplied by the number of days in a given period.</p><p><b><i>Average Vehicles (\"Fleet Capacity\" or \"Capacity\")</i></b></p><p>Average Vehicles is determined using a simple average of the number of vehicles in the fleet whether owned or leased by the Company at the beginning and end of a given period.</p><p><b><i>Average Rentable Vehicles</i></b></p><p>Average Rentable Vehicles reflects Average Vehicles excluding vehicles for sale on the Company’s retail lots or actively in the process of being sold through other disposition channels.</p><p><b><i>Depreciation Per Unit Per Month (\"Depreciation Per Unit\" or \"DPU\")</i></b></p><p>Depreciation Per Unit Per Month represents the amount of average depreciation expense and lease charges per vehicle per month, exclusive of the impacts of foreign currency exchange rates so as not to affect the comparability of underlying trends. This metric is important to management and investors as it reflects how effectively the Company is managing the costs of its vehicles and facilitates comparisons with other participants in the vehicle rental industry.</p><p><b><i>Total Revenue Per Transaction Day (\"Total RPD\" or \"RPD\"; also referred to as \"pricing\")</i></b></p><p>Total RPD represents revenue generated per transaction day, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates so as not to affect the comparability of underlying trends. This metric is important to management and investors as it represents a measure of changes in the underlying pricing in the vehicle rental business and encompasses the elements in vehicle rental pricing that management has the ability to control.</p><p><b><i>Total Revenue Per Unit Per Month (\"Total RPU\", \"RPU\" or \"Total RPU Per Month\")</i></b></p><p>Total RPU Per Month represents the amount of revenue generated per vehicle in the rental fleet each month, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates so as not to affect the comparability of underlying trends. This metric is important to management and investors as it provides a measure of revenue productivity relative to the number of vehicles in our rental fleet whether owned or leased, or asset efficiency.</p><p><b><i>Transaction Days (\"Days\"; also referred to as \"volume\")</i></b></p><p>Transaction Days represents the total number of 24-hour periods, with any partial period counted as one Transaction Day, that vehicles were on rent (the period between when a rental contract is opened and closed) in a given period. Thus, it is possible for a vehicle to attain more than one Transaction Day in a 24-hour period. This metric is important to management and investors as it represents the number of revenue-generating days.</p><p><b><i>Vehicle Utilization (\"Utilization\")</i></b></p><p>Vehicle Utilization represents the ratio of Transaction Days to Available Car Days. This metric is important to management and investors as it is the measurement of the proportion of vehicles that are being used to generate revenues relative to rentable fleet capacity.</p><p><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20260226304972r1&amp;sid=acqr8&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en\" style=\"width:0;height:0\"/><span class=\"bwct31415\"></span></p><p id=\"mmgallerylink\"><span id=\"mmgallerylink-phrase\">View source version on businesswire.com: </span><span id=\"mmgallerylink-link\"><a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260226304972/en/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260226304972/en/</a></span></p><p>Hertz Investor Relations:<br/><a href=\"mailto:investorrelations@hertz.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">investorrelations@hertz.com</a></p><p>Hertz Media Relations:<br/><a href=\"mailto:mediarelations@hertz.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">mediarelations@hertz.com</a></p><p>Source: Hertz Global Holdings, Inc.</p></article>",

In addition, non-cash forgivable loan amortization, which is reflected as an expense when presenting EBITDA metrics, is expected to increase approximately <money><money>$15 million</money></money>, or more than <percent>30%</percent> year over year, in fiscal 2026 due to the increase in talent investments completed in fiscal 2025. Finally, as a reminder, fiscal 2026 returns to CRA’s typical 52-week year, whereas fiscal 2025 contained an extra week and resulted in a 53-week year. While we are pleased with CRA’s strong performance in 2025, we remain mindful that uncertain global macroeconomic, business, and political conditions can affect our business.”</p><p>CRA does not provide reconciliations of its annual non-GAAP EBITDA margin guidance to GAAP net income margin because the Company is unable to estimate with reasonable certainty unusual gains or charges, foreign currency exchange rates, and the resulting effect of these items, and of equity awards, on CRA’s taxes without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and may have a material effect on CRA’s results computed in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between the historical GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release is provided in the financial tables at the end of this press release.</p><p><b>Share Repurchase Expansion and Quarterly Dividend</b></p><p>On February 26, 2026, CRA’s Board of Directors authorized a <money><money>$55.0 million</money></money> expansion of the Company’s existing share repurchase program, in addition to the <money><money>$10.9 million</money></money> currently remaining under the program. CRA may repurchase shares of its common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations. The timing, amount and extent to which CRA repurchases shares will depend upon market conditions and other factors it may consider in its sole discretion.</p><p>The Board of Directors also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of <money><money>$0.57</money></money> per common share, payable on March 20, 2026 to shareholders of record as of March 10, 2026. CRA expects to continue paying quarterly dividends, the declaration, timing and amounts of which remain subject to the discretion of CRA’s Board of Directors.</p><p><b>Conference Call Information and Prepared CFO Remarks</b></p><p>CRA will host a conference call today at 10:00 a.m. ET to discuss its fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2025 financial results.

CRA believes that the non-GAAP financial measures described in this press release are important to management and investors because these measures supplement the understanding of CRA’s ongoing operating results and financial condition. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are used by CRA in its budgeting process, and the non-GAAP adjustments are made to the performance measures for some of CRA’s performance-based compensation.</p><p>As used herein, CRA defines non-GAAP EBITDA as net income before interest expense (net), provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization further adjusted for the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance, such as non-cash amounts relating to valuation changes in contingent consideration, acquisition-related costs, foreign currency (gains) losses, net, restructuring costs and related tax effects. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share also exclude non-cash amounts relating to valuation changes in contingent consideration, acquisition-related costs, foreign currency (gains) losses, net, restructuring costs and related tax effects. This press release also presents certain current fiscal period financial measures on a “constant currency” basis in order to isolate the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations can have on CRA’s financial results. These constant currency measures are determined by recalculating the current fiscal period local currency financial measure using the specified corresponding prior fiscal period’s foreign exchange rates.</p><p>All of the non-GAAP financial measures referred to above should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for, the GAAP financial information presented in this press release. The financial measures identified in this press release as “non-GAAP” are reconciled to their GAAP comparable measures in the financial tables appended to the end of this press release. In evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures, note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by CRA may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.</p><p><b>SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT</b></p><p><i>Statements in this press release concerning our future business, operating results and financial condition, including those concerning guidance on future revenue and non-GAAP EBITDA margin, the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results, our expectations regarding continued growth, our expectations regarding the payment of any future quarterly dividends and the level and extent of any purchases under our expanded share repurchase program, and statements using the terms “outlook,” “expect,” or similar expressions, are “forward-looking” statements as defined in Section 21 of the Exchange Act. These statements are based upon our current expectations and various underlying assumptions. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for these statements and assumptions, and these statements are expressed in good faith, these statements are subject to a number of additional factors and uncertainties. Our actual revenue and non-GAAP EBITDA margin in fiscal 2026 on a constant currency basis relative to fiscal 2025 could differ materially from the guidance presented herein, and our actual performance and results may differ materially from the performance and results contained in or implied by the forward-looking statements made herein, due to many important factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the possibility that the demand for our services may decline as a result of changes in general and industry specific economic conditions; the timing of engagements for our services; the effects of competitive services and pricing; the development and use of artificial intelligence; our ability to attract and retain key employee or non-employee experts; the inability to integrate and utilize existing consultants and personnel; the decline or reduction in project work or activity; global economic conditions including less stable political and economic environments; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; unanticipated expenses and liabilities; risks inherent in international operations; changes in tax law or accounting standards, rules, and regulations; our ability to collect on forgivable loans should any become due; and professional and other legal liability or settlements. Additional risks and uncertainties are discussed in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the heading “Risk Factors.” The inclusion of such forward-looking information should not be regarded as our representation that the future events, plans, or expectations contemplated will be achieved. Except as may be required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this press release, and we do not intend to do so.</i> </p><table

Non-GAAP financial measures refer to financial information adjusted from financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> (GAAP). The Company believes that the presentation of these adjusted financial measures is useful to investors as they provide additional information on comparisons between periods by including certain items that affect overall comparability. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for business planning purposes and to consider underlying trends of its business. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our use of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures reported by other companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures.

Our growth is powered by four iconic brands with deep heritage in their communities and enduring guest loyalty, supported by exceptional franchisees and great talent around the world,\" said Josh Kobza, Chief Executive Officer of RBI. \"As we look toward 2028 and beyond, we see a highly franchised, asset-light business delivering consistent <percent>5%</percent>+ Net Restaurant Growth, predictable earnings growth, and strong double-digit total shareholder returns. The strength of our brands and the quality of our teams position us to compound value for all our stakeholders for many years to come.\"</p><p>Sami Siddiqui, Chief Financial Officer, commented: \"We're committed to becoming a simpler, <percent>99%</percent> franchised business over the next few years. Our business generates significant free cash flow, which gives us substantial capital allocation flexibility. We've always prioritized investing in our brands, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and returning excess cash to shareholders through our attractive dividend. We're resuming share repurchases in 2026, and we've made the decision to become an investment-grade company. We believe we're only two years away from achieving corporate investment-grade leverage, which, once achieved, will unlock meaningful long-term flexibility for our business.\"</p><p>Patrick Doyle, Executive Chairman, commented: \"When I invested in RBI three years ago, I saw a company with great brands, great food, great people, and great franchisees executing the fundamentals that drive long-term success in this business. Today, we're delivering on exactly what attracted me to invest in this company. RBI continues to make the right long-term decisions for the business. We allocate capital well and keep franchisee profitability at the center of our decision-making. I cannot imagine a more exciting time to be part of the RBI story.\"</p><p><b>CLEAR PATH TO <percent>5%</percent>+ NET RESTAURANT GROWTH </b></p><p>RBI outlined three building blocks to achieve <percent>5%</percent>+ Net Restaurant Growth by 2028, representing approximately 1,800 net new restaurants per year by 2028. Outside of Burger King China, RBI's Net Restaurant Growth has averaged <percent>4.0%</percent> over the past five years, underscoring the strength and diversity of the core development engine.</p><p><b><i>US and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location> (300-400 net new restaurants per year by 2028):</i></b> Growth in the US and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location> is expected to be driven by Firehouse Subs, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes. Firehouse Subs is expected to contribute approximately half of the net new units in the US and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location>, with 150-200 net new units per year, driven by improving brand awareness and strong unit economics, with paybacks under four years, on average. The remaining 150-200 net new units will be roughly split between Tim Hortons and Popeyes. Tim Hortons Canada growth is supported by opportunities in underpenetrated regions including <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Western Canada</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.qc\">Quebec</location>, as well as attractive paybacks, which are less than three years on average. In the US, the team is on track to continue accelerating development in both existing and new markets, like <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.de\">Delaware</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tn\">Tennessee</location>, New <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.york\">York, Michigan</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location>, and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location>. While Popeyes tempered development in 2025, the team is laying the operational groundwork to position the brand to reaccelerate in the years ahead.</p><p><b><i><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> (300-400 net new restaurants per year by 2028):</i></b> Burger King China's partnership with CPE, announced in November 2025, is on track to deliver over 200 net new units in 2028, with continued acceleration after 2028, as CPE executes on its commitment to double the brand's footprint to 2,500 restaurants within five years. CPE's <money><money>$350 million</money></money> primary capital investment is intended to fully fund this development. Popeyes China and Tim Hortons China are expected to contribute the remaining 100-200 combined net new units in 2028 as both businesses scale.</p><p><b><i>International Excluding China (approximately 1,100 net new restaurants per year by 2028):</i></b> Top 10 growth markets including <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/in\">India</location>, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/mx\">Mexico</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/fr\">France</location>, and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/jp\">Japan</location> are expected to deliver approximately 700 units per year by 2028, supported by strong unit economics, with paybacks under four and a half years, on average. The remaining international portfolio of around 175 brand-market combinations are expected to contribute approximately 400 new units per year.</p><p><b>BURGER KING RECLAIM THE FLAME GROWTH STRATEGY DELIVERING RESULTS</b></p><p>Tom Curtis, President of Burger King US and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location>, provided an update on <i>Reclaim the Flame</i>, the brand's comprehensive growth strategy, which has delivered four years of burger <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/QSR/\" title=\"View QSR stock overview\">QSR</a> industry Comparable Sales outperformance since launching in 2022. The brand has moved from 10th to 6th place in industry guest experience rankings, increased modern image penetration from <percent>37%</percent> in 2021 to <percent>58%</percent> in 2025, and improved franchisee profitability from a low of around <money><money>$125,000</money></money> to approximately <money><money>$205,000</money></money> in both 2023 and 2024. Looking through the impact of temporary beef inflation and ad fund transfers, franchisee profitability grew in 2025, demonstrating that actions within the brand's control are working to expand profitability even during a challenging environment.</p><p>In addition, Burger King franchisees have voted to continue their elevated ad fund contribution of <percent>4.5%</percent> of sales through at least 2027, with <percent>97%</percent> voting to support the continued advertising firepower. The ad fund rate will continue at this level in 2028 if the business achieves <money><money>$230,000</money></money> in franchisee profitability by the end of 2027 or if the franchisees vote to extend again. This continued investment supports sustained marketing share of voice and demonstrates strong franchisee confidence in the brand's trajectory.</p><p>Looking ahead, Burger King will elevate culinary quality, beginning with enhancements to the Whopper, including new glazed buns, creamier mayonnaise, and upgraded clamshell packaging. In 2026, the brand will also launch a major campaign reinforcing its commitment to listening to and acting on guest feedback. Additionally, Burger King sees meaningful opportunity to win with families and kids, who represent just <percent>10%</percent> of the brand's traffic today.</p><p>The Company also introduced BK Assistant, an AI-powered tool designed to streamline restaurant operations by providing managers and team members with instant access to operational guidelines, inventory management, and compliance tracking, enabling them to focus more on guest service and team leadership.</p><p><b>SIMPLIFICATION ROADMAP AND CAPITAL ALLOCATION UPDATE </b></p><p>Sami Siddiqui, Chief Financial Officer, outlined RBI's simplification roadmap and enhanced capital allocation framework, and emphasized the transition to a <percent>99%</percent> franchised model, corporate investment-grade leverage by 2028, and resumption of share repurchases, with around <money><money>$500 million</money></money> expected in 2026. Share repurchases are expected to grow over time as the Company uses the majority of annual excess free cash flow for buybacks, with capacity to accelerate further once investment grade is achieved. In addition, RBI committed to its durable and growing dividend, with a long-term target payout ratio of around <percent>60%</percent>.</p><p>RBI's algorithm of <percent>3%</percent>+ Comparable Sales and <percent>5%</percent>+ Net Restaurant Growth continues to support <percent>8%</percent>+ organic Adjusted Operating Income growth on average through 2028. Three core structural drivers underpin this outlook: first, ramping to <percent>5%</percent>+ Net Restaurant Growth by 2028; second, a structural tailwind in the royalty rate as international markets scale and contractual royalty step-ups take effect; and third, disciplined cost management, with annual Segment G&amp;A growth of approximately <percent>2%</percent>, excluding Restaurant Holdings, creating meaningful operating leverage as System-wide Sales grow faster.</p><p><b><i>Restaurant Holdings to Sunset:</i></b> RBI is actively working to refranchise the Burger King US company restaurant portfolio to a base of approximately 300-500 home market restaurants and to place Popeyes China and Firehouse Brazil with long-term local partners. Both objectives are expected to be accomplished by the end of 2027, at which point the Restaurant Holdings segment will wind down. The long-term steady-state Burger King US company portfolio will target 300 restaurants across a few strategic markets.</p><p><b><i>Refined Capital Expenditures Outlook:</i></b> Total Capex and Cash Inducements is expected to be approximately <money><money>$400 million</money></money> in 2026 and 2027, stepping down to approximately <money><money>$300 million</money></money> in 2028 and thereafter as the Company finds long-term partners for Popeyes China and Firehouse Brazil, refranchises the vast majority of the Burger King US company restaurants, and largely concludes <i>Reclaim the Flame</i>. This trajectory supports significant free cash flow growth from approximately <money><money>$1.6 billion</money></money> in 2025 to more than <money><money>$2 billion</money></money> annually by 2028.</p><p><b><i>Investment Grade by 2028:</i></b> RBI is targeting net leverage of approximately 4.0x in 2026 and a long-term target of low- to mid-3x, which the Company expects to achieve by 2028 through earnings growth. Investment grade provides tangible benefits including lower relative cost of debt, access to deeper pools of capital, and the ability to issue longer-duration debt.</p><p>Until RBI becomes investment grade, the Company does not intend to fund share repurchases with incremental leverage. Once investment grade is achieved, RBI fully intends to operate within investment-grade leverage parameters while stepping up the quantum of buybacks with incremental leverage capacity each year as EBITDA grows.</p><p><b>2026 INVESTOR DAY</b></p><p>RBI's 2026 Investor Day featured presentations from Chief Executive Officer, Josh Kobza, Chief Financial Officer, Sami Siddiqui, Executive Chairman, Patrick Doyle, and Business Unit Presidents including Tom Curtis (Burger King US and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location>), Axel Schwan (Tim Hortons Canada and US), Thiago Santelmo (International), Peter Perdue (Popeyes US and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location>), and Mike Hancock (Firehouse Subs US and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location>).

Codere Online, launched in 2014 as part of the renowned casino operator Codere Group, offers online sports betting and online casino through its state-of-the art website and mobile applications. Codere Online currently operates in its core markets of Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Panama and Argentina; this online business is complemented by Codere Group’s physical presence in Spain and throughout Latin America, forming the foundation of the leading omnichannel gaming and casino presence.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><b>About Codere Group</b><br/>Codere Group is a multinational group dedicated to entertainment and leisure. It is a leading player in the private gaming industry, with four decades of experience and with presence in seven countries in Europe (Spain and Italy) and Latin America (Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Panama, and Uruguay).</p> <p align=\"justify\"><b>Note on Rounding. </b>Due to decimal rounding, numbers presented throughout this report may not add up precisely to the totals and subtotals provided, and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><b>Forward-Looking Statements </b><br/>Certain statements in this document may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding Codere Online Luxembourg, S.A. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Codere Online”) or Codere Online’s or its management team’s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “would” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements in this document may include, for example, statements about Codere Online’s financial performance and, in particular, the potential evolution and distribution of its net gaming revenue; any prospective and illustrative financial information; and changes in Codere Online’s strategy, future operations and target addressable market, financial position, estimated revenues and losses, projected costs, prospects and plans.</p> <p align=\"justify\">These forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this document and current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Codere Online’s or its management team’s views as of any subsequent date, and Codere Online does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.</p> <p align=\"justify\">As a result of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, Codere Online’s actual results or performance may be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Codere Online does not presently know or that Codere Online currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include (i) changes in applicable laws or regulations, including online gaming, privacy, data use and data protection rules and regulations as well as consumers’ heightened expectations regarding proper safeguarding of their personal information, (ii) the impacts and ongoing uncertainties created by regulatory restrictions, changes in perceptions of the gaming industry, changes in policies and increased competition, and geopolitical events such as war, (iii) the ability to implement business plans, forecasts, and other expectations and identify and realize additional opportunities, (iv) the risk of downturns and the possibility of rapid change in the highly competitive industry in which Codere Online operates, (v) the risk that Codere Online and its current and future collaborators are unable to successfully develop and commercialize Codere Online’s services, or experience significant delays in doing so, (vi) the risk that Codere Online may never achieve or sustain profitability, (vii) the risk that Codere Online will need to raise additional capital to execute its business plan, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, (viii) the risk that Codere Online experiences difficulties in managing its growth and expanding operations, (ix) the risk that third-party providers, including the Codere Group, are not able to fully and timely meet their obligations, (x) the risk that the online gaming operations will not provide the expected benefits due to, among other things, the inability to obtain or maintain online gaming licenses in the anticipated time frame or at all, (xi) the risk that Codere Online is unable to secure or protect its intellectual property, (xii) the risk that Codere Online’s securities may be delisted from Nasdaq and (xiii) the possibility that Codere Online may be adversely affected by other political, economic, business, and/or competitive factors. Additional information concerning certain of these and other risk factors is contained in Codere Online’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning Codere Online or other matters and attributable to Codere Online or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><b>Financial Information and Non-GAAP Financial Measures</b><br/>Codere Online’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”), which can differ in certain significant respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).</p> <p align=\"justify\">This document includes certain financial measures not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS (“non-GAAP”), such as, without limitation, net gaming revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and constant currency information. These non-GAAP financial measures are not measures of financial performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS and may exclude items that are significant in understanding and assessing Codere Online’s financial results. Therefore, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to revenue, net income, cash flows from operations or other measures of profitability, liquidity or performance under U.S. GAAP or IFRS. You should be aware that Codere Online’s presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. In addition, the audit of Codere Online’s financial statements in accordance with PCAOB standards, may impact how Codere Online currently calculates its non-GAAP financial measures, and we cannot assure you that there would not be differences, and such differences could be material.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Codere Online believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends in comparing Codere Online’s financial measures with other similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. These non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expense and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable measure under IFRS are included herein.</p> <p align=\"justify\">This document may include certain projections of non-GAAP financial measures. Codere Online is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP or IFRS financial measures without unreasonable effort, due to the inherent difficulty and variability of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact of the various adjusting items necessary for such comparable measures or such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted, ascertained or assessed, which could have a material impact on its future IFRS financial results. Consequently, no disclosure of estimated comparable U.S. GAAP or IFRS measures is included and no reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures is included.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><b>Use of Projections </b><br/>This document contains financial forecasts with respect to Codere Online’s business and projected financial results, including net gaming revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Codere Online’s independent auditors have not audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the projections for the purpose of their inclusion in this document, and accordingly, they did not express an opinion or provide any other form of assurance with respect thereto for the purpose of this document. These projections should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results. The assumptions and estimates underlying the prospective financial information are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the prospective financial information. See “Forward-Looking Statements” above. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the prospective results are indicative of the future performance of Codere Online or that actual results will not differ materially from those presented in the prospective financial information. Inclusion of the prospective financial information in this document should not be regarded as a representation by any person that the results contained in the prospective financial information will be achieved.</p> <p align=\"justify\">For further information on the limitations and assumptions underlying these projections, please refer to Codere Online’s filings with the SEC.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><b>Preliminary Information</b><br/>This document contains figures, financial metrics, statistics and other information that is preliminary and subject to change (the “Preliminary Information”). The Preliminary Information has not been audited, reviewed, or compiled by any independent registered public accounting firm. This Preliminary Information is subject to ongoing review including, where applicable, by Codere Online’s independent auditors. Accordingly, no independent registered public accounting firm has expressed an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the Preliminary Information. During the course of finalizing such Preliminary Information, adjustments to such Preliminary Information presented herein may be identified, which may be material. Codere Online undertakes no obligation to update or revise the Preliminary Information set forth in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law. The Preliminary Information may differ from actual results. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance upon this Preliminary Information. The Preliminary Information is not a comprehensive statement of financial results, and should not be viewed as a substitute for full financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the Preliminary Information is not necessarily indicative of the results to be achieved in any future period.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><b>No Offer or Solicitation </b><br/>This document does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor will there be any sale of securities in any states or jurisdictions in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. No offering of securities will be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or an exemption therefrom.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><b>Trademarks</b><br/>This document may contain trademarks, service marks, trade names and copyrights of Codere Online or other companies, which are the property of their respective owners.
