Winning teams will earn cash prizes, with top innovations considered for company-wide deployment.</p><p>\"At its core, Mastery is about designing technical capabilities that will shape the next chapter of hospitality,\" said Brian Kirkland, Chief Information Officer, Choice Hotels International.  \"By engaging associates across the organization—not just engineers—we're unlocking new opportunities to apply AI and emerging technologies to real business challenges. That collective investment in talent and expertise is accelerating innovation across the Choice Hotels system and translating into dependable, practical tools that help franchisees operate more efficiently, make smarter decisions, and grow their businesses with confidence.\"</p><p>A winning project from last year's Mastery event demonstrated how emerging technologies can deliver tangible business impact. In 2025, Choice Hotels' technology organization faced a major initiative to modernize  Hotel Suite, a legacy, web‑based system used across the company's entire property portfolio. The effort focused on updating and reimagining a critical platform that had become increasingly complex to maintain and evolve. Initial estimates projected the Hotel Suite modernization would take more than a year using traditional development approaches. Instead, a cross‑functional engineering team applied lessons from Mastery 2025, leveraging generative AI and a \"vibe coding\" development approach to fully reimagine the application. The team not only dramatically accelerated the delivery, but also modernized the user interface and delivered the first business‑critical, end‑user‑facing application at Choice Hotels to reach production using an AI‑assisted development model — cutting timelines by months, and saving more than <money><money>$750,000</money></money> in projected investment.</p><p><b><i>History of Innovation</i></b><br/>Choice Hotels brings a decades-long legacy of innovation to the hospitality industry, from introducing the first hotel website with real-time rates and availability and launching the first hotel app for the iPhone, to creating the first mobile-friendly rate management tool for operators and fully migrating its platforms to the cloud. Through Mastery, that innovation is put into practice—leveraging technology to give owners tools that simplify operations, strengthen competitiveness, and allow them to focus on delivering great stays for guests.</p><p>Choice Hotels has built and introduced industry-first, owner-facing technologies, including:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>In 1995, Choice launched the first hotel website with real-time rate and availability information.</li><li>In 2003, Choice launched the first cloud-based property management system (PMS), choiceADVANTAGE.</li><li>In 2009, Choice released the first hotel app for iOS.</li><li>In 2014, Choice became the first hotel company to offer instant booking on TripAdvisor.

The results show that Signatera status post-ICI was associated with bladder-intact event-free survival (BI-EFS). Specifically, Signatera-negativity at baseline and post-neoadjuvant therapy was linked to an <percent>88.6%</percent> and <percent>91%</percent> estimated two-year BI-EFS, respectively.</p><p>RETAIN evaluated a clinical response-adapted approach to identify patients for potential bladder-preservation following neoadjuvant therapy. The findings showed that post-treatment ctDNA clearance or negativity was associated with improved metastasis-free survival (MFS), and that Signatera-negative patients with no clinical or radiographic evidence of disease managed with active surveillance achieved MFS comparable to Signatera-negative patients undergoing cystectomy. In contrast, persistent Signatera-positivity was associated with poor outcomes.</p><p><span class=\"bwuline\">Perioperative Care: NIAGARA</span></p><p>This phase 3 randomized perioperative study includes the first-ever presentation of utDNA data with clinical correlation. The combination of utDNA and ctDNA status post-neoadjuvant therapy and pre-cystectomy identified the group with the highest 24-month EFS. utDNA-positivity pre-cystectomy was more strongly associated with residual non-invasive disease vs ctDNA-positivity was more strongly associated with residual invasive disease. These data suggest that the combined assessment of utDNA and ctDNA can provide complementary risk stratification benchmarked against pathologic staging, enabling comprehensive identification of residual disease.</p><p>“As treatment options expand in perioperative and bladder preservation settings, we need tools that help us determine who truly requires additional therapy and who may safely avoid it,” said Michiel van der Heijden, M.D., Ph.D., Netherlands Cancer Institute, principal investigator of INDIBLADE and presenting author of the NIAGARA study. “The data presented at ASCO GU demonstrate that MRD assessment with Signatera has strong correlations with outcomes and the potential to inform these critical treatment decisions.”</p><p>“Following our milestone PMA submission to the FDA based on IMvigor011, these compelling data presentations reflect our commitment to transforming care across the spectrum of genitourinary malignancies,” said Minetta Liu, M.D., chief medical officer of oncology and early cancer detection at Natera. “The new data suggests a particularly important opportunity for Signatera to optimize clinical decisions around bladder preservation, a major opening to improve patient quality of life.”</p><p><b>The full list of presentations at ASCO GU includes:</b></p><p class=\"bwmarginl1\"><b>February 27, 8:10 AM PT | Abstract #633 (Oral Presentation)<br/></b>Presenter: Joaquim Bellmunt, M.D.<br/><i>Circulating tumor (ct)DNA-guided adjuvant atezolizumab (atezo) in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC): Exploratory analysis of ctDNA dynamics in the IMvigor011 trial</i></p><p class=\"bwmarginl1\"><b>February 27, 8:10 AM PT | Abstract #632 (Oral Presentation)<br/></b>Presenter: Pooja Ghatalia, M.D.<br/><i>Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to guide response-adapted bladder preservation in muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC): Integrated analysis of the RETAIN trials</i></p><p class=\"bwmarginl1\"><b>February 27, 11:30 AM PT | Abstract #797<br/></b>Presenter: Can Aydogdu, M.D.<br/><i>Integrating genomic profiling and circulating tumor DNA monitoring to optimize surveillance strategies in muscle-invasive bladder cancer</i></p><p class=\"bwmarginl1\"><b>February 27, 11:30 AM PT | Abstract #831<br/></b>Presenter: Can Aydogdu, M.D.<br/><i>Association of ctDNA status with upstaging, pathologic outcomes, and genomic alterations in high-risk NMIBC</i></p><p class=\"bwmarginl1\"><b>February 27, 2:30 PM PT | Abstract #637 (Oral Presentation)<br/></b>Presenter: Jan-Jaap J.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><b>Vertical Structural Continuity Emerging in DDH-26-01</b><br/><b>Nova Scotia Introduces Purpose-Built Natural Hydrogen Legislation</b></p><p>Montreal, Quebec--(Newsfile Corp. - February 27, 2026) - Québec Innovative Materials Corp. (CSE: QIMC) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/QIMCF/\" title=\"View QIMCF stock overview\">QIMCF</a>) (FSE: 7FJ) (\"QIMC\" or the \"Company\") reports that drill hole DDH-26-01 has intersected a second hydrogen-associated structural zone at approximately 313 metres depth at its West Advocate Project, Nova Scotia. This interval from approximately 313 metres to 330 metres depth is distinct from the previously reported 40-metre hydrogen-bearing fault corridor encountered between 142 and 191 metres.</p><p>The identification of two vertically separated hydrogen-associated structural zones within a single borehole supports the interpretation of a structurally controlled, multi-zone natural hydrogen system and further strengthens QIMC's H2 geological model. Drilling at DDH-26-01 remains ongoing toward the planned total depth of 650 metres.</p><p>This development coincides with the Government of Nova Scotia's introduction of the Powering the Economy Act (Bill No. 193), proposed legislation that regulates natural hydrogen as a subsurface energy resource within the Province. This legislative development directly enhances investment certainty and long-term planning capability and demonstrates the Province's and Premier Houston's commitment to establishing Nova Scotia as a hub for responsible clean energy development. The Company's exploration at West Advocate involves no hydraulic fracturing and no reservoir stimulation.</p><p><b>What This Means for Investors</b></p><p>DDH-26-01 has now intersected hydrogen-associated structural intervals at approximately 142 metres and 313 metres depth within a single borehole, supporting the interpretation of a multi-zone, structurally controlled natural hydrogen system rather than an isolated occurrence. In natural hydrogen exploration, structural repetition across depth is a recognized indicator of system continuity and scale. This result further strengthens QIMC's working geological model and provides a defined, systematic, data-driven pathway for the next phases of its Nova Scotia natural hydrogen exploration program.</p><p><b>CEO Commentary</b></p><p>John Karagiannidis, President &amp; CEO of QIMC, stated:</p><p>\"Intersecting a second hydrogen-associated structural zone at 320 metres while Hole 1 continues drilling toward 650 metres significantly strengthens our geological interpretation of West Advocate as a structurally controlled, multi-zone system. We are observing vertically separated brecciated intervals within a single borehole that exhibit geochemical characteristics consistent with hydrogen-bearing environments.</p><p>The Province of Nova Scotia's introduced regulatory framework provides the clarity necessary to responsibly advance multi-well exploration strategies and support long-term planning and investment. As we continue defining structural continuity through drilling and logging, this regulatory certainty underpins our disciplined, systematic approach and we commend the Province for its proactive clean energy leadership.\"</p><p><b>Project Geologist Commentary</b></p><p>Edward Procyshyn, Project Geologist, commented:</p><p>\"Drill logging has identified within the second structural fault zone three separate brecciated shear zones that are progressively more altered and sheared downhole. With progressive alteration, the breccia fragments become more completely replaced by finely crystalline massive dark carbon-graphite and dark mica. Each underlying shear zone is more highly altered than the overlying shear zone. The middle and lower altered shear zones were most highly altered and develop dark, very finely granular, massive carbon-rich intervals 0.5 to 1 metre thick. These highly altered core intervals contain the highest measured hydrogen gas values.</p><p>The host rock within the structural fault zone is also progressively altered as the intensity of shear deformation increases downhole. Thinly bedded, finely granular siltstone, dark carbonaceous mudstone, and fanglomerate are progressively recrystallized to form, within the structural fault zone, massive white, very fine-grained porcelain-like units cut by darker web to lenticular fractures. As shear fracturing and alteration increase in intensity downhole, the intervening porcellanite-like host changes colour from white to pale green and finally to darker greenish grey, indicating mineralogical changes due to increasing conditions of alteration.\"</p><p>Edward Procyshyn continued:</p><p>\"The progressive hydrothermal alteration of this structural fault shear zone supports the model that white native hydrogen is being increasingly generated at lower crustal levels by degassing of a magmatic system and being transported by advective hydrothermal fluids into the fault-related shear structures. This suggests that the degassing may be generated by injection of mantle plumes into the upper crust within the West Advocate area and that this process may have contributed significant amounts of white hydrogen gas that was and is presently being measured in the intersected structural zones and at surface in the soil-gas samples.</p><p>The very low to absent quantities of methane contained in the measured gases support the concept that hydrogen is being generated from crustal sources in a naturally occurring hydrogen system rather than from a conventional hydrocarbon occurrence.\"</p><p><b>Gas Monitoring Observations at 313m</b></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align: start; width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">Parameter</td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Observation<br/><br/></td></tr><tr><td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">Hydrogen (H₂)</td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Elevated concentrations detected<br/><br/></td></tr><tr><td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">Oxygen (O₂)</td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Depleted relative to atmospheric levels<br/><br/></td></tr><tr><td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">Methane (CH₄)</td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">None detected<br/><br/></td></tr><tr><td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">Hydraulic fracturing / stimulation</td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Not conducted<br/><br/></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p>Measurements were collected in ambient atmospheric air near the borehole collar and during core handling and are subject to atmospheric dilution.</p><p><b>2026 Drill Program: Five-Hole Campaign</b></p><p>DDH-26-01 is the first hole in a planned five-hole 2026 drill program designed to systematically evaluate structural hydrogen corridors at West Advocate and adjacent targets.</p><ul><li><p>Hole 1 (DDH-26-01): Drilling continues toward planned 650 metres depth.</p></li><li><p>Hole 2 (DDH-26-02): Planned from same pad; oriented N297° with 55° plunge to the northwest.</p></li><li><p>Hole 3 (DDH-26-03): Eatonville Road area along the Reid Line; planned to 700 metres depth.</p></li><li><p>Holes 4 &amp; 5 (DDH-26-04 and DDH-26-05): Bennett Hill targets testing the broader regional structural hydrogen corridor.</p></li></ul><p><b>Nova Scotia Legislation</b></p><p>Nova Scotia's proposed legislation reflects a broader recognition by governments that natural hydrogen warrants a dedicated regulatory framework, a development that directly benefits companies with active exploration programs in the province.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - February 27, 2026) - <b>Advanced Gold Exploration Inc. (CSE: AUEX) (FSE: ZF2) (OTC Pink: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/AUHIF/\" title=\"View AUHIF stock overview\">AUHIF</a>)</b> (\"<b>Advanced Gold</b>\" or the \"<b>Company</b>\") is pleased to announce that it has entered into a mineral property purchase and sale agreement dated February 26, 2026 (the \"<b>Agreement</b>\") with Stream Metals LLC and Kadenwood Development Corp. (collectively, the \"<b>Vendors</b>\") to acquire a <percent>100%</percent> interest in the Silver Belle Project (the \"<b>Project</b>\") located in Eureka County, Nevada.</p><p>The Project consists of approximately 100 unpatented lode mining claims (2,000 acres) situated within the prolific Eureka Mining District of Nevada, an area well known for high-grade carbonate replacement deposit (\"<b>CRD</b>\") style mineralization and historic silver-lead-zinc production.</p><p>The Project is in one of Nevada's most productive carbonate-hosted mineral belts, proximal to several historic and modern mining operations. The Company believes the Project demonstrates geological characteristics consistent with CRD-style mineralization and intends to conduct modern exploration, including geologic mapping, sampling, and geophysical targeting, to evaluate the potential for high-grade replacement and feeder structures at depth.</p><p>Historic records from the district document high-grade mineralization, including reported silver and base metal head grades from prior mining operations in the area. Mineralization is characterized by silver with associated lead, zinc and antimony hosted in favorable carbonate stratigraphy typical of CRD systems.</p><p>Advanced Gold president Arndt Roehlig, states, \"Data interpreted of the Project has confirmed the site's status as a \"rediscovery\" target, highlighted by documented historical production of silver. Located in the historic Diamond District of Eureka County, the Project consists of a 2,000-acre claim block situated on the Eureka-Battle Mountain mineral belt. Despite its location in one of the world's most productive mining jurisdictions, the Project has seen no modern exploration, with all historical work restricted to the shallow oxidized cap of a much larger, untested potential CRD system.\"</p><p>A documented 1937 smelter return from the Silver Bell Mining Co. underscores the metal content of the Project's underground workings. A 21-short-ton shipment sent to the ASARCO Smelter in Salt Lake City returned a silver grade of <b>1,611 g/t (47 oz/ton)</b>. In addition to silver, the shipment contained significant base metal concentrations, including <b><percent>37%</percent> Lead, <percent>10%</percent> Zinc, and <percent>1%</percent> Copper</b>. The presence of 3,000 g/t Antimony further confirms the Project's position within the antimony-enriched portion of the Diamond Range CRD belt, consistent with regional metallogenic zoning typical of large-scale systems. </p><p>Historical infrastructure at the site includes a shaft, multiple adits, and approximately 500 feet of underground development.  The deeper, higher-temperature sulphide-rich CRD core-where the highest tonnages are typically found-remains untested. The Project sits within a wide-open structural corridor with clear expansion potential both along strike to the north and south, and down-dip to the west where the limestone host rock thickens.</p><p>The high-grade nature of the Project mineralization is related to classic CRD architecture, characterized by reactive limestone-quartzite contacts and intrusive-driven hydrothermal fluids. These systems are highly prized by modern explorers for their ability to host vertically extensive mineralized shoots and very large ounce counts within relatively small surface footprints. All historical grade data and shipment records cited herein are verified by the <b>USGS MRDS deposit record (M232256).</b></p><p><b>Transaction Terms</b></p><p>In accordance with the terms of the Agreement, the Company shall acquire the Project from the Vendors. As consideration for the Project, the Company shall: (A) pay an aggregate of <money>$25,000</money> in cash to the Vendors upon execution of the Agreement (the \"<b>Effective Date</b>\"), an additional <money>$100,000</money> in cash on the date of the closing (the \"<b>Closing Date</b>\") of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, and a final cash payment of <money>$50,000</money> on or before the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date; and (B) issue to the Vendors an aggregate of 1,500,000 common shares (the \"<b>Common Shares</b>\") in the capital of the Company on the Closing Date, and issue an aggregate of 1,500,000 Common Shares to the Vendors on or before the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date.</p><p>In addition, in connection with the transaction contemplated by the Agreement, Stream Metals will be entitled to a <percent>1.5%</percent> net smelter returns royalty (the \"<b>Royalty</b>\"). The Company has the option to purchase the Royalty (reducing the Royalty to <percent>0%</percent>) by making a cash payment to Stream Metals in the amount of US<money>$1,500,000. T</money>he completion of the transaction contemplated by the Agreement remains subject to the approval of all regulatory and other approvals, including the approval of the Canadian Securities Exchange. All securities issued pursuant to the Agreement will be subject to a statutory hold period of four months and one day from the issuance thereof, as applicable, in accordance with applicable securities laws.</p><p><b>Proposed Private Placement</b></p><p>In addition, the Company wishes to announce that it intends to complete a non-brokered private placement through the issuance of up to 5,000,000 units (each, a \"<b>Unit</b>\") in the capital of the Company at a price of <money>$0.20</money> per Unit for aggregate gross proceeds of up to <money>$1,000,000</money> (the \"<b>Offering</b>\").</p><p>Each Unit shall be comprised of one common share (each, a \"<b>Common Share</b>\") in the capital of the company and one-half of one whole transferable Common Share purchase warrant (each whole warrant, a \"<b>Warrant</b>\"). Each Warrant shall entitle the holder thereof to acquire one Common Share at a price of <money>$0.30</money> per Common Share for a period of two (2) years from the date of issuance.</p><p>All securities issued pursuant to the Offering will be subject to a hold period of four months plus a day from the date of issuance and the resale rules of applicable securities legislation. The gross proceeds of the Offering shall be used for general corporate and working capital purposes.</p><p>The closing of the Offering is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, the receipt of all necessary regulatory and other approvals, including the approval of the Canadian Securities Exchange. The Company may pay certain eligible finders a cash commission of up to <percent>8%</percent> cash or warrants of the gross proceeds received from subscribers introduced to the Company by such finder.</p><p>Closing of the transaction remains subject to customary conditions and regulatory approvals.</p><p><b>Qualified Person</b></p><p>Jim Atkinson, MSc., P.

(an Ontario corporation) holds <percent>100%</percent> of the shares of Vicus Exploraciones S.A.C., its Peruvian subsidiary, which holds a <percent>100%</percent> interest in seven property groupings located in northeastern, central, and southeastern Peru.</p><p>Four of these projects are located in southeastern Peru in the Santa Lucia mining district, within a two hour drive of the Company's field office in the city of Juliaca: Galena, Esperanza, Volcano, and Sora silver-copper projects. As part of the spin out transaction, an NI 43-101 report on the Galena silver-copper-manganese project is underway. Once the spin out transaction is approved an inaugural drilling program is planned to test for Ag Cu Mn mineralization within the limestone contact horizon to determine whether it may host a deposit similar to Aftermath Silver Ltd.'s (TSXV: AMM) Berenguela silver-copper-manganese project. Berenguela is located northeast of Galena within the same Carbonate Replacement Deposit ('CRD') trend. Colt's Esperanza silver-copper-manganese project is being investigated as a possible extension of the Berenguela deposit. Colt's Volcano and Sora projects were recently increased in size through staking by over 4,500 hectares to cover ground relinquished by Fresnillo Plc. (LON: FRES) between the operating Tacaza mine and historical Santa Barbara mine. The Sora Project is contiguous to Ivanhoe Electric Inc's (TSE:IE) Pinaya copper-gold porphyry-skarn project. All four of these projects have year-round access and excellent access. </p><p>The Cristel copper project is located in in southeastern Peru, and was acquired to investigate a color anomaly caused by the oxidation of massive and semi-massive that locally contains copper. Minsur S.A.'s San Rafael copper-tin deposit located approximately 40 km to the south began as a high-grade copper deposit and high-grade tin mineralization was discovered at depth beneath the copper deposit.</p><p>The Ica copper-gold project is located in west-central Peru and is being investigated for a the iron oxide-copper-gold (IOCG) target. The Pluma sediment hosted copper project is in an emerging red-bed hosted copper district in northeastern Peru. Palamina's strategy is to maintain the Pluma project while Hannan   Metals Ltd's (TSXV: HAN) carries out a drilling program on their adjacent San Martin project.</p><p>Currently, Colt Silver has no other assets.</p><p><b>Debenture Offering and Subscription Receipt Offering</b></p><p><i>Debenture Offering</i></p><p>Colt Silver intends to complete a non-brokered private placement of up to <money>$500,000</money> in secured convertible debentures (the \"<b>Debentures</b>\").

According to some clinical practice guidelines, about <percent>25%</percent> of newly diagnosed bladder cancer cases are MIBC. The standard of care for patients with MIBC has been neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy followed by surgery, which is shown to prolong survival. However, nearly half of patients who undergo this standard treatment experience recurrence.</p><p><b>About Merck’s early-stage cancer clinical program<br/></b>Finding cancer at an earlier stage may give patients a greater chance of long-term survival. Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease. Building on the strong understanding of the role of KEYTRUDA in later-stage cancers, Merck is evaluating our portfolio of medicines and pipeline candidates in earlier disease states, with more than 30 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer.</p><p><b>About Merck’s research in genitourinary cancers<br/></b>Merck is advancing research aimed at helping transform the treatment landscape and broaden options for people with genitourinary (GU) cancers, including bladder, kidney and prostate cancers. Globally, GU cancers account for an estimated 2.6 million new cancer diagnoses each year, equaling over 1 in 8 of all cancer incidences. Through a robust clinical development program with more than 50 clinical trials evaluating more than 22,000 patients around the world, Merck is investigating the potential of several portfolio medicines and pipeline assets, leveraging multiple novel combination strategies, across various stages of disease, to help address unmet needs in GU cancers.</p><p><b>About KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab) injection for intravenous use, 100 mg<br/></b>KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.</p><p>Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.</p><p><b>Selected KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab) Indications in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location><br/></b><i>Urothelial Cancer<br/></i>KEYTRUDA, in combination with enfortumab vedotin, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.</p><p>KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>who are not eligible for any platinum-containing chemotherapy, or</li><li>who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy.</li></ul><p>KEYTRUDA, in combination with enfortumab vedotin, as neoadjuvant treatment and then continued after cystectomy as adjuvant treatment, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) who are ineligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.</p><p>KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-unresponsive, high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ (CIS) with or without papillary tumors who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo cystectomy.</p><p><i>See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> after the Selected Important Safety Information.</i></p><p><b>Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA<br/></b><b>Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions<br/></b>KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.</p><p>Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.</p><p>Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.</p><p><span class=\"bwuline\">Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis<br/></span>KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation.
