(CSE: QNI) (\"Quebec Nickel\") whereby Quebec Nickel can acquire a <percent>100%</percent> interest in the Ecru gold project, Nevada, USA.</p><p>Under the terms of the Agreement, Quebec Nickel can acquire a <percent>100%</percent> interest in the Ecru claims from Orogen for an aggregate consideration of <money>$540,000</money> in cash and shares of Quebec Nickel (\"Consideration Shares\"), subject to regulatory acceptance of the Canadian Securities Exchange, and payable as follows:</p><ol><li><p><money>$250,000</money> cash on closing of the acquisition, <money>$25,000</money> of which has already been received;</p></li><li><p>1,000,000 Consideration Shares of Quebec Nickel issued on closing, at a price of <money>$0.16</money>5 per share, representing the permitted discount to the closing price of Quebec Nickel's common shares on February 26, 2026; and</p></li><li><p>Within six months of closing, the issuance to Orogen of <money>$125,000</money> of Consideration Shares at a price per share equal to the 10-day volume weighted average price of the common shares of Quebec Nickel on the Canadian Securities Exchange at the date of the issue.</p></li></ol><p>Quebec Nickel will also grant a non-buyable <percent>2%</percent> net smelter return (\"NSR\") royalty to Orogen.</p><p>Closing of the acquisition is expected to be completed within the next 30 days.</p><p>Paddy Nicol, CEO of Orogen commented, \"The Ecru gold project, staked by Orogen's generative team, is favourably located in the prolific Cortez trend in Nevada, immediately north and adjacent to Nevada Gold Mines Robertson deposit. We look forward to following the progress of the Quebec Nickel team at Ecru.\"</p><p><strong><u>About the Ecru Gold Project</u></strong></p><p>The Ecru project is located on the northeast margin of Nevada Gold Mine's Cortez Trend land position (the Cortez Complex<sup>1</sup>) within the larger Battle Mountain - Eureka trend. The property consists of 112 lode-mining claims <percent>100%</percent> owned by Orogen and two leased sections. The project lies immediately adjacent to Nevada Gold Mines' 2.4 Moz Robertson reduced intrusion related gold deposit<sup>1</sup> (Figure 1).</p><p>Two main target areas are located on the property and demonstrate the potential for both Carlin and Robertson-style mineralization (Figure 2).</p><p>The shallower intrusive target is defined by a two-kilometre diameter area of multiple magnetic highs and adjacent gravity lows, interpreted to reflect intrusive bodies and associated alteration within upper‑plate siliciclastic rocks. Multiple intrusive phases are present on the property, both at surface and in historical drill intercepts. These multi‑phase intrusives and the surrounding rock exhibit characteristics and geochemical signatures analogous to the Robertson deposit.</p><p>A potential Carlin-type system is defined by an untested, prominent gravity high target interpreted to be a region of structurally uplifted lower plate carbonates near surface, under pediment cover. Nearby historical drilling has identified anomalous gold and pathfinder geochemistry in upper plate stratigraphy which supports the potential for a mineralized, lower plate carbonate window at Ecru.</p><p>Quebec Nickel plans to evaluate the potential for both deposit types on the property.</p><a href=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/bdbbbf6b-4bb9-443c-b0ca-2e40b3395753/1142121/orogen-fig1-022626.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/bdbbbf6b-4bb9-443c-b0ca-2e40b3395753/1142121/orogen-fig1-022626.jpg\" style=\"text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto;\" width=\"566\"/></a><figcaption><strong>Figure 1: Location of the Ecru project.

            "title": "Worksport Is \"Showing Its Work\" as 2026 Momentum Targets Record-Setting Performance | WKSP Stock News",
            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><strong id=\"dateline\">WEST SENECA, NY / <a href=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ACCESS Newswire</a> / February 27, 2026 / </strong>Projections often capture attention. Measurable progress builds confidence.</p><p>At Worksport Ltd. (\"Worksport\" or the \"Company\") <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3h3\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">(NASDAQ:<u>WKSP</u>)</a>, the sequence of developments extending back through Q4 2025 reflects the latter principle. This is not a company relying on narrative alone. It's increasingly demonstrating execution alongside opportunity. As 2026 begins, the emphasis is clear: documented milestones and operational advancement are taking precedence over distant ambition.</p><p>That tone was established before the new year even turned. In December 2025, Worksport reported that November <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3h4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>revenue</u></a> marked the highest monthly total in Company history, creating a record baseline entering 2026. A single month does not define a trajectory, but it can reveal acceleration. When revenue peaks within a compressed timeframe, it often signals traction building beneath the surface, which can show up in broader quarterly performances.</p><p>Against that backdrop, the early 2026 announcements read less like routine updates and more like coordinated steps within a structured expansion.</p><p><strong>Growth Through Intention</strong></p><p>On January 27, Worksport's subsidiary <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3h5\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>Terravis Energy</u></a> selected a major Asian manufacturing partner for its Aetherlux heat pump platform with Zerofrost anti-frosting technology. The move was less about headlines and more about infrastructure. Clean energy hardware does not scale on concept alone. It requires supply chain alignment, cost discipline, and production readiness. By securing manufacturing capacity ahead of broader commercialization, Worksport signaled preparation and a willingness to lay foundational infrastructure before expanding market visibility.</p><p>Then, on February 3, the Company announced a strategic <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3h6\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>partnership</u></a> with Potomac International Partners to accelerate federal government and commercial market engagement for its clean energy ecosystem. Federal procurement is structured, compliance-driven, and relationship-based. Rather than attempting to navigate that terrain independently, Worksport aligned with a partner designed to open institutional doors. The SOLIS solar system, COR portable energy platform, and Aetherlux heat pump technology are now positioned within structured procurement conversations.</p><p>Momentum is far more compelling when numbers support it.</p><p><strong>Record-Setting Revenues Posted</strong></p><p>On February 11, Worksport <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3h7\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>reported</u></a> Q4 revenue growth of <percent>65%</percent> year over year, with gross profit increasing <percent>380%</percent>. Full-year revenue climbed <percent>91%</percent> to approximately <money>$16.2 million</money>, and gross margins expanded into the low <percent>30%</percent> range. Revenue growth draws attention. Margin expansion commands respect. Together, they indicate that scaling efforts are not occurring at the expense of discipline. In other words, operational leverage appears to be emerging alongside expansion.</p><p>The next development added another layer. On February 12, Worksport <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3h8\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>confirmed</u></a> that a government entity is evaluating its Aetherlux Pro heat pump, with AHRI and ENERGY STAR certification processes continuing to advance. Government evaluation is not casual engagement. It involves technical scrutiny, regulatory review, and structured assessment. While outcomes remain subject to process, the engagement itself signals that the technology is being tested within serious institutional channels.</p><p>That momentum carried forward on February 19, when Worksport secured key <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3h9\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>certifications</u></a> for its COR portable energy system, including transport and federal compliance approvals. The Company indicated that final UL and CSA certifications are expected within the first quarter of 2026. Those certifications are often prerequisites for large-scale retail and enterprise distribution, again showing that commercialization gates are being addressed in accretive sequence.</p><p>Viewed collectively, the pattern becomes harder to dismiss. Revenue momentum. Manufacturing readiness. Federal channel access. Certification advancement. Margin expansion. These are not disconnected headlines. They represent synchronized movement across production, distribution, compliance, and financial performance.</p><p>Worksport's broader 2026 business <a href=\"https://pr.report/j3ha\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>update</u></a> reinforces that alignment. Management has stated that clean energy products are shipping, that OEM and major distribution discussions are progressing, and that growth is expected to continue in 2026 - language that reflects forward movement supported by visible operational steps.</p><p><strong>Summing The Parts</strong></p><p>It's also important to remember the foundation beneath this expansion. Worksport's core automotive accessory business, particularly tonneau covers, continues to contribute revenue stability. The SOLIS solar integration platform, COR portable energy system, and Aetherlux heat pump portfolio are not replacements. They are extensions. The Company is layering clean energy capabilities onto an existing operational base rather than attempting to build from scratch.</p><p>Market opportunity narratives, including references to multibillion-dollar industry segments, only carry weight when paired with tangible advancement. What distinguishes Worksport's current phase is that incremental barriers are being addressed methodically. Production alignment reduces supply risk. Certifications reduce compliance friction. Institutional evaluation adds credibility. Margin expansion suggests scalability.</p><p>Taken together, the progression suggests coordination between strategy and execution. Moreover, Worksport's updates show it's not merely outlining where it intends to go in 2026. It's describing the intermediate steps designed to support that trajectory. For observers evaluating emerging clean energy participants within the small-cap landscape, the distinction between aspiration and implementation matters.</p><p>As importantly, Worksport's first-quarter developments continue to reflect a company intent on showing its work as it provides answers to serve multiple market opportunities. In a market environment that increasingly values operational clarity and disciplined advancement, that distinction could prove meaningful.</p><p><strong>About Worksport</strong></p><p>Worksport Ltd. (Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/WKSP/\" title=\"View WKSP stock overview\">WKSP</a>), through its subsidiaries, designs, develops, manufactures, and owns the intellectual property on a variety of tonneau covers, solar integrations, portable power systems, and clean heating &amp; cooling solutions.
