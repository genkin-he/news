Development of the next version of Caris Detect is currently underway with the aim of improving the already best-in-class performance with the incorporation of Whole Transcriptome Sequencing.\"</p><p><b><u>About Caris Life Sciences<br/></u></b>Caris Life Sciences® (Caris) is a leading, patient-centric, next-generation AI TechBio company and precision medicine pioneer actively developing and commercializing innovative solutions to transform healthcare.

            "title": "Nutrien Announces TSX Approval for Its Renewed Share Repurchase Program | NTR Stock News",
            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p> <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.sk.sasoon\">SASKATOON, Saskatchewan</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nutrien Ltd. (TSX and NYSE: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/NTR/\" title=\"View NTR stock overview\">NTR</a>) announced today that the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) has accepted Nutrien's notice to commence a normal course issuer bid (NCIB) to purchase outstanding common shares representing up to five percent of its issued and outstanding common shares.</p><p>Under the NCIB, purchases of common shares may be made through the facilities of the TSX, the New York Stock Exchange and/or alternative trading systems in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location> and the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location>, or as otherwise permitted under applicable securities laws. The actual number of common shares that may be purchased under the NCIB and the timing of any such purchases will be determined by Nutrien. Nutrien believes that purchasing its own common shares represents an attractive investment opportunity, is in the best interests of the company and is consistent with Nutrien's objective of returning capital to shareholders over time. As of February 17, 2026, Nutrien had 481,141,322 common shares outstanding and, therefore, is permitted to repurchase up to 24,057,066 of its outstanding common shares pursuant to the NCIB. Common shares purchased under the NCIB will be cancelled.</p><p>The NCIB will be effected in accordance with the TSX normal course issuer bid rules and/or Rule 10b-18 under the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which contain restrictions on the number of common shares that may be purchased on a single day, subject to certain exceptions for block purchases, based on the average daily trading volumes of Nutrien's common shares on the applicable exchange. Subject to exceptions for block purchases, Nutrien will limit daily purchases of common shares on the TSX in connection with the NCIB to no more than twenty-five percent (430,107 common shares) of the average daily trading volume of the common shares on the TSX for the six-month period from August 1, 2025 to January 31, 2026 (1,720,429 common shares) during any trading day. Purchases under the NCIB will be made through open market purchases at market price, as well as by other means as may be permitted under applicable securities laws, including private agreements. Any purchases made by private agreement under an issuer bid exemption order issued by a securities regulatory authority will be at a discount to the prevailing market price as provided in such exemption order. Purchases of common shares may commence on March 3, 2026 and will expire on the earlier of March 2, 2027, the date on which the company has acquired the maximum number of common shares allowable under the NCIB or otherwise decides not to make any further repurchases under the NCIB. Nutrien has entered into an automatic purchase plan with a broker which will enable Nutrien to provide standard instructions and purchase common shares on the open market during self-imposed blackout periods. Outside of these black-out periods, common shares may be purchased in accordance with management's discretion.</p><p>Nutrien's prior NCIB for the purchase of up to 24,462,941 common shares will expire on March 2, 2026. As of February 17, 2026, Nutrien repurchased an aggregate of 8,708,901 common shares at a weighted-average price of <money>US<money>$58.56</money></money> per share, for an aggregate of <money>US<money>$510,031,461</money></money> under the prior NCIB. Purchases were made on the open market.</p><p><b>About Nutrien</b></p><p>Nutrien is a leading global provider of crop inputs and services.

Reaching a combined monthly audience of approximately 170 million listeners, SiriusXM offers a broad range of content for listeners everywhere they tune in with a diverse mix of live, on-demand, and curated programming across music, talk, news, and sports.</p><p><b>Forward-Looking Statements</b></p><p>This communication contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the senior notes offering and the Concurrent Tender Offer and the intended use of proceeds from the senior notes offering. Such forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements.</p><p>The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and the timing of events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: <i>Risks Relating to our Business and Operations:</i> We face substantial competition, and that competition has increased over time; our SiriusXM service has suffered a loss of subscribers, and our Pandora ad-supported service has similarly experienced a loss of monthly active users; if our efforts to attract and retain subscribers and listeners, or convert listeners into subscribers, are not successful, our business will be adversely affected; we engage in extensive marketing efforts and the continued effectiveness of those efforts is an important part of our business; we rely on third parties for the operation of our business, and the failure of third parties to perform could adversely affect our business; failure to successfully monetize and generate revenues from podcasts and other non-music content could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition; we may not realize the benefits of acquisitions or other strategic investments and initiatives; and the impact of economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. <i>Risks Relating to our SiriusXM Business: </i>Changing consumer behavior and new technologies relating to our satellite radio business may reduce our subscribers and may cause our subscribers to purchase fewer services from us or to cancel our services altogether, resulting in less revenue to us; a substantial number of our SiriusXM service subscribers periodically cancel their subscriptions and we cannot predict how successful we will be at retaining customers; our ability to profitably attract and retain subscribers to our SiriusXM service is uncertain; our business depends in part upon the auto industry; failure of our satellites would significantly damage our business; and our SiriusXM service may experience harmful interference from wireless operations. <i>Risks Relating to our Pandora and Off-platform Business: </i>Our Pandora and Off-platform business generates a significant portion of its revenues from advertising, and reduced spending by advertisers could harm our business; emerging industry trends may adversely impact our ability to generate revenue from advertising; our failure to convince advertisers of the benefits of our Pandora ad-supported service could harm our business; if we are unable to maintain our advertising revenue, our results of operations will be adversely affected; changes to mobile operating systems and browsers may hinder our ability to sell advertising and market our services; and if we fail to accurately predict and play music, comedy or other content that our Pandora listeners enjoy, we may fail to retain existing and attract new listeners. <i>Risks Relating to Laws and Governmental Regulations: </i>Privacy and data security laws and regulations may hinder our ability to market our services, sell advertising and impose legal liabilities; consumer protection laws and our failure to comply with them could damage our business; failure to comply with FCC requirements could damage our business; we may face lawsuits, incur liability or suffer reputational harm as a result of content published or made available through our services; and increasing interest and expectations regarding sustainable business practices by our various stakeholders and related reporting obligations may expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects. <i>Risks Associated with Data and Cybersecurity and the Protection of Consumer Information:</i> If we fail to protect the security of personal information about our customers, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our reputation could suffer; we use artificial intelligence in our business, and challenges with properly managing its use could result in reputational harm, competitive harm, and legal liability and adversely affect our results of operations; and interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business. <i>Risks Associated with Certain Intellectual Property Rights: </i>Rapid technological and industry changes and new entrants could adversely impact our services; the market for music rights is changing and is subject to significant uncertainties; our Pandora services depend upon maintaining complex licenses with copyright owners, and these licenses contain onerous terms; failure to protect our intellectual property or actions by third parties to enforce their intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and operating results; and some of our services and technologies use \"open source\" software, which may restrict how we use or distribute our services or require that we release the source code subject to those licenses. <i>Risks Related to our Capital Structure:</i> While we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock, we may change our dividend policy at any time; our holding company structure could restrict access to funds of our subsidiaries that may be needed to pay third party obligations; we have significant indebtedness, and our subsidiaries' debt contains certain covenants that restrict their operations; and our ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund our operations could be limited, which could negatively impact our operations. <i>Other Operational Risks:</i> If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business could be harmed; our facilities could be damaged by natural catastrophes or terrorist activities; the unfavorable outcome of pending or future litigation could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial condition; we may be exposed to liabilities that other entertainment service providers would not customarily be subject to; and our business and prospects depend on the strength of our brands.</p><p>Additional factors that could cause material differences from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025, which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") and available at the SEC's Internet site (<a href=\"http://www.sec.gov\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://www.sec.gov</a>).

However, we've always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance's latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.</p><p>Warner Bros. is a world-class organization, and we want to thank David Zaslav, Gunnar Wiedenfels, Bruce Campbell, Brad Singer and the <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/WBD/\" title=\"View WBD stock overview\">WBD</a> Board for running a fair and rigorous process. We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.' iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the U.S.  But this transaction was always a 'nice to have' at the right price, not a 'must have' at any price.</p><p>Netflix's business is healthy, strong and growing organically, powered by our slate and best-in-class streaming service. This year, we'll invest approximately <money><money>$20 billion</money></money> in quality films and series and will expand our entertaining offering.

These forward-looking statements are based on Netflix's and WBD's current expectations, estimates and projections about the expected date of closing of the proposed transaction and the potential benefits thereof, their respective businesses and industries, management's beliefs and certain assumptions made by Netflix and WBD, all of which are subject to change. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"could,\" \"seek,\" \"see,\" \"will,\" \"may,\" \"would,\" \"might,\" \"potentially,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\" \"expect,\" \"target,\" similar expressions or the negatives of these words or other comparable terminology that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes. All forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control and are not guarantees of future results, such as statements about the consummation of the proposed transaction and the anticipated benefits thereof. These and other forward-looking statements, including the failure to consummate the proposed transaction or to make or take any filing or other action required to consummate the transaction on a timely matter or at all, are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (i) the completion of the proposed transaction on anticipated terms and timing, including obtaining stockholder and regulatory approvals, completing the separation of WBD's Discovery Global business (\"Discovery Global\") and Warner Bros. business, anticipated tax treatment, unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, future prospects, business and management strategies, expansion and growth of WBD's and Netflix's businesses and other conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction; (ii) failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction, including as a result of delay in completing the transaction or integrating the businesses of Netflix and WBD; (iii) Netflix's and WBD's ability to implement their business strategies; (iv) consumer viewing trends; (v) potential litigation relating to the proposed transaction that could be instituted against Netflix, WBD or their respective directors; (vi) the risk that disruptions from the proposed transaction will harm Netflix's or WBD's business, including current plans and operations; (vii) the ability of Netflix or WBD to retain and hire key personnel; (viii) potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement, pendency or completion of the proposed transaction; (ix) uncertainty as to the long-term value of Netflix's common stock; (x) legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting Netflix's and WBD's businesses; (xi) general economic and market developments and conditions; (xii) the evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes under which Netflix and WBD operate; (xiii) potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships, during the pendency of the proposed transaction that could affect Netflix's or WBD's financial performance; (xiv) restrictions during the pendency of the proposed transaction that may impact Netflix's or WBD's ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions; (xv) failure to receive the approval of the stockholders of WBD; (xvi) the final allocation of indebtedness between WBD and Discovery Global in connection with the separation could cause a reduction to the consideration for the proposed transaction; (xvii) inherent uncertainties involved in the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial projections, and inherent uncertainties involved in the estimates and judgments used to estimate the differences between WBD's Global Linear Networks segment results and the expected results of Discovery Global; and (xviii) volatility or a decline in the market price for Discovery Global common stock following the separation. Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in Netflix's and WBD's filings with the SEC, including their Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and the Proxy Statement filed by WBD in connection with the proposed transaction. While the list of factors presented here and in the Proxy Statement are considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Netflix's or WBD's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Neither Netflix nor WBD assumes any obligation to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws.</p><p>SOURCE Netflix, Inc.</p></div></article>",

The program remains focused on extending known mineralization and further refining mine planning, setting the stage for the 2026 exploration program, which is now underway with the objective of extending mine life.</p><p>Building on these developments, the Company has commenced work to expand the existing leach pad by adding capacity for an additional 3 million tonnes of ore. In addition, detailed engineering and permitting for a new leach pad are undergoing final review. Together, these initiatives are expected to extend leaching capacity through 2033.</p><p>To support anticipated production requirements, the mobile fleet will be increased by three additional haul trucks, bringing the total fleet size to twelve during 2026. Golden Queen also replaced the stacker and the agglomeration drum, improvements that enhanced ore stacking quality. The agglomeration process improved the quality of the stacked material, while the new stacker enhanced blending and reduced fine particle segregation. These improvements are expected to result in higher solution percolation rates and reduced particle migration. The Merrill-Crowe Plant is undergoing an upgrade from a capacity of approximately 3,000 gallons per minute (GPM) to 4,000 GPM, with commissioning planned for the fourth quarter. This upgrade is expected to increase gold and silver production from the leach pad by approximately 6 to <percent>10%</percent> by directing a higher proportion of lower-grade solution to the Merrill-Crowe process and reducing the volume sent to the operating pond.</p><p><b>San Bartolome Outlook</b></p><p>In 2025, San Bartolome advanced its ore supply strategy by establishing new ore purchase agreements with local communities, supporting long-term operational stability while broadening its network of business partners. In addition, the Company finalized a long-term agreement with COMIBOL to acquire up to 7 million tonnes of oxide ore within a 250-kilometre radius of the processing facility. The first delivery of ore is anticipated by the end of 2026, increasing the diversity of feed sources over the long term and enhancing future feed strategies.</p><p>Transportation logistics at San Bartolome were notably improved in 2025, contributing to a <percent>21%</percent> increase in processing throughput compared to the previous year. Building on this progress, the focus in 2026 will be on improving processing recoveries through automation initiatives and the construction of an additional thickener, scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2027. These process improvements are expected to improve recovery rates by approximately <percent>0.5%</percent> to <percent>1.0%</percent>.</p><p><b>2026 Guidance </b></p><p>At Golden Queen, capital investment in 2026 is primarily directed toward infrastructure and mine development initiatives supporting exploration results and potential mine life extension. Planned expenditures include the expansion of the existing leach pad, detailed engineering and permitting for the construction of a new leach pad, acquisition of three additional haul trucks, deferred waste stripping, and upgrades to the Merrill-Crowe facility. These investments are intended to ensure sufficient processing capacity and operational flexibility to support anticipated future production requirements.</p><p>At San Bartolome, capital spending in 2026 is focused on processing enhancements and sustaining infrastructure. Planned capital expenditures include the construction of an additional thickener and related plant optimization initiatives designed to improve overall plant performance.</p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align: start;

It is approved for use in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), relapsed or refractory Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), and in locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma.</p><p>A Phase III study (NCT06127407) is now underway in adults (18+) with locally advanced or metastatic conventional chondrosarcoma carrying an IDH1 mutation. Eligible participants may be either treatment-naïve or have received one previous systemic therapy. Primary completion is anticipated in February 2028.</p><p><b>Inhibrx Biosciences' Ozekibart (INBRX-109)</b> is a tetravalent agonist that targets human Death Receptor 5 (DR5) to induce tumor-selective programmed cell death. Built using Inhibrx's single-domain antibody platform, it is engineered to optimize both agonistic activity and safety. DR5 is a receptor for TRAIL (Tumor Necrosis Factor–related Apoptosis-inducing Ligand). The US FDA has granted Fast Track Designation to INBRX-109 for patients with unresectable or metastatic conventional chondrosarcoma. A Phase II trial of ozekibart (NCT04950075) is currently recruiting patients with unresectable or metastatic conventional chondrosarcoma, according to ClinicalTrials.gov.</p><p>The anticipated launch of these emerging therapies are poised to transform the chondrosarcoma market landscape in the coming years.

It most commonly affects the bones of the pelvis, hip, and shoulder, but it can occur in any cartilage-bearing area of the body. Unlike some other bone cancers, chondrosarcoma typically grows slowly; however, certain aggressive forms can metastasize to other parts of the body. Symptoms often include persistent pain, swelling, or a noticeable lump near the affected bone. Treatment usually focuses on surgery to remove the tumor, as chondrosarcoma is often resistant to chemotherapy and radiation.</p><p><b>Chondrosarcoma Epidemiology Segmentation</b></p><p>The chondrosarcoma epidemiology section provides insights into the historical and current chondrosarcoma patient pool and forecasted trends for the leading markets.
