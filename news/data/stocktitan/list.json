(NASDAQ: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/AUGO/\" title=\"View AUGO stock overview\">AUGO</a>) (B3: AURA33) (“Aura” or the “Company”) </strong>announces that it has filed its audited consolidated financial statements and earnings release (together, “Financial and Operational Results”) for the period ended December 30, 2025. The full version of the Financial and Operational Results can be viewed on the Company’s website at www.auraminerals.com, on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca. or on SEC www.sec.com.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Rodrigo Barbora, Aura’s President, and CEO commented: “We are delighted to report that higher production, higher metal prices and stable costs have once again driven Aura to another set of record results. We closed 2025 with record full-year Adjusted EBITDA of US<money>$547 million</money> at an average realized gold price of <money>$3,446</money>/oz, including a standout Q4 performance of US<money>$207 million</money> at realized gold prices of <money>$4,090</money>/oz. During this transformative year, we achieved multiple major milestones: we completed construction and declared commercial production at Borborema under budget and on schedule, delivered record-high production together with record quarterly, closed the strategic acquisition of MSG in December, successfully listed on Nasdaq — now enjoying strong liquidity with average daily traded volume of almost US<money>$100 million</money> — and were included in 58 different ETFs during the last three months. We also recently announced initial groundwork construction at our Era Dorada project and obtained the license to relocate the road at Borborema, with a potential to double its reserves.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Looking ahead to 2026, we project production to grow to 360,000–390,000 GEO while we still prepare MSG and Apoena for higher output, pursue opportunities to increase capacity at Borborema, advance underground development and expand capacity at Almas, continue exploration and studies to grow Matupá’s Resources &amp; Reserves, and progress our drill campaign in Carajás. Yet, we are just in the beginning. Throughout 2025 and recent months, Aura has taken decisive steps toward our forecast of exceeding 600,000 GEO per year, while we continue to identify and pursue opportunities to go even further.”</p> <p><strong>Operational &amp;

(2) MSG was acquired in December 2025, at which date the Company obtained control.</sup></p> <p align=\"justify\">Total production in Q4 2025 reached 82,067 gold equivalent ounces (“GEO”), <percent>11%</percent> higher than Q3 2025 and <percent>23%</percent> higher when compared to Q4 2024 at current metal prices, mainly due to negative impact from the copper-to-GEO conversion at Aranzazu. At constant prices, Aura’s quarterly production was record high, increasing by <percent>12%</percent> compared to Q3 2025 and <percent>29%</percent> above Q4 2024. When compared to the last quarter, the result was mainly attributable to stronger operational performance driven by higher ore processed volumes and improved grades at Almas, the production increase of Borborema and the inclusion of MSG in December.</p> <p align=\"justify\">In 2025, production reached 280,414 GEO, representing a <percent>5%</percent> increase in current metal prices. At constant 2024 prices — which neutralize the effect of copper price fluctuations in the GEO conversion at Aranzazu — production was of 292,536 an increase of <percent>9%</percent> over the 267,232 GEO produced in 2024, also due to Borborema production, Almas improvements and the additional of MSG. At 2025 Production Guidance Prices and excluding MSG, the 2025 production was 285,380 GEO, ending the year achieving the upper half of the Company’s 2025 Production Guidance (266k GEO – 300k GEO).</p> <p><strong>2.2.

Excluding this impact of MSG and at constant 2024 metal prices, Aura’s Cash Cost was US<money>$1,036</money>/GEO, reflecting a <percent>6%</percent> decrease compared to Q4 2024 and <percent>2%</percent> decrease compared to Q3 2025. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, this improvement was mainly driven by operational enhancements at Almas and Borborema, supported by higher grades and higher recovery rates, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, increase in production at Almas and the additional of Borborema, which had a lower-than-average cash cost profile, contributed to the reduction.</p> <p align=\"justify\">In 2025, Cash Cost averaged US<money>$1,136</money>/GEO, representing a <percent>9%</percent> increase, primarily driven by lower grades and a higher waste-to-ore ratio at Almas and Apoena, as well as the impact of copper-to-GEO conversion at Aranzazu. At constant 2024 metal prices and excluding MSG, Cash Cost in 2025 averaged US<money>$1,054</money>/GEO, in line with 2024 which was US<money>$1,041</money>/GEO. Cash Cost also adversely affected by lower stacking volumes at Minosa, resulting from higher rainfall in 2025 compared to 2024, which followed an unusually dry rainy season in Minosa during 2024, and Apoena, which is going under an investment phase. These negative impacts were offset by the addition of Borborema with its lower-than-average cash cost profile.</p> <p align=\"justify\">In Q4 2025, consolidated All-in Sustaining Cost (AISC) at current metal prices totaled US<money>$1,521</money>/GEO, representing a <percent>9%</percent> increase compared to Q4 2024, while at Q4 2024 metal prices and excluding MSG would have been down <percent>2%</percent> mainly due to higher sales volume from Almas and the addition from Borborema; these business units have the lower AISC of Aura’s portfolio of mines in production. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, AISC increased by <percent>8%</percent> compared to Q3 2025 at current prices and <percent>2%</percent> at constant prices ex-MSG, reflecting as flat sales were offset by temporary <percent>18%</percent> increase in capex and <percent>28%</percent> higher G&amp;A, which were partially mitigated by higher production from Borborema.</p> <p align=\"justify\">In 2025, AISC reached US<money>$1,458</money>/GEO, an increase of <percent>10%</percent> when compared to 2024 at current prices and <percent>2%</percent> increase in constant prices and excluding MSG for the same reasons discussed above. At Guidance Prices and excluding MSG, Aura’s AISC was US<money>$1,368</money>/GEO, in line with the bottom end of the Company’s guidance range of US<money>$1,374</money>/GEO to US<money>$1,492</money>/GEO.</p> <p><strong>2.4.

In 2025, Projects were significantly lower compared to 2024, which counted for US<money>$6.4 million</money> of Exploration expenses. In Matupá, efforts were focused on expanding reserves in regions close to X1, Pé Quente and other strategic areas. In Carajás, exploration work successfully confirmed copper mineralization, expanding the mineral potential of the region.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Other expenses primarily comprise provisions recognized to reflect the estimated partial non-recoverability of VAT credits related to Minosa (<money>$8,250)</money> and the expected discount on the sale of VAT (ICMS) credits from Apoena (<money>$1,922)</money> and other non-recurring expenses.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The Company thus ended Q4 2025 with Operating Income of US<money>$165.1 million</money>, compared to an Operating Income of US<money>$67.1 million</money> in Q4 2024, also higher compared to the Operating Income of Q3 2025 of US<money>$136.9 million</money>, which reflects a positive result of higher gross profit. In 2025, the Operating Income was US<money>$458.9 million</money>, <percent>125%</percent> increase compared to 2024.

The Company’s increase in production, while maintaining disciplined cost control, enabled it to fully capture the benefit of rising metal prices. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled compared to Q4 2024 and grew <percent>37%</percent> over Q3 2025.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by higher production, strong cost control and higher gold and copper prices, as discussed previously. This result was also noted on the Adjusted EBITDA margin gain of 18 p.p. compared to Q4 2024, supported by stronger metal prices but also by a <percent>16%</percent> increase in sales volume.</p> <p align=\"justify\">In 2025, Adjusted EBITDA reached a record high of US<money>$547.8 million</money>, more than doubling year-over-year, representing a <percent>105%</percent> increase compared to 2024. This strong performance was driven by higher production volumes, mainly supported by Borborema and MSG, which together added 33,334 GEO to the annual production, as well as a <percent>5%</percent> increase in production at Almas versus 2024. Supported by operating leverage and disciplined cost management, the Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to <percent>59%</percent>, compared to <percent>45%</percent> in 2024.</p> <p><strong>2.7.

Silver Price = US<money>$56.86</money>/oz and Molybdenum Price = US<money>$22.12</money>/oz.</sup></p> <p align=\"justify\">At Aranzazu, production reached 18,878 GEO, representing a <percent>12%</percent> decrease compared to the previous quarter and <percent>19%</percent> over the Q4 2024, resulting mainly from metal prices since higher gold prices negatively impact the conversion to GEO. At constant prices, Aranzazu production was <percent>7%</percent> lower when compared to Q3 2025 as well as compared to Q4 2024, due to slightly lower grades of copper, silver and gold, due to mine sequencing and according to the Company’s plan. In 2025, total production decreased by <percent>15%</percent> compared to the previous year at current prices, in line with the negative impact of the metals price conversion. At constant 2024 metal prices, Aranzazu produced 100,031 GEO, <percent>3%</percent> above the previous year, mainly due to higher grades and commercial molybdenum production. At 2025 Guidance Prices, Aranzazu ended 2025 with a production of 92,569 GEO, in line with the Guidance range.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Aranzazu’s Net Revenue in Q4 2025 was US<money>$66.5 million</money>, <percent>1%</percent> lower compared to Q3 2025 and up <percent>26%</percent> compared to Q4 2024, primarily driven by higher metal prices. Average sales prices rose quarter-over-quarter, with copper increasing <percent>14%</percent>, gold <percent>21%</percent>, silver <percent>42%</percent>. For 2025, Aranzazu’s Net Revenue reached US<money>$246.4 million</money>, a <percent>25%</percent> increase over 2024, also attributed to elevated metal prices.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Cash Cost was US<money>$1,228</money>/GEO for the quarter, <percent>8%</percent> higher than Q3 2025 and <percent>25%</percent> higher than Q4 2024, mainly due to GEO conversion and also lower grades and recovery. In 2025, Cash Cost increased by <percent>20%</percent>, with a total of US<money>$1,156</money>/GEO, primarily impacted by the effect of metal prices in the conversion to GEO, what was partially offset by higher grades and recovery rates.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Aranzazu’s AISC was US<money>$1,732</money> in the quarter, up <percent>15%</percent> from Q3 2025 and up <percent>21%</percent> from Q4 2024, primarily due to variations in metal prices. At constant Q4 2024 metal prices, AISC was US<money>$1,478</money>/GEO, and increase of <percent>3%</percent> over Q4 2024, mainly because of slightly lower grades of copper, silver and gold.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Aranzazu’s Adjusted EBITDA was US<money>$41.0 million</money> in Q4 2025, reflecting a <percent>3%</percent> increase from Q3 2025 and a <percent>65%</percent> compared to Q4 2024, driven by robust Net Revenue growth from higher metal prices compared to 2024. For 2025, Adjusted EBITDA totaled US<money>$140.9 million</money>, up <percent>55%</percent> from 2024, propelled by the increase in Net Revenue, primarily from elevated metal prices, which more than offset the sales volume decline.</p> <p><strong>3.2 Apoena</strong></p> <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

Compared with Q4 2024, production increased <percent>26%</percent>, primarily because of higher recovery rates, with <percent>4%</percent> increase, and higher grades, from 0.70 g/ton to 0.79 g/ton. In 2025, production was of 35,304 GEO, a decrease of <percent>5%</percent> when compared to 2024, attributable mainly to lower grades and lower ore mined as expected. Considering the full year of 2025, Apoena exceeded the Company’s expectations by delivering higher grades and improved productivity, achieving a recovery rate of <percent>94%</percent>, which drove the mine to finish 2025 above the upper end of the Guidance range, which was 32,000 GEO.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Apoena’s Net Revenue totaled US<money>$36.1 million</money> for Q4 2025, <percent>16%</percent> higher than Q3 2025 and <percent>39%</percent> above the Q4 2024, driven primarily by higher gold prices.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The Cash Cost was US<money>$1,450</money>/GEO for the quarter, down <percent>19%</percent> from Q4 2024, primarily driven by improved recovery rates and higher grades. Compared to Q3 2025, the Cash Cost was up <percent>34%</percent>, mainly due to a higher waste-to-ore ratio which increased to 12.50 tonnes, combined with <percent>29%</percent> lower ore mined volumes. For 2025, Cash Cost increased <percent>4%</percent> to US<money>$1,232</money>/GEO, below Company’s annual Guidance, primarily due to lower grades, consistent with expected mine sequencing. In Q4 2025, Apoena’s AISC was US<money>$2,427</money>/GEO, <percent>3%</percent> lower than Q4 2024, due to the lower G&amp;A and decreased lease expenses. Compared to Q3 2025, AISC increased <percent>36%</percent> due to higher maintenance costs, impacted by plant maintenance in December, representing an increase in COGS. For 2025, AISC ended with US<money>$ 2,007</money>/GEO, <percent>9%</percent> higher than 2024, due to <percent>181%</percent> higher CAPEX due to higher exploration near mine, tailing dams investments and machinery equipment. When compared to Apoena’s AISC Guidance, this result was <percent>18%</percent> below the lower range which was US<money>$2,425</money>/GEO to US<money>$2,619</money>/GEO.</p> <p align=\"justify\">In Q4 2025 compared to Q4 2024, Adjusted EBITDA increased significantly, mainly driven by higher production levels, improved cost performance and stronger gold prices. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, despite slightly lower production and sales volumes and higher costs, the positive impact of higher gold prices more than offset these pressures, supporting an increase in Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. In Q4 2025 versus Q4 2024, EBITDA rose by <percent>255%</percent>, explained by the increase in production, gold prices and lower cash costs. On a full-year basis, EBITDA more than doubled in 2025 compared to 2024, primarily driven by higher gold prices, which more than offset the impact of lower production and sales volumes and higher cost levels during the period.</p> <p><strong>3.3 Minosa</strong></p> <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

These savings were more than offset by the increase in CAPEX, which rose from US<money>$ 0.99</money>9 million to US<money>$ 2.25</money>3 million due to investments in leach pad phases expansion and infrastructure, in the context of a <percent>12%</percent> reduction in sales volumes. Compared to Q3 2025, AISC decreased <percent>8%</percent>, primarily due to lower COGS of <percent>11%</percent> due to lower unitary mine costs and higher grades. For 2025, AISC was US<money>$1,297</money>/GEO, an <percent>8%</percent> increase over 2024, reflecting the combined impact of lower sales of <percent>11%</percent>, due to lower ore plant feed, and increase in Capex, due to improvements in pilling infrastructure.</p> <p align=\"justify\">In Q4 2025, Minosa’s Adjusted EBITDA reached US<money>$47.9 million</money>, up <percent>35%</percent> from Q3 2025 and <percent>103%</percent> from Q4 2024, driven by higher gold prices, despite reduced production from lower stacking volumes due to increased rainfall and higher CAPEX year-over-year. For 2025, Adjusted EBITDA was US<money>$144.0 million</money>, a <percent>73%</percent> increase from 2024, supported by elevated gold prices and higher grades, partially offset by higher CAPEX.</p> <p><strong>3.4 Almas</strong></p> <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

These changes increased the plant’s ore processing capacity from 2.0 to 2.2 million tonnes per year. However, the full benefits will not be realized in 2026 due to lower ore grades from mine sequencing. In parallel, the Company has started developing the underground project, which—combined with additional expansion capacity this year—should drive further production increases starting in 2027.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\"><strong>Borborema: </strong>With ramp-up finalized in Q4 2025, Borborema is expected to reach between 65k and 77k GEO in 2026. This guidance reflects the expected increase in Mineral Reserves driven by higher gold prices, which in turn reduces average grades compared to the original feasibility study. As a result, the Company has adjusted its mine sequencing and ore segmentation strategy to incorporate these lower-grade ores, prioritizing overall project economics and the long-term value generated by the mine</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt; text-align:justify;\"><strong>MSG:</strong> This year's focus is on turnaround, efficiency gains, and revisions to the mine plan and methods. This will demand greater attention to equipment maintenance and underground development. Nonetheless, aligned with our operational enhancement plan emphasizing cost optimization, we guide MSG production to 50,000–60,000 GEO in 2026.

Since acquiring the project, we recognized its substantial upside potential — exactly why we designed and built a fully expandable plant from the outset. With the updated reserve now at 1.5 million ounces — <percent>82%</percent> larger than our previous feasibility study — we are immediately advancing engineering and water-access solutions to increase capacity, while progressing the road relocation. Borborema perfectly demonstrates our strategy: start production as quickly as possible, generate positive cash flow in a de-risked environment, and then unlock further upside. Looking ahead, we continue to explore additional opportunities, including a review of the mine plan with new cut-off grades based on higher gold prices, which should further improve our reserves. A new Resources &amp; Reserves report is expected by the end of Q1, concurrent with the publication of our 20F. We remain committed to executing the project responsibly and in full alignment with our Aura 360° Mining philosophy.\"</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Updated Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates </strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">The updated resource block model gold grade was modelled by SRK using Ordinary Kriging (OK) methodology constrained within nested grade shells at 0.2 g/t, 0.5 g/t, and 1.0 g/t indicatory grade shells.</p> <p align=\"justify\">SRK used a nested, soft-boundary grade shell technique with shells at 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 g/t Au to limit the influence of variable Au grades in the broader mineralized volume which displays general lower grade attributes. Raw drilling data was composted to 2 m lengths with upper capping applied at 20 g/t Au. Kriging neighborhoods and variography were determined for each nested grade shell. The Feasibility Study block model showed acceptable validation against composited and raw data with acceptable smoothing and is considered suitable for use in reporting of Mineral Resources.</p> <p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Longitudinal View of Au Grade Shells, Viewing West (Source: SRK)\" data-caption=\"Longitudinal View of Au Grade Shells, Viewing West (Source: SRK)\" data-dpi=\"150\" data-filename=\"Aura_Figure_1.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/ea6c6f86-614e-4249-83f2-4092fe0bbce7/aura-figure-1.jpg\"/><br/></p> <p align=\"center\"><em>Longitudinal View of Au Grade Shells, Viewing West (Source: SRK)</em></p> <p align=\"justify\">SRK utilized an oxidation boundary surface constructed in 2012 by Crusader (Cascar) to discriminate oxide from sulfide mineralization as the logging data was considered too variable and of lower confidence to construct this surface. The oxidation model is utilized to code bulk density as well.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Mineral Resources are classified in accordance with S-K 1300 definitions into Indicated and Inferred categories based on identified uncertainty and risks.</p> <p align=\"justify\">In order to establish reasonable prospects for economic extraction (RPEE) as per S-K 1300 definitions of Mineral Resources, SRK applied an economic cut-off grade (CoG) to blocks constrained within an economic pit shell on the Borborema property. This shell utilizes a 1.0 revenue factor, 37-degree slope on the west and 60-degree slope on the east, 2 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) mining rate, and <percent>5%</percent> discount rate.

These Mineral Reserves are defined within detailed engineered pit designs and life-of-mine (LOM) plans that are based on the optimized pit shells. Mineral Reserves within these engineered pit designs were calculated using cut-off grades (COG) specific to each rock type, considering a gold price of US<money>$ 1,472</money>/oz with an exchange rate of R<money>$ 5.2</money>/US<money>$ 1.0</money>, with refining costs included. The Mineral Reserves are contained within two pits. A high-voltage transmission line (HVTL) limits the pit expansion to the north. However, the previously constraining paved highway (BR-226), as indicated in the prior Technical Report (TR), no longer restricts the pit to the south.

The 20 year and 5 months LOM is planned for open pit mining.</p> <p align=\"justify\">The proposed mining operations will employ hydraulic excavators and a fleet of haul trucks with conventional open-pit methods. Excavated material will be loaded into trucks and transported either the Run of Mine (ROM) pad, the low-grade stockpile, oxide ore stockpile or the Waste Rock Storage Facilities (WRSF). Weathered material is considered to be free dig with transitional material to be lightly blasted to loosen it for digging. Fresh rock will be typically blasted on 5 m benches for ore domain and 10 m benches for the waste domain.

The Company's six operating assets include Minosa gold mine in Honduras; Almas, Apoena, Borborema and MSG gold mines in Brazil; and Aranzazu, a copper, gold, and silver mine in Mexico. Additionally, the Company owns Era Dorada, a gold project in Guatemala; Tolda Fria, a gold project in Colombia; and three projects in Brazil: Matupá, which is under development; São Francisco, which is in care and maintenance; and the Carajás copper project in the Carajás region, in the exploration phase.</p> <p align=\"left\">Rodrigo Barbosa<br/>President &amp; CEO<br/>305-239-9332</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Caution Regarding Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates</strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">The figures for mineral resources and reserves contained herein are estimates only and no assurance can be given that the anticipated tonnages and grades will be achieved, that the indicated level of recovery will be realized or that the mineral resources and reserves could be mined or processed profitably. Actual reserves, if any, may not conform to geological, metallurgical or other expectations, and the volume and grade of ore recovered may be below the estimated levels. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral resources and reserves, including many factors beyond the Company’s control. Such estimation is a subjective process, and the accuracy of any reserve or resource estimate is a function of the quantity and quality of available data and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and geological interpretation. Short-term operating factors relating to the mineral resources and reserves, such as the need for orderly development of the ore bodies or the processing of new or different ore grades, may cause the mining operation to be unprofitable in any particular accounting period. In addition, there can be no assurance that metal recoveries in small scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in larger scale tests under on-site conditions or during production. Lower market prices, increased production costs, the presence of deleterious elements, reduced recovery rates and other factors may result in revision of its resource and reserve estimates from time to time or may render the Company’s resources and reserves uneconomic to exploit. Resource and reserve data is not indicative of future results of operations. If the Company’s actual mineral resources and reserves are less than current estimates or if the Company fails to develop its resource base through the realization of identified mineralized potential, its results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.</p> <p align=\"justify\">All forward-looking statements herein are qualified by this cautionary statement. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. If the Company does update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that it will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Forward-Looking Information </strong></p> <p align=\"justify\">This press release contains “forward-looking information” and “forward-looking statements”, as defined in applicable securities laws (collectively, “forward-looking statements”) which include, without limitation, mineral resources and mineral reserve estimates and the economic analysis resulting from the Feasibility Study (including NPV, IRR and payback periods); expected production from, and the further potential of the Company’s properties; the ability of the Company to achieve its longer-term outlook; the amount of future production over any period and LOM, capital expenditure, AISC and mine production costs, the Company’s target leverage ratio for the Project; and the completion of the conversion of Dundee’s equity interest in the Project into a net smelter returns royalty.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s ability to predict or control, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements if such risks, uncertainties or factors materialize. The Company has made numerous assumptions with respect to forward-looking information contain herein, including among other things, assumptions from the Feasibility Study, which may include assumptions on gold prices and exchange rates, which could also cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements if such assumptions prove wrong. Specific reference is made to the Company’s most recent AIF on file with certain Canadian provincial securities regulatory authorities and the Technical Reports for a discussion of some of the risk factors underlying forward-looking statements, which include, without limitation the ability of the Company to achieve its longer-term outlook and the anticipated timing and results thereof, the ability to lower costs and increase production, the ability of the Company to successfully achieve business objectives, copper and gold or certain other commodity price volatility, changes in debt and equity markets, the uncertainties involved in interpreting geological data, increases in costs, environmental compliance and changes in environmental legislation and regulation, interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations, general economic conditions and other risks involved in the mineral exploration and development industry.

This interim readout of Achieve 1 represents a major milestone in Caris' goal to detect cancer earlier, when it is most treatable, through Whole Genome Sequencing, advanced AI and molecular insights.</p><div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1\"><p><a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/830740/Caris_Life_Sciences_Logo.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Caris Life Sciences Logo (PRNewsfoto/Caris Life Sciences)\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/830740/Caris_Life_Sciences_Logo.jpg\" title=\"Caris Life Sciences Logo (PRNewsfoto/Caris Life Sciences)\"/></a></p></div><p>Caris Detect leverages Caris' industry-leading molecular profiling data, which has surpassed one million cases processed and produced more than 50 billion molecular markers. This deep molecular foundation enables Caris' AI models to identify subtle biological signals associated with early-stage cancers with unprecedented resolution. </p><p>Achieve 1 is evaluating Caris Detect across a broad population of patients, assessing its ability to detect multiple cancer types at early stages using a blood draw. For the undiagnosed cohort, which consisted of 1,505 samples, we utilized blood draws from subjects who had screening or symptomatic screening, a population reflecting a higher likelihood of cancer than the general population. We followed <percent>22.5%</percent> of the subjects for approximately one year following their blood draw. Of these, 121 subjects had no symptoms of cancer, no significant risk factors of cancer and were not subsequently diagnosed with cancer, representing a healthy population.</p><p>The first phase of Achieve 1 utilized a cross-validation approach, with approximately 865 samples held out for a blinded validation that is in process. Caris expects to report those results later in the first quarter of 2026.</p><p>Study highlights and key performance data from the interim readout include:</p><ul

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p> <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.sk.sasoon\">SASKATOON, Saskatchewan</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nutrien Ltd. (TSX and NYSE: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/NTR/\" title=\"View NTR stock overview\">NTR</a>) announced today that the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) has accepted Nutrien's notice to commence a normal course issuer bid (NCIB) to purchase outstanding common shares representing up to five percent of its issued and outstanding common shares.</p><p>Under the NCIB, purchases of common shares may be made through the facilities of the TSX, the New York Stock Exchange and/or alternative trading systems in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location> and the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location>, or as otherwise permitted under applicable securities laws. The actual number of common shares that may be purchased under the NCIB and the timing of any such purchases will be determined by Nutrien. Nutrien believes that purchasing its own common shares represents an attractive investment opportunity, is in the best interests of the company and is consistent with Nutrien's objective of returning capital to shareholders over time. As of February 17, 2026, Nutrien had 481,141,322 common shares outstanding and, therefore, is permitted to repurchase up to 24,057,066 of its outstanding common shares pursuant to the NCIB. Common shares purchased under the NCIB will be cancelled.</p><p>The NCIB will be effected in accordance with the TSX normal course issuer bid rules and/or Rule 10b-18 under the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which contain restrictions on the number of common shares that may be purchased on a single day, subject to certain exceptions for block purchases, based on the average daily trading volumes of Nutrien's common shares on the applicable exchange. Subject to exceptions for block purchases, Nutrien will limit daily purchases of common shares on the TSX in connection with the NCIB to no more than twenty-five percent (430,107 common shares) of the average daily trading volume of the common shares on the TSX for the six-month period from August 1, 2025 to January 31, 2026 (1,720,429 common shares) during any trading day. Purchases under the NCIB will be made through open market purchases at market price, as well as by other means as may be permitted under applicable securities laws, including private agreements.

Reaching a combined monthly audience of approximately 170 million listeners, SiriusXM offers a broad range of content for listeners everywhere they tune in with a diverse mix of live, on-demand, and curated programming across music, talk, news, and sports.</p><p><b>Forward-Looking Statements</b></p><p>This communication contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the senior notes offering and the Concurrent Tender Offer and the intended use of proceeds from the senior notes offering. Such forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements.</p><p>The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and the timing of events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: <i>Risks Relating to our Business and Operations:</i> We face substantial competition, and that competition has increased over time; our SiriusXM service has suffered a loss of subscribers, and our Pandora ad-supported service has similarly experienced a loss of monthly active users; if our efforts to attract and retain subscribers and listeners, or convert listeners into subscribers, are not successful, our business will be adversely affected; we engage in extensive marketing efforts and the continued effectiveness of those efforts is an important part of our business; we rely on third parties for the operation of our business, and the failure of third parties to perform could adversely affect our business; failure to successfully monetize and generate revenues from podcasts and other non-music content could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition; we may not realize the benefits of acquisitions or other strategic investments and initiatives; and the impact of economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. <i>Risks Relating to our SiriusXM Business: </i>Changing consumer behavior and new technologies relating to our satellite radio business may reduce our subscribers and may cause our subscribers to purchase fewer services from us or to cancel our services altogether, resulting in less revenue to us; a substantial number of our SiriusXM service subscribers periodically cancel their subscriptions and we cannot predict how successful we will be at retaining customers; our ability to profitably attract and retain subscribers to our SiriusXM service is uncertain; our business depends in part upon the auto industry; failure of our satellites would significantly damage our business; and our SiriusXM service may experience harmful interference from wireless operations. <i>Risks Relating to our Pandora and Off-platform Business: </i>Our Pandora and Off-platform business generates a significant portion of its revenues from advertising, and reduced spending by advertisers could harm our business; emerging industry trends may adversely impact our ability to generate revenue from advertising; our failure to convince advertisers of the benefits of our Pandora ad-supported service could harm our business; if we are unable to maintain our advertising revenue, our results of operations will be adversely affected; changes to mobile operating systems and browsers may hinder our ability to sell advertising and market our services; and if we fail to accurately predict and play music, comedy or other content that our Pandora listeners enjoy, we may fail to retain existing and attract new listeners. <i>Risks Relating to Laws and Governmental Regulations: </i>Privacy and data security laws and regulations may hinder our ability to market our services, sell advertising and impose legal liabilities; consumer protection laws and our failure to comply with them could damage our business; failure to comply with FCC requirements could damage our business; we may face lawsuits, incur liability or suffer reputational harm as a result of content published or made available through our services; and increasing interest and expectations regarding sustainable business practices by our various stakeholders and related reporting obligations may expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects. <i>Risks Associated with Data and Cybersecurity and the Protection of Consumer Information:</i> If we fail to protect the security of personal information about our customers, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our reputation could suffer; we use artificial intelligence in our business, and challenges with properly managing its use could result in reputational harm, competitive harm, and legal liability and adversely affect our results of operations; and interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business. <i>Risks Associated with Certain Intellectual Property Rights: </i>Rapid technological and industry changes and new entrants could adversely impact our services; the market for music rights is changing and is subject to significant uncertainties; our Pandora services depend upon maintaining complex licenses with copyright owners, and these licenses contain onerous terms; failure to protect our intellectual property or actions by third parties to enforce their intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and operating results; and some of our services and technologies use \"open source\" software, which may restrict how we use or distribute our services or require that we release the source code subject to those licenses. <i>Risks Related to our Capital Structure:</i> While we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock, we may change our dividend policy at any time; our holding company structure could restrict access to funds of our subsidiaries that may be needed to pay third party obligations; we have significant indebtedness, and our subsidiaries' debt contains certain covenants that restrict their operations; and our ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund our operations could be limited, which could negatively impact our operations. <i>Other Operational Risks:</i> If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business could be harmed; our facilities could be damaged by natural catastrophes or terrorist activities; the unfavorable outcome of pending or future litigation could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial condition; we may be exposed to liabilities that other entertainment service providers would not customarily be subject to; and our business and prospects depend on the strength of our brands.</p><p>Additional factors that could cause material differences from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025, which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") and available at the SEC's Internet site (<a href=\"http://www.sec.gov\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://www.sec.gov</a>).

Netflix had earlier received notice from Warner Bros. Discovery (<a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/WBD/\" title=\"View WBD stock overview\">WBD</a>) that its Board of Directors has determined Paramount Skydance's (<a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/PSKY/\" title=\"View PSKY stock overview\">PSKY</a>) latest proposal constitutes a \"Superior Proposal\" under the terms of <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/WBD/\" title=\"View WBD stock overview\">WBD</a>'s existing merger agreement with Netflix. Netflix issued the following statement in response from co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters:</p><div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1\"><p><a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/133154/netflix__inc__logo.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Netflix, Inc.

(PRNewsfoto/Netflix, Inc.)\"/></a></p></div><p>The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval. However, we've always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance's latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.</p><p>Warner Bros. is a world-class organization, and we want to thank David Zaslav, Gunnar Wiedenfels, Bruce Campbell, Brad Singer and the <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/WBD/\" title=\"View WBD stock overview\">WBD</a> Board for running a fair and rigorous process. We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.' iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the U.S.  But this transaction was always a 'nice to have' at the right price, not a 'must have' at any price.</p><p>Netflix's business is healthy, strong and growing organically, powered by our slate and best-in-class streaming service. This year, we'll invest approximately <money><money>$20 billion</money></money> in quality films and series and will expand our entertaining offering. Consistent with our capital allocation policy, we'll also resume our share repurchase program.</p><p>We will continue to do what we've done for more than 20 years as a public company: delight our members, profitably grow our business, and drive long-term shareholder value.</p><p><b>About Netflix</b></p><p>Netflix is one of the world's leading entertainment services offering TV series, films, games and live programming across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.</p><p><b>Important Information and Where to Find It</b></p><p>In connection with the proposed transaction between Netflix and WBD, WBD filed a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A (the \"Proxy Statement\") with the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").

Information about WBD's directors and executive officers is set forth in WBD's proxy statement for its 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on April 23, 2025, WBD's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and any subsequent filings with the SEC.

Free copies of these documents may be obtained as described above.</p><p><b>Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements</b></p><p>This document contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements are based on Netflix's and WBD's current expectations, estimates and projections about the expected date of closing of the proposed transaction and the potential benefits thereof, their respective businesses and industries, management's beliefs and certain assumptions made by Netflix and WBD, all of which are subject to change. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"could,\" \"seek,\" \"see,\" \"will,\" \"may,\" \"would,\" \"might,\" \"potentially,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\" \"expect,\" \"target,\" similar expressions or the negatives of these words or other comparable terminology that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes. All forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control and are not guarantees of future results, such as statements about the consummation of the proposed transaction and the anticipated benefits thereof. These and other forward-looking statements, including the failure to consummate the proposed transaction or to make or take any filing or other action required to consummate the transaction on a timely matter or at all, are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (i) the completion of the proposed transaction on anticipated terms and timing, including obtaining stockholder and regulatory approvals, completing the separation of WBD's Discovery Global business (\"Discovery Global\") and Warner Bros. business, anticipated tax treatment, unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, future prospects, business and management strategies, expansion and growth of WBD's and Netflix's businesses and other conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction; (ii) failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction, including as a result of delay in completing the transaction or integrating the businesses of Netflix and WBD; (iii) Netflix's and WBD's ability to implement their business strategies; (iv) consumer viewing trends; (v) potential litigation relating to the proposed transaction that could be instituted against Netflix, WBD or their respective directors; (vi) the risk that disruptions from the proposed transaction will harm Netflix's or WBD's business, including current plans and operations; (vii) the ability of Netflix or WBD to retain and hire key personnel; (viii) potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement, pendency or completion of the proposed transaction; (ix) uncertainty as to the long-term value of Netflix's common stock; (x) legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting Netflix's and WBD's businesses; (xi) general economic and market developments and conditions; (xii) the evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes under which Netflix and WBD operate; (xiii) potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships, during the pendency of the proposed transaction that could affect Netflix's or WBD's financial performance; (xiv) restrictions during the pendency of the proposed transaction that may impact Netflix's or WBD's ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions; (xv) failure to receive the approval of the stockholders of WBD; (xvi) the final allocation of indebtedness between WBD and Discovery Global in connection with the separation could cause a reduction to the consideration for the proposed transaction; (xvii) inherent uncertainties involved in the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial projections, and inherent uncertainties involved in the estimates and judgments used to estimate the differences between WBD's Global Linear Networks segment results and the expected results of Discovery Global; and (xviii) volatility or a decline in the market price for Discovery Global common stock following the separation. Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in Netflix's and WBD's filings with the SEC, including their Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and the Proxy Statement filed by WBD in connection with the proposed transaction. While the list of factors presented here and in the Proxy Statement are considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Netflix's or WBD's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Neither Netflix nor WBD assumes any obligation to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws.</p><p>SOURCE Netflix, Inc.</p></div></article>",
