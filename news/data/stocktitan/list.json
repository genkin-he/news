(OTC: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/RNWF/\" title=\"View RNWF stock overview\">RNWF</a>) (“RNWF”, “American Fusion” or the “Company”), provides the following update regarding its pending civil action in King County Superior Court (Case No. 25-2-32689-6).</p> <p>On February 26, 2026, the Court entered an order dismissing all claims against Justin Costello pursuant to Civil Rule 41. Because Mr. Costello is no longer a party to the action, the Court struck his Emergency Motion for Stay of All Proceedings.</p> <p>The Court separately entered an order striking the Company’s Motion for Entry of Default Judgment against the remaining corporate defendants on procedural grounds related solely to citation formatting requirements under Civil Rule 7 and King County Local Civil Rules.</p> <p>Importantly:</p> <p><strong>• </strong>Defaults entered against the corporate defendants remain in place.</p> <p><strong>• </strong>The Court did not question service, default, rescission, or the evidentiary record.</p> <p><strong>• </strong>The ruling was procedural and did not address the merits of the Company’s claims.</p> <p>The underlying action seeks rescission of two 2021 asset purchase agreements and cancellation of approximately 1,683,000,000 shares issued in connection with those transactions for which the Company contends no consideration was received.</p> <p>The Company is in the process of refiling a corrected motion that complies with the Court’s procedural directives. The Company believes this to be last remaing material item outstanding to effect the Corporate action with FINRA for the Name Change and Voluntry Symbol Change.</p> <p>Management is aware of commentary circulating online and emphasizes that the Court’s orders do not constitute a ruling against the Company on the substance of its claims.</p> <p>The Company remains committed to resolving the disputed share issuances through the judicial process.</p> <p>For more information about Kepler Fusion Technologies and its Texatron™ platform, please visit: <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mKMwWtXKsF0usaUuNwguZZlXhWF0Wp6TMD78uvsJ_SUah0YXfRXv1rYHtxSluRlBq5MiR3EeuEJc5koUlN5LYMkCVSB0FH-YoVav8x2VC5g=\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.keplerfusion.com</a> and <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-VdubZnTy8gkmACkW4kKTy-IxOzpATih6SkBZrPFBFhCvAosD4Fe33i1oZ1EQYsYUZy1E4RZ_8jkCJieWMQDIQSmkBA0p7gL7LNRttTFdTURilmtRbnzQbC4HV2wm9iI\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">americanfusionenergy.com</a></p> <p><strong>About Renewal Fuels, Inc. and American Fusion</strong></p> <p>Renewal Fuels, Inc.

(Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/UCTT/\" title=\"View UCTT stock overview\">UCTT</a>) today announced the pricing of its offering of <money><money>$525.0 million</money></money> aggregate principal amount of <percent>0.00%</percent> convertible senior notes due 2031 (the \"notes\") in a private offering to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). The offering size was increased from the previously announced offering size of <money><money>$400.0 million</money></money> aggregate principal amount of notes. The issuance and sale of the notes are scheduled to settle on March 3, 2026, subject to customary closing conditions. Ultra Clean also granted the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a period of 13 days from, and including, the date the notes are first issued, up to an additional <money><money>$75.0 million</money></money> principal amount of notes.</p><div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1\"><p><a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/582701/Ultra_Clean_Holdings_Logo.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"(PRNewsfoto/Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc.)\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/582701/Ultra_Clean_Holdings_Logo.jpg\" title=\"(PRNewsfoto/Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc.)\"/></a></p></div><p>Ultra Clean estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately <money><money>$511.1 million</money></money> (or approximately <money><money>$584.2 million</money></money> if the initial purchasers fully exercise their option to purchase additional notes), after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. Ultra Clean intends to use the net proceeds from the offering as follows:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>approximately <money><money>$21.9 million</money></money> of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the cost of entering into the capped call transactions described below;</li><li>approximately <money><money>$40.0 million</money></money> of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase 672,608 shares of its common stock; and</li><li>the remainder for working capital, prepayment of a portion of the company's outstanding term loan under its amended and restated credit agreement or other general corporate purposes.</li></ul><p>If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, then Ultra Clean intends to use a portion of the additional net proceeds to fund the cost of entering into additional capped call transactions, as described below, and the remainder for the purposes described above.</p><p>The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Ultra Clean. The notes will not bear regular interest and the principal amount of the notes will not accrete. The notes will mature on March 15, 2031, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Before December 16, 2030, noteholders will have the right to convert their notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after December 16, 2030, noteholders may convert their notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. Ultra Clean will settle conversions in cash and, if applicable, shares of its common stock. The initial conversion rate is 11.8001 shares of common stock per <money><money>$1,000</money></money> principal amount of notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately <money><money>$84.75</money></money> per share of common stock. The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately <percent>42.5%</percent> over the last reported sale price of <money><money>$59.47</money></money> per share of Ultra Clean's common stock on February 26, 2026. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. If a \"make-whole fundamental change\" (as defined in the indenture for the notes) occurs, then Ultra Clean will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a specified period of time for holders who convert their notes in connection with that make-whole fundamental change.</p><p>The notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations), for cash at Ultra Clean's option at any time, and from time to time, on or after March 20, 2029 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of Ultra Clean's common stock exceeds <percent>130%</percent> of the conversion price for a specified period of time and certain other conditions are satisfied. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest and additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. If Ultra Clean calls any or all notes for redemption, then holders of notes called for redemption may convert their notes during the related redemption conversion period, and such conversions will also constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to the notes so converted.</p><p>If a \"fundamental change\" (as defined in the indenture for the notes) occurs, then, subject to a limited exception, noteholders may require Ultra Clean to repurchase their notes for cash. The repurchase price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest and additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date.</p><p>In connection with the pricing of the notes, Ultra Clean entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates and certain other financial institutions (the \"option counterparties\"). The capped call transactions will cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the notes, the number of shares of Ultra Clean's common stock initially underlying the notes. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Ultra Clean expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties.</p><p>The cap price of the capped call transactions will initially be <money><money>$104.07</money>25</money> per share, which represents a premium of <percent>75.0%</percent> over the last reported sale price of Ultra Clean's common stock of <money><money>$59.47</money></money> per share on February 26, 2026, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions.</p><p>The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to Ultra Clean's common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or offset any potential cash payments Ultra Clean is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, upon conversion of the notes. If, however, the market price per share of Ultra Clean's common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions.</p><p>Ultra Clean has been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Ultra Clean's common stock and/or purchase shares of Ultra Clean's common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Ultra Clean's common stock or the notes at that time.</p><p>In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Ultra Clean's common stock and/or purchasing or selling Ultra Clean's common stock or other securities of Ultra Clean in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and (x) are likely to do so during the relevant valuation period under the capped call transactions and (y) are likely to do so following any early conversion or repurchase of the notes by Ultra Clean, if Ultra Clean elects to unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions in connection with such early conversion or repurchase). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Ultra Clean's common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the number of shares of common stock and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes.</p><p>Concurrently with the pricing of the notes, Ultra Clean entered into privately negotiated transactions with or through one of the initial purchasers of the notes in this offering to use approximately <money><money>$40.0 million</money></money> of the net proceeds from the notes offering to repurchase shares of Ultra Clean's common stock at a purchase price of <money><money>$59.47</money></money> per share. These share repurchases could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Ultra Clean's common stock or the notes, and could result in a higher effective conversion price for the notes. The offering of the notes is not contingent upon the repurchase of any common stock.</p><p>The offer and sale of the notes and any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, and the notes and any such shares cannot be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, the notes or any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, nor will there be any sale of the notes or any such shares, in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, sale or solicitation would be unlawful.</p><p><b>Forward-Looking Statements</b></p><p>This press release includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the completion of the offering and the share repurchases, the expected amount and intended use of the net proceeds and the effects of entering into the capped call transactions described above. Forward-looking statements represent Ultra Clean's current expectations regarding future events and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied by the forward-looking statements. Among those risks and uncertainties are market conditions, the satisfaction of the closing conditions related to the offering and risks relating to Ultra Clean's business, including those described in periodic reports that Ultra Clean files from time to time with the SEC. Ultra Clean may not consummate the offering described in this press release and, if the offering is consummated, cannot provide any assurances regarding its ability to effectively apply the net proceeds as described above. The forward-looking statements included in this press release speak only as of the date of this press release, and Ultra Clean does not undertake to update the statements included in this press release for subsequent developments, except as may be required by law.</p><p><b>Contact</b></p><p>Rhonda Bennetto<br/>SVP Investor Relations<br/><a href=\"mailto:rbennetto@uct.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">rbennetto@uct.com</a></p><p>SOURCE Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc.</p></div></article>",

NextEra Energy Capital Holdings expects to use its general funds to fund investments in energy and power projects and for other general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of its outstanding commercial paper obligations.</p><p>Each equity unit will be issued in a stated amount of <money><money>$50</money></money>. Each equity unit will consist of a contract to purchase NextEra Energy common stock in the future, and undivided beneficial ownership interests in two series of debentures issued by NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, consisting of a Series P Debenture due March 1, 2031, and a Series Q Debenture due March 1, 2034, each with a principal amount of <money><money>$1,000</money></money>.

The higher end of this price range reflects a premium of approximately <percent>25%</percent> over the New York Stock Exchange closing price of NextEra Energy common stock on Feb. 26, 2026, which was <money><money>$91.99</money></money>. The holders of the equity units must complete the stock purchase by no later than Feb. 15, 2029, with the required purchase price of stock purchased on that date determined based on the average closing price of NextEra Energy's common stock over the 20 consecutive trading day period ending on Feb. 12, 2029. The holders may satisfy their purchase obligations with proceeds raised from remarketing the debentures that comprise part of their equity units.</p><p>Upon settlement of the purchase contract, NextEra Energy will receive cash and will issue the requisite number of shares of its common stock.

The ITC issued a Limited Exclusion Order to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Customs and Border Protection to prevent further importation of Insta360's infringing products, as well as a Cease and Desist Order to Insta360 prohibiting further importation, sale, and marketing of Insta360's infringing products. The Orders will be effective after Presidential Review.</p><p>The ITC's finding of design patent infringement comes on the heels of several decisions from the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) late last year, which upheld the validity of multiple GoPro utility patents. The PTAB rejected three separate Insta360 challenges to patents covering GoPro's ground-breaking HyperSmooth technology.<br/><br/>GoPro's intellectual property enforcement campaign, including recent positive rulings from the PTAB reaffirming the validity of GoPro's patents, reinforces the strength of GoPro's intellectual property portfolio and highlights GoPro's long-standing record of category-defining innovation, supported by more than 1,500 <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> patents.<br/><br/>\"Innovation is at the heart of everything we do at GoPro. When competitors imitate instead of innovate, we have no choice but to take action to ensure creators everywhere benefit from products built on original ideas, not imitation,\" said Nicholas Woodman, GoPro's founder and CEO. \"By protecting our intellectual property, we can keep pushing boundaries and delivering the industry-leading, breakthrough experiences customers expect from GoPro.\"</p><p><b>About GoPro, Inc.

With these new data, existing Orphan Drug designation for treating this group of patients, and FDA’s stated preference for randomized controlled trials, Mesoblast is moving from filing for accelerated approval to filing for full FDA approval next quarter. A confirmatory study would no longer be needed, if approved.</li><li style=\"margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify;\"><strong>Commercial manufacturing:</strong> scale-up work for rexlemestrocel-L is well progressed to support BLA filings for both CLBP and, in the first instance, for end-stage HFrEF patients with LVADs.</li></ul> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>FY2026 Net Revenue Guidance </strong><br/>Mesoblast anticipates full-year fiscal 2026 Ryoncil<sup>®</sup> net revenue to range between US<money>$110 million</money> and US<money>$120 million</money>.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Commentary</strong><br/>Mesoblast Chief Executive Dr. Silviu Itescu, commented on the result: “Today we report strong operational and financial performance for the first half of FY2026, a period that marks an important inflection point in Mesoblast’s evolution from clinical development to sustainable commercial execution. Sales momentum for Ryoncil<sup>®</sup> continued to build, driving meaningful revenue and reinforcing the product’s value in addressing significant unmet medical need and the strength of our commercial strategy.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Importantly, we have improved the Company’s financial position with positive cash flow generated from Ryoncil<sup>®</sup> sales, disciplined cost management, and a strategic refinancing, providing greater flexibility to support expansion and late-stage clinical programs.</p> <p align=\"justify\">As we enter the second half of FY2026, we remain focused on accelerating commercial uptake, advancing regulatory and label expansion opportunities, and maintaining financial discipline to deliver sustainable long-term shareholder value.”</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Conference Call</strong><br/>There will be a webcast today, beginning at 5.00pm EST (Thursday, February 26); 9.00am AEDT (Friday, February 27).

(“MMLC”). The Merger was accounted for as an asset acquisition in accordance with ASC 805-50, Business Combinations — Related Issues. The consideration paid to MMLC’s shareholders was less than the aggregate fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the “purchase discount”). The purchase discount was allocated to the cost of MMLC investments acquired by us on a pro-rata basis based on their relative fair values as of the closing date. Immediately following the Merger with MMLC, we marked the investments to their respective fair values and, as a result, the purchase discount allocated to the cost basis of the investments acquired was immediately recognized as unrealized appreciation on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The purchase discount allocated to the loan investments acquired will amortize over the life of each respective loan through interest income, with a corresponding adjustment recorded as unrealized appreciation on such loan acquired through its ultimate disposition. The purchase discount allocated to equity investments acquired will not amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, we will recognize a realized gain with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"bwpadl0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"></td><td class=\"bwpadl0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> </td></tr><tr><td class=\"bwpadl0 bwvertalignt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"></td><td class=\"bwvertalignt bwpadl1\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">As a supplement to our financial results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States of America</location> (“GAAP”), we have provided, as detailed below, certain non-GAAP financial measures to our operating results that exclude the aforementioned purchase discount and the ongoing amortization thereof, as determined in accordance with GAAP.
