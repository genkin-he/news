Morgan Asset Management</b>. \"As people live longer and the retirement landscape becomes more unpredictable, advisors need practical tools to help clients and participants understand and navigate retirement challenges. The Guide is a valuable resource that provides real data and meaningful guidance to support more informed financial decisions to help achieve a secure retirement.\"</p><p><b>Sharon Carson, J.P. Morgan Asset Management Retirement Strategist,</b> added, \"Social Security remains one of the most important, and often misunderstood, components of retirement planning. We continue to see that the timing of when you claim benefits can have a lasting impact on your financial security. It's critical for individuals to understand the trade-offs, debunk common myths, and consider their personal circumstances so they can make the most informed choices for their retirement.\"</p><p>Key themes from the Guide to Retirement include:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li><b>The math matters: Know your number.</b> Having a defined savings target and income replacement goal is a key driver of success. Small, consistent increases in savings rates, as little as <percent>1%</percent>, can significantly enhance retirement readiness and cover nearly nine years of Medicare-related expenses.</li><li><b>Small business, big retirement opportunities.</b> Small businesses have more options than ever to help owners and employees prepare for retirement. Access to a workplace retirement plan makes a significant difference: <percent>62%</percent> of workers with a plan have at least <money><money>$100,000</money></money> saved, compared to just <percent>5%</percent> without one. Features like auto-enrollment and auto-escalation can further boost retirement readiness for small business employees.</li><li><b>Social Security: Expectations vs. reality.</b> While many workers expect to retire at 65, the actual median retirement age is 62, often due to unforeseen circumstances. Claiming Social Security at 62 leads to a permanent reduction to <percent>70%</percent> of the full benefit, while waiting until 70 increases monthly payments by <percent>24%</percent> compared to claiming at full retirement age. These trade-offs may be complicated by misconceptions about the future of the program.</li><li><b>Tax-smart savings: Make every dollar count.</b> Choosing the right account type can help you keep more of your retirement savings. For example, diversifying across traditional and tax-free Roth accounts and being strategic about Roth conversions can provide flexibility and control over your tax bill and Medicare premiums in retirement.</li><li><b>The silent risks to retirement spending.</b> Retirement spending often faces overlooked risks, with six in ten new retirees experiencing significant spending volatility in their first three years. Households with more guaranteed income spend up to <percent>44%</percent> more in retirement, highlighting the importance of dependable income and flexible strategies to manage market volatility and unexpected health care costs that may impact long-term financial security.</li></ul><p>J.P.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><strong>All moomoo customers who requested shares received an allocation</strong></p><p align=\"left\">JERSEY CITY, N.J., Feb.  26, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=xEesp3CSUqOUUBcPu-H0m3YUJbKC8X15TuVuOOcuXiMXJRN8HMOImVYZe-8dH5PtH17PrMpol1yi0GkFfip_jA==\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">moomoo</a>, a global investment and trading platform, today announced that it was the first U.S. brokerage firm to provide retail investor access to Figure Technology Solutions Inc.’s blockchain-native share offering. The offering represents the first SEC-registered public equity issued in blockchain-native form.</p> <p>The transaction reflects moomoo’s continued focus on enabling retail participation in new issuance formats for public equity, rather than new asset classes, while maintaining compliance with applicable U.S. securities regulations. Customers participated using U.S. dollar buying power through their existing moomoo brokerage accounts, and all customers who requested shares received an allocation.* moomoo does not charge commissions on U.S.-listed equities, and there were no blockchain “gas” fees associated with FGRD subscriptions or market trading.**</p> <p>“Public equities have long depended on legacy infrastructure designed decades ago,” said Mike Cagney, co-founder and Chairman of Figure Technology Solutions. “With this offering, we’re demonstrating that equities can be issued and traded on blockchain in a fully regulated context. Working with partners like moomoo allows this innovation to reach retail investors through a familiar, regulated brokerage experience.”</p> <p>Moomoo continues to expand retail participation in evolving capital markets while maintaining alignment with U.S. regulatory standards. The offering was made available through standard brokerage workflows, without requiring customers to use digital wallets or blockchain-native payment methods.</p> <p>“Being the first brokerage firm to support retail access to this blockchain-native offering reflects the trust placed in our platform and our regulatory capabilities,” said Neil McDonald, CEO of moomoo U.S. “It also emphasizes our focus on expanding investor choice by making new market structures accessible to everyday investors through our compliant, transparent brokerage experience.”</p> <p>The FGRD offering highlights a broader evolution underway in U.S. capital markets as regulated firms explore the integration of blockchain-based infrastructure alongside existing systems. For moomoo, participation in this transaction represents another step in bridging traditional brokerage services with emerging market technologies, while maintaining a focus on investor protection, transparency, and regulatory compliance.</p> <p>*<em>Investing involves risk and the potential to lose principal. Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) can be risky and speculative investments and may not be appropriate for every investor. </em><em>Blockchain native securities may be subject to unique risks including blockchain technology risk (network congestion or smart contract vulnerabilities), settlement failure risk (reliance on counterparty performance on-chain), regulatory risk (evolving digital asset frameworks), and liquidity risk typical of emerging markets.</em> <em>Moomoo does not offer investment recommendations or professional advice.

We are renewing our commitment to STS because we see in these students that same potential to transform our world, and we eagerly await their future contributions to science and humanity.”</p> <p>“At Regeneron, our success has always been driven by a deep belief in science and the people behind it,” said Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., co-Founder, co-Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer at Regeneron, and 1970 STS Alumnus. “This renewed, long-term investment in the Regeneron Science Talent Search – alongside our support for many other STEM education programs – reflects our confidence in the extraordinary potential of young scientists and our responsibility to help cultivate the curiosity, rigor and leadership that will shape the future of scientific discovery.”</p> <p><strong>What is the Regeneron Science Talent Search? </strong><br/>The Regeneron Science Talent Search, first established in 1942 as the Westinghouse Science Talent Search and later the Intel Science Talent Search, is now proudly supported by Regeneron as its third long-term sponsor. Since the beginning of this enduring sponsorship through this year’s STS, Regeneron and the Society have engaged and inspired more than 20,000 of the nation’s top young scientists, recognized 3,000 as Regeneron scholars, and awarded over <money>$31 million</money> in prizes.</p> <p>For 85 years, STS has recognized and championed the United States’ most promising young scientists whose groundbreaking research and leadership potential can fuel the breakthroughs of tomorrow. The competition serves as a catalyst for young scientists to build confidence, strengthen their research skills, and deepen their commitment to high-quality scientific inquiry.</p> <p>“In its 85th year, the Science Talent Search inspires and elevates the nation’s top high school students passionate about tackling the world’s most intractable problems,” said Maya Ajmera, President and CEO at Society for Science; Executive Publisher, Science News; and 1985 STS Alumna. “This renewal not only secures the legacy of this historic competition but also amplifies its impact in the years ahead. With Regeneron’s unwavering support, we will continue to empower the extraordinary – the rising stars and the legends in the making – who will define the future of science, innovation, and discovery.”</p> <p>Each year, nearly 2,500 of the nation’s top science and math students from across the United States enter STS, presenting original research spanning fields such as artificial intelligence, climate science, cancer biology, and renewable energy. Thousands of STS alumni have gone on to world-changing careers in science, with several earning esteemed honors, including the Nobel Prize, the Fields Medal, the National Medal of Science, and the MacArthur Fellowship for groundbreaking research across STEM fields. Since Regeneron became the title sponsor, entries to STS have increased by <percent>49%</percent>, reflecting a significant expansion in the program’s reach and impact on young scientists nationwide.</p> <p>As part of this sponsorship renewal, Regeneron will continue to support the Society's <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=q-vp1Klghzw1GbFsuEM6qPnhu-Urovokd1-9aduVos0xkwG7p3bOH9Yr7yj9xEKK_2XnoC52DnA62u5tYLtsypkNN57QH63mM9ypRG0SjQwASRIUhsuBXgVd5mteuMKo02aScVUVFl40a6X7JHvtqA==\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">STEM Outreach Programs</a>.

Each Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one common share of the Company at a price of <money>$0.59</money> per share for a period of 36 months following the closing of the private placement, 26 February 2029.</p><p>The proceeds of the Financing will be used for advancement of the Company's mineral exploration assets and operations, potential future acquisitions, and general working capital purposes. No finder fees were paid in relation to the private placement and no insiders participated in the equity financing. </p><p>All securities issued pursuant to the Financing will be subject to a statutory hold period of four months and one day from the date of issuance in accordance with applicable securities laws and TSXV policies.</p><p><b>About Stria Lithium</b></p><p>Stria Lithium (TSXV: SRA) is an emerging resource exploration company developing Canadian lithium reserves to meet legislated demand for electric vehicles and their rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. The Company is committed to growth through responsible and efficient exploration and development of its mining assets.</p><p>Stria's Central Pontax Lithium Project covers 36 square kilometres, including 8 km of strike along the prospective Chambois Greenstone Belt. The region, known as the Canadian \"Lithium Triangle,\" is one of only a few known sources of lithium available for hard rock mining in North America. Stria's Pontax Central Project Joint Venture with Cygnus Metals now has a maiden JORC-compliant inferred mineral resource estimate of 10.1Mt at <percent>1.04%</percent> Li2O based on the central area of the known mineralisation.</p><p>This JORC estimate establishes Pontax Central as a significant occurrence in the emerging James Bay lithium region. Cygnus Metals, being an ASX issuer, adhered to Australian JORC Code 2012 guidelines, meaning that such mineral resource estimate is not necessarily compliant with CIM and National Instrument 43-101 standards and the Company is not considering them as such at this time.</p><p>Cygnus Metals is committed to fully funding and managing the current two-stage exploration and drilling program to a maximum of <money>$10 million</money> at Stria's Pontax property and will also pay Stria up to <money>$6 million</money> in cash. In return, Cygnus may acquire up to a <percent>70%</percent> interest in the property. Cygnus has fulfilled its stage 1 requirements within the agreement and has now earned its <percent>51%</percent> interest in the property.</p><p>As momentum builds for the green energy revolution and the shift to electric vehicles, governments in Canada and the United States are aggressively supporting the North American lithium industry, presenting the industry and its investors with a rare opportunity for growth and prosperity well into the next decade and beyond.</p><p>Stria is committed to exceeding the industry's environmental, social and governance standards. A critical part of that commitment is forging meaningful, enduring and mutually beneficial relationships with local communities and stakeholders, and engaging openly and respectfully as neighbours and collaborators in this project that has the potential to create lasting jobs and prosperity.</p><p>The scientific and technical content disclosed herein was reviewed and approved by Réjean Girard, P.Geo and president of IOS Services Geoscientifiques Inc., a qualified person as defined under National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.</p><p>Reference:<br/>JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of Pontax Project, James Bay Quebec, Brian Wolfe; Duncan Grieve, August 14, 2023.</p><p>For more information about Stria Lithium and the Pontax Lithium project, please visit <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/Q2pXKCEYma\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://strialithium.com</a>.</p><p>Follow us on:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li>Twitter @StriaLithium</li><li>Instagram @strialithium</li><li>Facebook <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/mjxEwsxX3K\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://www.facebook.com/strialithium</a></li><li>LinkedIn <a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/kXYx2sYDpp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://www.linkedin.com/company/stria-lithium/</a></li></ul><div id=\"contactInfo\"><p>For more information on Stria Lithium Inc., please contact:</p><p>Dean Hanisch<br/>CEO, Stria Lithium<br/><a href=\"mailto:dhanisch@strialithium.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">dhanisch@strialithium.com</a></p><p>Investor Relations, Stria Lithium Inc.<br/><a href=\"mailto:info@strialithium.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">info@strialithium.com</a></p></div><p>Neither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the accuracy or adequacy of this release.</p><p><i><b>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information</b></i></p><p><i>Except for statements of historical fact, this news release contains certain forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities law.

            "title": "Waste Energy Corp to Present at Clean Energy & Renewables Virtual Investor Conference on March 5th; Highlights Permian Basin Deployment and 2026 Operational Roadmap | WAST Stock News",
            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><strong id=\"dateline\">MIDLAND, TX / <a href=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ACCESS Newswire</a> / February 26, 2026 / </strong>Waste Energy Corp (OTCQB:WAST) (\"WEC\" or the \"Company\"), a clean-energy company converting non-recyclable waste into usable fuel and renewable energy products, today announced that is will present at the Clean Energy &amp; Renewables Virtual Investor Conference on March 5, 2026, hosted by OTC Markets Group. Management will walk through the Company's waste conversion model, its first facility in Midland, Texas, and the operational milestones it expects to hit as commissioning draws near.</p><p><strong>Permian Basin: A Deliberate Starting Point</strong></p><p>The Midland facility wasn't placed in the Permian Basin by accident. The region offers something most early-stage energy infrastructure companies spend years chasing established distribution networks, industrial-scale fuel demand, and a deep base of energy capital that understands long-cycle infrastructure investment. Waste tire feedstock is also concentrated in the area, reducing inbound logistics costs and simplifying supply chain management.</p><p>Management sees the Permian not just as a first market, but as a template. If the model works here, it travels.</p><p><strong>What the Facility Actually Does</strong></p><p>Running Phase 1 at full capacity 30 tons per day, 330 days a year, the Midland plant is designed to process around 10,000 tons of waste tires annually. That's north of 300,000 passenger tires, or roughly 140,000 heavy truck tires, every year. Beyond the headline fuel output, the process recovers carbon black, syngas to run the system and high grade steel, all of which have established regional buyers. Steel alone could represent 990 to 1,485 tons of recoverable material annually, based on typical tire composition.</p><p>The Company is also working with local partners on landfill diversion and tire stockpile remediation in the Permian Basin, a community angle that has drawn interest from regional stakeholders.</p><p><strong>Rethinking How Carbon Credits Get Made</strong></p><p>The voluntary carbon market has a credibility problem. Credits get challenged, methodologies get disputed, and human reporting introduces errors that undermine confidence in the underlying asset. Waste Energy Corp has filed a patent for a system designed to fix that at the source.</p><p>The Company's patent-pending carbon credit automation system uses on-site video monitoring and sensor data to capture the conversion process in real time. That data is then run through a carbon credit algorithm when a match is confirmed, a credit is created automatically, minted as an NFT, and deposited directly into a digital wallet. The credits will be tradeable on the Company's own blockchain-based platform.</p><p>The logic is straightforward: remove the human from the reporting chain, and you remove the most common source of error and dispute. The result is a carbon credit with a verifiable, immutable record of exactly how and when it was generated, something the market has struggled to produce consistently.</p><p>For investors, this matters beyond the environmental angle. A carbon credit with a clean chain of custody and blockchain-based provenance is a more defensible asset. It's also a potential competitive advantage as regulators and institutional buyers apply increasing scrutiny to voluntary market integrity.</p><p><strong>The Carbon Credit Opportunity</strong></p><p>Based on combustion-equivalent emission factors, full-capacity throughput at the Midland facility could translate to roughly 12,800 metric tons of CO₂e annually. Whether that supports a meaningful credit position still depends on third-party validation and registry methodology, a process that hasn't concluded. Conservative estimates put potential annual credits in the 7,000 to 17,000 range, with a theoretical ceiling around 22,000 to 28,000. Management isn't booking that revenue yet, but the automated issuance system is designed to make the validation process faster, cleaner, and more defensible when it does get there.</p><p><strong>Midland Facility Commissioning &amp; Timelines</strong></p><p>The Midland facility is approaching commissioning. Management has committed to regular updates tied to actual milestones production ramp, first revenue, and expansion decisions rather than forward-looking timelines that tend to slip.</p><p>\"We are building Waste Energy Corp around disciplined execution and measurable results,\" said Scott Gallagher, Chairman &amp; CEO. \"Our first priority is to demonstrate a model that works operationally and economically. The Permian Basin deployment is not simply a site launch, it is the foundation for a scalable environmental infrastructure platform designed to generate diversified revenue streams, including fuel, recovered materials, and carbon-linked assets.\"</p><p>Gallagher continued, \"As we move toward commissioning, transparency becomes increasingly important. During the March 5th presentation, I will provide a clear framework outlining our expected path to revenue for the Midland facility. Shareholder value is created through execution, consistency, and scale and our focus in 2026 is to deliver on each of those.\"</p><p>The broader context isn't lost on the Company either. U.S. electricity demand hit record highs in 2025 and is projected to keep climbing, driven largely by the data center and AI infrastructure buildout that shows no sign of slowing. Data center electricity demand has grown more than <percent>400%</percent> over the past decade. Carbon credits, and U.S. data center power demand is forecast to reach 134 gigawatts by 2030, nearly triple current levels. That kind of structural demand creates a sustained need for new domestic energy sources, particularly ones that don't require greenfield grid infrastructure. Waste Energy Corp's model, modular, deployable near existing waste streams, and producing fuel that can flow through established regional distribution networks is designed for exactly that environment.</p><p>At the same time, institutional capital continues its rotation toward ESG-aligned infrastructure. Corporate power purchase agreements for zero-carbon electricity reached 29.5 gigawatts in 2025, the highest annual total on record, a signal that large buyers are actively seeking credible, verifiable clean energy and carbon assets. The Company believes its combination of waste diversion, domestic fuel production, and blockchain-verified carbon credits positions it squarely in that flow of capital. The Midland facility will ultimately have to prove the model but the market conditions for doing so have rarely been better aligned.</p><p><strong>Conference Details</strong></p><p>Waste Energy Corp will present at the Clean Energy &amp; Renewables Virtual Investor Conference on March 5, 2026.
