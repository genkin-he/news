This development is accompanied by continued site advancement, including initial land clearing, removal of out-of-service and abandoned pipeline infrastructure, relocation of active lines, and subsurface soil sampling to support civil engineering design. These activities are intended to optimize the developable footprint and maximize usable acreage for data center deployment.</p><p>By seeking to consolidate this corridor, New Era is looking to enhance its ability to structure direct power solutions and optimize interconnection design as it advances development of its now 438-acre, master-planned TCDC campus, which is designed to scale to more than 1 gigawatt over time.</p><p>The additional acreage would expand New Era’s capacity to:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Directly on next for major power offtake arrangements with nearby energy generation and transport infrastructure</li><li>Negotiate more efficient and flexible interconnection structures</li><li>Reduce exposure to broader grid congestion and transmission constraints; and</li><li>Enhance redundancy, reliability, and long-term expansion flexibility</li></ul><p>The Company expects control of the corridor between operating generation assets and its campus footprint may potentially increase New Era’s negotiating leverage with power producers while improving development sequencing.

Will Gray II, CEO of New Era Energy &amp; Digital commented: “By taking the first step to secure this additional 54 acres, we are seeking to strengthen our strategic land position between major power generation and transmission assets and take a pivotal step toward finalizing a definitive lease agreement with our end tenant. This transaction would further reinforce TCDC’s positioning as an integrated power and digital infrastructure platform designed for long-term expansion and operational reliability.”</p><p><b>About New Era Energy &amp; Digital, Inc.<br/></b>New Era Energy &amp; Digital, Inc.

These are meaningful shortfalls against the very peer group selected by the Board’s Compensation Committee. Yet management continues to receive peer-level compensation for disappointing results. This is not a portfolio problem, FR’s same-store NOI and FFO growth have been comparable to Prologis and EastGroup. It is clear to us that FR’s underperformance is a governance and communication failure.</p><p>We strongly believe that a Board that has overseen this level of underperformance has no business resisting refreshment. Shockingly, no director has been added to the FR Board in the past five years. If the incumbent Board could not consistently deliver superior returns over 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, why should shareholders trust them to realize the ~<percent>20%</percent> upside to NAV going forward and close the valuation discount to its closest peers?</p><p><b>Steps to Generate Value<br/></b>We urge the Board to take the following actions immediately:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\"><li>Publicly commit to a plan to close the NAV discount with specific milestones and timelines.</li><li>Initiate a <money>$500M</money>–<money>$1B</money> asset disposition program with proceeds returned to shareholders.</li><li>Schedule an investor day with property tours within 90 days.</li><li>Authorize a formal exploration of strategic alternatives if the discount does not narrow within six months.</li><li>Immediately refresh the Board: Mr. Dominski and Mr. Hackett should not stand for re-election, and their seats, along with the vacancy created following Mr. Rau’s passing, must be filled with directors experienced in capital allocation and REIT value creation.</li></ul><p>Constructive engagement requires a willing partner and to date, we have not found one in FR.

Maynard, Vice President of Exploration of Minaurum and a Qualified Person (QP) as defined by National Instrument 43-101, reviewed and verified the assay data, and has approved the disclosure in this news release. Verification was done by visual inspection of core samples and comparison to assay results. Assay results have not been checked by re-analysis.

Core samples are sawed in half and then bagged in a secure facility near the site and then shipped either by a licensed courior by Company personnel to ALS Minerals' preparation facility in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. ALS prepares the samples, crushing them to <percent>70%</percent> less than 2mm, splitting off 250g, and pulverizing the split to more than <percent>85%</percent> passing 75 microns. The resulting sample pulps are prepared in Hermosillo and then shipped to Vancouver for chemical analysis by ALS Minerals. In Vancouver, the pulps are analyzed for gold by fire assay and ICP/AES on a 30-gram charge. In addition, analyses are done for silver, copper, lead, and zinc using 4-acid digestion and ICP analysis. Samples with silver values greater than 100 g/t; and copper, lead, or zinc values greater than 10,000 ppm (<percent>1%</percent>) are re-analyzed using 4-acid digestion and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). </font></i></p><p><i><font style=\"font-size: 11px;\">Quality-control (QC) samples are inserted in the sample stream every 20 samples on average, and thus represent <percent>5%</percent> of the total samples. QC samples include standards, blanks, and duplicate samples. Standards are pulps that have been prepared by a third-party laboratory; they have gold, silver, and base-metal values that are established by an extensive analytical process in which several commercial labs (including ALS Minerals) participate. Standards test the calibration of the analytical equipment. Blanks are rock material known from prior sampling to contain less than 0.005 ppm gold; they test the sample preparation procedure for cross-sample contamination.  In the case of duplicates, the sample interval is cut in half and then quartered. The first quarter is the original sample, the second becomes the duplicate. Duplicate samples provide a test of the reproducibility of assays in the same drilled interval. When final assays are received, QC sample results are inspected for deviation from accepted values. To date, QC sample analytical results have fallen in acceptable ranges on the Alamos project.</font></i></p><p><i><font style=\"font-size: 11px;\">When final assays are received, QC sample results are inspected for deviation from accepted values by the QP.

            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><b>Vertical Structural Continuity Emerging in DDH-26-01<br/>Nova Scotia Introduces Purpose-Built Natural Hydrogen Legislation</b></p><p>Montreal, Quebec--(Newsfile Corp. - February 26, 2026) - Québec Innovative Materials Corp.  (CSE: QIMC) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/QIMCF/\" title=\"View QIMCF stock overview\">QIMCF</a>) (FSE: 7FJ) (\"QIMC\" or the \"Company\") reports that drill hole DDH-26-01 has intersected a second hydrogen-associated structural zone at approximately 313 metres depth at its West Advocate Project, Nova Scotia. This interval from approximately 313 metres to 330 metres depth is distinct from the previously reported 40-metre hydrogen-bearing fault corridor encountered between 142 and 191 metres.</p><p>The identification of two vertically separated hydrogen-associated structural zones within a single borehole supports the interpretation of a structurally controlled, multi-zone natural hydrogen system and further strengthens QIMC's H2 geological model. Drilling at DDH-26-01 remains ongoing toward the planned total depth of 650 metres.</p><p>This development coincides with the Government of Nova Scotia's introduction of the Powering the Economy Act (Bill No. 193), proposed legislation that regulates natural hydrogen as a subsurface energy resource within the Province. This legislative development directly enhances investment certainty and long-term planning capability and demonstrates the Province's and Premier Houston's commitment to establishing Nova Scotia as a hub for responsible clean energy development. The Company's exploration at West Advocate involves no hydraulic fracturing and no reservoir stimulation.</p><p><b>What This Means for Investors</b></p><p>DDH-26-01 has now intersected hydrogen-associated structural intervals at approximately 142 metres and 313 metres depth within a single borehole, supporting the interpretation of a multi-zone, structurally controlled natural hydrogen system rather than an isolated occurrence. In natural hydrogen exploration, structural repetition across depth is a recognized indicator of system continuity and scale. This result further strengthens QIMC's working geological model and provides a defined, systematic, data-driven pathway for the next phases of its Nova Scotia natural hydrogen exploration program.</p><p><b>CEO Commentary</b></p><p>John Karagiannidis, President &amp; CEO of QIMC, stated:</p><p>\"Intersecting a second hydrogen-associated structural zone at 320 metres while Hole 1 continues drilling toward 650 metres significantly strengthens our geological interpretation of West Advocate as a structurally controlled, multi-zone system. We are observing vertically separated brecciated intervals within a single borehole that exhibit geochemical characteristics consistent with hydrogen-bearing environments.</p><p>The Province of Nova Scotia's introduced regulatory framework provides the clarity necessary to responsibly advance multi-well exploration strategies and support long-term planning and investment. As we continue defining structural continuity through drilling and logging, this regulatory certainty underpins our disciplined, systematic approach and we commend the Province for its proactive clean energy leadership.\"</p><p><b>Project Geologist Commentary</b></p><p>Edward Procyshyn, Project Geologist, commented:</p><p>\"Drill logging has identified within the second structural fault zone three separate brecciated shear zones that are progressively more altered and sheared downhole. With progressive alteration, the breccia fragments become more completely replaced by finely crystalline massive dark carbon-graphite and dark mica. Each underlying shear zone is more highly altered than the overlying shear zone. The middle and lower altered shear zones were most highly altered and develop dark, very finely granular, massive carbon-rich intervals 0.5 to 1 metre thick. These highly altered core intervals contain the highest measured hydrogen gas values.</p><p>The host rock within the structural fault zone is also progressively altered as the intensity of shear deformation increases downhole. Thinly bedded, finely granular siltstone, dark carbonaceous mudstone, and fanglomerate are progressively recrystallized to form, within the structural fault zone, massive white, very fine-grained porcelain-like units cut by darker web to lenticular fractures. As shear fracturing and alteration increase in intensity downhole, the intervening porcellanite-like host changes colour from white to pale green and finally to darker greenish grey, indicating mineralogical changes due to increasing conditions of alteration.\"</p><p>Edward Procyshyn continued:</p><p>\"The progressive hydrothermal alteration of this structural fault shear zone supports the model that white native hydrogen is being increasingly generated at lower crustal levels by degassing of a magmatic system and being transported by advective hydrothermal fluids into the fault-related shear structures. This suggests that the degassing may be generated by injection of mantle plumes into the upper crust within the West Advocate area and that this process may have contributed significant amounts of white hydrogen gas that was and is presently being measured in the intersected structural zones and at surface in the soil-gas samples.</p><p>The very low to absent quantities of methane contained in the measured gases support the concept that hydrogen is being generated from crustal sources in a naturally occurring hydrogen system rather than from a conventional hydrocarbon occurrence.\"</p><p><b>Gas Monitoring Observations at 313m</b></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align: start; width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"width: 50%;\">Parameter<br/><br/></td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Observation</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 50%;\">Hydrogen (H₂)<br/><br/></td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Elevated concentrations detected</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 50%;\">Oxygen (O₂)<br/><br/></td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Depleted relative to atmospheric levels</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 50%;\">Methane (CH₄)<br/><br/></td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">None detected</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 50%;\">Hydraulic fracturing / stimulation<br/></td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Not conducted</td></tr></tbody></table><p> <br/>Measurements were collected in ambient atmospheric air near the borehole collar and during core handling and are subject to atmospheric dilution.</p><p><b>2026 Drill Program: Five-Hole Campaign</b></p><p>DDH-26-01 is the first hole in a planned five-hole 2026 drill program designed to systematically evaluate structural hydrogen corridors at West Advocate and adjacent targets.</p><ul><li>Hole 1 (DDH-26-01): Drilling continues toward planned 650 metres depth.<br/><br/></li><li>Hole 2 (DDH-26-02): Planned from same pad; oriented N297° with 55° plunge to the northwest.<br/><br/></li><li>Hole 3 (DDH-26-03): Eatonville Road area along the Reid Line; planned to 700 metres depth.<br/><br/></li><li>Holes 4 &amp; 5 (DDH-26-04 and DDH-26-05): Bennett Hill targets testing the broader regional structural hydrogen corridor.</li></ul><p><b>Nova Scotia Legislation</b></p><p>Nova Scotia's proposed legislation reflects a broader recognition by governments that natural hydrogen warrants a dedicated regulatory framework, a development that directly benefits companies with active exploration programs in the province.

The new eConsent offering can be deployed in under four weeks and is available as a lightweight, cost‑effective module or as a fully integrated component of the DATATRAK Powered by Fountayn EDC and DCT ecosystem.</p><p>Unlike many eConsent tools that are bundled only within large, expensive ePRO or DCT packages, DATATRAK's standalone eConsent delivers flexible pricing so study teams can implement digital informed consent without paying for an entire ePRO system they do not need. Reasonable, study‑level pricing makes eConsent accessible for a broader range of trials and budgets, including early‑phase, single‑site, and investigator‑initiated studies.</p><p>\"Study teams want the benefits of modern eConsent-faster startup, better participant understanding, and cleaner documentation-without lengthy implementations or bloated platform costs,\" said Alex Tabatabai, CEO, DATATRAK. \"Our standalone eConsent is purpose‑built to launch quickly, fit into existing study infrastructure, and scale seamlessly when sponsors are ready to expand into DATATRAK EDC, ePRO, RTSM, CTMS, or full decentralized clinical trials.\"</p><p><strong>Fast Startup, IND‑Ready Timelines</strong></p><p>The DATATRAK eConsent solution is designed for implementation timelines of under four weeks, allowing study teams to go live in time for IND or ethics approval and first‑patient‑in milestones. Configuration is supported by reusable templates and best‑practice workflows that help streamline approvals and site activation.</p><p><strong>Standalone eConsent with Enterprise‑Grade Integration</strong></p><p>The eConsent module can be used as a standalone utility and integrated with third‑party infrastructure, including external EDC, RTSM, CTMS, and eTMF systems, or deployed as a native component of DATATRAK EDC. When used with DATATRAK EDC, consent data and enrollment status are seamlessly connected to subject records, randomization, and visit schedules, enabling true end‑to‑end digital trial execution on a single platform.</p><p><strong>Key Capabilities Include:</strong></p><p>1. Standalone eConsent that integrates with third‑party clinical trial systems or EDC<br/>2. Seamless integration with the consent and enrollment workflow in EDC<br/>3. Support for remote and decentralized clinical trials with patient access from any device<br/>4. Designed for protocol amendments and regulatory workflows</p><p>DATATRAK's eConsent simplifies managing protocol amendments and re‑consent, a common pain point for sponsors and sites. Study teams can easily trigger and track re‑consent when protocol changes occur, ensuring every participant is on the correct version and that audit trails remain inspection‑ready.</p><p>The system also supports tracking and managing supporting documents such as witness statements, translations, and supplemental information, helping maintain complete, compliant records across sites and regions.</p><p><strong>Flexible Patient Engagement and Enrollment Options</strong></p><p>To support both site‑based and remote enrollment, the eConsent solution enables sites to invite participants using multiple methods: email links, QR codes patients can scan on their own device, or direct registration by the physician or site staff. Sites can also schedule consent visits prior to trial enrollment, helping ensure participants have adequate time to review materials, ask questions, and complete consent in a controlled, compliant workflow.</p><p>When combined with DATATRAK's EDC, ePRO, and eSource capabilities, sponsors can extend the same patient‑centric digital experience beyond consent to ongoing data collection and engagement throughout the study.</p><p><strong>About DATATRAK</strong></p><p>DATATRAK Powered by Fountayn is transforming healthcare and life sciences through technological innovations by providing a unified, cloud based eClinical and decentralized clinical trial platform that brings together EDC, eSource, ePRO/eCOA, eConsent, RTSM, RBM, Adjudication, Imaging, Safety, Global Oversight and Enterprise Workflow Management, CTMS, eTMF, and DCT tools in a single, configurable environment.

Clinical efficacy across leading programs is converging in the 12–<percent>16%</percent> weight-loss range.</p> <p>In this increasingly competitive field, long-term differentiation depends not only on clinical performance but also on the strength and defensibility of each program’s patent portfolio.</p> <p>The report reviews more than 1,200 patent documents across 26 clinical-stage programs, mapping composition-of-matter claims, Markush scope, formulation layers, and method-of-use protection. The findings reveal dramatic disparities in patent depth between programs at similar development stages.</p> <p>More than <money>$47 billion</money> in GLP-1-related deal value has been committed since 2023, yet most oral programs remain unpartnered. With semaglutide’s patent cliff approaching in 2031 and tirzepatide’s in 2036, long-term exclusivity will determine which assets become franchises and which face early generic pressure.</p> <p>“When multiple drugs deliver similar weight-loss results, the competitive moat shifts beneath the surface,” said Javier Chamorro, Chief Operating Officer of PatentVest. “The difference between a broad genus claim and a narrow composition patent can determine who owns this market for the next twenty years.”</p> <p>This analysis maps 50 oral small-molecule GLP-1 programs worldwide, including 30 in clinical development, and evaluates the IP positioning of leading assets from Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Roche, AstraZeneca, Gilead, Structure Therapeutics, and others.</p> <p>This is the first in a series of deep-dive analyses evaluating the structural and patent defensibility of each major program.</p> <p>PatentVest, a division of MDB Capital Holdings (Nasdaq: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/MDBH/\" title=\"View MDBH stock overview\">MDBH</a>), is the first integrated IP intelligence, strategy, and law firm designed to help visionary companies become technology leaders.
