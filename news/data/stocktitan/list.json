With a portfolio that includes reusable, industry-leading templates, clause libraries, KPI and SLA catalogs, real-time market benchmarks and a staged process that spans strategy, transition and ongoing governance, the ISG revenue cycle management framework can help healthcare providers reduce rework and staffing costs, ensure compliance and improve financial stability.</p><p>It also leverages AI-based platforms and services to manage administrative tasks and increase efficiency, which can save healthcare organizations nearly 50 percent of their operations costs and drive millions of dollars in increased net patient revenue. In recent client engagements, the ISG revenue cycle management framework saved a children’s healthcare system <money><money>$15 million</money></money> over a five-year IT services contract and delivered a Midwest hospital network 50 percent savings and <money><money>$45 million</money></money> in annual revenue uplift.</p><p>“U.S. healthcare providers are entering a period of intensified financial and operational pressure, making revenue cycle performance a must-have,” Burke said. “Properly structured, negotiated and governed revenue cycle transformation agreements have been proven to build structurally lower-cost enterprises that can fund transformation through self-generated savings.”</p><p>ISG is the world’s leading sourcing advisor and the industry pioneer.

ISAC is an innovative technology that enables use cases across commercial, public safety and defense scenarios, enabling faster adoption of new emerging technologies like autonomous systems and drone delivery in commercial settings. From a defense scenario, it augments national security and provides an additional layer of safety.</p><p>ISAC integrates sensing and spatial location of passive (not connected) objects into the mobile communication network - extending network functionality beyond connectivity by enabling the detection and characterization of objects and movement using existing infrastructure. The capability is progressing in 3GPP with initial studies in Release 19 and is expected to form part of early 6G standardization, showing the foundation for broad, scalable sensing applications.</p><p>\"ISAC represents a transformative leap forward, merging advanced communications and sensing capabilities into a unified platform,\" said Dr. Tom Rondeau, Principal Director for the DoW's FutureG Office. \"By using communication signals to sense the physical world in real-time, ISAC gives wireless networks a new dimension of environmental awareness, enabling groundbreaking applications that advance both <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> national security and commercial interests, and solidifying America's leadership in the race to 6G.\"</p><p>\"Today, we showed how ISAC can unlock a new class of applications - from safer skies to smarter cities - by introducing a powerful new sensing platform as an added layer to the existing telecom network,\" said Yossi Cohen, President and CEO of Ericsson Americas. \"By transforming deployed radio sites and spectrum to support both communications and sensing, we give networks the ability to truly perceive their surroundings. We can introduce these capabilities efficiently and responsibly, accelerating time to value for operators and their customers. As a trusted supplier and long-term partner worldwide, Ericsson brings the scale, reliability, and security to help service providers realize these benefits from day one.\"</p><p>During this proof of concept, Ericsson engineers showcased how network-based sensing supports use cases such as drone detection and airspace safety. We continue to explore how sensing can be used for automotive and transportation assistance; industrial automation and worker protection - use cases that benefit from the network's wide-area perspective and ability to \"see around corners.\"</p><p>Why it matters:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>Safer, smarter infrastructure: Network-based sensing can support use cases by augmenting local sensors with wide-area network awareness.</li><li>Efficient path to scale: ISAC is designed to reuse existing mobile network sites, spectrum, and hardware, enabling pragmatic introduction and coverage at scale.</li><li>Road to 6G: 3GPP studies have begun, with ISAC poised to become a foundational capability in the 6G era.</li></ul><p>The proof of concept underscores Ericsson's commitment to advancing 6G-era capabilities and collaborating with the broader ecosystem to validate real-world scenarios and deployment approaches across sites, spectrum, and hardware integration levels.</p><p><b>Ericsson in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location></b></p><p>Ericsson has operated in the US for more than 120 years and continues to expand its footprint across research, manufacturing, and operations.

Together, these AI capabilities displace traditional IT &amp; Data skills, which fell to seventh place (<percent>17%</percent>), signaling a rapid realignment of strategic talent investment toward AI-driven capabilities.<br/><br/></li><li><b>The Human Edge Becomes More Valuable<br/></b>Even amid the surge in demand for AI, core human skills remain in-demand.

Additionally, AM Best has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of “a-” (Excellent) of Primerica, Inc. (Primerica) (headquartered in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ga.duluth\">Duluth, GA</location>) [NYSE: PRI], which is the holding company for the group’s insurance and non-insurance operating companies. AM Best also has affirmed the Long-Term Issue Credit Rating of “a-” (Excellent) on <money><money>$600 million</money></money>, <percent>2.8%</percent> senior unsecured notes, due 2031, of Primerica. The outlook of all these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.</p><p>The ratings reflect Primerica Group’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its very strong operating performance, favorable business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management.</p><p>Primerica’s credit ratings continue to recognize the group’s strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). The company’s balance sheet remains a core strength, characterized by strong liquidity and financial flexibility. Primerica has an investment profile that focuses on fixed-income assets, while maintaining only modest exposure to commercial mortgage-backed securities. However, the company’s business model does rely heavily on the use of reinsurance.</p><p>Primerica reinforced its position as an industry leader, consistently reporting high levels of earnings and top-tier return-on-equity measures among its peers. Steady premium growth, fueled by a vast and geographically diversified distribution system spanning the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> and Canadian marketplaces, continues to improve the company's operational strength. Primerica has extensive agent recruitment and a well-established monitoring system to ensure compliance and steady premium growth.

Drilling in the West Zone intersected broad levels of gold mineralization in multiple holes, with long intervals of gold mineralization encountered in two of the six holes completed during the program, complementing the spring 2023 discovery hole of 48.5m of 0.85 g/t Au starting at 316.5m (see News Release dated 2023-Jun-06).</p><p><b>Highlights:</b></p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li>IMGW-25-06 returned 0.424 g/t gold over 278.35 metres from 45.1 to 323.45 metres, which included several sub-intervals, including:<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\"><li><b>1.019 g/t gold over 7.4 metres</b> from 118.75 to 126.15 metres</li><li><b>0.566 g/t over 80 metres</b> from 154 to 234 metres</li><li><b>0.610 g/t gold over 62.45</b> <b>metres</b> from 261 to 323.45 metres, including<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\"><li><b>1.239 g/t gold over 16.65 metres</b> from 289.35 to 306 metres</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>IMGW-25-01 returned <b>0.419 g/t gold over 65.75</b> <b>metres </b>from 276.7 to 342.45 metres, including<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\"><li><b>0.868 g/t gold over 8 metres</b> from 296.5 to 304 metres</li><li><b>0.786 g/t gold over 5.8 metres</b> from 315.95 to 321.75 metres</li></ul></li><li>IMGW-25-03 returned <b>1.116 g/t gold over 6.2 metres</b> from 342.75 to 348.95 metres</li><li>McFarlane Lake Mining Limited, contiguous to the northwest has identifed a parallel zone to it's Juby Zone within the regional Ridout-Tyrrell Deformation Zone, the 826 Zone, which appears to trend into the West Zone.</li></ul><p>\"These results continue to expand the gold system at Gowganda West and demonstrate both broad mineralization and higher-grade internal intervals,\" stated Saf Dhillon, President &amp; CEO of iMetal. \"The scale of the mineralized envelope, combined with its proximity to the Juby Deposit and the emerging 826 Zone, reinforces the structural significance of this corridor. We look forward to incorporating these results into our ongoing geological model and planning the next phase of drilling!\" commented iMetal President &amp; CEO Saf Dhillon. </p><p>The drilling intersected the targeted host rocks that exhibited alteration patterns and mineralization similar to that which was intersected in the 2023 drill program. The dominant rock type intersected is a matrix supported greenish polymictic conglomerate composed of heterogenous centimetric to pluricentimetric round clasts with different colors. A percentage of the red clasts are magnetic but the matrix is not. Zones of moderate to pervasive hematization /potassic alteration, sericitization and silicification were noted in the drill holes. Mineralization included disseminated and clast-replacement controlled pyrite, while a few holes also intersected local chalcopyrite vein fractures or plurimillimetric clusters. Alteration intensity appears to be a control on elevated gold values. Pyrite content also shows a relationship with elevated gold values and intensity of alteration.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/7946/285465_table1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

Successive drill programs advancing to the southwest continued to intersect increasing alteration and gold values in suspected NW trending zones and lead directly to the IMGW23-04 discovery hole. The 48.5m gold interval is characterized by a coarse-grained to boulder-sized conglomerate, with moderate to pervasive silica alteration associated with a large intermediate-mafic dyke.
