            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p><b>Vertical Structural Continuity Emerging in DDH-26-01</b><br/><b>Nova Scotia Introduces Purpose-Built Natural Hydrogen Legislation</b></p><p>Montreal, Quebec--(Newsfile Corp. - February 27, 2026) - Québec Innovative Materials Corp. (CSE: QIMC) (OTCQB: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/QIMCF/\" title=\"View QIMCF stock overview\">QIMCF</a>) (FSE: 7FJ) (\"QIMC\" or the \"Company\") reports that drill hole DDH-26-01 has intersected a second hydrogen-associated structural zone at approximately 313 metres depth at its West Advocate Project, Nova Scotia. This interval from approximately 313 metres to 330 metres depth is distinct from the previously reported 40-metre hydrogen-bearing fault corridor encountered between 142 and 191 metres.</p><p>The identification of two vertically separated hydrogen-associated structural zones within a single borehole supports the interpretation of a structurally controlled, multi-zone natural hydrogen system and further strengthens QIMC's H2 geological model. Drilling at DDH-26-01 remains ongoing toward the planned total depth of 650 metres.</p><p>This development coincides with the Government of Nova Scotia's introduction of the Powering the Economy Act (Bill No. 193), proposed legislation that regulates natural hydrogen as a subsurface energy resource within the Province. This legislative development directly enhances investment certainty and long-term planning capability and demonstrates the Province's and Premier Houston's commitment to establishing Nova Scotia as a hub for responsible clean energy development. The Company's exploration at West Advocate involves no hydraulic fracturing and no reservoir stimulation.</p><p><b>What This Means for Investors</b></p><p>DDH-26-01 has now intersected hydrogen-associated structural intervals at approximately 142 metres and 313 metres depth within a single borehole, supporting the interpretation of a multi-zone, structurally controlled natural hydrogen system rather than an isolated occurrence. In natural hydrogen exploration, structural repetition across depth is a recognized indicator of system continuity and scale. This result further strengthens QIMC's working geological model and provides a defined, systematic, data-driven pathway for the next phases of its Nova Scotia natural hydrogen exploration program.</p><p><b>CEO Commentary</b></p><p>John Karagiannidis, President &amp; CEO of QIMC, stated:</p><p>\"Intersecting a second hydrogen-associated structural zone at 320 metres while Hole 1 continues drilling toward 650 metres significantly strengthens our geological interpretation of West Advocate as a structurally controlled, multi-zone system. We are observing vertically separated brecciated intervals within a single borehole that exhibit geochemical characteristics consistent with hydrogen-bearing environments.</p><p>The Province of Nova Scotia's introduced regulatory framework provides the clarity necessary to responsibly advance multi-well exploration strategies and support long-term planning and investment. As we continue defining structural continuity through drilling and logging, this regulatory certainty underpins our disciplined, systematic approach and we commend the Province for its proactive clean energy leadership.\"</p><p><b>Project Geologist Commentary</b></p><p>Edward Procyshyn, Project Geologist, commented:</p><p>\"Drill logging has identified within the second structural fault zone three separate brecciated shear zones that are progressively more altered and sheared downhole. With progressive alteration, the breccia fragments become more completely replaced by finely crystalline massive dark carbon-graphite and dark mica. Each underlying shear zone is more highly altered than the overlying shear zone. The middle and lower altered shear zones were most highly altered and develop dark, very finely granular, massive carbon-rich intervals 0.5 to 1 metre thick. These highly altered core intervals contain the highest measured hydrogen gas values.</p><p>The host rock within the structural fault zone is also progressively altered as the intensity of shear deformation increases downhole. Thinly bedded, finely granular siltstone, dark carbonaceous mudstone, and fanglomerate are progressively recrystallized to form, within the structural fault zone, massive white, very fine-grained porcelain-like units cut by darker web to lenticular fractures. As shear fracturing and alteration increase in intensity downhole, the intervening porcellanite-like host changes colour from white to pale green and finally to darker greenish grey, indicating mineralogical changes due to increasing conditions of alteration.\"</p><p>Edward Procyshyn continued:</p><p>\"The progressive hydrothermal alteration of this structural fault shear zone supports the model that white native hydrogen is being increasingly generated at lower crustal levels by degassing of a magmatic system and being transported by advective hydrothermal fluids into the fault-related shear structures. This suggests that the degassing may be generated by injection of mantle plumes into the upper crust within the West Advocate area and that this process may have contributed significant amounts of white hydrogen gas that was and is presently being measured in the intersected structural zones and at surface in the soil-gas samples.</p><p>The very low to absent quantities of methane contained in the measured gases support the concept that hydrogen is being generated from crustal sources in a naturally occurring hydrogen system rather than from a conventional hydrocarbon occurrence.\"</p><p><b>Gas Monitoring Observations at 313m</b></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align: start; width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">Parameter</td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Observation<br/><br/></td></tr><tr><td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">Hydrogen (H₂)</td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Elevated concentrations detected<br/><br/></td></tr><tr><td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">Oxygen (O₂)</td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Depleted relative to atmospheric levels<br/><br/></td></tr><tr><td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">Methane (CH₄)</td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">None detected<br/><br/></td></tr><tr><td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">Hydraulic fracturing / stimulation</td><td style=\"width: 50%; vertical-align: top;\">Not conducted<br/><br/></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p>Measurements were collected in ambient atmospheric air near the borehole collar and during core handling and are subject to atmospheric dilution.</p><p><b>2026 Drill Program: Five-Hole Campaign</b></p><p>DDH-26-01 is the first hole in a planned five-hole 2026 drill program designed to systematically evaluate structural hydrogen corridors at West Advocate and adjacent targets.</p><ul><li><p>Hole 1 (DDH-26-01): Drilling continues toward planned 650 metres depth.</p></li><li><p>Hole 2 (DDH-26-02): Planned from same pad; oriented N297° with 55° plunge to the northwest.</p></li><li><p>Hole 3 (DDH-26-03): Eatonville Road area along the Reid Line; planned to 700 metres depth.</p></li><li><p>Holes 4 &amp; 5 (DDH-26-04 and DDH-26-05): Bennett Hill targets testing the broader regional structural hydrogen corridor.</p></li></ul><p><b>Nova Scotia Legislation</b></p><p>Nova Scotia's proposed legislation reflects a broader recognition by governments that natural hydrogen warrants a dedicated regulatory framework, a development that directly benefits companies with active exploration programs in the province.

            "title": "Delta Identifies Three Significant Gold Anomalies From the 2024-25 I-Zone Sector Till Survey and Reports Drill Results From the Latest Regional Exploration Drill Program | DTARF Stock News",
            "description": "<article class=\"article\"><p>Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - February 27, 2026) -  <b>Delta Resources Limited (TSXV: DLTA)</b> <b>(OTC Pink: <a class=\"symbol-link\" href=\"/overview/DTARF/\" title=\"View DTARF stock overview\">DTARF</a>) (FSE: 6GO1) (\"Delta\" or \"the Company\")</b> is pleased to report the preliminary interpretation from the 2024-25 till survey conducted by IOS Géosciences in the I-Zone sector, located approximately 18 kilometres southwest of the Eureka Gold Deposit and about 60 kilometres west of Thunder Bay, Ontario. The till survey, completed in the fall of 2025 (<a href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/wE4nDTB0aA\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">see September 17, 2025 news release</a>), has identified at least three significant gold anomalies and one nickel anomaly, further reinforcing the potential for expansion and new discoveries in the area. Delta is also pleased to report assay results from its most recent regional exploration drill program at the Delta-1 Gold Project.</p><p><b>Highlights Include: </b></p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li>A sample containing 629 total gold grains (normalized to 10 kg fraction) and an anomalous fine-fraction value of 86.8 ppb Au collected west of the I-Zone, which may reflect an extension of the known I-Zone showing or indicate a previously undiscovered gold occurrence.</li><li>A sample containing 488 normalized gold grains collected from an area with no known historical gold occurrences, approximately 3 km northeast of I-Zone, hosted within a distinct geological package.</li><li>A sample containing 152 normalized gold grains, likely derived from the New Road Zone, a known gold occurrence identified by Delta as a high-priority, yet-to-be-drilled exploration target.</li><li>A large anomalous nickel trend pointing to an area northeast of the I-Zone prospect.  </li></ul><p><b>Ron Kopas, Chief Executive Officer of Delta, commented:</b></p><p>\"With the 2024-25 till data and its interpretation now completed, Delta continues to demonstrate district-scale discovery potential beyond the Eureka Gold Deposit. This is most evident in the I-Zone sector, where historic work indicates high-grade gold mineralization in a style distinct from Eureka. In the coming months, we will advance an aggressive follow-up exploration program in the I-Zone area while continuing to accelerate development of the Eureka deposit and nearby priority targets.\"</p><p><b>2024-2025 Till Survey</b></p><p>In the fall of 2024, Delta initiated a large-scale regional till survey in the western portion of the Delta-1 property, which hosts the I-Zone and associated gold showings. The survey was originally scheduled to resume in the spring of 2025 but was ultimately completed later in the fall. Results from recent till sampling and geochemical interpretation within the I-Zone sector have identified multiple highly anomalous gold and nickel responses, supporting the presence of both known and previously unrecognized mineralized sources in the area.</p><p>A highly anomalous till sample collected near the I-Zone returned 629 normalized gold grains, along with an anomalous fine-fraction gold value of 86.8 ppb Au. Based on ice-flow indicators and Quaternary interpretation, this anomaly is considered unlikely to have been sourced directly from the existing I-Zone trench. The sample may represent either an extension of the known I-Zone gold showing or a previously undiscovered gold occurrence proximal to the I-Zone.</p><p>A second anomalous sample returned 488 normalized gold grains and was collected from an area with no known historical gold occurrences. This sample is hosted within a distinct geological package separate from the I-Zone, suggesting the presence of an additional, previously unrecognized gold-bearing system within the broader project area.</p><p>A third anomalous sample returned 152 normalized gold grains and is interpreted to be derived from the New Road Zone, a known gold occurrence previously identified by Delta Resources as a high-priority exploration target that has not yet been drill tested.</p><p>In addition to the gold anomalies, compilation of geochemical data has identified a large anomalous nickel trend extending to the northeast of the I-Zone prospect, highlighting an additional exploration vector and supporting the multi-commodity potential of the area.</p><p>Collectively, these results reinforce the prospectivity of the I-Zone sector and support continued follow-up exploration and target refinement aimed at advancing near-term drill targets.</p><p>The combined 2024-2025 surveys in the I-Zone sector consisted of 209 sample sites and covered an area of approximately 70 km². </p><p>The I-Zone sector is located 18 kilometres southwest of the Eureka Gold Deposit and hosts several high-grade gold showings, including historical (non-NI 43-101 compliant) drill intercepts of 4.32 g/t Au over 41.0 metres, 4.53 g/t Au over 14.4 metres, and 4.36 g/t Au over 20.4 metres (Landore Resources, 1995-1997), as well as a 1,000-kg mini-bulk sample (Mengold Resources, 2008) that returned an average grade of 9.9 g/t Au.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8482/285635_deltafig1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img alt=\"Cannot view this image?

Anomalous gold within favorable host rocks confirms a large, active hydrothermal system at Wedge and informs future drill targeting (Table 1).</p><p>\"This phase of drilling demonstrated the presence of anomalous gold within favorable host rocks confirming our geological model and providing critical data to refine targets and improve future drill effectiveness.

Samples were collected from subsurface till using a combination of hydraulic excavator and hand-shovel methods, depending on overburden conditions. Excavation was employed where necessary to access till beneath historical glacial lake sediments. All samples were logged in the field, collected following procedures consistent with previous surveys on the property, and spatially referenced using UTM NAD83 coordinates. Field operations were supervised by IOS Géosciences to ensure sample integrity and procedural consistency.</p><p>Fine-fraction (&lt;63 µm) till samples were analyzed using aqua regia digestion followed by ICP-MS multi-element analysis at Actlabs, an accredited commercial laboratory. A comprehensive QA/QC program was implemented by both IOS Géosciences and Actlabs, including the systematic insertion of certified reference materials, analytical blanks, and laboratory duplicates. Certified reference materials specifically developed for till material were used to monitor analytical accuracy and precision, while blanks were inserted to detect potential contamination or sample mix-ups. All analytical quality control results are documented in the technical report and associated laboratory certificates.</p><p>Gold grain counts were obtained using the ARTPhot® automated optical detection technology, which combines high-resolution digital microscopy with automated image recognition and expert validation to identify and count gold grains recovered from till samples. </p><p>Chemical analyses reported for drill samples in this news release were performed by AGAT Laboratories, an independent analytical laboratory accredited to ISO/IEC 17025 by the Standards Council of Canada (SCC). Sample preparation was completed at AGAT's facility in Thunder Bay, Ontario. All sampling and analytical procedures were conducted under a comprehensive Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) program, including the insertion and monitoring of certified reference materials (standards), blanks, and duplicate samples.</p><p>To minimize assay variability associated with the nugget effect from coarse and/or visible gold, the Company implemented the following assaying protocol at Delta-1:</p><p>Where visible gold is observed in the sample or where the sample is derived from an interpreted mineralized zone, the assay is performed by metallic screening. In this procedure, the entire sample is crushed, and a 1 kg split is pulverized and screened to 106 µm. Both the coarse and fine-fractions are analyzed by 50 g fire assay with gravimetric finish at AGAT Laboratories in Thunder Bay, Ontario.</p><p>Where visible gold is not observed, or where samples are outside of interpreted mineralized zones, an initial assay is performed by 50 g fire assay with ICP-OES finish at the AGAT Laboratory in Thunder Bay, Ontario. If the assay result exceeds 2.0 g/t Au, remaining rejects are pulverized, a 1 kg portion is screened to 106 µm and analyzed by 50 g fire assay with gravimetric finish at the AGAT Laboratory in Thunder Bay, Ontario.</p><p>NQ-size drill core was sawn lengthwise in half using a diamond blade saw. One half of the core was sampled, placed in sealed and labelled plastic bags, and shipped to AGAT Laboratories for </p><p>preparation and analysis. The remaining half core was returned to core boxes and retained for reference at Delta's secure core storage facilities. QA/QC materials including blanks and certified standards were inserted into the sample stream at the project site. In addition, routine insertion of accredited blank, duplicate, and certified reference samples was conducted during the analytical process by AGAT Laboratories, providing further independent QA/QC monitoring.</p><p>Mineralized intervals are calculated using a 0.2 g/t Au cut-off grade. Reported intercepts are constrained to intervals where internal dilution does not exceed 5 m of continuous core grading below the cut-off.</p><p><b>About Delta Resources Limited</b></p><p>Delta Resources is a Canadian mineral exploration and project development company focused on its Delta-1 project in Ontario, where it has discovered a large, near-surface gold deposit located 50 kilometres west of Thunder Bay, directly adjacent to the Trans-Canada Highway. The Eureka Gold Deposit extends 2.5 km in strike length, from surface to over 300 metres in depth. Highlights include drill intercepts such as 5.92 g/t Au over 31 metres (including 14.8 g/t Au over 11.9 metres), and 1.79 g/t Au over 128.5 metres. Mineralization has been observed up to 600 metres vertical depth and remains open in all directions.

Its bands continue to anchor volume in the mass market, while its basic watches, supported by in-house chip development and deeper ecosystem integration, are enabling the brand to move up the value chain. Apple retains a strong premium position, leveraging 5G connectivity and advanced health features, including hypertension monitoring, to sustain high loyalty among its high-value users. Huawei has consolidated its mainstream presence through a broad portfolio, while intensifying its focus on professional sports and medical-grade health applications.</p><p>AI and subscription services are reshaping competition, transforming from nice-to-have features into essential revenue drivers of growth and profitability. Wearable bands are increasingly optimized for continuous health monitoring, with some vendors exploring screenless or reduced-screen designs to improve comfort and data continuity. “The wearables profit model is undergoing structural change,” said <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fomdia.tech.informa.com%2Fauthors%2Fjason-low&amp;esheet=54435131&amp;newsitemid=20260227981313&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Omdia+Research+Director+Jason+Low&amp;index=3&amp;md5=580e5ddc32c1c0b2f40a4a50ce7551f3\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" shape=\"rect\">Omdia Research Director Jason Low</a>. “Algorithms and services are becoming standalone profit centers, with advanced health insights, professional training plans, and AI-powered coaching generating recurring subscription revenue.” For vendors with a higher-priced portfolio, subscription services represent more than just additional revenue. They are becoming essential to maintaining profitability as hardware margins compress due to rising component costs. This recurring revenue model provides a critical buffer against the volatility of hardware pricing. Meanwhile, improved insights into health and sport tracking are designed to increase usage and stickiness, which, in turn, provides more data points for more tailored services.</p><p>Looking ahead, Omdia expects the global wearables market to deliver modest single-digit growth in 2026, reflecting not only continued expansion in shipment volume but also a gradual shift in industry value dynamics. Growth will increasingly be driven by on-device AI advancements and the rising demand for more professional-grade sports and health management. Meaningful upgrade cycles will rely on real breakthroughs in substantive health monitoring capabilities. For leading smartwatch vendors, such as Apple, Samsung, and Huawei, progress in key physiological metrics, particularly blood glucose and blood pressure monitoring, will become the primary catalyst for renewed growth. Among the three major categories, smartwatches are expected to show the strongest momentum, combining advanced sensing, AI analytics, and deeper ecosystem connectivity to serve as the most scalable platform for AI agent integration. At the same time, improving subscription and service monetization is strengthening profitability and enabling reinvestment in technology and ecosystem development. Over time, competitive advantage will depend less on shipment scale alone and more on the depth of AI capability and the strength of cross-device ecosystem integration.</p><table cellspacing=\"0\"

Mutations enhance AMPK activity leading to abnormal glycogen accumulation in heart muscle cells leading to thickened heart muscles, electrical conduction problems, and arrhythmias. There are 1,000 – 2,000 people with PRKAG2 syndrome in the US. Current management is limited to symptomatic treatment; no approved therapies exist to address the underlying genetic driver of disease.</p><p><b>About PLN Cardiomyopathy</b></p><p>PLN (phospholamban) cardiomyopathy is a rare autosomal dominant, progressive cardiac disease caused by mutations in PLN, a key regulator of SERCA2a calcium pump. Pathogenic variants produce protein aggregates that disrupt endoplasmic reticulum processes and lead to dilated, arrhythmogenic, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathies and a significantly increased risk of heart failure and sudden cardiac death. There are 2,000 – 4,000 people with pathogenic PLN variants in the US. No approved therapies target the underlying molecular cause of the disease.</p><p><b>Forward-Looking Statements</b></p><p>This communication contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
