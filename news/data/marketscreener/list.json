Therefore, we must maintain the status quo with dignity and resolve, firmly opposing annexation, aggression, and the forced advancement of unification,\" he said.</p><p>\n              \"We reject 'one country, two systems' because we will forever uphold our free and democratic constitutional system,\" Lai added.</p><p>\n              China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>\n              No major political party in Taiwan supports China's \"one country, two systems\" idea.</p><p>\n              Lai said that the Republic of China - Taiwan's formal name - and the People's Republic of China are \"not subordinate\" to each other and that \"Taiwan's sovereignty cannot be violated or annexed\" and its future can only be decided by its people.</p><p>\n              \"The Taiwanese people safeguarding their sovereignty and preserving their democratic and free way of life should not be viewed as provocation. Investing in national defence is investing in peace.\"</p><p>\n              Lai has pledged to increase military spending to 5% of GDP by 2030, strengthening the island's defences in the face of a rising threat from its giant neighbour China.</p><p>\n              Lai was in Hukou for a commissioning ceremony for Taiwan's first battalion of M1A2T Abrams tanks, made by General Dynamics Land Systems, a unit of U.S. firm General Dynamics.</p><p>\n              Taiwan has so far received 80 of the 108 M1A2T tanks it ordered from the United States, the island's most important international backer and arms supplier despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties.</p><p>\n              The M1A2T tank can fire high explosive anti-tank warheads and kinetic energy ammunition, such as armor-piercing fin-stabilised discarding sabot.</p><p></p><p> (Reporting by Yi-Chin Lee; Writing by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Michael Perry)</p><p>\n            By Yi-Chin Lee</p></div>",
