This eSIM solution, powered by Thales Adaptive Connect (TAC), becomes a key part of AT&amp;T's global IoT solution, AT&amp;T Virtual Profile Management for IoT, and can support many industries worldwide including automotive, smart cities, healthcare and utilities. Compliant with the GSMA SGP.32 standard, the new solution enables customers to ship connected devices anywhere in the world with one single, pre-integrated eSIM from Thales, then seamlessly activate the correct local connectivity profile remotely, eliminating the need for any physical access to it.</p><p>This results in faster launches and simpler logistics for global IoT deployments. It also enables AT&amp;T and its customers to easily manage connectivity policies, diagnostics, and subscription changes entirely over the air, through a single unified industry-certified interface. This solution also adds advanced automation to simplify the remote eSIM management of large numbers of devices.</p><!-- Article --><p>It automates complex tasks--such as switching subscriptions or updating fleets rules--so enterprises can spend less time on logistics and operations, while bringing new products and services faster to market. The GSMA SGP.32standard the latest specification from the GSM Association for eSIM (embedded SIM) Remote SIM Provisioning (RSP), for the remote eSIM management of Internet of things (IoT) devices and other types of mobile device deployments. Thanks to these advanced features, Thales' eSIM solution (TAC) gives companies the flexibility to localize within AT&amp;T network partners or adjust devices' subscriptions across large fleets without hardware changes, helping optimize costs, supply chains, coverage, and performance.</p><p>The service is now available for commercial use and supports customers worldwide.</p></div>",
