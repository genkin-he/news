That was partially offset by growth for its HIV products and Livdelzi, a liver-disease treatment. Excluding Veklury, product sales were up 4%. </p><p>\n\n  Royalty, contract and other revenue streams meanwhile increased to $424 million from just $30 million a year earlier. </p><p>\n\n  Gilead reported quarterly profit of $3.05 billion, or $2.43 a share, compared with $1.25 billion, or $1 a share, last year. The year-earlier quarter included a pre-tax, in-process research and development impairment charge that didn't recur. </p><p>\n\n  Adjusted earnings were $2.47 a share. Analysts polled by FactSet had been expecting $2.13 a share. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-30-25 1642ET</p></div>",
