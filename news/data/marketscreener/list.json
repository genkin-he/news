Chronic hepatitis B is a major public health challenge, affecting more than 250 million people worldwide and nearly one million people in Japan. The current standard of care - nucleos(t)ide analogues - often requires lifelong therapy and the functional cure rates remain low, typically only 1%.</p><p>Functional cure occurs when the chronic hepatitis B virus DNA and viral protein - hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) - are at levels low enough to be undetectable in the blood for at least 24 weeks after stopping all treatment, and can be controlled by the immune system without medication. Functional cure is associated with significant reduction in the risk of long-term liver complications, including liver cancer. It is estimated that ~56% of liver cancer cases globally are caused by CHB.</p><!-- Article --><p>The regulatory submission is supported by positive results from the B-Well 1 and B-Well 2 Phase III trials, where bepirovirsen demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful functional cure rate. Functional cure rates were significantly higher with bepirovirsen plus standard of care compared with standard of care alone across all ranked endpoints, including in patients with lower baseline HBsAg levels where an even greater effect was observed. Bepirovirsen demonstrated an acceptable safety and tolerability profile consistent with previous studies.</p><p>The data are anticipated to be presented at a congress and submitted for scientific peer-reviewed publication in 2026. Bepirovirsen was granted SENKU designation in Japan in August 2024, reflecting its innovation and potential to address a disease with high unmet medical need. SENKU designation is intended to facilitate early patient access through an expedited regulatory review process.</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Robb M. Stewart </p><br/><p>\n  Toronto-Dominion Bank's earnings jumped in the first three months of its fiscal year as the big Canadian lender saw revenue growth across its operations, including record revenue in Canada on the back of a rise in loan and deposit volumes and strength in its wealth-management and markets-facing segments. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  Net income climbed to 4.04 billion Canadian dollars (US$2.96 billion), or C$2.34 a share, from C$2.79 billion, or C$1.55, a year earlier. </p><p>\n\n  Stripping out items that the bank doesn't believe reflect the underlying performance of its business, such as restructuring costs, first-quarter per-share earnings came in at C$2.44, well above the C$2.26 mean estimate of analysts polled by FactSet. </p><p>\n\n  Overall revenue was up 18% for the three months to Jan. 31 at C$16.59 billion, beating the C$14.52 billion expected. </p><p>\n\n  The rise in earnings for TD, Canada's second-largest bank by market value, was helped by a decline in the lender's provision for credit losses to C$1.04 billion from C$1.21 billion in the same period last year. Still, that was higher than the C$1.11 billion economists expected TD to have set aside in against the risk of loans defaulting, and it marked an increase of C$57 million from the final quarter of fiscal 2025. </p><p>\n\n  Compared with a year prior, TD said its provision on impaired loans declined about 4%, with lower provisions in the Canadian and U.S. commercial-banking segments and U.S. consumer-lending portfolios, while the bank recorded a recovery in its credit-loss provision on performing loans of C$125 million with a migration from performing to impaired in the wholesale and U.S. commercial-lending portfolios, as well as an improvement in its Canadian and U.S. macroeconomic forecasts. </p><p>\n\n  Across its business, revenue from Canadian personal and commercial banking was up 5.3% on a year earlier to C$5.42 billion. The operations saw volume growth and higher loan margins, with average loan volumes increasing about 5% and deposit volumes rising some 3% with increases in personal and business deposits. </p><p>\n\n  U.S. banking revenue jumped 39% to C$4.09 billion following recent balance-sheet restructuring efforts and a fall in credit-loss provisions. Wealth-management and insurance-division revenue increased 8.6% to C$3.91 billion and TD's wholesale-banking revenue advanced 24% to C$2.47 billion. </p><p>\n\n  TD capital position remained strong. Its common equity Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 14.5% as of the end of January, compared with 13.1% a year earlier. Canada's banking regulator requires the big lenders to maintain a capital ratio of at least 11.5% of risk-weighted assets. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Robb M.
