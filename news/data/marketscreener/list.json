            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  0913 GMT - Oil prices are headed for a monthly loss of nearly 3% ahead of Sunday's OPEC+ meeting. In early trade, Brent crude and WTI both slip 0.6% to $63.98 and $60.20 a barrel, respectively. The market has largely priced in a modest output increase of 137,000 barrels a day for December, but concerns over a growing supply glut continue to weigh on sentiment. Meanwhile, the trade agreement between the U.S. and China did little to resolve questions over Chinese purchases of Russian oil, analysts say. \"There has been no indication on the Chinese side as to whether they will stop buying,\" according to ANZ. \"There was also hope that China would agree to purchases of U.S. oil and gas as part of a broader U.S.-China deal.\" (giulia.petroni@wsj.com) </p><p>\n\n  -- </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  Gold Rises With Focus on U.S.-China Trade, Fed Rate-Cut Prospects -- Market Talk </p><p>\n\n  0847 GMT - Gold prices rise in early trading as investors digest the trade deal between the U.S. and China and the Federal Reserve's hawkish tone on December interest-rate cuts. Futures in New York are up 0.4% to $4,032.10 a troy ounce after retreating back below the $4,000 mark earlier this week, and are now set for monthly gains of more than 4%. \"We expect gold prices to remain elevated in the coming weeks, especially as central bank purchases remain high,\" analysts at BMI say. However, \"risks are slated to the downside as the Fed has downplayed the possibility of another cut in December and the trade deal between the U.S. and China has abated a lot of the uncertainty in the market.\" (giulia.petroni@wsj.com) </p><p>\n\n  -- </p><p>\n\n  Palm Oil Prices to Be Supported Near Term -- Market Talk </p><p>\n\n  0428 GMT - Prices of palm oil are expected to remain supported in the near term, underpinned by strong demand from India, BMI says in a note. Despite the commodity's narrowing price advantage over soybean oil, which could slow exports, BMI thinks palm oil remains competitively priced, providing a stable demand floor. BMI raises its 2025 average crude palm oil price forecast to 4,320 ringgit a ton from 4,150 ringgit a ton. Over the long term, slower production growth in Malaysia and Indonesia, due to land and environmental constraints, is expected to keep palm oil prices structurally firm, with a slight easing to 4,300 ringgit a ton in 2026, BMI adds.

Prices face near-term downward pressure as supply has been strong, with port inventories accumulating quickly, Nanhua Futures analysts say in a research note. Meanwhile, demand has been weighed amid a lack of policy support. Downward pressure may persist unless steel mills achieve large-scale production cuts, they note.

A trade deal between the two economies should stabilize relations, though underlying tensions remain unresolved, they say. Recent mine supply disruptions have weighed on Chinese smelters competing over shrinking supply flow, which prompts an industry association to urge Beijing to curb new capacity with stricter controls on projects, they note. Meanwhile, a stronger U.S. dollar weighs on investor appetite after Fed chair Powell warned investors need to rein in expectations for a December rate cut. The three-month LME copper contract climbs 0.4% to $10,958.00 a ton.

These include consistent central-bank allocation and investor buying of gold across various investment products, the head of markets strategy says. \"All these purchases of gold have one key common important motivation, i.e. the need for safe haven diversification of portfolio amidst the increasingly volatile de-dollarization narrative,\" he adds. UOB maintains its positive outlook for gold and raises price forecasts by $100/oz each to $4,000/oz by 4Q 2025, to $4,100/oz by 1Q 2026, to $4,200/oz by 2Q 2026, and to $4,300/oz by 3Q 2026.

(ronnie.harui@wsj.com) </p><p>\n\n  -- </p><p>\n\n  Palm Oil Outlook Neutral Despite U.S.-China Soybean Trade Resumption -- Market Talk </p><p>\n\n  0101 GMT - Palm oil prices are unlikely to be affected by the resumption of U.S.-China soybean trade, TA Securities analyst Angeline Chin says in a note. The two oils often move in tandem due to their use in similar products. While increased soybean oil supply could weigh on demand for crude palm oil, firm biodiesel demand under Indonesia's B50 mandate, seasonal monsoon-related production slowdown and lower Malaysian inventories should limit downside risks. Unless China significantly scales up its soybean imports from the U.S., the overall impact on palm oil fundamentals may remain limited, she adds. TA maintains a neutral rating on Malaysia's plantation sector. It rates United Malacca at buy, Kuala Lumpur Kepong at hold, and SD Guthrie and IOI at sell.

Futures on the London Metal Exchange are down 0.8% to $10,843 a metric ton after climbing above the $11,100 mark earlier this week. The U.S. dollar index--which measures the greenback against a basket of other major currencies--is up 0.3% to 99.81, making dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for international buyers. The pullback comes as traders assess the Federal Reserve's hawkish tone on December rate cuts and the U.S.-China trade agreement. Yet, copper is still headed for a weekly gain of more than 5%, supported by concerns over global supply following a series of disruptions at major mines this year. Investors will be watching upcoming sentiment indicators from China due early next week for signals on demand.

After spiking on U.S. sanctions against Russia's largest oil company, prices have retreated with higher OPEC+ output and weaker seasonal demand containing advances. While the \"overarching bearish balance outlook continues to accelerate,\" risk premiums still exist as Russian output is likely to be a key focus, analysts at Rystad Energy say in a note. Rystad raised its Brent price forecast for 4Q to $63 a barrel from $62 a barrel.

Zeller adds that with the government shut down, it will be difficult for traders and analysts to get confirmation of whether or not China is following through with promised purchases.

The market is \"transitioning away from storage oversupply fears toward a robust structural winter narrative,\" Eli Rubin of EBW Analytics says in a note.

The energy research firm estimates that between 500,000 and 600,000 barrels a day of Russian oil production could be curtailed in the next two months as a result of the latest U.S. sanctions, but the risk of immediate production shut-ins are extremely marginal at the moment. \"Given that any impact on Russian output will take time to materialize and with Moscow keen to project stability, it is unlikely Russia will oppose another modest OPEC+8 production increase,\" says Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis. \"For the Kremlin, staying composed and signaling control remain central to its strategy.\" In afternoon trade, Brent crude and WTI rise 0.5% to $64.69 and $60.94 a barrel, respectively.
