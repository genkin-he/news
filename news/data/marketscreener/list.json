In the third quarter of last year, the company reported revenue of C$14.2 billion. </p><p>\n\n  In its U.S. refining segment, crude throughput came to 605,300 barrels a day. Upstream production reached 832,900 barrels of oil equivalent a day, up from 771,300 a day a year ago, of which about 642,800 a day were from the oil sand segment. Analysts were expecting total production of about 830,500 barrels a day. </p><p>\n\n  Cenovus Energy recently reached a deal to acquire MEG Energy in a strategic move to expand its oil sands portfolio. The agreement included the divestiture of certain assets to Strathcona Resources, which was also in the running to acquire MEG. This proposed transaction, which will finally be voted on by MEG shareholders on Nov. 7, aims to consolidate Cenovus's position in thermal oil production in the competitive landscape of Canadian oil patch. </p><p>\n\n  For the full year, Cenovus lowered its output guidance to reflect the disposal of its 50% stake in WRB Refining LP, a joint venture with Phillips 66. It now expects downstream throughput of 510,000 barrels a day to 515,000 barrels a day, which represents a decrease of 52,500 barrels a day at the midpoint. </p><p>\n\n  Downstream turnaround expenses are now pegged at of $360 million to $380 million, lowered by $65 million at the midpoint. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Adriano Marchese at adriano.marchese@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-31-25 0652ET</p></div>",

Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected adjusted earnings of $1.82 a share. </p><p>\n\n  Exxon attributed the lower earnings to weaker crude prices, bottom-of-cycle chemical margins, higher depreciation, growth costs and lower base volumes stemming from divestments. </p><p>\n\n  These headwinds were partially offset by volume growth in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oil field, where the company said it set a production record of nearly 1.7 million oil-equivalent barrels per day. At the Exxon-led project in Guyana, quarterly production surpassed 700,000 barrels per day. </p><p>\n\n  Exxon said it sent $9.4 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Connor Hart at connor.hart@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-31-25 0648ET</p></div>",
