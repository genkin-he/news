This was the second time it has expanded its buyback program after initially approving 100 billion yen in November last year. </p><p>\n\n   The company now plans to repurchase up to 90 million shares by May, representing more than 1.5% of its outstanding shares. This is a substantial increase from the 55 million shares originally announced. </p><p>\n\n  Sony said it had launched the share buyback in a bid to improve capital efficiency. It added that the plan was expanded to allow more flexibility in repurchases, after considering the current pace of buybacks and stock market trends. </p><p>\n\n  The share price move may also reflect a shift in investor flows, as stocks of other gaming companies have also risen. </p><p>\n\n  \"Sony's stock increase is likely part of a broader movement to take profits on semiconductor-related stocks following Nvidia's earnings and to repurchase gaming-related stocks that had been recently sold off heavily,\" said Morningstar equity research director Kazunori Ito. </p><p>\n\n  Sony's shares, which outperformed other gaming stocks, gained even further in reaction to the share buyback expansion, he added. </p><p>\n\n  \"We are seeing rotation into laggards like...Sony that [had] been trading woefully with AI and semiconductor related names sucking in all the flows,\" with the shift expected to continue into March, said Andrew Jackson, head of Japan equity strategy at Ortus Advisors. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Jason Chau at jason.chau@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-26-26 2329ET</p></div>",

It has voting rights of 11.5% but with the option to boost that to more than 50% if Rapidus runs into any financial or operational problems. </p><p>\n\n  The initial capital injection will be deployed immediately, with an additional 150 billion yen earmarked in the upcoming budget, bringing the government's total equity commitment in Rapidus to 250 billion yen for the 2026 fiscal year. </p><p>\n\n  The move signals a shift toward a more aggressive industrial policy as Japan pushes to regain its footing in the global silicon arms race, industry analysts said. </p><p>\n\n  Japan has pinned its hopes on Rapidus, a state-backed venture established in 2022 with the mission of developing home-grown advanced chipmaking capacity. It has also been courting foreign companies, seeking to bring their expertise into the domestic ecosystem. </p><p>\n\n  Earlier this month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. finalized an agreement to produce 3-nanometer chips at its second Japanese facility in Kumamoto, an upgrade from previous plans for more mature nodes. </p><p>\n\n  That was a major leap for Japan, which doesn't yet have capacity to mass produce advanced chips essential for artificial intelligence. </p><p>\n\n  The government has been pushing to change that, backing projects like the Kumamoto expansion, which provides a high-volume manufacturing baseline for the country. Rapidus meanwhile is focused on the even more ambitious goal of making 2-nanometer logic chips. </p><p>\n\n  To further safeguard its investment in the state-backed venture, the government will hold a so-called \"golden share\" in Rapidus, granting it veto power over board decisions to protect against economic security risks and foreign influence. </p><p>\n\n  A combined $1.07 billion investment pledge in Rapidus from 32 companies reflects renewed interest from the private sector too. </p><p>\n\n  The investment pool, which includes contributions from a broad range of domestic industry leaders, surpassed the government's initial projections for private funding. </p><p>\n\n  The capital commitment \"exceeds the initial target of 130 billion yen,\" a sign that \"expectations for the project are clearly mounting\", Akazawa said. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Yang Jie at jie.yang@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-26-26 2325ET</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>Feb 27 (Reuters) - Cross-border fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan intensified overnight, with both sides claiming heavy losses and the Pakistani defence minister saying his country was in an \"open war\" with its neighbour.</p><p>\n              As tensions persist, here is a look at how Pakistan dwarfs Afghanistan's military forces and arsenals, according to data from the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.    </p><!-- Article --><p><b>OVERVIEW </b></p><p>\n              Pakistan's armed forces benefit from good recruitment and retention, bolstered by equipment from its main defence partner China. Islamabad continues to invest in its military nuclear programmes and is also modernising its navy and air force. </p><p>\n              The capability of the Afghan Taliban's armed forces, meanwhile, is declining, with a fall in their ability to use foreign equipment that the Islamist group seized when it returned to power in the landlocked country in 2021.</p><p>\n              A lack of international recognition for the Taliban administration has also hurt military modernisation. </p><p><b>PERSONNEL </b></p><p>\n              Pakistan has 660,000 active personnel in its defence forces, of whom 560,000 are in the army, 70,000 are in the air force, and 30,000 are in the navy.  </p><p>\n              The strength of the Afghan Taliban's military is thinner, with only 172,000 active personnel. The group has, however, announced plans to expand its armed forces to 200,000 personnel. </p><p><b>FIGHTING VEHICLES AND ARTILLERY</b></p><p>\n              Pakistan has more than 6,000 armoured fighting vehicles, and over 4,600 pieces of artillery. </p><p>\n              The Afghan forces also possess armoured fighting vehicles, including Soviet-era main battle tanks, armoured personnel carriers and autonomous underwater vehicles, but their exact number is unknown. </p><p>\n              The precise number of artillery they possess, which is of at least three different types, is similarly not known. </p><p><b>AIR FORCE</b></p><p>\n              Pakistan has a fleet of 465 combat aircraft and more than 260 helicopters that include multi-role, attack and transport choppers.</p><p>\n              Afghanistan has no fighter jets and no real air force to speak of. It is known to possess at least six aircraft - some of them dating back again to the Soviet era - and 23 helicopters, although it is not possible to assess how many are in flying condition.</p><p><b>NUCLEAR ARSENAL </b></p><p>\n              While Pakistan is a nuclear-armed country and has 170 warheads, Afghanistan does not have a nuclear arsenal.</p><p>\n               (Compiled by Sakshi Dayal; Editing by YP Rajesh and Raju Gopalakrishnan)</p></div>",
