Although negotiations are still at an early stage, the news was enough to spark activity on the Milan Stock Exchange, where TIM shares rose by 4.8%. This suggests that the market is betting on the consolidation of a fragmented and fiercely competitive sector, Il Sole notes.</p><p></p><p>\nIliad Italia could be valued at over EUR3 billion. Among the options under consideration are a joint venture with Wind Tre or the transfer of Italian operations in exchange for a stake in a European spin-off that CK Hutchison is reportedly preparing. However, the French group has repeatedly stated it is only interested in deals that offer concrete industrial benefits and a leading role, the newspaper adds.</p><p></p><p>\nBoth companies have declined to comment on the rumors. Any restructuring, however, will have to contend with Brussels: following the 2016 Wind-3 merger, the EU imposed a moratorium on new mergers until 2026, facilitating Iliad's entry to ensure competition.</p><p></p><p>\nAccording to Agcom, Wind Tre holds a 24% share of the mobile market and Iliad 10.9%; combined, they would surpass Fastweb+Vodafone, which together have 30%, while TIM remains the market leader with 26.6%.</p><p></p><p>\nBy Claudia Cavaliere, Alliance News reporter</p><p></p><p>\nComments and questions to redazione@alliancenews.com</p><p></p><p>\nCopyright 2025 Alliance News IS Italian Service Ltd.

The dollar and U.S. Treasurys were flat. Gold and oil futures were lower. </p><p>\n\n     Equities: </p><p>\n\n     European equity futures were lower after post-earnings slumps in Meta Platforms and Microsoft shares weighed on major stock indexes on Wall Street. </p><p>\n\n     Investors gave a thumbs down to Meta's plans to spend even more to stay in the artificial-intelligence race, marking the stock's biggest one-day decline in more than three years. </p><p>\n\n     Yields on Meta's bonds jumped after the company said it was looking to raise at least $25 billion from a jumbo debt sale. Increased spending plans also cast a shadow over an otherwise-stellar Microsoft earnings report. </p><p>\n\n     \"None of these companies can keep up this huge spending on AI forever,\" said David Trainer, chief executive of New Constructs, an investment-research firm. </p><p>\n\n     Forex: </p><p>\n\n     The European Central Bank is seen by some analysts as needing to do more to support growth and offset the impact of a strong euro. </p><p>\n\n     The currency's rise has revived concerns about too-low inflation in the eurozone, because it makes imports cheaper. If the Fed keeps cutting rates, as widely expected by investors, it could amplify the pressure, by boosting the relative appeal of the euro. </p><p>\n\n     \"Even if the ECB still tries to make us believe that it's done cutting rates, I am convinced that the Fed's rate cuts, a strengthening euro, and the delayed impact from U.S. tariffs could still force the ECB to cut rates in December or early next year,\" said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING in Frankfurt. </p><p>\n\n     Bonds: </p><p>\n\n     U.S. Treasury yields held steady as traders pared bets on an interest-rate cut in December after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said one was far from a done deal. </p><p>\n\n     Powell's statement \"caught the market a little off-guard as it reduced visibility into future rate cuts and highlighted a growing divide among policymakers,\" Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, wrote to clients. </p><p>\n\n     Energy: </p><p>\n\n     Oil fell in the early trading session. \"The market is now watching this weekend's OPEC+ meeting and discussions of its output policy,\" said ANZ Research analysts in a research report. </p><p>\n\n     \"The U.S. sanctions on Russian oil companies significantly lift risks to supply,\" the analysts said. </p><p>\n\n     This could prompt OPEC+ to approve another increase of 137,000 barrels per day in supply for December, the analysts added. </p><p>\n\n     Metals: </p><p>\n\n     Gold edged lower, paring some of the overnight gains seen amid prospects of continued central-bank demand. </p><p>\n\n     Central-bank purchases of the precious metal climbed 28% on quarter to an estimated net 220 tons in 3Q, the World Gold Council said in a report. </p><p>\n\n     \"Central banks are likely to continue their buying spree,\" it said, adding that \"demand has broadened, with hitherto dormant banks becoming active.\" </p><p>\n\n     - </p><p>\n\n     Iron ore fell as prices face near-term downward pressure as supply has been strong, with port inventories accumulating quickly, said Nanhua Futures analysts in a research note. </p><p>\n\n     Meanwhile, demand has been weighed amid a lack of policy support. Downward pressure may persist unless steel mills achieve large-scale production cuts, they noted. </p><p>\n\n     TODAY'S TOP HEADLINES </p><p>\n\n     China Factory Activity Gauge Signals Deepening Manufacturing Gloom </p><p>\n\n     China's economic momentum continued to weaken, with a manufacturing gauge signaling mounting headwinds for the world's second-largest economy. </p><p>\n\n     The official manufacturing purchasing managers index saw a sharp drop to 49.0 in October, from 49.8 in September, putting it below the 50 threshold that separates an expansion in activity from a contraction for seven straight months. </p><p>\n\n     U.S.-China Truce Brings Little Peace for Businesses Caught in Superpower Standoff </p><p>\n\n     After a face-to-face with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, President Trump said the meeting wasn't just nice, it was a 12 on a scale of one to 10. </p><p>\n\n     But for businesses caught between the two superpowers, the ugly reality remains: The U.S. and China haven't addressed their underlying conflicts. Commerce is going to be rocky for years to come. </p><p>\n\n     Federal Reserve to Reduce Bank Supervision Staff by 30% </p><p>\n\n     Federal Reserve officials are planning to reduce the staff of its banking supervision arm by 30% by the end of next year, according to an internal memo seen by The Wall Street Journal. </p><p>\n\n     The reductions would leave the Fed's supervision and regulation division with about 350 people, down from a previously authorized head count of 500, according to the memo. The cuts were announced by the Fed's new top regulatory official, Vice Chair Michelle Bowman, during a morning meeting. </p><p>\n\n     Hezbollah Is Rearming, Putting Cease-Fire at Risk </p><p>\n\n     Lebanese militant group Hezbollah is rebuilding its armaments and battered ranks, defying the terms of a cease-fire agreement and raising the prospect of renewed conflict with Israel, according to people familiar with Israeli and Arab intelligence. </p><p>\n\n     The intelligence shows Iranian-backed Hezbollah is restocking rockets, antitank missiles and artillery, the people said. Some of those weapons are coming in via seaports and weakened but still functional smuggling routes through Syria, some of the people said. Hezbollah is manufacturing some new weapons itself, one of the people said. </p><p>\n\n     The ECB and Fed Are Going in Different Directions. Can It Last? </p><p>\n\n     The European Central Bank held interest rates steady on Thursday, as investors question whether the institution's most aggressive easing campaign since the financial crisis is really done. </p><p>\n\n     The ECB held its key interest rate at 2%, where it has been since June. The central bank cut rates by 2 percentage points in a year before hitting pause over the summer. </p><p>\n\n     Disney Channels Go Dark on YouTube TV </p><p>\n\n     Disney channels including ESPN, ABC and FX vanished from Google's YouTube TV platform after the two sides failed to come to terms on a new distribution agreement. </p><p>\n\n     The channels went dark in roughly 10 million homes shortly before midnight Eastern time. Disney and YouTube TV had held contentious negotiations leading up to the channels being removed. The deadline to reach a deal was 11:59 p.m. ET on Thursday. </p><p>\n\n     Big Tech Is Spending More Than Ever on AI and It's Still Not Enough </p><p>\n\n     Silicon Valley's biggest companies are already planning to pour $400 billion into artificial intelligence efforts this year. They all say it's nowhere near enough. </p><p>\n\n     Meta Platforms says it is still running up against capacity constraints as it tries to train new AI models and power its existing products at the same time. Microsoft says it is seeing so much customer demand for its data-center-driven services that it plans to double its data-center footprint in the next two years. And Amazon.com says it is racing to bring more cloud capacity online as soon as it can. </p><p>\n\n     Write to singaporeeditors@dowjones.com </p><p>\n\n     Expected Major Events for Friday </p><p>\n\n     05:30/NED: Oct Flash Estimate CPI </p><p>\n\n     06:00/FIN: Sep Retail sales </p><p>\n\n     07:00/TUR: Sep Foreign Trade </p><p>\n\n     07:00/GER: Sep Retail Trade </p><p>\n\n     07:00/GER: Sep Foreign trade price indices </p><p>\n\n     07:00/UK: Oct Nationwide House Price Index </p><p>\n\n     07:30/HUN: Sep PPI </p><p>\n\n     07:30/SWI: Sep Retail Sales </p><p>\n\n     07:45/FRA: Sep PPI </p><p>\n\n     07:45/FRA: Oct Provisional CPI </p><p>\n\n     10:00/ITA: Oct Provisional CPI </p><p>\n\n     10:00/ITA: Oct Cities CPI </p><p>\n\n     10:00/LUX: Sep PPI </p><p>\n\n     10:00/EU: Oct Flash Estimate euro area inflation </p><p>\n\n     10:00/GRE: Aug Turnover Index in Retail Trade </p><p>\n\n     10:00/CYP: Sep PPI </p><p>\n\n     11:00/POR: Sep Industrial production index </p><p>\n\n     15:59/UKR: Sep POSTPONED: Industrial Production </p><p>\n\n     16:59/SPN: Sep Budget deficit </p><p>\n\n     16:59/BEL: Sep PPI </p><p>\n\n     16:59/SPN: Aug Monthly Balance of Payments </p><p>\n\n     All times in GMT.

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Jason Chau </p><br/><p>\n  PetroChina's shares rose after the Chinese oil-and-gas major reported  earnings, with its Hong Kong stock touching a more than one-year high. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  The company's H-shares climbed 2.5% to HK$8.17 on Friday morning, before paring gains. The stock has gained 33% so far this year and is on track to close at its highest level since July 2024. </p><p>\n\n  Its Shanghai-listed stock was last 0.6% higher. </p><p>\n\n  The gains come after PetroChina reported an on-year drop in third-quarter profit, but a rise in revenue, and steady crude production of crude oil and natural gas. </p><p>\n\n  PetroChina remains Citi's top pick in China's oil-and-gas sector, analysts Oscar Yee and Desmond Law said in a report. </p><p>\n\n  The company's profit rose 14% on the quarter and its nine-month results have hit 84% of Citi's full-year estimates. </p><p>\n\n  The results underline the strength of PetroChina's natural gas marketing, which delivered a 50% on-year surge in earnings before interest and taxes, the analysts said. </p><p>\n\n  They think seasonally strong natural gas earnings in the fourth quarter could cushion against oil price weakness, and see limited impact on the company from tighter U.S. energy sanctions on Russia. </p><p>\n\n  Long term, PetroChina will likely be a key beneficiary of China's growing demand for natural gas due to its sourcing capabilities, they added. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Jason Chau at jason.chau@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-31-25 0113ET</p></div>",

Last year, labour unions at major automakers set pay hike targets in December.</p><p>\n              Ueda may also heed to mounting pressure from within his nine-member board to act sooner rather than later. Two board members repeated their proposal, made in September, to hike rates to 0.75%, on Thursday.</p><p>\n              U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has recently chimed in, urging the government of new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who is known as an advocate of loose monetary policy, to allow the BOJ to raise rates and avoid excessive yen declines.</p><p>\n              \"A hawkish bloc has solidified within the BOJ policy board\" with the hawks having \"an external advocate pushing for monetary tightening\" in Bessent, said Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC, who predicts a rate hike in December.</p><p>\n              \"As a new prime minister, it may even be advantageous for Takaichi to get the rate hike out of the way early on in her tenure,\" he added.</p><p><b>YEN COMPLICATES TIMING</b></p><p>\n              To be sure, the BOJ may opt to play it safe by waiting until its January 22-23 meeting, as most big manufacturers firm up wage plans at the start of the year, some analysts say.</p><p>\n              By then, there will be more clarity on the Takaichi administration's budget plans and economic policies. The BOJ, too, can offer a more thorough analysis justifying a rate hike in a quarterly report due after the January meeting.</p><p>\n              In the end, however, the timing may depend much on yen moves as a renewed slide in the currency would push up import costs and broader inflation, some analysts say.</p><p>\n              The yen fell to a nearly nine-month low against the dollar on Thursday despite Ueda's hawkish comments. Data on Friday showed core consumer inflation in Japan's capital, a leading indicator of nationwide trends, perked up in October and remained above the central bank's 2% target.</p><p>\n              Further rises in the cost of living would run counter to Takaichi's pledge to cushion households' blow from inflation.</p><p>\n              Former BOJ executive Akira Otani expects the BOJ to hike rates in January, when enough data becomes available on whether companies will weather the tariff hit and keep hiking pay. But he cites the yen as potentially changing the timing.</p><p>\n              \"At present, we don't see a strong chance of a December rate increase,\" said Otani, currently managing director at Goldman Sachs Japan. \"But the possibility could heighten if yen falls accelerate and increase the risk of inflation overshooting the BOJ's baseline forecast made in October.\"</p><p></p><p> (Reporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Kim Coghill)</p><p>\n            By Leika Kihara</p></div>",
