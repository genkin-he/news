The cells will supply its battery energy storage business in Gdansk, Poland, which it also bought out of the Northvolt bankruptcy.</p><p>\n              Northvolt's main customers included Volkswagen, BMW and Volvo Cars, but Lyten's chief sustainability and marketing officer Keith Norman said winning back automakers will take time.</p><p>\n              \"It's a wonderful market to be in, but it's a very difficult market to get into because it just takes time, rightly so,\" he said. \"They need consistency, and that requires spending a large amount of time testing and validating and working with them.\"</p><p>\n              Automotive qualification can take years, though Norman said Lyten hopes the process will move faster because former Northvolt customers already know the cells.</p><p>\n              For now, the company is targeting sectors such as battery-energy storage, data centres and defence.</p><p>\n              \"Some of the other markets that we're looking at ... we can get cells in customers' hands in large-scale commercial quantities much more quickly. And so that's how we're thinking about really balancing the focus of the plant,\" Norman said. </p><p>\n              He added that Lyten expects to hire more than 600 employees in the coming months.  </p><p>\n              Truckmaker Scania, a former Northvolt customer and close partner, said it was still too early to say whether it would place orders with Lyten. </p><p>\n              Lyten also said it had sold a data-centre site in Skelleftea to EdgeConneX, a portfolio company of EQT.</p><p>\n              Completion of the deal was delayed from the original mid-October timeline. Lyten said on Friday that the purchase was financed through investments from European and U.S. investors as well as capital from the EdgeConneX transaction.</p><p>\n               (Reporting by Stine Jacobsen.

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Dow Jones Newswires Staff </p><br/><p>\n  U.S. futures fell in early European trade as investors continued to pull back from risk at the end of a volatile month. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  Traders reacted negatively to Nvidia's earnings Thursday as hand-wringing over the delicate artificial-intelligence ecosystem troubled tech investors. The tech-driven surge in South Korea's Kospi was checked Thursday after the index had gained for six consecutive sessions. Meanwhile, concerns around private credit quality and renewed trade uncertainty weighed on market confidence more broadly. </p><p>\n\n  Safe haven assets saw a boost. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields slipped below 4% to a three-month low, while gold is on track for a 4% weekly gain. </p><p>\n\n  Oil rose, holding above $71 a barrel as investors remained cautious around potential risks to supply in the Middle East, even after positive signals from U.S-Iran talks Thursday. Talks between the two countries will continue next week. </p><br/><p>\n  --Equity futures in the U.S. pointed to another day of selling Friday. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 were down 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average--which closed flat Thursday--fell 0.4%. Futures for the tech-heavy Nasdaq nudged down 0.1%, with shares in cloud computing company CoreWeave falling 9.4% premarket after it announced earnings. </p><p>\n\n  Nvidia gained 0.8% premarket after falling 5.5% Thursday. 'Big Short' investor Michael Burry flagged concerns over a rise in Nvidia's purchase obligations, which he said could tie the chip maker to paying for unused capacity. \"A year ago, the same commitment would have been considered bullish,\" Swissquote's Ipek Ozkardeskaya said. \"Today, the interpretation has flipped on fears that AI capex could slow and leave Nvidia with excess capacity. This looks like peak-cycle behavior.\" </p><br/><p>\n   --Asian markets were mixed on the last day of February trading. South Korea's Kospi finished 1.0% lower, snapping a six-session winning streak, though the index rose 20% for the month. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average closed 0.2% higher. Economic data earlier in the day firmed up rate-hike hopes, despite some reservations over recent days about political pressure deterring Bank of Japan normalization. That gave a little lift to the yen, combining with haven buying and continued trade uncertainty. </p><p>\n\n  The Shanghai Composite in China ended 0.4% higher, though the tech-heavy ChiNext index ended down 1.0%. The yuan softened after the People's Bank of China cut shorting costs for the currency. Markets are looking to China's Two Sessions next week for more clues into Beijing's policy path in the year head. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed up 0.95%, led by real estate stocks such as Sun Hung Kai Properties and Hang Lung Properties. India's Sensex fell 0.8% ahead of GDP data. </p><br/><p>\n  --European indexes were largely higher at the open as basic-materials stocks across the continent gained. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 rose 0.35% as miners climbed, with gold and silver miner Fresnillo up 5.6%. Barclays slipped 1% after the collapse of a mortgage-finance company for which the bank arranged loans. Blue-chip indexes in Germany and France both struggled for direction, trading flat. Chemicals company BASF slipped 3.2%, though energy stocks gain in Frankfurt, while in Paris gains for energy group Schneider Electric--up 1.3%--countered a slip in utilities. The Italian FTSE MIB edged up 0.2% as electricity infrastructure company Prysmian climbed 4%, though Banca MPS slipped 2.2% after earnings. Spain's IBEX 35 was up 0.1% as construction group Acciona surged 7.4%. </p><br/><p>\n  --The dollar fell against a basket of currencies as tensions between the U.S. and Iran and tariff uncertainty leave investors cautious. Falls are limited as a drop in U.S. tech stocks stoked risk aversion. Still, investors remained wary of buying the dollar amid concerns about tariff policies, central bank independence and geopolitical interventions, including in Iran. Demand from international investors to hedge their U.S. assets against the risk of a dollar decline still \"plays a significant role,\" said BNY's Bob Savage in a note. U.S. producer price data for January will be watched at 1330 GMT. The DXY dollar index fell 0.2% to 97.63, although it remained within its recent tight trading range. </p><p>\n\n  Sterling fell to a 10-week low against the euro after the U.K.'s ruling Labour Party lost a one-off special district election, raising fresh concerns about a leadership challenge for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The euro rose to 0.8764 pounds, LSEG data show. Sterling falls 0.1% to $1.3461. </p><br/><p>\n  --The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield slipped to a three-month low just below 4% in Asian trade as investors remained attentive to geopolitical developments. \"The latest round of U.S.-Iran talks in Geneva acted as a catalyst to trim down risk across the board,\" said Pepperstone's Michael Brown in a note. However, a sustainable fall below the 4% handle isn't in sight, at least for now. \"We do remain, just about, within the longer-run range here,\" the senior research strategist said. Should the 10-year yield trade under 4.00% on a closing basis, that would give U.S. Treasury bulls some degree of control in the near term, he said. The 10-year Treasury yield was last trading at 3.997%, down 1.9 basis points, according to Tradeweb. </p><p>\n\n  Yields on U.K. government bonds, or gilts, edged higher after the special election in Gorton and Denton revived political unease within the ruling Labour Party. Ten-year gilt yields were marginally higher at 4.282% after rising to 4.290% as the market opened. </p><br/><p>\n  --Bitcoin rose marginally but continued to struggle for a meaningful recovery after U.S. stocks closed mostly lower overnight. The cryptocurrency edged up 0.2% to $67,622, LSEG data showed. </p><br/><p>\n  --Oil prices rose as investors digested news that the U.S. and Iran will resume discussions next week after the latest round of talks wrapped up on Thursday without a deal. Brent crude rose 0.9% to $71.45 a barrel, while WTI was up 0.7% to $65.32 a barrel. Discussions \"on a technical level\" will take place next week in Vienna, Oman's Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi said in a post on X. However, markets remained on edge as any potential escalation of tensions could disrupt energy flows. Traders were also awaiting OPEC+'s meeting on Sunday for signals on future production policy. </p><br/><p>\n  --Gold prices were broadly steady in early trading, but are headed for a weekly gain of nearly 4% on news that the U.S. and Iran will continue discussions next week. Futures in New York were flat at $5,193.60 a troy ounce. \"Gold's role as a hedge against geopolitical and policy shocks is once again in focus,\" said Ewa Manthey from ING. At record prices, buyers are becoming more price sensitive, so short-term pullbacks or consolidation are to be expected. However, the main drivers of the rally--central bank diversification, geopolitical tensions, possible policy easing, and renewed ETF demand--remain strong, according to market watchers. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Barcelona Editors at barcelonaeditors@dowjones.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-27-26 0500ET</p></div>",

But the Chinese announcement made no mention of canola seed tariffs, which Carney had previously said would be lowered by March 1.</p><p>\n              Ottawa expected Beijing to lower canola seed tariffs to a combined rate of about 15% from the current 84%. A probe into Canadian canola is set to conclude on March 9, the Chinese commerce ministry has said.</p><p>\n              \"One thing we do know is that Chinese buyers have been booking Canadian canola cargoes for March already. That gives me a pretty high degree of confidence that they're going to follow through on the reduced tariff rate,\" said Even Rogers Pay, director at Beijing-based consultancy Trivium China. </p><p>\n              Canola oil and pork were also not mentioned in the statement. But Beijing could still announce further adjustments by the March 1 deadline previewed by Carney.</p><p>\n              China was Canada's second largest market for canola in 2024.</p><p>\n              The suspensions come amid a wave of visits to Beijing by Western leaders as U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies have strained Washington's traditional alliances. China has sought to present itself as a more stable and reliable economic partner in contrast.</p><p>\n              Carney went further than his European counterparts by securing a deal with China and signalling Canada's ambition to play a leading role in a new global trade order aimed at reducing dependence on the United States.</p><p>\n              During his China trip, Carney pledged to allow into Canada up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles at a tariff of 6.1% on most-favoured-nation terms.</p><p>\n               (Reporting by Ella Cao, Xiuhao Chen, Daphne Zhang and Lewis Jackson; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Gareth Jones)</p></div>",

This research will leverage Cowellnex?s independently acquired, high-precision gut microbiota data obtained through shotgun metagenomic analysis*1?one of Japan?s most detailed gut microbiota tests?accumulated over approximately three years through its ?MicroBio Me?*2 service. The companies aim to commercialize and introduce the resulting new testing services to the market in the future. Gut microbiota has been gaining attention in recent years from a health maintenance perspective. However, because the composition (types and ratios) of gut bacteria varies greatly among individuals, dietary approaches also differ. As a result, indicators that show the desired state of gut microbiota for each person and concrete action guidelines are not yet sufficiently developed. The commonly used 16S rRNA gene analysis*3 helps grasp broad bacterial classifications but provides limited information compared with shotgun metagenomic analysis. Furthermore, methods academically established for test items or food recommendations based on gut microbiota data specifically for Japanese individuals currently do not exist. Against this backdrop, expectations are increasing for more accurate gut microbiota testing and for testing items and personalized food recommendations based on such data. In the MicroBio Me business operated by Cowellnex, the company has accumulated highly precise data over approximately three years using shotgun metagenomic analysis, one of the most detailed gut microbiota tests available in Japan. Leveraging these data, Cowellnex will create new test parameters that take into account the characteristics of the gut environment of Japanese people, and will develop an algorithm (mechanism) that proposes foods based on those parameters. In this joint research, Cowellnex will be responsible for providing data, formulating hypotheses for test parameters and food recommendations, and conducting acceptability verification. Metagen will be responsible for conducting metabolic pathway analysis based on its expertise in gut environment research and bioinformatics, as well as for developing the algorithm (mechanism) for food recommendations. Through this joint research, it will become possible not only to identify which gut bacteria are present but also to predict the overall capability of the gut environment?including interactions among gut bacteria?to produce beneficial metabolites. A series of consecutive chemical reactions along metabolic pathways carried out by gut bacteria. Through these processes, dietary fiber is broken down and various metabolites are produced.<br/>\nCowellnex plans to commercialize the results of this joint research as new testing services and launch them in the market. Even after the research concludes, Cowellnex will continue accumulating data and studying ways to utilize them, contributing to improving testing accuracy and developing ingredients that help regulate gut microbiota. By leveraging its strength in high-precision data obtained through shotgun metagenomic analysis, Cowellnex will accelerate innovation in the gut microbiota domain and create a market for personalized gut health solutions based on gut microbiota composition.\n    \n    </div>",

Discovery (WBD) said a new $111 billion offer from Paramount Skydance (PSKY) is a better deal for shareholders than the one it agreed to earlier with Netflix (NFLX). Netflix will now have four business days to come up with a new proposal that beats Paramount or it will lose the fight for one of the industry's oldest film and TV studios. Paramount has offered $31 a share for all of Warner Bros. while Netflix has bid $27.75 a share for the company's studios and HBO business. Paramount Chief Executive Officer David Ellison has been pursuing Warner Bros. for months, efforts that prompted the parent of HBO and CNN to put itself up for sale in October. After Warner Bros. signed a deal in early December with Netflix, Paramount kept up the fight.

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Elena Vardon </p><br/><p>\n  Swiss Re's shares traded higher after the reinsurer paired its quarterly results with a surprise $1 billion share buyback, signaling a more aggressive stance on capital returns. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  The Zurich-based group on Friday said that it would repurchase $1.5 billion of its own shares over the course of the year. The program includes the introduction of a recurring annual $500 million buyback as announced late last year, plus the $1 billion top up. </p><p>\n\n  The stock climbed around 5% in early trading to hit its highest level since before a December investor day that had weighed on shares. </p><p>\n\n  J.P. Morgan analysts described the unexpected extra buyback as \"the culmination of a number of resilience building activities and strong [Swiss Solvency Test ratio].\" The move reflects a pattern of proactive capital management often seen as pricing cycles soften, where underwriters prioritize capital returns over chasing volume, Jefferies wrote in a note to clients. </p><p>\n\n  Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods struck a more cautious note and questioned the sustainability of such payouts as the total capital return slightly exceeded net operating capital generation for the year. </p><p>\n\n  For the full year, Swiss Re reported a 47% jump in net profit to a record $4.8 billion, beating its own guidance of more than $4.4 billion for 2025. The increase was driven by disciplined underwriting and a benign catastrophe environment in its property and casualty units, which helped offset a weaker showing in its life and health business. </p><p>\n\n  Performance in the last three months of the year was more nuanced. Swiss Re's net income reached $717 million, beating the company-compiled consensus of $687 million but falling sharply from the $1.05 billion recorded a year earlier. The top-line was also softer as insurance revenue slipped 6% to $11.14 billion while its investment result fell 12% to $966 million, with both metrics trailing consensus expectations. </p><p>\n\n  The quarterly print was weighed down by a review of underperforming life and health portfolios in Australia, Israel and South Korea. Swiss Re had warned this would shave off $250 million from its fourth-quarter earnings, leading it to miss its the division's annual profit target.

The company maintained its $4.5 billion net profit target for 2026, which includes a $1.7 billion contribution from the rehabilitated life and health business. </p><p>\n\n  In addition to the buybacks, the board proposed a 9% increase to its annual dividend to $8.0 per share. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Elena Vardon at elena.vardon@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-27-26 0439ET</p></div>",
