He was released on bail six months later, after which he resigned as chief minister.</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party had dismissed the allegations as \"a desperate attempt to malign his image\" ahead of national and Delhi elections.</p><p>\n              The AAP lost the Delhi election in February 2025, handing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party controls of the national capital territory for the first time in 27 years. Kejriwal, 58, had earlier won three straight elections in Delhi. </p><p>\n              \"We have always said the truth prevails,\" Kejriwal told reporters outside the Rouse Avenue district court, with tears in his eyes. \"They slapped a false case on us but the court said that we are fiercely honest.\"</p><p>\n              The CBI said it planned to appeal the ruling, stating that \"several aspects of investigation have either been ignored or not considered adequately.\" The Enforcement Directorate, which is separately examining the case, had also been pursuing charges against Kejriwal.</p><p>\n              The CBI alleges that the liquor policy implemented by Kejriwal's government gave unfair advantages to private retailers. Kejriwal and his colleagues have denied the charges.</p><p>\n              The court order also exonerated 22 other individuals, including Kejriwal's former deputy Manish Sisodia, said lawyer Sumer Singh Boparai, who represented one of the accused. The trial court's full order is yet to be published.</p><p></p><p>(Reporting by Arpan  Chaturvedi, editing by Andrei Khalip)</p></div>",

Analysts think the developments could be positive for economies like India that faced higher levies compared to their peers. </p><p>\n\n  Deepali Bhargava, ING's regional head of research for Asia-Pacific highlighted India and China as potential beneficiaries from the ruling, as it likely means that they will face lower tariffs than before. </p><p>\n\n  \"Trump had already lowered the punitive 50% tariff on India to 18%, and the elimination of [International Emergency Economic Powers Act] surcharges takes this relief a step further,\" she wrote in a note. It could also give India a bit more leverage when finalizing the trade deal with the U.S. </p><p>\n\n  That said, uncertainty still looms large for global trade. </p><p>\n\n  \"We expect U.S. trade policy...to become increasingly complex and more targeted resulting in a patchwork of tariff measures and trade agreements,\" BNP Paribas Equity Research said, as the Trump administration seeks to use other measures to retain higher tariffs. </p><p>\n\n  Even if tariffs are reset, India's continued growth last year suggests that it can weather the storm. The country has also been striking trade deals with other partners, including the EU, giving it access to more markets on better terms. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Kimberley Kao at kimberley.kao@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-27-26 0615ET</p></div>",

The solution is designed to simplify and automate operations, improve network performance, and accelerate the transition toward autonomous networks. The platform provides a level of control to the telecom operator through operator-defined policies and application to enable fully automated RAN deployment and operations.</p><p>As RANs evolve, telecom operators are managing increasingly complex RAN environments. These typically span multiple vendors, technologies, and generations. For operators, this complexity constrains agility and increases operational expenditure.</p><!-- Article --><p>One approach to solve this is Open RAN (O-RAN), a concept seeking to create open, intelligent and interoperable RANs. Capgemini and Deutsche Telekom have developed a platform for Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) that operates consistently across O-RAN but also legacy RAN environments, including 5G and 4G for Deutsche Telekom's European segments. This enables operators to modernize incrementally, protect prior investments, and adopt automation at scale without disrupting live networks.</p><p>With multi-vendor RAN management, the platform also reduces operators' dependency on proprietary vendor solutions. A key differentiator of the platform is its open architecture: It supports a full ecosystem of rApps - applications that can automate RAN functions using AI or digital twins. These capabilities are built on Radio Intelligent Controllers (RIC) that can be deployed on hyperscaler platforms or private telco clouds.</p><p>This paves the way for an \"application marketplace\" that can host and certify third-party applications, providing operators with flexibility and architectural choice. By enabling operators to define their own policies, automate operational workflows, and accelerate service innovation such as network optimization, intelligent coverage and network slicing, the solution delivers tangible business outcomes: improved network efficiency, faster service rollout, and reduced operational complexity without vendor lock-in. Capgemini and Deutsche telekom will showcase the solution at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, demonstrating a unified RAN operations dashboard, real-time topology visualization, multi-vendor rApp deployment, AI-driven optimization, rApp conflict management, and rapid rApp development using modular templates.</p><p>The demonstration highlights how ecosystem collaboration and open platforms can translate advanced RAN intelligence into operational reality.</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>NEW YORK, Feb 27 (Reuters) - On paper, American consumers spent last year tightening their belts, and even retail heavyweights stumbled. But sit-down restaurants and some drive-through chains buzzed with patrons seeking a special treat or cheap comfort food.</p><p>\n              Their upbeat sales made the U.S. restaurant industry a rare bright spot for jobs, with restaurant payrolls ticking up 1% last year, adding about 108,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n              In contrast, the overall U.S. economy added 181,000 non-farm jobs in 2025, marking the weakest annual payroll growth in 20 years outside a recession year.</p><p>\n              Success among restaurants was not evenly spread, though.</p><p>\n              Corporate filings show that eateries such as Brinker's Chili's, Yum Brands' Taco Bell and fast-growing coffee chain Dutch Bros lured customers by aggressively marketing bundled deals, leaning into digital innovation and limited-time offers, and focusing on high-margin, Instagrammable food. </p><p>\n              But previous darlings like Chipotle and Cava were hurt by what analysts call the \"slop-bowl fatigue\" -  growing weariness among younger consumers with high-priced, customizable grain or salad bowls. </p><p>\n              Tempe, Arizona-based Dutch Bros and its franchisees added roughly 8,000 employees in the last two years, a 33% increase, the company said. </p><p>\n              \"We have a healthy pipeline of growth,\" CEO Christine Barone told Reuters after the company's earnings in February. The brand, which serves customizable beverages, is a hit with younger consumers, Barone said.  </p><p>\n              A similar story is playing out at another chain that, like Dutch Bros, sells more treats than meals.</p><p>\n              Ice cream chain Whit's Frozen Custard has grown its payroll by up to 40% a year for the past two years, said owner Bill Aseere, to keep up with rapid growth. It now has stores in 93 locations across 10 states and some 15 to 20 employees per store. </p><p>\n              Amanda Wang, co-founder of fast-growing Chinese beverage chain Ningji Lemon Tea - part of a tidal wave of Chinese tea brands coming to the U.S. - said her chain's new restaurants in the U.S. were buoyed by demand among price-weary consumers for affordable indulgences. </p><p>\n              Tea \"offers that little bit of happiness,\" she said.</p><p>\n              As a whole, the restaurant industry grew payrolls even as it weathers depressed traffic and rising labor costs, analysts say, thanks in part to menu price increases. Menu prices at restaurants grew 4.1% in 2025 compared to grocery inflation of 2.3%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. </p><p><b>DIVERGING FORTUNES</b></p><p>\n              A deeper look at 2025 payroll data shows the difference in fortunes between types of restaurants: staff headcount at snack and non-alcoholic beverage restaurants grew 3.6% in 2025 and those at sit-down restaurants rose 1%. But fast-food payrolls grew only 0.4%, while cafeterias and buffet payrolls shrank 3.9%. </p><p>\n              \"At the end of the day, people want go out to eat and celebrate those big occasions,\" said Chad Moutray, an economist at the National Restaurant Association, referring to resilient spending at sit-down restaurants. </p><p>\n              \"Consumers might be pulling back from vacations, but they still prioritize eating out.\"</p><p>\n              The payroll data and Moutray's comments underscore what the industry calls the \"lipstick effect\" - consumers tightened their budgets, canceling expensive trips and postponing big-ticket purchases, but treated themselves to an indulgent meal, coffee or dessert.</p><p>\n              Brinker's reported 23% growth in its hourly restaurant staff between fiscal years 2024 and 2025, according to SEC filings, though it indicated that a growing share of its employees were part-time. </p><p>\n              Darden, the parent company of sit-down restaurants like Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, increased staff for fiscal 2025 by about 3.8%.</p><p>\n              Most national restaurant chains are franchised and do not report total employment figures among franchisees, but Chipotle and Starbucks, which operate the majority of their own stores, reported slight declines in total headcount for fiscal year 2025. </p><p>\n              While cascades of tariff announcements have forced other industries to raise prices and reroute sourcing, restaurant owners have only faced the tariffs impacting narrow categories like cup packaging and Chinese Sichuan peppers. </p><p></p><p> (Reporting by Waylon Cunningham; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Nick Zieminski)</p><p>\n            By Waylon Cunningham</p></div>",

It had been forecast to grow by 7.4% under the old data series.</p><!-- Article --><p><b>COMMENTARY:</b></p><p><b>MADHAVI ARORA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, EMKAY GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES, MUMBAI:</b></p><p>\n              \"The revised GDP series, featuring improved sectoral representation, reduced deflator-related distortions, and a more comprehensive capture of economic activity, has led to a recalibration of historical data. </p><p>\n              The FY26 Second Advance Estimate now projects real GDP growth at 7.6%, up from the 7.4% in the First Advance Estimate. This follows a stronger FY25 print of 7.1% (revised up from 6.5% under the earlier base).\"</p><p><b>RADHIKA RAO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DBS BANK, SINGAPORE:</b></p><p>\n              \"At first glance, the momentum in the rebased growth numbers appears to be marginally stronger than the previous trend, with methodological changes expected to have captured updated production structures, wider coverage of segments, new ratios, and improved government data sets, including those that capture activity in the informal sector. </p><p>\n              Service sector performance signals a strong lift, besides double-digit growth in manufacturing. The October-December quarter also benefited from indirect tax rationalisation and festive demand, in addition to a better faring rural farm sector. The rebased numbers are close to our forecast of 7.7% YoY for FY26.\"</p><p>\n               (Reporting by Kashish Tandon, Meenakshi Maidas in Bengaluru; compiled by Abinaya Vijayaraghavan; Editing by Sonia Cheema)</p></div>",
