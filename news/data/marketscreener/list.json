This will enable EDF to finance its strategy and contribute to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.\n<br/><br/>\n\nSettlement and delivery of the bonds is expected to take place on March 4, 2026, at which time the bonds are scheduled to be admitted to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris.\n\n    \n    </div>",

Momentum has continued this year, with companies in various sectors lining up to go public. </p><p>\n\n  Sunway Healthcare's offering looks set to draw healthy demand. It has secured 20 cornerstone investors, including AHAM Asset Management, AIA, Eastspring Investments and JPMorgan Asset Management (Singapore), which have agreed to subscribe to 97.5% of the allocated shares. </p><p>\n\n  For the company, the IPO is a way to fuel its bid to establish a presence in Southeast Asia, executive chairman Jeffrey Cheah said at a press conference on Friday. </p><p>\n\n  Sunway Healthcare has been expanding its footprint across Malaysia and expects to grow its bed capacity to 3,400 by 2032. It currently has 1,805 licensed beds, said the company's president, Lau Beng Long. </p><p>\n\n  Shares of Sunway Healthcare are set to begin trading on Malaysia's main bourse on March 18. </p><p>\n\n  Maybank Investment Bank and AmInvestment Bank are advising on the offering. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Ying Xian Wong at yingxian.wong@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-27-26 0118ET</p></div>",

            "title": "Canada's Carney visits India to boost trade, mend ties on latest 'middle powers' trip",
            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>OTTAWA, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney arrives in Mumbai on Friday on his first official visit to India, hoping to reset the sometimes fractious relationship with the world's most populous country as he seeks new global alliances.</p><p>\n              Carney will meet business leaders in Mumbai and start talks on a comprehensive trade agreement, which is expected to be completed by November, his foreign minister told Reuters. He is scheduled to travel on to New Delhi for talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              Carney has sought closer ties with China and Middle Eastern countries as well as India, as he tries to reduce Canada's dependence on the United States and forge a new global trading order led by what he calls middle-power countries.</p><p>\n              Relations between Canada and India soured several years ago after explosive allegations by then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the Indian government was linked to the assassination of a Canadian citizen who was also a prominent Sikh separatist. India has repeatedly denied any such links.</p><p>\n              Unlike several previous Canadian leaders, including Trudeau, Carney will not make a stop in India's Punjab region, a major origin of Indian migration to Canada. Sikh separatists have pushed for an independent state in the Punjab and a visit there risks irking Carney's Indian hosts.</p><p>\n              Analysts say the move signals a more pragmatic foreign policy that aims to wean Canada away from the United States, spurred by President Donald Trump's tariff war and annexation threats.</p><p>\n              \"The Prime Minister has a laser-beam focus on attracting capital to Canada, not playing to the Indian diaspora back home,\" said Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada.</p><p>\n              \"This is a business trip aimed at growing the economy to give Canadians more economic sovereignty,\" he said, calling the approach a significant shift from the Trudeau era.</p><p>\n              Last month, the European Union and India reached a landmark trade deal to cut tariffs on most goods, raising expectations that India might soon sign a similar deal with Canada. India's high commissioner to Canada told Reuters in January that Carney will likely sign a 10-year, C$2.8 billion ($2.05 billion) uranium supply deal and smaller agreements on oil and gas, the environment, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, education and culture.</p><p><b>NO BHANGRA DANCING</b></p><p>\n              Trudeau was mocked for wearing overly elaborate Indian outfits during a 2018 visit and was publicly criticized by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for allowing \"anti-India activities,\" a reference to vocal Sikh separatists living in Canada.</p><p>\n              \"Carney has a sense of gravitas and is very strategic,\" said Partha Mohanram, a management professor at the University of Toronto. \"He's not going to do a bhangra dance over there.\"</p><p>\n              But Carney's approach to India has drawn criticism from some Sikh groups in Canada.</p><p>\n              \"The Carney government has failed to hold India accountable or to create any meaningful safeguards to ensure that Sikh Canadians are protected from foreign interference and transnational repression,\" the World Sikh Organization of Canada said in a statement on Wednesday.</p><p>\n              Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand told Reuters there have been conversations between Canada and India at the highest levels regarding concerns about criminal activity with possible links to India. Anand said there were new measures to track criminal money, digital threats and surveillance of diaspora communities.</p><p>\n              Anand said Carney's foreign policy was driven by the reordering of global trading relationships and that \"no country will ever have a pass in terms of the domestic safety and security of this country.\"</p><p><b>FENDING OFF AMERICAN HEGEMONY</b></p><p>\n              After India, Carney will visit Australia, where he will address parliament and discuss military, trade and defense links. En route back to Ottawa, Carney will meet Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and talk about boosting trade in autos, energy and critical minerals.</p><p>\n              Jonathan Kalles, a former adviser to ex-Prime Minister Trudeau, said Carney's agenda was defined by the new geopolitical order he outlined in his Davos speech, where he called for middle powers to adopt a \"principled and pragmatic\" path to fend off American hegemony.</p><p>\n              \"When the world is nice and calm, you can try to change the world and talk about virtues,\" he said. \"But when you're living in uncertain times, the Prime Minister's job is to advance the country's interests and Mark Carney knows very well his job is to diversify our trade and strengthen the economy.\"</p><p>\n              ($1 = 1.3684 Canadian dollars)</p><p></p><p> (Reporting by Maria Cheng; Editing by Caroline Stauffer and Edmund Klamann)</p><p>\n            By Maria Cheng</p></div>",

            "title": "Under siege from politics, central bankers fight back - at a cost",
            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>FRANKFURT/WASHINGTON/TOKYO, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Under pressure from politicians, central bankers are fighting back. However, their efforts are exposing a delicate trade-off: defending independence may preserve inflation credibility, but at the cost of appearing political themselves.  </p><p>\n              Mainstream centrist politicians the world over are facing an onslaught from less conventional, often populist rivals who have their own ideas about what central banks should do, and who should run them.  </p><!-- Article --><p>\n              In the United States, the pushback has meant digging in. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has weathered repeated attacks from U.S. President Donald Trump, who accused him of undermining growth by keeping interest rates too high.</p><p>\n              In Europe, resistance takes a more paradoxical form: stepping down early to deny eurosceptic leaders the chance to influence who runs the central bank.</p><p>\n              Bank of France Governor François Villeroy de Galhau will leave months before elections expected to be won by the far right. Villeroy insisted this was his decision but a source said the move was driven partly by a desire to preserve continuity at the bank.</p><p>\n              European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, also French, is reportedly considering a similar move. She has said her \"baseline\" is to complete her term but has not excluded the possibility of an early exit.</p><p>\n              The Bank of Japan has repeated its pledge to keep raising rates even after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi appointed two dovish economists to the BOJ's board, seen as an attempt to stop hikes.</p><p>\n              With sovereign debt at record highs, central bankers fear sound monetary policy will be sacrificed at the altar of cheap borrowing as governments demand lower interest rates.</p><p>\n              At stake is their ability to control inflation -- and the credibility rebuilt since the price shocks of the 1970s. Turkey and Argentina show what can happen when governments force monetary policy into submission: inflation spikes, investors flee, trust evaporates.</p><p>\n              Yet in pushing back, central bankers risk appearing political themselves.</p><p>\n              \"Central bankers are being drawn into a fight between the establishment and populists. They're being drawn into the ring and they should try to do everything they can to stay out of it,\" said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING.</p><p><b>CRISES PUSH CENTRAL BANKS INTO SPOTLIGHT </b></p><p>\n              The pushback should not come as a surprise. ECB founding president Wim Duisenberg once likened a good central banker to whipped cream: \"the more you whip it, the harder it gets.\"</p><p>\n              His own early resignation in 2003, part of a deal between Germany and France to hand the baton to Jean-Claude Trichet, showed that, even if appointments are political, the job needn't become so.</p><p>\n              Contemporary models of central bank governance assume officials will act independently once in office, regardless of who installed them.</p><p>\n              But the past decade has blurred that line. In Japan, former PM Shinzo Abe installed Haruhiko Kuroda at the BOJ to fuel his stimulus agenda.</p><p>\n              Massive bond-buying across advanced economies -- encouraged by governments during the global financial crisis and the pandemic -- also brought central banks closer to fiscal policy, a precedent France's far-right now cites approvingly.</p><p>\n              Public confidence wobbled after the post-COVID inflation surge. Limited forays into climate policy -- particularly at the ECB and Bank of England -- fed accusations of mission creep.</p><p>\n              Jakob de Haan, a professor of political economy at the University of Groningen, said central banks \"increasingly have moved beyond their mandate\", raising questions about their own independence.</p><p><b>INDEPENDENCE VS PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY    </b></p><p>\n              Central banks are insulated from day-to-day politics, often via legal provisions such as the European treaties governing the ECB.</p><p>\n              But they are not shielded from democratic expectations. They answer to Congress in the U.S. and the European Parliament in the euro zone -- and to public perceptions.</p><p>\n              This is where their rearguard action may expose a flank.</p><p>\n              \"I don't see any process fouls here,\" said Nathan Sheets, global chief economist at Citi. \"But it does cause one to reflect on whether we have that balance between independence and accountability right.\"</p><p>\n              Resignations by Villeroy and, potentially, Lagarde in France could be seen as attempts to give President Emmanuel Macron one last say over appointments before voters possibly shift to the Rassemblement National.</p><p>\n              Economists warn this may backfire.</p><p>\n              \"The manoeuvre could slightly compromise the independence of the central bank itself,\" said Marco Valli, chief European economist at UniCredit.</p><p><b>MARKETS MAY HAVE FINAL WORD</b></p><p>\n              Government debt may be the fiercest arena.</p><p>\n              The U.S. government must refinance nearly a third of its $36 trillion debt this year. How the Fed under Trump's appointee Kevin Warsh manages rates and its $6.6 trillion balance sheet will be crucial.</p><p>\n              Europe faces rising defence spending atop already-high debt in Italy and France. French far-right leader Jordan Bardella has called for opening discussions with the ECB over financing.</p><p>\n              \"From a political point of view, the best way to finance it is to be able to count on the central bank's printing press,\" said Enrico Colombatto, a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Turin.</p><p>\n              Markets, though, may have the final word. Central banks can suppress bond yields but not stop investors fleeing -- weakening currencies and pushing up inflation.</p><p>\n              Japan shows fears of market bumps can be central bankers' best allies. </p><p>\n              \"The relentless yen slump taught the administration a lesson on how brutal markets could become if it tried to push back against the BOJ's interest rate hikes,\" former BOJ board member Makoto Sakurai said. \"Market forces helped the BOJ fend off political pressure.\"</p><p></p><p> (Additional reporting by Bill Schomberg in London; Editing by Toby Chopra)</p><p>\n            By Francesco Canepa, Howard Schneider and Leika Kihara</p></div>",

They come with higher costs and typically require applicants to present high, stable income, but while still rare offer an option for those unable to save up for a downpayment but desperate for a home of their own. </p><p>\n              Natalie and Martin Walker from West Yorkshire in northern England say an eviction notice served when their baby was one month old drove them to take up a zero-deposit mortgage last year to buy a house after four years of renting.</p><p>\n              \"The sense of stability that it brings you, that's the biggest delight for me,\" said Natalie.</p><p>\n              Back in Spain, Carlos Sempere, a 36-year-old industrial engineer who rents a flat in central Madrid, where properties are selling for around 1 million euros - far out of his reach - bought a rental property in southern Spain instead via an investment company PropHero. </p><p>\n              \"Either it helps me pay the rent, or I sell it in the future,\" he said.</p><p>\n              For those who cannot afford a whole property, PropHero also offers stakes in rental apartment buildings in Spain and Ireland for as little as 20,000 euros. </p><p>\n              Ultimately, it is the dire market conditions that make prospective first-time buyers look past legal complexities and cost of new schemes, says real estate consultant and head of alternative investments at AIRE Partners Patricio Palomar.</p><p>\n              \"All these housing solutions serve to show how people are getting poorer.\" </p><p></p><p> (Reporting by Corina Pons in Madrid and Iain Withers in London; editing by Charlie Devereux and Tomasz Janowski)</p></div>",
