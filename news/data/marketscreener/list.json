            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>Feb 27 (Reuters) - Cross-border fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan intensified overnight, with both sides claiming heavy losses and the Pakistani defence minister saying his country was in an \"open war\" with its neighbour.</p><p>\n              As tensions persist, here is a look at how Pakistan dwarfs Afghanistan's military forces and arsenals, according to data from the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.    </p><!-- Article --><p><b>OVERVIEW </b></p><p>\n              Pakistan's armed forces benefit from good recruitment and retention, bolstered by equipment from its main defence partner China. Islamabad continues to invest in its military nuclear programmes and is also modernising its navy and air force. </p><p>\n              The capability of the Afghan Taliban's armed forces, meanwhile, is declining, with a fall in their ability to use foreign equipment that the Islamist group seized when it returned to power in the landlocked country in 2021.</p><p>\n              A lack of international recognition for the Taliban administration has also hurt military modernisation. </p><p><b>PERSONNEL </b></p><p>\n              Pakistan has 660,000 active personnel in its defence forces, of whom 560,000 are in the army, 70,000 are in the air force, and 30,000 are in the navy.  </p><p>\n              The strength of the Afghan Taliban's military is thinner, with only 172,000 active personnel. The group has, however, announced plans to expand its armed forces to 200,000 personnel. </p><p><b>FIGHTING VEHICLES AND ARTILLERY</b></p><p>\n              Pakistan has more than 6,000 armoured fighting vehicles, and over 4,600 pieces of artillery. </p><p>\n              The Afghan forces also possess armoured fighting vehicles, including Soviet-era main battle tanks, armoured personnel carriers and autonomous underwater vehicles, but their exact number is unknown. </p><p>\n              The precise number of artillery they possess, which is of at least three different types, is similarly not known. </p><p><b>AIR FORCE</b></p><p>\n              Pakistan has a fleet of 465 combat aircraft and more than 260 helicopters that include multi-role, attack and transport choppers.</p><p>\n              Afghanistan has no fighter jets and no real air force to speak of. It is known to possess at least six aircraft - some of them dating back again to the Soviet era - and 23 helicopters, although it is not possible to assess how many are in flying condition.</p><p><b>NUCLEAR ARSENAL </b></p><p>\n              While Pakistan is a nuclear-armed country and has 170 warheads, Afghanistan does not have a nuclear arsenal.</p><p>\n               (Compiled by Sakshi Dayal; Editing by YP Rajesh and Raju Gopalakrishnan)</p></div>",

The sources declined to be identified as the information is not public. </p><p>\n              Both banks have set out policies to reduce cross-shareholdings. A 2019 sale of Nintendo's shares, in which they and others participated, totalled some 71 billion yen. </p><p>\n              The Bank of Kyoto, a regional lender, held a 4.19% stake in Nintendo as of September last year. MUFG Bank, Japan's largest, had a 3.62% stake, which is held by a trust bank. </p><p>\n              Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group declined to comment and Kyoto Financial Group did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>\n              Regulators and the Tokyo Stock Exchange have been encouraging Japanese companies to unwind their cross-shareholdings.</p><p>\n              Toyota is planning an unwinding of strategic shareholdings that would involve banks and insurers selling around $19 billion of its shares, Reuters reported on Thursday. </p><p>\n              The practice, which involves firms holding shares in each other to cement business ties, has been criticised by governance experts and overseas investors as insulating management from shareholders.

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Megumi Fujikawa </p><br/><p>\n  TOKYO--Inflation in Japan's capital cooled below the central bank's 2% target for the first time in over a year, but the slowdown is unlikely to derail further interest rate hikes. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  While the headline figure eased, underlying price pressures in Tokyo--considered a leading indicator of nationwide trends--remain firm, with the bulk of the slowdown due to the impact of government subsidies, Friday's data showed. </p><p>\n\n  Excluding fresh food, consumer prices in the Tokyo metropolitan area rose 1.8% in February from a year earlier, compared with the 2.0% increase seen in January. The deceleration was driven largely by a 9.2% plunge in energy prices after the government rolled out subsidies to help households cope with rising living costs. </p><p>\n\n  That marked the first time the Tokyo gauge has fallen below the Bank of Japan's 2% target since October 2024, but the print likely won't shift expectations on monetary policy. </p><p>\n\n  The central bank has been maintaining a cautious but positive stance on further interest-rate hikes following a round of tightening that brought the policy rate to 0.75% in December. </p><p>\n\n  Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute economist Takuya Hoshino said the Tokyo data was \"broadly firm,\" pointing out that service prices, which have a strong correlation with wage growth, rose 1.5%, up slightly from January. </p><p>\n\n  A core measure of inflation which strips out volatile fresh food and energy prices also edged up to 2.5% in February. </p><p>\n\n  While consumer inflation excluding fresh food continued to slow, \"the results are unlikely to deter the BOJ from raising interest rates further,\" he said. </p><p>\n\n  Capital Economics economist Marcel Thieliant agreed, saying that the slew of economic indicators, including inflation figures, released Friday \"suggest that the BOJ won't wait much longer before hiking rates again.\" </p><p>\n\n  Markets are currently pricing in a nearly 60% chance of a rate hike in April, according to data from money market broker Tokyo Tanshi. Traders and BOJ officials are closely monitoring how Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's planned sales tax cut will affect price trends. </p><p>\n\n  Separate government data on Friday meanwhile signaled that consumption remains solid, with retail sales rising 1.8% in January from a year earlier. Industrial production rose 2.2% on the month in January on the back of front-loaded demand ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays, a sharp reversal from December's 0.1% decrease. </p><p>\n\n  Still, there is continued uncertainty around the outlook for Japanese manufacturers. If weakness in the sector drags on broader economic growth, that could dent the case for rate hikes. </p><p>\n\n  While the U.S. Supreme Court recently struck down so-called reciprocal tariffs, Japanese officials have warned that automobile levies continue to weigh on the industry and said they will continue monitoring the impact of President Trump's new tariffs. </p><p>\n\n  Policymakers say the nation's corporate sector remains resilient despite the headwinds posed by U.S. trade policy, but Friday's data showed factory activity is expected to weaken again in the coming months. </p><p>\n\n  Norinchukin Research Institute economist Takeshi Minami said increasing tensions between Japan and China could weigh on production down the road. Earlier this week, China said that it will ban the export of items that have potential military applications, targeting a list of Japanese companies. </p><p>\n\n  Diplomatic tensions between the two countries have intensified following Takaichi's remarks last year suggesting Japan's potential involvement in any conflict over Taiwan. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-26-26 2159ET</p></div>",
