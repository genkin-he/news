At the end of the third quarter, its common equity tangible 1 ratio--which measures capital strength--stood at 13.7%, above the 13.0% level at which it said it would consider distributions. </p><p>\n\n  \"The fact that SG did not announce a share buyback program with 3Q results might disappoint some but as the CET 1 ratio continued to increase plus SG reiterated its capital target, this might only be a timing factor,\" RBC Capital Markets a wrote in a note to clients. Jefferies analysts also pointed to an absence of news on distributions, adding that \"banks with meaningful excess capital ought to be buying their shares back at a 20% discount to tangible book.\" </p><p>\n\n  For the three month period, the French lender reported an 11% rise in net profit to 1.52 billion euros ($1.76 billion). This beat expectations of a 1.305 billion-euro result taken from a Visible Alpha poll due to lighter costs and provisions for bad loans. The group said it isn't exposed to recent high-profile bankruptcies in the U.S. and has negligible exposure to the country's regional banks. </p><p>\n\n  Net banking income--its top-line metric--fell 2.7% to 6.655 billion euros due to recent disposals but still beat consensus' 6.41 billion-euro estimate. Excluding these asset sales, income rose 3.8% led by growth in its French retail, private banking and insurance division, while its investment bank posted a mixed performance and revenue from its division housing international retail and mobility and financial services contracted. </p><p>\n\n  \"There is still a lot to do to get where we want to be, but real tangible results have pointed us in the right direction,\" Krupa said. The bank is on track to surpass its annual targets, he added. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Elena Vardon at Elena.Vardon@wsj.com and Tracy Qu at tracy.qu@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-30-25 0816ET</p></div>",

Underlying cash flow from operations was slightly lower than consensus provided by Visible Alpha, the analysts say. On a stated basis--which excludes leases and hybrids--the company reported a fall in net debt to $24.6 billion from $25.9 billion, they say.

The rise in gold has outpaced equities and bonds, it notes, adding that steepening yield curves, fiscal uncertainty, and risks to Fed independence might continue to support gold buying by central banks and retail investors. Further support for gold prices could also come from falling real interest rates amid slowing growth and Fed rate cuts, and weakening of the U.S. dollar after the recent consolidation, it says. It maintains a positive stance on gold, and raises its 12-month target to $4,600 an ounce. Spot gold is last at $3,969/oz, according to LSEG data.
