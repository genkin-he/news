The bank left its GDP forecast at 2.0% for 2027. </p><p>\n\n  The central bank said it still sees moderately faster growth, although from a higher base than previously estimated. </p><p>\n\n  In the fourth quarter, Mexico's GDP grew 0.9% seasonally adjusted from the previous quarter, while third-quarter GDP was revised up to a 0.1% expansion from a previously estimated 0.3% contraction. The economy grew 0.6% in 2025. </p><p>\n\n  Private consumption growth is expected to accelerate gradually in 2026, while investment is likely to remain weak, at least until the second half of the year given uncertainty about the trade relationship with the U.S. and the coming review of the U.S.-Mexico Canada Agreement, the Bank of Mexico said. Exports are expected to continue with moderate growth. </p><p>\n\n  The balance of risks for growth remains tilted to the downside, the central bank said. Downside risks include greater trade uncertainty with the U.S., geopolitical conflicts that may hurt global growth and trade, and Mexico's higher tariffs on countries with which it doesn't have a trade agreement. </p><p>\n\n  Upside risks to its forecast include a successful USMCA review, and the 2026 soccer World Cup which Mexico is co-hosting with the U.S. and Canada, and higher-than-expected U.S. economic growth, the central bank said. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Anthony Harrup at anthony.harrup@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-26-26 1449ET</p></div>",

LeBlanc cited, for instance, talks last fall between Ottawa and Washington to ease tariffs on key sectors like steel, aluminum and automobiles, which President Trump later terminated due to anger over a Canadian ad that questioned the use of tariffs. </p><p>\n\n  LeBlanc said Canada wants the U.S. to recommit to a trilateral trade pact. Furthermore, he added, \"there have always been bilateral arrangements as between the three countries. That's not new… [And] we need to get a bilateral deal with the United States to take pressure off the sectoral tariffs.\" </p><p>\n\n  The sectoral tariffs, of up to 50%, have squeezed Canada's manufacturing sector. Nonfarm payrolls data issued Thursday indicated that factories shed workers in December, for a year-over-year decline of 2.6%. </p><p>\n\n  LeBlanc said he expects to meet U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in the coming days. Greer told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. on Tuesday that Canada will have to live with U.S. tariffs as part of a revised USMCA. </p><p>\n\n  \"If Canada wants to agree that we can have some level of higher tariff on them while they open up their markets to us on things like dairy and other things, then that's a helpful conversation,\" Greer said. </p><p>\n\n  Earlier this week, LeBlanc told Canadian senators he remained optimistic about USMCA's future, noting that the White House provided an exemption to a new U.S. tariff, of up to 15%, so long as the goods entering the U.S. comply with the trilateral pact. The Bank of Canada has labeled the pending review of USMCA as a key risk to the economic outlook. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-26-26 1435ET</p></div>",
