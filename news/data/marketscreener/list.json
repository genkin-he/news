That triggered nervousness in other sectors as well.</p><p>\n              Nexperia makes basic power control chips such as transistors and diodes. These cost only a few cents to buy, but are needed in almost every device that uses electricity and are ubiquitous in cars to connect the battery to motors, for lights and braking systems.</p><p>\n              Europe adopted the 43 billion euro ($50.15 billion) EU Chips Act in 2023, aimed at doubling the bloc's share of global chip output to 20% by 2030 and reducing its reliance on foreign chipmakers. </p><p>\n              The European Commission will review this legislation next year, and has tentatively called it Chips Act 2. </p><p>\n              ($1 = 0.8575 euros)</p><p>\n               (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Jan Harvey)</p><p>\n            By Foo Yun Chee</p></div>",
