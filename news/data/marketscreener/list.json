They didn't disclose financial details for the multi-year agreement. </p><p>\n\n  Accenture employees will have access to products like Mistral AI Studio--a platform that allows users to experiment with models before embedding the technology in their operations. The software will allow Accenture to advise its customers on how to deploy AI at scale. </p><p>\n\n  For Mistral AI, the deal means it can add Accenture to its list of big-shot clients at a critical juncture in the AI race as large tech companies rush to secure partnerships with model providers to streamline their operations and improve services for customers. </p><p>\n\n  International Business Machines, Cisco Systems, SAP, carmaker Stellantis and Dutch chip-equipment giant ASML Holding are among several high-profile companies that are leveraging Mistral AI's models, according to the company's website. </p><p>\n\n  Last year, ASML agreed to inject more than $1.5 billion into Mistral AI for a roughly 11% stake, leading a round that valued the Paris-based startup at nearly $14 billion. Mistral AI has also struck partnerships with European governments, Singapore and Morocco. </p><p>\n\n  For Accenture, the deal means the consulting giant can use new models to reduce repetitive tasks, speed up delivery of projects and advise clients on how to adopt AI in their day-to-day operations. </p><p>\n\n  In December, Accenture struck a multi-year partnership with Anthropic to train about 30,000 of its employees on the startup's Claude chatbot and help enterprises shift from experimenting with AI to fully deploying it. </p><p>\n\n  Chief Executive Julie Sweet has been a fierce advocate of the technology as a primary growth driver, actively pushing employees to learn how to use it. Last year, she said the company had already trained a big portion of its roughly 780,000-strong workforce, but cautioned that employees who weren't getting the hang of AI would be shown the door. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Mauro Orru at mauro.orru@wsj.com and Najat Kantouar at najat.kantouar@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-26-26 0614ET</p></div>",
