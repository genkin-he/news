            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Kirk Maltais </p><br/><p>\n  --Wheat for December delivery fell 1.5% to $5.24 1/2 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade Thursday, as market participants focused on soybeans following trade talks between the U.S. and China. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  --Corn for December delivery fell 1% to $4.29 3/4 a bushel. </p><p>\n\n  --Soybeans for January delivery rose 1.1% to $11.06 1/2 a bushel. </p><br/><p>\n  HIGHLIGHTS </p><br/><p>\n  Left Unsaid: Reports about the agricultural part of the U.S.-China trade truce mention China will resume buying U.S. soybean exports, but don't disclose information on corn or wheat, which pressured prices today. \"Corn and wheat not only were left out of the trade agreement, but also have a negative seasonal tendency beginning in early November,\" Midwest Market Solutions'  Brian Hoops said. \"Without news from the trade agreement, positive fundamental information is lacking for corn and even more so for wheat.\" </p><p>\n\n  Good Showing: Indications that China plans to purchase 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans this year, along with 25 million tons annually for the next three years, pushed CBOT soybean futures up over the $11 a bushel mark overnight. It's the first time that threshold has been passed since July 2024. President Trump posted on Truth Social that he \"had a truly great meeting with President Xi of China,\" mentioning that China agreed to purchase \"massive amounts of Soybeans, Sorghum, and other Farm products.\" Further details were scant throughout the day. </p><br/><p>\n  INSIGHT </p><br/><p>\n  Different Scenario: China isn't looking to build its livestock herds, but instead move more animals through its meat-processing pipeline. That may become a big factor influencing how CBOT soybeans trade, more so than promises made during this week's meetings between the U.S. and China. \"Amid a massive liquidation of their hog herd, [we doubt] that China wants to import greater tonnages of soybeans in 2025/26,\" AgResource said in a note. The firm also adds that Brazilian prices remain more competitive, making the U.S. a less-favored alternative until margins ease. </p><p>\n\n  Delayed Reaction: Aid payments that have been directed to farmers in the wake of U.S. trading disputes with numerous partners may be slowing down what would otherwise be a necessary change in the input costs for farmers to plant every spring. In a report this week, analysts with Rabobank said payments coming from the Trump Administration may be creating this delay. If land values alone were to backtrack from current levels, then the price competitiveness of U.S. soybeans would be closer to par with that of soybeans out of Brazil's Mato Grosso region, Rabobank said. </p><br/><p>\n  AHEAD </p><br/><p>\n  Note: The government shutdown is impacting the timing of USDA reports and data releases. </p><p>\n\n  --AGCO Corp. will release its third quarter earnings report at 7:30 a.m. ET Friday. </p><p>\n\n  --Zoetis Inc. will release its third quarter earnings report at 7 a.m. ET Tuesday. </p><p>\n\n  --Mosaic Co. will release its third quarter earnings report after the  stock market closes on Tuesday. </p><br/><p>\n   Write to Kirk Maltais at kirk.maltais@wsj.com </p><p>\n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-30-25 1544ET</p></div>",
