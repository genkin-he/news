Fairview International tied these gains to higher average fees across its two schools in Malaysia. </p><p></p><p>\"Alongside these fee increases, our continued focus on management of its operating and administrative cost base are improving margins,\" said the company. </p><p></p><p>A key performance metric for the firm is headcount. At September 30, this figure stood at 277, up 4.9% from 693 a year prior. Fairview said it has invested further in marketing and recruitment, with it anticipating further gains as the year continues. </p><p></p><p>\"Coupled with sustained fee growth, this positions Fairview for ongoing expansion,\" said Chair Daniel Chian. </p><p></p><p>Fairview International said it continues to assess acquisition opportunities to expand the business, looking at both \"acquisitions and new builds applying the criteria of economic growth, demand for quality education and sustainability in their assessments.\"</p><p></p><p>Shares in the company closed flat at 10.50 pence on Thursday in London.</p><p></p><p>\"It is a pleasure to present Fairview's maiden annual report since our IPO in October 2024.  As we anticipated at the time, it has been a year of great progress, both operationally and academically. Both of our schools are able to increase student numbers without the need for further capex or facilities and our focus on marketing and recruitment is bearing fruit with enrolments comfortably ahead of the comparative period last year,\" said Chair Chian. </p><p></p><p>\"Demand for high quality independent education continues to rise, the International Baccalaureate curriculum grows in popularity and Malaysia's policy of expanding expatriate student numbers should all contribute to Fairview's further development.\"</p><p></p><p>By Christopher Ward, Alliance News reporter</p><p></p><p>Comments and questions to newsroom@alliancenews.com</p><p></p><p>Copyright 2025 Alliance News Ltd.
