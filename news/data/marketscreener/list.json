But electric trucks still make up a small fraction of the market, as they cost significantly more than diesel models and buyers remain concerned about charging infrastructure.</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              In a letter to the European Commission dated Oct. 13, the companies called for changes to the EU's credit system which rewards manufacturers whose emissions fall below both the bloc's targets and a linear trajectory between target years. Instead, they want credits for simply beating the headline targets.</p><p>\n              Christian Levin, CEO of Scania and Traton, told Reuters the letter was \"a cry out for help\". </p><p>\n              \"We're not arguing the targets are wrong... but it's going to be very, very difficult,\" said Levin, who is also the chair of the European automobile manufacturers' association's (ACEA) commercial vehicles board.</p><p>\n              A spokesperson for Daimler Truck said the industry had invested heavily in electrification but faced \"draconian\" penalties for missing targets - despite factors outside of their control, including battery manufacturing and charging infrastructure.</p><p>\n              \"The best would be to remove these stupid fines on the industry, and rather force everyone in the system through incentives or penalties to do the job together,\" Levin added.</p><p>\n              Under EU law, truckmakers must cut emissions from new trucks by 15% by 2025, rising to 90% in 2040, compared to 2019 levels.</p><p>\n              Most truckmakers are on track to meet the 2025 goal - mainly through improving their diesel-powered lineup rather than selling more electric trucks.  </p><p>\n              Environmental campaigners warn that weakening the targets could slow Europe's shift to electrification and open the door to Chinese producers. Campaign group Transport &amp; Environment said the proposed changes could cut EU sales of zero-emission trucks by 27% in 2030.</p><p>\n              The European Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
