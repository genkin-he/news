            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n     Fed Divisions Reveal New Caution Over Continued Cuts By Vicky Ge Huang </p><p>\n\n     The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates at its second consecutive meeting, but Chair Jerome Powell cast doubt on expectations of a further rate cut this year. On the trade front, President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping emerged from their first face-to-face meeting in six years with a temporary truce in the bruising tariff fight between the two superpowers. Elsewhere, the Bank of Canada cut its policy rate for the fourth time this year, and signaled an end to the easing cycle as it needs to balance the need to help an economy battered by U.S. tariffs while keeping inflation near the target level. And the Bank of Japan held rates steady again, narrowing the window of opportunity to hike before year's end as it waits for clarity on the impact of tariffs and a political leadership change in Tokyo. Focus now turns to the European Central Bank, which is widely expected to hold interest rates steady on Thursday. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n     Top News Fed Divisions Reveal New Caution Over Continued Cuts </p><p>\n\n     Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered a blunt message for investors </p><p>\n\n  who have assumed the central bank would be on cruise control toward a third rate cut in December: Not so fast. </p><p>\n\n     Rather than hide behind cryptic and vague language that central bankers often deploy, Powell went out of his way Wednesday to play up divisions on the rate-setting committee and play down the idea that a rate cut in six weeks is a foregone conclusion. </p><p>\n\n     \"In fact, far from it,\" he said at one point. </p><p>\n\n     Powell's plain speaking reflected deepening divisions at the Fed over how to interpret an economy where consumer spending remains robust but hiring has slowed sharply. </p><p>\n\n     Future Fed Rate Cuts 'Far' From Certain After Divided Meeting </p><p>\n\n  Bank of Canada Cuts Rates, Signals Pause to Meet Inflation Target </p><p>\n\n     The Bank of Canada's quarter-point reduction to 2.25% </p><p>\n\n  marks 'right level' to contain inflation risks and help the economy adjust to tariff-fueled disruption. </p><p>\n\n     Bank of Canada Exhausts Tools to Help Tariff-Battered Economy </p><p>\n\n  Japan's Central Bank Holds Fire as Tariffs, Politics Cloud Policy Target </p><p>\n\n     In a widely expected move, the central bank maintained its overnight call rate target at 0.5% , extending a pause since its last hike in January. That leaves one more chance to resume tightening this year: at the December meeting. </p><p>\n\n     Trump Meets With Xi, Declares Immediate Cut to Tariffs </p><p>\n\n     President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping reached an agreement to lower immediate trade tensions </p><p>\n\n  between the U.S. and China. The agreement includes a reduction in stiff U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for a pledge by China to crack down on the trade in the chemicals used to produce fentanyl. </p><p>\n\n     Trump, South Korea Reach Terms on Trade Deal </p><p>\n\n  Economy Pending-Home Sales Hold at Second-Strongest Pace This Year </p><p>\n\n     The number of homes going under contract in the U.S. was unchanged in September , according to a monthly index, holding at a strong pace as mortgage rates tick down. </p><p>\n\n     Senate Talks Pick Up as Shutdown Pain Increases </p><p>\n\n     The financial pain from the government shutdown is spreading and the legislative options for both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are narrowing, prompting a pickup in informal talks to resolve the nearly monthlong impasse. Lawmakers point to deadlines within days that they hope will force a breakthrough </p><p>\n\n  before money stops flowing for food-stamp benefits and enhanced healthcare subsidies. </p><p>\n\n     Too Much Experience Hurts You in Today's Tough Job Market </p><p>\n\n     Belt-tightening is overused corporate jargon, but it is particularly apt at the moment. The midsection of America's workforce is getting squeezed . </p><p>\n\n     Eurozone Economy Picks Up Speed as Hopes for Revival Gather Pace </p><p>\n\n     The eurozone economy picked up slightly </p><p>\n\n  in the three months through September as it adjusted to higher U.S. tariffs, and recent surveys show tentative signs of a German-led recovery as a tumultuous year draws to a close. </p><p>\n\n     Number of U.K. Companies Hit by Critical Financial Distress Surges </p><p>\n\n     The number of U.K. businesses in critical financial distress soared in the third quarter , reflecting tax increases, inflation and a challenging economic backdrop, according to a new study. </p><p>\n\n     Financial Regulation Binance Boosted Trump Family's Crypto Company Ahead of Pardon for Its Billionaire Founder </p><p>\n\n     Giant crypto exchange facilitated $2 billion purchase </p><p>\n\n  of World Liberty's stablecoin and built its technology; clemency for Changpeng Zhao surprised some in Trump administration. </p><p>\n\n     UBS to Appeal Swiss Ruling on $17 Bln Credit Suisse Bond Wipeout </p><p>\n\n     UBS Group said it intends to appeal </p><p>\n\n  a Swiss court judgment that ruled there was no legal basis to wipe out more than $17 billion in Credit Suisse bonds as part of a state-orchestrated rescue takeover. </p><p>\n\n     Forward Guidance Thursday (all times ET) </p><p>\n\n     8:30 a.m.: Advance estimate GDP </p><p>\n\n     8:30 a.m.: Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims Report - Initial Claims </p><p>\n\n     9:15 a.m.: ECB interest rate announcement </p><p>\n\n     9:45 a.m.: U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies hold public outreach meeting </p><p>\n\n     10 a.m.: Federal Reserve Vice Chair Michelle Bowman speaks at Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act Outreach Meeting (via pre-recorded video) </p><p>\n\n     Friday </p><p>\n\n     8:30 a.m.: Personal Income and Outlays </p><p>\n\n     8:30 a.m.: Employment Cost Index </p><p>\n\n     9:45 a.m.: Chicago Business Barometer - ISM-Chicago Business Survey - Chicago PMI </p><p>\n\n     Commentary </p><p>\n\n     The Bank of Canada signaled it has emptied its toolbox to help an economy hurting from the trade row </p><p>\n\n  with the U.S. Canada's central bank cut its main interest rate on Wednesday, to 2.25%, and said the rate is \"at about the right level\" to keep inflation intact at its 2% target. It's taking this approach even though its own economic outlook is bleak over the next two years. </p><p>\n\n     Gov. Tiff Macklem said that President Trump's shift on trade has scarred the economy. At the same time, Macklem added, the Bank of Canada \"can't lose sight of our inflation objective.\" The central bank's balancing act shifts the onus on refueling growth to Mark Carney, the prime minister and previously Macklem's boss at the Bank of Canada, writes WSJ's Paul Vieira. </p><p>\n\n     Research Missing Data Could Cloud December Cut </p><p>\n\n     The Fed cut interest rates for a second straight meeting, and the central bank's September dot plot indicated that last month many officials saw a path to a third straight cut on the way in December. But the government shutdown, and the associated lack of official economic data, could stymie that plan, analyst Omair Sharif of Inflation Insights writes. \"I do wonder if officials will be comfortable cutting rates again on December 10 if they go into that meeting with no official data reflecting activity in October and November,\" Sharif writes. \"It may be hard to reach a consensus on another cut, especially given the split in the FOMC indicated in the September dot plot.\" - Matt Grossman </p><p>\n\n     About Us </p><p>\n\n     WSJ Pro Central Banking brings you central banking news, analysis and insights from WSJ's global team of reporters and editors.

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>Kimberly-Clark Corporation updated earnings guidance for the year 2025. As a reminder, the company adjusted its full-year outlook in August to be consistent with the reporting of the IFP business as discontinued operations. Its outlook for Net Sales, Organic Sales Growth and Adjusted Operating Profit growth now reflect the results of the remaining two segments, North America and IPC, as well as its overhead structure excluding the IFP business.</p><p>2025 Organic Sales Growth is expected to be broadly in line with the weighted average growth in the categories and countries it competes, which are currently growing at approximately two percent. Reported Net Sales are forecast to reflect a negative impact of approximately 100 basis points from currency translation, as well as a negative 290 basis point impact from a combination of the PPE divestiture and the exit of the company's private label diaper business in the US. The company expects its 2025 Adjusted Operating Profit to grow at a low single digit rate on a constant-currency basis versus the prior year.</p><!-- Article --><p>Adjusted Earnings per Share Attributable to Kimberly-Clark are expected to grow at a low-to-mid single digit rate on a constant-currency basis including a negative 320 basis point impact from a combination of its PPE divestiture and the exit of the company's private label diaper business in the US, as well as a negative 100 basis point impact from items below operating profit including higher net interest expense, a higher adjusted effective tax rate, partially offset by lower shares outstanding.</p></div>",
