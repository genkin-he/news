Against this backdrop, the search for companies that combine high returns on equity, strong net margins, and robust profitability scores has intensified.</p><p>\nUsing our Stock Screener, we identified firms in Saudi Arabia and the UAE with a return on equity above 15%, net margins exceeding 10%, and profitability and quality metrics in the upper range of our universe. Three regional heavyweights stood out — Aramco, Al Rajhi Banking and Investment Corporation, and ADNOC Gas — each exemplifying how scale, efficiency, and strategic focus can align to deliver enduring returns.</p><!-- Article --><p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-zoomable=\"true\" height=\"332\" src=\"//img.zonebourse.com/stock/screen_aramc_alraj_adnoc.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"800\"/></p><h2>\nAramco: Scale meets scrutiny</h2><p>\nSector: Energy</p><p>\nAramco, the world’s largest integrated oil and gas company, remains the cornerstone of the Saudi market with a market capitalization of $1.672 trillion. Despite a volatile year for oil prices, the company posted net income of 393,891 million for 2024, achieving a 26.3% return on equity and a 21.9% net margin — both in the upper decile of our universe.</p><p>\nIn Q2 2025, net income reached 85,632 million, 4.8% below consensus, while EPS of 0.35 came in 6.6% short of expectations, underscoring margin pressure amid continued energy price swings.</p><p>\nValuation remains closely watched: Aramco trades at a 2024 P/E of 17.2x and a price-to-book ratio of 4.65x, both slightly below five-year averages. The free cash flow yield is 4.7%, while the dividend yield has risen to 6.3% for 2024, supported by a 109% distribution rate.</p><p>\nOur MarketScreener Investor Rating stands at 4★, indicating strong fundamentals, while the analyst consensus remains OUTPERFORM, with an average target price 11% above the last close. Recent moves — including acquiring a minority stake in AI firm Humain and increasing ownership in Petro Rabigh to 60% — signal a push toward diversification and digital expansion. Yet, Aramco continues to face scrutiny over its exposure to oil cycles and policy direction within the Kingdom.</p><p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-zoomable=\"true\" height=\"400\" src=\"//img.zonebourse.com/stock/aramco_20251030170254.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"600\"/></p><h2>\nAl Rajhi Bank: Consistency as a core asset</h2><p>\nSector: Financials</p><p>\nAl Rajhi Banking and Investment Corporation, Saudi Arabia’s largest Islamic bank, commands a market capitalization of $117 billion and delivers a return on equity of 17.2% alongside a net margin of 61.5% — both in the top decile of our universe. Net income and EPS growth also rank highly, underscoring operational strength. Over the past year, shares have gained 19.7%, including an 11.7% rise year-to-date.</p><p>\nValuation metrics are neutral, with a mid-range P/E ratio and a lower-tier price-to-book ratio. Dividend yield is moderate, but capital efficiency remains robust. Analyst sentiment has improved notably, with both target price divergence and recommendation trends in the upper range.</p><p>\nRevisions to revenue and EPS forecasts point upward, reinforcing confidence in the bank’s earnings outlook. While recent quarters have brought no major earnings surprises, Al Rajhi’s steady profitability, efficiency, and margin strength secure its place as a cornerstone for investors seeking stability in the Gulf’s financial landscape.</p><p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-zoomable=\"true\" height=\"400\" src=\"//img.zonebourse.com/stock/alrajhibankingandi_20251030170228.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"600\"/></p><h2>\nADNOC Gas: Efficiency with endurance</h2><p>\nSector: Energy</p><p>\nWith a market capitalization of $74.36 billion, ADNOC Gas anchors the UAE’s gas sector as an integrated processing powerhouse. The company reports a return on equity of 21.6% and a net margin of 20.5%, both in the upper range of our universe. Its share price has advanced 6.3% over the past year, maintaining a steady upward path despite global market turbulence.</p><p>\nProfitability remains exceptional — EBITDA, EBIT, and net margins all sit in the upper decile, while capital efficiency and return on assets also rank highly. The company holds a 5★ Investor Rating, the highest in our selection, and a matching Trader Rating.</p><p>\nAlthough its revenue growth decile is lower, EPS growth ranks near the top, pointing to strong cost control and expanding margins. ADNOC Gas’s dual role as a supplier of LNG and industrial gases to both domestic and export markets offers resilience, while its integrated model ensures consistent operational performance and long-term visibility.</p><p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-zoomable=\"true\" height=\"400\" src=\"//img.zonebourse.com/stock/adnocgasplc_20251030170308.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"600\"/></p><h2>\nThree paths to resilience</h2><p>\nTogether, Aramco, Al Rajhi, and ADNOC Gas illustrate three distinct paths to quality in the Gulf. Aramco delivers scale and yield but must manage cyclical pressures and policy risks. Al Rajhi exemplifies dependable growth through disciplined financial management. ADNOC Gas stands out for its efficiency and stability, supported by its strategic position in the regional energy value chain.</p><p>\nEach company reflects the high-ROE, high-margin profile our screening process targets — a compelling combination of resilience, profitability, and strategic focus in a region redefining what sustainable growth looks like.</p></div>",

Group new order intake increased by 5.6% in Q3 compared to the prior year, with September returning to Q2 2025 levels following seasonally softer trading in July and August,\" Essentra said. </p><p></p><p>\"Consistent with H1 2025, EMEA revenue performance during the period was mixed. The region returned to year-on-year growth against soft prior-year comparatives, further supported by a strong relative performance in Turkey, which continues to benefit from faster-growing end-markets, the implementation of pricing initiatives and local currency devaluation. EMEA ex-Turkey experienced subdued demand across the quarter, particularly in higher margin UK and Western European geographies.\"</p><p></p><p>Trading in the Americas \"maintained its year-on-year growth momentum\".</p><p></p><p>\"The APAC region continues to be driven by market dynamics in China, supported by a number of business wins in faster-growing end-markets,\" Essentra added. </p><p></p><p>The firm added that year-on-year revenue growth and an improving order intake trend has continued into October. </p><p></p><p>\"While the group remains cautious about the timing of any material recovery in market conditions, actions taken to streamline the cost base and optimise operations will protect profitability and allow Essentra to benefit from significant operational gearing as market conditions improve,\" it added. </p><p></p><p>\"Given the strength of Essentra's operations in Turkey, which generate lower margins compared to the rest of EMEA, the group's overall gross margin was slightly weaker than expected in the period and this effect is likely to continue into the final quarter of the year. As such, management now anticipates that the full year adjusted operating margin will remain consistent with the first half of the year.\"</p><p></p><p>Essentra's adjusted operating margin in the first half weakened to 10.8% from 13.7%. </p><p></p><p>Shares in the company were down 7.2% at 98.70 pence in London on Thursday afternoon.</p><p></p><p>By Eric Cunha, Alliance News news editor</p><p></p><p>Comments and questions to newsroom@alliancenews.com</p><p></p><p>Copyright 2025 Alliance News Ltd.
