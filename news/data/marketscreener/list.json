This is way below earlier government projections for 3.4% growth in 2025, which was cut later to 2.5% and then 1%. </p><p>\n              He also said the economy cannot be boosted by cutting spending as some economists suggest.</p><p>\n              \"We should do what is good for people....and not what straightens the numbers. So I believe Hungary's economy cannot be put on the growth track with saving steps,\" Orban said.</p><p>\n              He said the only question was in how many steps the so-called \"14th-month pension\" could be introduced. The top-up would see pensioners who already receive an extra month's worth of pension per year receive an extra \"14th month\" payment.</p><p>\n              While the economic recovery remains weak, stubborn inflation is preventing interest rate cuts. The central bank's base rate stands at 6.5%. </p><p>\n              Orban also faces strong competition from a new centre-right opposition party which currently leads most polls.</p><p>\n              Peter Virovacz, an economist with ING Bank, said introducing the pension top-up would cost an equivalent to 0.6% of Hungary's GDP.</p><p>\n              Hungary's fiscal consolidation will be slower than expected, Fitch Ratings said earlier this month, adding that recently flagged tax cuts could create additional risk to its deficit and debt projections amid weak growth.</p><p>\n              (Reporting by Krisztina Than and Anita Komuves; Editing by Sharon Singleton)</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Kwanwoo Jun </p><br/><p>\n  LG Electronics' third-quarter net profit surged despite sluggish demand and tariff headwinds, as resilience in its home-appliance and auto-component segments offset weakness in its television business. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  The South Korean consumer-electronics giant said Friday that net profit rose fivefold from a year earlier to 461.00 billion won, equivalent to $322.5 million, for the July-September period. Analysts had expected 287.50 billion won for the quarter, according to a FactSet-compiled consensus. </p><p>\n\n  Although the results were better than market expectations, LG said it expects the global home-appliance market to remain challenging in the final quarter of the year, due to a slow recovery in demand and intensified competition. </p><p>\n\n  For the third quarter, revenue fell 1.4% to 21.874 trillion won, and operating profit dropped 8.4% to 688.90 billion won, in line with the company's preliminary estimates. </p><p>\n\n  LG's home-appliance and vehicle-component segments grew despite higher tariffs and soft demand in major global markets, with revenues rising 4.7% and 1.4%, respectively. </p><p>\n\n  Revenue from its media and entertainment segment, which includes televisions and laptop computers, slumped 9.5%. Costs associated with marketing amid intensified competition and early retirement programs for employees in the segment weighed on operating profit. </p><p>\n\n  The Korean electronics maker said Friday that it continues to be affected by President Trump's higher levies despite the U.S. trade agreement struck earlier this week. Under the deal, Washington would lower blanket tariffs on most Korean goods to 15% from 25% in exchange for a $350 billion investment from Seoul. </p><p>\n\n  The U.S. maintains a 50% duty on steel and aluminum, key materials in many home appliances and auto parts, and recently expanded the tariffs to cover finished products. </p><p>\n\n  The increasingly challenging trade environment has prompted LG to expand into new businesses, such as heating, ventilation and air-conditioning services, as well as nonhardware platforms like appliance subscriptions and online services. </p><p>\n\n  The company has set an annual HVAC revenue target of 20 trillion won by 2030. It has also designated its new business of supplying advanced chiller systems to data centers and large-scale commercial buildings as a core future growth driver. </p><p>\n\n  Earlier this month, LG raised $1.3 billion by selling a 15% stake in its Indian subsidiary in an initial public offering. The proceeds could provide the company with significant funding to improve its business structure and drive new initiatives for future growth, it said. </p><p>\n\n  Kiwoom Securities analyst Kim So-won said that some of LG Electronics India's IPO proceeds could also be allocated to dividends and share buybacks to enhance investor returns. Kim was upbeat about India's home-appliance market, projecting growth of 14% annually through 2029. </p><p>\n\n  Shares of LG Electronics ended flat after the results. The stock has underperformed the broader market this year, gaining by around 5% compared with the benchmark Kospi's 71% gain. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Kwanwoo Jun at kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-31-25 0355ET</p></div>",
