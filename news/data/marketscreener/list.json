Berkshire has also repurchased none of its own stock since the spring of 2024.</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              \"I recognize how you want us to succeed together, and to do so in the right way,\" Abel wrote. \"My role is to ensure our liquidity levels and capital deployment remain intentional and deliberate.\"</p><p>\n              Abel also paid homage to Buffett, 95, who stepped down at year-end after 60 years as chief executive.

Including changes in the value of equity holdings led by Apple and American Express, net income fell 3% to $19.2 billion.</p><p>\n              For all of 2025, operating profit fell 6% to $44.49 billion, while net income fell 25% to $67 billion.</p><p>\n              Buffett had long urged investors to ignore fluctuations in Berkshire's net income, which reflect accounting rules that require Berkshire to report gains and losses on stocks that Berkshire is not selling.</p><p>\n               (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Louise Heavens and Lisa Shumaker)</p><p>\n            By Jonathan Stempel</p></div>",
