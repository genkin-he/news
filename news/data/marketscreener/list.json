Net profit came in at $27.46bn, largely inflated by a 2024 comparison basis that was affected by an exceptional tax charge. The group anticipates between 10% and 12% revenue growth in the December quarter, driven by \"exceptional\" demand for the iPhone 17, according to Tim Cook.</p><p>\nThe commercial momentum of the new iPhone, launched at the end of September, should enable Apple to achieve record revenue of close to $137bn, exceeding consensus expectations ($132.31bn). Cook said that several models were already out of stock, including in the previous range. While iPhone sales ($49.03bn) were slightly below expectations for the past quarter, other segments posted solid performances, particularly services ($28.75bn, +15%) and Macs ($8.73bn, +13%).</p><!-- Article --><p>\nApple continues to strengthen its position in high-margin services, which are becoming its main source of profitability. At the same time, the company is accelerating its efforts in artificial intelligence: a new version of Siri integrated with Apple Intelligence is planned for 2026, with a partnership already established with OpenAI. The group is also absorbing the costs associated with customs duties without passing them on to consumers. Despite a decline in sales in China (-4%), Tim Cook expects a return to growth as early as next quarter. Apple is thus approaching the end of the year with a solid outlook, at the crossroads of product innovation and strategic diversification. This was enough to push the stock up over 4% in after-hours rading, even though it is already at historic highs.</p></div>",
