            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London closed mostly lower on Friday, after positive news for European trade with China and hawkish comments by a US Federal Reserve officer. </p><p></p><p>Meanwhile in the UK, softer inflation data means the Bank of England's interest rate call on Thursday next week is more finely balanced than previously thought. A hold is broadly expected, but the vote is expected to be close, and a quarter-point cut is far from ruled out.</p><!-- Article --><p></p><p>With 'dovish' Monetary Policy Committee members Swati Dhingra and Alan Taylor expected to vote for a cut, the outcome will likely depend on the decisions of BoE Governor Andrew Bailey, Deputy Governor Sarah Breedon and Dave Ramsden. The BoE's dilemma follows a downside surprise in September inflation data, cooling pay growth, a weakening labour market and lacklustre economic growth. In addition, reports suggest Chancellor Rachel Reeves may opt to remove VAT on electricity bills in November's budget, adding to downward pressure on inflation.</p><p></p><p>The FTSE 100 index closed down 42.81 points, 0.4%, at 9,717.25. The FTSE 250 ended down 105.31 points, 0.5%, at 22,170.97, and the AIM All-Share closed up 2.58 points, 0.3%, at 772.38.</p><p></p><p>The Cboe UK 100 was down 0.4% at 969.84, the Cboe UK 250 was 0.6% lower at 19,256.82, and the Cboe Small Companies was up 0.1% at 17,908.94.</p><p></p><p>On the FTSE 250, Raspberry Pi ended up 0.4%, after announcing that Chief Financial Officer Richard Boult will step down from his role in the second half of 2026 to \"explore new challenges,\" with a formal search for his successor now underway.</p><p></p><p>The Cambridge, England-based maker of personal-use computers and modules said Boult will assist in the recruitment process to ensure an orderly succession. </p><p></p><p>Among smaller caps, Coral Products climbed 14% after posting a swing to an annual profit.</p><p></p><p>The Manchester, England-based maker of bespoke plastic products said it swung to a pretax profit of GBP216,000 in the financial year ended April 30, from a loss of GBP1.2 million a year prior. Revenue fell 3.7% to GBP29.8 million from GBP31.0 million.</p><p></p><p>Chair Joe Grimmond said after a \"disappointing\" first half, the company \"took decisive action by appointing a largely new executive team with a clear focus on strengthening our operational fundamentals.\"</p><p></p><p>Crimson Tide gained 12%.</p><p></p><p>The Kent, England-based software developer said it continues to see evidence of the impact of its new strategy, which is designed to result in sustainable growth.</p><p></p><p>At the annual general meeting, Chair Chris Fielding said Crimson Tide's performance \"remains in line with the board's expectations of re-establishing the foundations for growth in future years\". Cash on October 29 amounted to GBP1.3 million, which the firm expects to largely maintain for the rest of the financial year.</p><p></p><p>Versarien lost 28%, after the Gloucestershire-based advanced materials group said it has inked a non-binding heads of terms with an unnamed UK PLC regarding the disposal of its remaining assets. </p><p></p><p>The consideration for the assets would be GBP100,000 in cash and around GBP100,000 in shares in the potential acquirer.

The other dissenter was Governor Stephen Miran, who wanted a larger cut.</p><p></p><p>\"The labour market is largely in balance, the economy shows continued momentum, and inflation remains too high,\" Schmid said in a statement. </p><p></p><p>\"I view the stance of policy as only modestly restrictive,\" he added. \"In this context, I judged it appropriate to maintain the policy rate at this week's meeting.\"</p><p></p><p>In other US news, G7 countries will have to use \"non-market\" tactics to curb China's dominance in rare earth production, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said, calling the effort a \"strategic necessity.\"</p><p></p><p>\"China, frankly, just used non-market practices to squish the rest of the world out of manufacturing those products, so it got strategic leverage.

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Dow Jones Newswires staff </p><br/><p>\n  Below are the most important global events likely to affect FX and bond markets in the week starting Nov. 3. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  U.S. ISM survey data will be closely watched as investors assess whether or not the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again in December. All eyes will also be on whether U.S. lawmakers can agree to end the government shutdown, which prevents the release of key economic data. </p><p>\n\n  Elsewhere, focus will center on central bank interest-rate decisions in the U.K. and Australia, as well as a number of other countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Sweden, Norway and Malaysia. </p><p>\n\n  In Asia, purchasing managers' surveys, including from China, will be closely watched as U.S. trade policy continues to set the tone for the region. </p><br/><p>\n  U.S. </p><br/><p>\n  Upcoming U.S. economic data will be scrutinized after the Federal Reserve recently cut interest rates by 25 basis points, as expected, but Chair Jerome Powell said a follow-up rate reduction in December wasn't a foregone conclusion. </p><p>\n\n  Investors will, therefore, be looking for any evidence of weakness in the labor market or evidence that inflation is slowing, which could increase prospects of a December rate cut. Investors are less sure about prospects for December's meeting after the latest Fed announcement, with money markets currently pricing in a 68% chance of another rate reduction then. </p><p>\n\n  If the U.S. government shutdown continues, however, this will mean official data, including key U.S. jobs figures, will still not be released. </p><p>\n\n  Investors will, therefore, focus closely on private-sector data, notably the ISM surveys on manufacturing activity in October due on Monday and on services activity due on Wednesday, as well as ADP private payrolls figures on Wednesday and University of Michigan's preliminary consumer survey for November on Friday. </p><p>\n\n  These \"will be more closely watched than usual for indications on the health of the labour market and inflationary pressures,\" HSBC economists said in a note. </p><p>\n\n  Meanwhile, markets will await any news when the government could be reopened. </p><p>\n\n  Scheduled data which won't be released unless the government reopens include trade data and factory orders figures on Tuesday, weekly jobless claims figures Thursday and monthly jobs data on Friday. </p><p>\n\n  There are no Treasury auctions but the quarterly refunding announcement is due on Wednesday. </p><p>\n\n  The U.S. Treasury is set to hold auction sizes steady for a seventh consecutive quarter at the November refunding announcement on Nov. 5, TD Securities' Gennadiy Goldberg and Jan Nevruzi said in a note. The U.S. rates strategists don't expect auction size increases until at least late 2026, with the Treasury likely keeping guidance unchanged. </p><br/><p>\n  Canada </p><br/><p>\n  Canadian jobs data for October on Friday will be closely watched as investors look for any evidence of growing weakness in the Canadian economy that could prompt the central bank to cut interest rates again. </p><p>\n\n  The Bank of Canada cut interest rates at its latest meeting but signaled that rates were likely to stay on hold for now. Still, recent gross domestic product data for August were weaker than expected. </p><p>\n\n  The latest rate cut will likely be the last one in the current cycle, but if the economy or labor market weakens more than expected the central bank could trim rates a little further, Oxford Economics' Tony Stillo and Michael Davenport said in a note. </p><br/><p>\n  Latin America </p><br/><p>\n  Brazil's central bank announces a rate decision on Wednesday and is expected to leave rates unchanged at 15.00%. </p><p>\n\n  \"The gradual and steady re-anchoring process of inflation expectations and the current domestic slowdown are likely to continue improving the inflation outlook going forward,\" Citi analysts said in a note. They expect the central bank to begin gradually lowering rates in the first quarter of 2026. </p><p>\n\n  Mexico's central bank is also set to announce a decision on Thursday, where it is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points in order to bolster the economy, taking the key interest rate down to 7.25%. </p><br/><p>\n  Eurozone </p><br/><p>\n  A quiet week in data follows the European Central Bank's policy meeting, where rates were left unchanged amid a relatively upbeat view on the eurozone's growth outlook. </p><p>\n\n  Spanish, Italian, French, German and eurozone final manufacturing purchasing managers indexes for October are up for release on Monday, followed by services PMIs on Wednesday. </p><p>\n\n  Germany publishes manufacturing orders data for September on Wednesday and industrial output figures on Thursday. France publishes industrial production data for September on Wednesday, and Spain releases similar data on Thursday. </p><p>\n\n  Eurozone retail sales data are due on Thursday. </p><p>\n\n  Germany will sell the December 2027 Schatz on Tuesday, as well as May 2041 and July 2044 Bunds on Wednesday. Other sovereign-bond issuers are Austria on Tuesday, and Spain and France on Thursday. </p><br/><p>\n  U.K. </p><br/><p>\n  Market focus will be on the Bank of England interest rate decision due on Thursday. </p><p>\n\n  The central bank is broadly expected to keep interest rates on hold at 4.0%, particularly ahead of the government's budget announcement on Nov. 26. </p><p>\n\n  However, some analysts expect that rates could be cut by 25 basis points, or at least that the decision will be a close call, following recent weaker-than-expected U.K. inflation and jobs data. </p><p>\n\n  \"We see a clear, although narrow path, to pave the way for a cut at the November meeting,\" said Danske Bank's Kirstine Kundby-Nielsen in a note. </p><p>\n\n  U.K. money markets price a 31% chance of a rate cut at this upcoming meeting, LSEG data show. </p><p>\n\n  Economic data during the week include final purchasing managers' data on manufacturing on Monday and on services on Wednesday. </p><p>\n\n  The Bank of England will also release its quarterly monetary policy report, where it will outline forecasts for inflation and the economy. </p><p>\n\n  The U.K. plans to sell 5 billion pounds in May 2029 gilt on Tuesday. </p><br/><p>\n  Scandinavia </p><br/><p>\n  Sweden's Riksbank announces an interest-rate decision on Wednesday, followed by a decision by Norway's Norges Bank on Thursday, with both expected to hold rates. </p><p>\n\n  The Riksbank is expected to leave its policy rate at 1.75%. ING analyst Francesco Pesole said in a note that solid Swedish economic growth argues against the Riksbank cutting interest rates again any time soon. </p><p>\n\n  Norges Bank is also expected to keep rates on hold at 4.0%, confirming it is in no hurry to increase rates further. </p><p>\n\n  Denmark and Sweden will hold bond auctions on Wednesday. </p><br/><p>\n  Poland </p><br/><p>\n  Poland's central bank will announce a policy decision on Wednesday where another interest-rate cut is widely expected. Market pricing implies an 85% chance of another 25 basis points rate cut to 4.25%, LSEG data show. </p><p>\n\n  At the October meeting, the central bank unexpectedly cut rates by 25 basis. It marked the fourth cut this year and came after inflation held at 2.9% in September, coming in below expectations. Data Friday showed inflation eased to 2.8% in October, strengthening the case for further rate cuts. </p><br/><p>\n  Czech Republic </p><br/><p>\n  The Czech National Bank announces its latest interest-rate decision on Thursday. Markets are pricing a 65% probability that the central bank will leave rates unchanged at 3.5% and a 35% chance of a 25 basis-point cut, LSEG data show. </p><p>\n\n  While inflation eased to 2% in September, stronger-than-expected economic growth data argues that the central bank should be cautious about cutting rates, ING analyst Chris Turner said in a note. </p><p>\n\n  \"The economy is growing at its fastest pace since the Covid rebound, and at the same time, wages are showing upside, which will keep core inflation higher,\" he said. </p><br/><p>\n  Switzerland </p><br/><p>\n  Switzerland releases consumer-price inflation data for October on Monday. </p><br/><p>\n  Japan </p><br/><p>\n  On Wednesday, the Bank of Japan will release minutes from its September meeting that will shed light into the central bank's decision to hold rates steady. At that meeting, two board members proposed hiking the policy rate to 0.75%, a proposal that was ultimately defeated. </p><p>\n\n  Japan's finance ministry is set to auction about 2.6 trillion yen of 10-year Japanese Government bonds on Wednesday. The sale could draw strong demand from investors following BOJ Gov. Kazuo Ueda's recent comments after the central bank held rates steady again in October. He said he sees no risk of Japan falling behind the policy curve, suggesting the BOJ is in no rush to tighten policy settings. </p><p>\n\n  He also said the central bank wants to further assess wage growth momentum and review more economic data before considering rate increases. </p><p>\n\n  Japanese markets will be closed on Monday for a national holiday. Auto sale figures for October, a gauge of consumer demand, are due Tuesday, while household spending data will be released Friday. </p><br/><p>\n  China </p><br/><p>\n  Markets will focus on a fresh batch of economic data from China following the recent easing of U.S.-China trade tensions. The two countries' leaders recently held their first face-to-face meeting in six years, agreeing to a temporary truce that included lowering tariffs. </p><p>\n\n  A private gauge for factory activity for the month of October--compiled before the meeting-is expected to show a slowdown in momentum. The RatingDog manufacturing PMI, due Monday, is likely to have edged down to 50.0 from 51.2 in September amid slowing export growth, Nomura analysts said. </p><p>\n\n  Capital Economics' Zichun Huang noted that while private PMI readings have been stronger than official data recently, \"the message is likely to be that growth momentum remains subdued, and we don't expect that to change in the coming quarters.\" </p><p>\n\n  China is also set to release October trade data on Friday. Nomura analysts expect export growth to slow sharply to 3.0% on year from 8.3% in September and import growth to ease to 5.0% from 7.4%, marginally widening the trade surplus to $94 billion. </p><p>\n\n  ANZ's Raymond Yeung projects exports and imports growth of just 1.2% and 2.3%, respectively, in U.S. dollar terms, citing fewer working days during the month and a high base last year. </p><p>\n\n  China's foreign-exchange reserves data is also scheduled for release during the week. </p><br/><p>\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-31-25 1259ET</p></div>",
