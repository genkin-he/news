Important lessons being drawn for our #ChipsAct 2.0 foreseen beginning of 2026,\" Virkkunen said on X.</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              She had hosted virtual meetings with the CEOs of Infineon, STMicroelectronics, NXP and Acea earlier on Thursday.</p><p>\n              Nexperia, owned by Chinese company Wingtech, has been in the spotlight after the Dutch government earlier this month took control of the company.</p><p>\n              Sources say this was prompted by worries that its former CEO was dismantling the company's European operations and moving production to China.</p><p>\n              Beijing subsequently responded by blocking Nexperia products from leaving China, prompting the Netherlands-based company to tell carmakers it could no longer guarantee supplies. That triggered nervousness in other sectors as well.</p><p>\n              Nexperia makes basic power control chips such as transistors and diodes. These cost only a few cents to buy, but are needed in almost every device that uses electricity and are ubiquitous in cars to connect the battery to motors, for lights and braking systems.</p><p>\n              Europe adopted the 43 billion euro ($50.15 billion) EU Chips Act in 2023, aimed at doubling the bloc's share of global chip output to 20% by 2030 and reducing its reliance on foreign chipmakers. </p><p>\n              The European Commission will review this legislation next year, and has tentatively called it Chips Act 2. </p><p>\n              ($1 = 0.8575 euros)</p><p>\n               (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Jan Harvey)</p><p>\n            By Foo Yun Chee</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  Crude oil contracts were little changed at midday Thursday, as energy investors reviewed a temporary truce in trade tensions between the U.S. and China following a meeting between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. </p><p>\n\n  The NYMEX December West Texas Intermediate contract was about 5cts higher at $60.55/bbl at noon ET and January WTI was up by a similar amount to $60.15/bbl. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  The ICE December Brent contract was also 5cts higher at $65/bbl and January Brent was unchanged at $64.30/bbl. </p><p>\n\n  Both oil benchmarks fell about $1 on Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned against assuming a December cut in interest rate was all but guaranteed following Wednesday's decision to cut benchmark interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point. </p><p>\n\n  Refined product contracts were mixed. The more-active NYMEX December ULSD contract was up 0.95ct to $2.4065/gal and the November contract was 2.05cts higher at $2.445/gal. The December RBOB contract was down 0.4ct to $1.887/gal and November RBOB was up 0.8ct to $1.982/gal. </p><p>\n\n  Analysts said the temporary agreement between Trump and Xi eases trade tensions between the two nations, but does not address fundamental trade issues. </p><p>\n\n  PBF Energy on Thursday said it expects its 157,000 b/d Martinez refinery in Northern California to return to full output by the end of the year following the completion of seasonal maintenance and repairs to equipment damaged by a February fire. </p><br/><p>\n  This content was created by Oil Price Information Service, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
