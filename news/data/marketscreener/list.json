            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Adriano Marchese </p><br/><p>\n  Restaurant Brands International is proving resilient against a cautious consumer, posting higher quarterly sales driven by its Tim Hortons chain and a pickup from Burger King's international operations. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  The quick-service restaurant company on Thursday reported a 7% rise in revenue of $2.45 billion, topping Wall Street expectations of $2.39 billion. </p><p>\n\n  Leading the charge were the company's Tim Hortons and international businesses, which together represent over two-thirds of the company's adjusted operating income. They posted comparable sales growth of 4.2% and 6.5%, respectively. Burger King comparative sales rose 3.1%. </p><p>\n\n  The results come as budget-conscious consumers pull back on spending. While higher-priced fast-casual chains like Chipotle--which recently cut guidance on the back of slowing sales--are feeling the squeeze, traditional quick-service restaurants appear to be shrugging off the pressure. </p><p>\n\n  Restaurant Brands, as well as other major quick-service players like Yum Brands, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut, have seen their sales pick up, suggesting that diners could be trading down to the more value-based offerings of fast-food restaurants rather than forgoing eating out entirely. </p><p>\n\n  In an investor call Thursday, management said consumer habits across income levels have remained largely stable throughout the year. While noting a slight softness among lower and middle-income groups, management said this trend is not new and that its third-quarter results reflect a year-long focus on delivering consistent value in that environment. </p><p>\n\n  Net income in the third quarter rose to $315 million, or 96 cents a share, up from $252 million, or 79 cents a share, in the prior-year period. On an adjusted basis, earnings per-share of $1.03 came in better than expected as well. </p><p>\n\n  Tim Hortons' system-wide sales growth was 4.8% to $2.03 billion, while Burger King's was 2.3% to $2.96 billion. As for the Popeyes brand, it posted system-wide sales growth of 0.7% to $1.52 billion, and Firehouse Subs reported 11% growth to $332 million. The international segment rose just over 12% to $5.45 billion. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Adriano Marchese at adriano.marchese@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-30-25 1043ET</p></div>",

But electric trucks still make up a small fraction of the market, as they cost significantly more than diesel models and buyers remain concerned about charging infrastructure.</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              In a letter to the European Commission dated Oct. 13, the companies called for changes to the EU's credit system which rewards manufacturers whose emissions fall below both the bloc's targets and a linear trajectory between target years. Instead, they want credits for simply beating the headline targets.</p><p>\n              Christian Levin, CEO of Scania and Traton, told Reuters the letter was \"a cry out for help\". </p><p>\n              \"We're not arguing the targets are wrong... but it's going to be very, very difficult,\" said Levin, who is also the chair of the European automobile manufacturers' association's (ACEA) commercial vehicles board.</p><p>\n              A spokesperson for Daimler Truck said the industry had invested heavily in electrification but faced \"draconian\" penalties for missing targets - despite factors outside of their control, including battery manufacturing and charging infrastructure.</p><p>\n              \"The best would be to remove these stupid fines on the industry, and rather force everyone in the system through incentives or penalties to do the job together,\" Levin added.</p><p>\n              Under EU law, truckmakers must cut emissions from new trucks by 15% by 2025, rising to 90% in 2040, compared to 2019 levels.</p><p>\n              Most truckmakers are on track to meet the 2025 goal - mainly through improving their diesel-powered lineup rather than selling more electric trucks.  </p><p>\n              Environmental campaigners warn that weakening the targets could slow Europe's shift to electrification and open the door to Chinese producers. Campaign group Transport &amp; Environment said the proposed changes could cut EU sales of zero-emission trucks by 27% in 2030.</p><p>\n              The European Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen recently promised heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers \"concrete measures to assist them to reach their targets\", in a separate letter to EU leaders. </p><p>\n              Brussels is already considering weakening its 2035 car CO2 emissions target, following pressure from industry and member states.</p><p></p><p> (Reporting by Kate Abnett in Brussels and Marie Mannes in Stockholm; additional reporting by Christina Amann, Ilona Wissenbach, Giulio Piovaccari)</p><p>\n            By Kate Abnett and Marie Mannes</p></div>",
