Headline inflation in the Philippines is expected to be driven by higher rice prices, said Barclays economists. </p><p>\n\n  The latest data would help set the central bank's future rate path trajectory, after it lowered its key interest rate at its last meeting in February, while noting it will be guided by incoming data. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  In Thailand, markets will be watching if consumer prices fall further. According to the median estimate forecast by five economists polled by The Wall Street Journal, consumer prices are expected to have fallen 0.49% on year in February. </p><p>\n\n  This was likely due to lower domestic petrol and diesel prices, as well as softer pork prices, said Eugene Tan of Moody's Analytics. The latest data comes amid expectations of weak growth and subdued inflation. </p><br/><p>\n  Taiwan </p><br/><p>\n  Taiwan will release February inflation data on Friday. </p><p>\n\n  Economists expect the island's consumer prices to have risen temporarily due to base effects and strong Lunar New Year demand.

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Dow Jones Newswires staff </p><br/><p>\n  Below are the most important global events likely to affect FX and bond markets in the week starting March 2. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  U.S. jobs data will mark the highlight of the coming week as investors remain uncertain about when the Federal Reserve is next likely to cut interest rates. </p><p>\n\n  In Europe, attention will center on eurozone inflation data and the spring statement by the U.K.'s treasury chief. In Asia, the Bank of Japan's policy outlook, Australia's growth figures and China's annual parliamentary sessions are in focus. </p><br/><p>\n  U.S. </p><br/><p>\n  U.S. jobs data are back in focus in the coming week, with monthly nonfarm payrolls data for February due on Friday. </p><p>\n\n  Investors will be looking to see whether January's surprisingly strong payrolls numbers were a one-off. This comes amid uncertainty over whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the coming months, although analysts say it would likely take a particularly weak number to move the dial much on rate expectations. </p><p>\n\n  \"Our view is that it would take quite a lot to get the Fed thinking about an imminent rate cut,\" ING economists said in a note. </p><p>\n\n  U.S. money markets aren't pricing in a rate cut until July at the earliest, LSEG data show. ING doesn't expect another reduction until June. </p><p>\n\n  Ahead of Friday's key data, ADP private payrolls figures for February will be released Wednesday, followed by weekly jobless claims Thursday. </p><p>\n\n  The latest ISM surveys for February for manufacturing and services activity will be released on Monday and Wednesday, respectively. These will be keenly watched for indications of the overall performance of the U.S. economy, particularly amid uncertainty over U.S. tariff policy and tensions between the U.S. and Iran. U.S. January retail sales data are also released Friday. </p><br/><p>\n  Eurozone </p><br/><p>\n  The eurozone data calendar thins out after the usual end-of-month avalanche. </p><p>\n\n  Spanish, Italian, French, German and eurozone manufacturing and services PMI data are due on Monday and Wednesday, respectively. </p><p>\n\n  Italy will release yearly GDP data on Monday and flash estimate CPI data for February on Tuesday, when the same data is also scheduled from the eurozone as a whole. </p><p>\n\n  Eurozone unemployment figures for January are scheduled for Wednesday and retail sales data for the same month on Thursday. Germany will publish manufacturing orders data for January on Friday. </p><p>\n\n  Final fourth-quarter GDP and employment data from the eurozone are due on Friday. </p><p>\n\n  \"For now, the economy still looks to be 'in a good place', albeit one that the European Central Bank thinks requires vigilance and agility,\" Investec analyst Sandra Horsfield says in a note. </p><p>\n\n  The Netherlands will launch a new 10-year bond via a Dutch Direct Auction on Tuesday, aiming to issue between 6 billion euros and 7 billion euros. Germany will auction April 2031 bonds on Tuesday and a February 2033 green Bund on Wednesday. Spain and France will hold bond auctions on Thursday. Italy will issue a new series of retail-only BTP Valore, with subscriptions running between Monday and Friday. </p><br/><p>\n  U.K. </p><br/><p>\n  Focus in the U.K. will be on Tuesday's spring statement, a twice-yearly report on U.K. public finances which Treasury chief Rachel Reeves will present before lawmakers. This will be followed by an announcement on gilt issuance by the Debt Management Office. </p><p>\n\n  Markets expect Reeves to announce an improved fiscal position, including solid fiscal headroom. Gilt investors also expect government debt issuance to fall in the fiscal year to April 2027. Analysts said this could help push yields on U.K. government bonds lower. </p><p>\n\n  Economic data include final purchasing managers' data for February on manufacturing on Monday, then on services Wednesday. Data on consumer credit and mortgage lending for January are released on Monday, as well as the latest Nationwide house price index for February. The BRC's shop price index for February is released Tuesday. </p><br/><p>\n  Poland </p><br/><p>\n  Poland's central bank announces an interest-rate decision on Wednesday, where it could announce a 25 basis-point reduction in its key policy rate to 3.75%. </p><p>\n\n  HSBC economists expect a rate cut due to evidence of declining inflation. </p><p>\n\n  \"We continue to expect that during the March meeting the rate-setters will have a new inflation forecast that will show a downward revision to the Polish central bank's 2026 inflation forecast, to or even below the 2.5% target,\" they said in a note. This should be enough to warrant a rate cut, they said. </p><br/><p>\n  Japan </p><br/><p>\n  Investors will look for clues on the timing of the Bank of Japan's next rate increase in speeches by BOJ officials. Deputy Gov. Ryozo Himino will meet local leaders in Wakayama, Japan, on Monday. Governor Kazuo Ueda is scheduled to appear at the  \"FIN/SUM 2026\" event in Tokyo on Tuesday. </p><p>\n\n  Japan's Ministry of Finance will auction about 2.6 trillion yen of 10-year government bonds on Tuesday and around 700 billion yen of 30-year bonds on Thursday. The 30-year sale may draw strong demand from pension funds and insurers seeking higher yields. </p><p>\n\n  Auto sales figures for February are also scheduled for release on Monday. </p><br/><p>\n  Australia </p><br/><p>\n  Bond traders will focus on Australia's fourth-quarter 2025 growth data due Wednesday. </p><p>\n\n  The economy is expected to have grown 2.1% in calendar 2025 while operating near full capacity, adding to inflation pressures. </p><p>\n\n  The week will therefore be dominated once again by a discussion about a decade of weak productivity growth, excessive government spending and the potential for the Reserve Bank of Australia to raise interest rates in the coming months, perhaps as early as mid-March. </p><p>\n\n  The release on Thursday of the household spending indicator for January will also be closely watched by the central bank, given that strong consumer spending will add to the case for higher interest rates. </p><p>\n\n  RBA Governor Michele Bullock will deliver a speech on Tuesday. Bullock has been indicating that the central bank is closely monitoring data, including quarterly inflation numbers in late April that are likely to be critical in setting the scene for an interest rate increase in May. </p><p>\n\n  For the RBA, the data will point to whether aggregate capacity constraints are more or less worrisome than before. January's household spending data should show consumer activity starting 2026 at a subdued pace, while house price data is likely to confirm another strong monthly increase. </p><br/><p>\n  China </p><br/><p>\n  China returns from the Lunar New Year holiday to a busy week of data and policy announcements, including the annual meetings of its top legislature and advisory body. </p><p>\n\n  The National People's Congress, part of the \"Two Sessions,\" will open on Thursday. Beijing is expected to announce key economic targets for 2026, including GDP growth. </p><p>\n\n  ING economists forecast the growth target will be lowered to \"above 4.5%\" from \"around 5.0%\" in recent years. Fiscal targets, including the deficit-to-GDP ratio and bond issuance, are also expected. </p><p>\n\n  A reduced growth target would mark the first in four years. Citi economists said such a move would signal measured stimulus. They anticipate 1 trillion yuan in fiscal support, a possible 10-basis-point rate cut and a 50-basis-point reserve requirement ratio cut this year. </p><p>\n\n  Further measures could focus on stabilizing the labor market, boosting household income and domestic demand as well as advancing AI adoption. </p><p>\n\n  Official PMIs due Wednesday are likely to reflect disruption from February's extended holidays. ANZ economist Krystal Tan expects the manufacturing PMI to fall to 49.0 from 49.3, and the non-manufacturing PMI to edge down to 49.3 from 49.4. Small and midsize firms may show particular weakness, with tourism gains offset by softness in construction and finance. </p><p>\n\n  Private PMIs compiled by RatingDog are also due Wednesday. Foreign-exchange reserves data will be released Saturday. </p><br/><p>\n  Asian PMIs </p><br/><p>\n  Monday brings February manufacturing PMIs for Taiwan, Japan, India, Vietnam and other economies. </p><p>\n\n  Investors will look for signs that renewed U.S. tariff uncertainty has affected business sentiment, especially after The Supreme Court struck down Trump's global tariffs as illegal. </p><p>\n\n  The ruling may offer temporary relief for some exporters, but trade policy remains uncertain. Momentum is likely to remain supported by a strong tech-led export cycle, which remains largely insulated from the tariff shifts, ANZ added. </p><br/><p>\n  Malaysia </p><br/><p>\n  Malaysia's central bank will announce its rate decision Thursday afternoon. </p><p>\n\n  With inflation contained and labor-cost growth moderate, Citi expects Bank Negara to keep its policy rate unchanged at 2.75% through 2026. Policymakers are likely to favor a gradual appreciation of the ringgit to tighten monetary conditions. </p><br/><p>\n  South Korea </p><br/><p>\n  South Korea is expected to report solid February exports on Mar. 1, driven by robust semiconductor demand despite fewer working days in the month. </p><p>\n\n  A Wall Street Journal poll of nine economists forecast exports rose 25.6% from a year earlier, after a revised 33.8% increase in January. Early February trade data suggest chip exports are on track for a monthly record. Imports likely rose 13.6%, resulting in a $10.10 billion trade surplus--wider than January's revised $8.72 billion surplus. </p><p>\n\n  February inflation data are due Friday. Headline inflation is expected to remain near the central bank's 2% target after easing to a five-month low of 2.0% in January from 2.3% in December. </p><br/><p>\n  Indonesia </p><br/><p>\n  Indonesia will release January trade and February inflation data Monday afternoon. </p><p>\n\n  Headline inflation likely rose in February due to base effects and stronger demand during Ramadan, Kenanga Investment Bank said. </p><p>\n\n  January export growth may moderate as base effects fade after a temporary rise in late 2025, RHB said in a note. However, exports should maintain moderate growth over 2026, driven by ongoing efforts to diversify markets, RHB added. </p><br/><p>\n  Philippines, Thailand </p><br/><p>\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-27-26 1144ET</p></div>",

This is according to a recall notice published in the database of the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA), which the Munich-based automaker has confirmed. The affected models include the i5, 7 Series, M5, 5 Series, and i7, produced between June 9, 2022, and December 5, 2025.\n</p><p>\n\n\n\n    Globally, 337,374 vehicles are potentially affected, with 29,441 of them located in Germany, according to the KBA. The authority stated that improper routing of the cockpit wiring harness \"could, when replacing the microfilter, cause damage to the cables, leading to a short circuit with smoke development and potentially resulting in a fire.\" As a countermeasure, the routing of the cockpit wiring harness will be inspected and, if necessary, corrected.\n</p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n\n\nWhat customers need to know now</p><p>\n\n\n\n    \"No accidents have been reported in connection with this issue,\" a BMW spokesperson stated. If a vehicle has already undergone an oil service and thus a microfilter replacement, an immediate inspection and, if needed, reworking of the cables is necessary. If no oil service and therefore no microfilter replacement has yet taken place, there is no immediate need for action; reworking during the first oil service will suffice, the spokesperson said.\n</p><p>\n\n\n\n    As early as last autumn, BMW had recalled hundreds of thousands of cars because, in that instance as well, a starter problem could, in the worst case, lead to fires.\n</p><p></p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>WASHINGTON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices accelerated in January, with the cost of goods outside food and energy increasing by the most in more than 3-1/2 years as businesses passed on import tariffs and raised prices at the start of the year.</p><p>\n              The stronger-than-expected increase in the Producer Price Index reported by the Labor Department on Friday reinforced economists' expectations that the Federal Reserve would not resume cutting interest rates before June. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n              The PPI was boosted by a widening in margins, including for professional and commercial equipment wholesaling as well as apparel, footwear, and accessories retailing. Some components, including domestic airfares and healthcare, which go into the calculation of the Personal Consumption Expenditures price indexes, the inflation measures tracked by the U.S. central bank for its 2% target, increased solidly last month. </p><p>\n              Economists continued to expect that the so-called core PCE inflation, excluding the volatile food and energy components, maintained a strong pace of increase in January.</p><p>\n              \"Wider margins for producers could add some upside for consumer costs in coming months as firms pass along higher costs for services,\" said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide. \"Given still-buoyant core inflation and the recent firming of job gains, we expect the Fed to remain on pause during its upcoming March meeting.\" </p><p>\n              The PPI for final demand rose 0.5% last month after advancing by a downwardly revised 0.4% in December, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI gaining 0.3% after a previously reported 0.5% increase in December.</p><p>\n              In the 12 months through January, the PPI increased 2.9% after rising 3.0% in December. The moderation in the year-on-year producer inflation rate reflected last year's high readings dropping out of the calculation. The report was delayed by the brief shutdown of the federal government early this month. </p><p>\n              A 0.8% jump in services drove the rise in the monthly PPI, reflecting a 2.5% increase in trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers. Margins for professional and commercial equipment wholesaling surged 14.4%, indicating businesses were passing on tariffs. </p><p>\n              Prices also rose for chemicals and allied products wholesaling, bundled wired telecommunications access services, health, beauty and optical goods retailing, and food and alcohol retailing. Transportation and warehousing services prices climbed 1.0%, but the cost of services less trade, transportation, and warehousing was unchanged.</p><p><b>TARIFF-RELATED PRICE INCREASES</b></p><p>\n              \"The problem last month appeared to be tariff-related,\" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. \"If we exclude trade and transportation, other core services prices were unchanged.\" </p><p>\n              The  U.S. Supreme Court last Friday struck down President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, which he had pursued under a law meant for use in national emergencies. However,  Trump swiftly imposed a 10% global tariff for 150 days to replace some of the emergency duties, before raising the rate to 15%. </p><p>\n              U.S. stocks opened lower. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.</p><p>\n              Within services, airline fares increased 2.6% and the cost of portfolio management fees rose 1.5%. Prices for physician care soared 0.8%, but the cost of hospital outpatient care fell 0.9% while inpatient care increased 0.2%. The wholesale cost of hotel and motel rooms decreased 4.1%. These are among the components that feed into the core PCE inflation. </p><p>\n              Producer goods prices fell 0.3%, with the cost of energy declining 2.7% amid a 5.5% drop in gasoline. Wholesale food prices decreased 1.5%, pulled down by a 10.5% plunge in fresh fruits and melons. The Trump administration has rolled back some tariffs on fruit and vegetables, including bananas, to lower costs for consumers. Egg prices crashed 63.9%, but the cost of beef and veal increased 1.1%. </p><p>\n              Excluding food and energy, goods prices vaulted 0.7%, the biggest gain since May 2022, after rising 0.4% in December. Core goods prices advanced 4.2% year-on-year, the largest gain since March 2023. Economists continued to believe that core PCE inflation increased by as much as 0.5% in January, which would translate to a year-on-year advance of 3.2%.</p><p>\n              Core PCE inflation rose 0.4% in December and increased 3.0% year-on-year. The government will publish the delayed PCE inflation report for January on March 13.</p><p>\n              \"This report validates the pivot of the Fed away from labor market risks,\" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. \"Market participants who have not already marked down their expectations for Fed rate cuts this year will be busy adjusting their books today.\"</p><p>\n              (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Andrea Ricci )</p></div>",

The euro is on track for a 0.42% loss, its first down month since October.</p><p>\n              Against the Japanese yen, the dollar strengthened 0.03% to 156.16. The U.S. currency is headed for a 0.9% gain against the yen this month.</p><p>\n              The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to keep rates on hold until at least June due to concerns about still elevated inflation.</p><p>\n              But traders are pricing in 60 basis points of cuts by year-end on concerns about a weakening labor market.</p><p>\n              The dollar was boosted earlier by a safety bid on concerns about a conflict between the U.S. and Iran.</p><p>\n              The two countries made progress in talks over Tehran's nuclear program on Thursday, mediator Oman said, but hours of negotiation ended with no sign of a breakthrough that could avert potential U.S. strikes amid a massive military buildup.</p><p>\n              Oil prices rose about 3% on Friday as traders remained on alert for potential supply disruptions if relations worsen. </p><p>\n              Overall market moves this week have been muted as traders gauge the geopolitical uncertainty along with the impact of new tariffs, after the U.S. Supreme Court last week struck down U.S. President Donald Trump's emergency tariffs.</p><p>\n              \"The dollar has been trading in a little bit of a holding pattern. It feels like it's waiting for its next real catalyst,\" said City Index market strategist Fiona Cincotta.</p><p>\n              The yuan took a breather from a 10-day rally after the People's Bank of China moved to slow the pace of the rise. It said it would scrap the foreign exchange risk reserves for some forward contracts - seen as a way to encourage dollar buying.</p><p>\n              Sterling fell 0.22% to $1.3451, and was set to snap three straight months of gains with a 1.75% fall in February.</p><p>\n              A local election in Manchester on Thursday delivered a big victory to the Green Party and a blow to Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour, whose popularity has slid sharply in the past year. </p><p>\n              Sterling is sensitive to domestic politics, but with risk events ahead, such as next week's budget update from finance minister Rachel Reeves, any volatility was contained.</p><p>\n              In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin fell 2.30% to $65,924.</p><p></p><p>(Reporting by Karen Brettell; Additional reporting by Amanda Cooper and Rae Wee; Editing by Rod Nickel)</p><p>\n            By Karen Brettell</p></div>",
