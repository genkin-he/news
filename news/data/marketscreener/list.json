The ACC alleges that Siddiq used her close family ties to former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to influence the allocation of government land to a private company.</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              Siddiq, who is Hasina's niece, has repeatedly denied the allegations, describing earlier verdicts against her as \"flawed and farcical\".

She fled to neighbouring India that August at the height of the protests and has remained there since. She was later sentenced to death by a Bangladeshi court over her government's violent crackdown on demonstrators.</p><p>\n              Following Hasina's removal, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus led an interim administration that oversaw an election on February 12, after which a new government took office under Prime Minister Tarique Rahman, the son of Hasina's arch-rival and former premier Khaleda Zia.</p><p></p><p> (Reporting by Ruma Paul; Editing by Alex Richardson)</p></div>",
