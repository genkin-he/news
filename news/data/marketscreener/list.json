Ermotti will remain Group CEO until at least early 2027,\" a UBS spokesperson said when asked by Reuters about the NZZ report, adding that it was \"premature to speculate about the timing of Sergio stepping down\". </p><p>\n              \"When the time comes to decide on a successor, the Board will be able to draw on a strong bench of internal candidates, but will of course fulfill its fiduciary duty by also evaluating external candidates,\" the spokesperson added.</p><p><b>MEASURES TO PREVENT FINANCIAL CRISES</b></p><p>\n              In June, the Swiss government proposed measures aimed at preventing future banking crises following the 2023 collapse of Credit Suisse. The plans could require UBS to hold up to $24 billion in additional capital.</p><p>\n              Other proposals include that UBS can no longer count software and deferred tax assets towards its Common Equity Tier 1 capital, whiles its foreign units must be fully backed with CET1 capital.</p><p>\n              UBS has rejected the proposals, arguing they would make Switzerland less competitive.</p><p>\n              NZZ said the bank was looking at different potential outcomes of that discussion, and that it might determine whether the bank remains based in Switzerland or moves its headquarters abroad.</p><p>\n              \"We will do everything we can to ensure that UBS can continue to operate successfully as a global bank from Switzerland. Nevertheless, the Board of Directors is obliged to prepare for all scenarios,\" the spokesperson said.    </p><p></p><p> (Reporting by Francois Murphy, Editing by Louise Heavens)</p></div>",

Even so, and I do not make this statement lightly, the Iranian regime seeks to kill,\" Trump said in a video shared on Truth Social.</p><p>\n              \"The lives of courageous American heroes may be lost and we may have casualties that often happens in war, but we're doing this, not for now.

The first was in June when Washington carried out a series of attacks on Iranian nuclear sites.</p><p>\n              Saturday's strikes, unlike the first, are expected to be carried out over several days, a U.S. official told Reuters.</p><p>\n              Tehran is preparing for retaliation, with the response set to be crushing, an Iranian official told Reuters.</p><p>\n              The Israeli military said that Tehran had launched missiles towards Israel in response.</p><p>\n              In his message, Trump told the members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, Iran's armed forces, to lay down their weapons, promising that they would be granted immunity. </p><p>\n              The other option, according to Trump, is \"certain death.\" </p><p>\n              Washington and Tehran held a series of talks in recent weeks about Iran's nuclear ambitions.

Trump later encouraged the protesters to continue protesting, saying that help was on the way.</p><p>\n              Trump mentioned the killing of protesters during his statement on the strikes, telling Iranians to take cover because bombs will drop \"everywhere.\"</p><p>\n              \"When we are finished, take over your government.
