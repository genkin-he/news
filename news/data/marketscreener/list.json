SKT is also taking part in the program as a model developer to provide foundation models for enterprises, industries and researchers working on AI agent and application development.</p><p>SK Telecom Advances Physical AI and Robotics With NVIDIA Omniverse: NVIDIA Cloud Provider SKT plans to build an industrial AI cloud with NVIDIA RTX PRO? 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs in Asia, empowering the nation?s manufacturing leaders to advance physical AI and robotics development. The initial deployment will include over 2,000 NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs, and will run NVIDIA Omniverse workloads to support SK hynix?s semiconductor manufacturing, fab digital twins and internal AI agents.</p><p>SK Hynix Boosts Productivity Through AI Physics, Digital Twins, Robotics and AI Agents: SK hynix is using the accelerated cloud infrastructure from SKT to scale its operations. SK hynix is tapping NVIDIA CUDA-X technologies, including through the NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework, to accelerate chip design with AI physics. This accelerates technology computer-aided design simulations, enabling SK hynix to deliver next-generation semiconductor products faster and with greater precision.</p><p>SK hynix is also testing opportunities to accelerate its current use of Synopsys software with NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs for technology computer-aided design and circuit simulation. To boost efficiency, SK hynix is building autonomous fab digital twins using NVIDIA Omniverse libraries and NVIDIA RTX PRO Servers with NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs. These digital twins enable real-time simulation, monitoring and optimization of fab operations, resulting in faster production ramp-up, improved operational agility and progress toward fully self-optimizing manufacturing facilities.</p><p>SKT is developing a foundation model called A.X. that will power SK hynix?s AI agents, built with NVIDIA NIM microservices and the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform. These agents will help more than 40,000 employees, production staff and office workers collaborate and solve problems faster, accelerating productivity across chip development and fabrication.</p></div>",
