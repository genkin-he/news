Fairview International tied these gains to higher average fees across its two schools in Malaysia. </p><p></p><p>\"Alongside these fee increases, our continued focus on management of its operating and administrative cost base are improving margins,\" said the company. </p><p></p><p>A key performance metric for the firm is headcount. At September 30, this figure stood at 277, up 4.9% from 693 a year prior. Fairview said it has invested further in marketing and recruitment, with it anticipating further gains as the year continues. </p><p></p><p>\"Coupled with sustained fee growth, this positions Fairview for ongoing expansion,\" said Chair Daniel Chian. </p><p></p><p>Fairview International said it continues to assess acquisition opportunities to expand the business, looking at both \"acquisitions and new builds applying the criteria of economic growth, demand for quality education and sustainability in their assessments.\"</p><p></p><p>Shares in the company closed flat at 10.50 pence on Thursday in London.</p><p></p><p>\"It is a pleasure to present Fairview's maiden annual report since our IPO in October 2024.  As we anticipated at the time, it has been a year of great progress, both operationally and academically. Both of our schools are able to increase student numbers without the need for further capex or facilities and our focus on marketing and recruitment is bearing fruit with enrolments comfortably ahead of the comparative period last year,\" said Chair Chian. </p><p></p><p>\"Demand for high quality independent education continues to rise, the International Baccalaureate curriculum grows in popularity and Malaysia's policy of expanding expatriate student numbers should all contribute to Fairview's further development.\"</p><p></p><p>By Christopher Ward, Alliance News reporter</p><p></p><p>Comments and questions to newsroom@alliancenews.com</p><p></p><p>Copyright 2025 Alliance News Ltd.

Against this backdrop, the search for companies that combine high returns on equity, strong net margins, and robust profitability scores has intensified.</p><p>\nUsing our Stock Screener, we identified firms in Saudi Arabia and the UAE with a return on equity above 15%, net margins exceeding 10%, and profitability and quality metrics in the upper range of our universe. Three regional heavyweights stood out — Aramco, Al Rajhi Banking and Investment Corporation, and ADNOC Gas — each exemplifying how scale, efficiency, and strategic focus can align to deliver enduring returns.</p><!-- Article --><p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-zoomable=\"true\" height=\"332\" src=\"//img.zonebourse.com/stock/screen_aramc_alraj_adnoc.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"800\"/></p><h2>\nAramco: Scale meets scrutiny</h2><p>\nSector: Energy</p><p>\nAramco, the world’s largest integrated oil and gas company, remains the cornerstone of the Saudi market with a market capitalization of $1.672 trillion. Despite a volatile year for oil prices, the company posted net income of 393,891 million for 2024, achieving a 26.3% return on equity and a 21.9% net margin — both in the upper decile of our universe.</p><p>\nIn Q2 2025, net income reached 85,632 million, 4.8% below consensus, while EPS of 0.35 came in 6.6% short of expectations, underscoring margin pressure amid continued energy price swings.</p><p>\nValuation remains closely watched: Aramco trades at a 2024 P/E of 17.2x and a price-to-book ratio of 4.65x, both slightly below five-year averages. The free cash flow yield is 4.7%, while the dividend yield has risen to 6.3% for 2024, supported by a 109% distribution rate.</p><p>\nOur MarketScreener Investor Rating stands at 4★, indicating strong fundamentals, while the analyst consensus remains OUTPERFORM, with an average target price 11% above the last close. Recent moves — including acquiring a minority stake in AI firm Humain and increasing ownership in Petro Rabigh to 60% — signal a push toward diversification and digital expansion. Yet, Aramco continues to face scrutiny over its exposure to oil cycles and policy direction within the Kingdom.</p><p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-zoomable=\"true\" height=\"400\" src=\"//img.zonebourse.com/stock/aramco_20251030170254.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"600\"/></p><h2>\nAl Rajhi Bank: Consistency as a core asset</h2><p>\nSector: Financials</p><p>\nAl Rajhi Banking and Investment Corporation, Saudi Arabia’s largest Islamic bank, commands a market capitalization of $117 billion and delivers a return on equity of 17.2% alongside a net margin of 61.5% — both in the top decile of our universe. Net income and EPS growth also rank highly, underscoring operational strength. Over the past year, shares have gained 19.7%, including an 11.7% rise year-to-date.</p><p>\nValuation metrics are neutral, with a mid-range P/E ratio and a lower-tier price-to-book ratio. Dividend yield is moderate, but capital efficiency remains robust. Analyst sentiment has improved notably, with both target price divergence and recommendation trends in the upper range.</p><p>\nRevisions to revenue and EPS forecasts point upward, reinforcing confidence in the bank’s earnings outlook. While recent quarters have brought no major earnings surprises, Al Rajhi’s steady profitability, efficiency, and margin strength secure its place as a cornerstone for investors seeking stability in the Gulf’s financial landscape.</p><p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-zoomable=\"true\" height=\"400\" src=\"//img.zonebourse.com/stock/alrajhibankingandi_20251030170228.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"600\"/></p><h2>\nADNOC Gas: Efficiency with endurance</h2><p>\nSector: Energy</p><p>\nWith a market capitalization of $74.36 billion, ADNOC Gas anchors the UAE’s gas sector as an integrated processing powerhouse. The company reports a return on equity of 21.6% and a net margin of 20.5%, both in the upper range of our universe. Its share price has advanced 6.3% over the past year, maintaining a steady upward path despite global market turbulence.</p><p>\nProfitability remains exceptional — EBITDA, EBIT, and net margins all sit in the upper decile, while capital efficiency and return on assets also rank highly. The company holds a 5★ Investor Rating, the highest in our selection, and a matching Trader Rating.</p><p>\nAlthough its revenue growth decile is lower, EPS growth ranks near the top, pointing to strong cost control and expanding margins. ADNOC Gas’s dual role as a supplier of LNG and industrial gases to both domestic and export markets offers resilience, while its integrated model ensures consistent operational performance and long-term visibility.</p><p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-zoomable=\"true\" height=\"400\" src=\"//img.zonebourse.com/stock/adnocgasplc_20251030170308.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"600\"/></p><h2>\nThree paths to resilience</h2><p>\nTogether, Aramco, Al Rajhi, and ADNOC Gas illustrate three distinct paths to quality in the Gulf. Aramco delivers scale and yield but must manage cyclical pressures and policy risks. Al Rajhi exemplifies dependable growth through disciplined financial management. ADNOC Gas stands out for its efficiency and stability, supported by its strategic position in the regional energy value chain.</p><p>\nEach company reflects the high-ROE, high-margin profile our screening process targets — a compelling combination of resilience, profitability, and strategic focus in a region redefining what sustainable growth looks like.</p></div>",

The region returned to year-on-year growth against soft prior-year comparatives, further supported by a strong relative performance in Turkey, which continues to benefit from faster-growing end-markets, the implementation of pricing initiatives and local currency devaluation.
