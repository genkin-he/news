Analysts had expected 287.50 billion won for the quarter, according to a FactSet-compiled consensus. </p><p>\n\n  Revenue fell 1.4% to 21.874 trillion won, and operating profit dropped 8.4% to 688.90 billion won, in line with the company's preliminary estimates. </p><p>\n\n  Growth at the company's home-appliance and auto-parts segments stayed resilient despite challenges from higher tariffs and soft demand in major global markets, with revenue rising 4.7% and 1.4%, respectively. </p><p>\n\n  The sluggishness in its media and entertainment segment, which includes televisions, continued, with revenue slumping 9.5%. Costs associated with marketing and early retirement programs for employees in the segment weighed on operating profit. </p><p>\n\n  Shares of LG Electronics were flat after the results. The stock has underperformed the broader market this year, gaining by around 5% compared with the benchmark Kospi's roughly 70% gain. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Kwanwoo Jun at kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-31-25 0147ET</p></div>",
