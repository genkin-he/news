It also removed its Chinese CEO, citing concerns that its technology could be appropriated by Wingtech.</p><p>\n              Nexperia's move came after the Dutch chipmaker's Chinese unit resumed supplying semiconductors to local customers but stipulated that all sales to distributors would need to be settled using the Chinese yuan. Previously, transactions had been settled with foreign currencies like the U.S. dollar.</p><p>\n              The company produces large volumes of chips in the Netherlands that are widely used in the automotive and consumer electronics industries.

Nexperia is developing alternative solutions to ensure (that) supply (is) continuing to our customers.\"</p><p>\n              Nexperia added that the decision did not reflect an intention to withdraw from its site in Dongguan or from the Chinese market as a whole, adding that it remained committed to finding a resolution to the problem. </p><p>\n              Nexperia said it is financially independent of Wingtech and it does not raise capital from Wingtech, the letter showed.</p><p>\n              Nexperia confirmed that it sent the letter but said it could not comment further. Nexperia China and Wingtech did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>\n              Court filings showed that the seizure by the Dutch government came as U.S. pressure was rising on Nexperia after Wingtech was placed on a restricted-export list, though Dutch authorities say governance shortcomings were the trigger. </p><p>\n              On October 4, China's commerce ministry blocked Nexperia from exporting chips from China.</p><p>\n              Industry bodies have sounded the alarm over the possible impact on production, with Stellantis  saying on Thursday that it had set up a \"war room\" to monitor the situation. </p><p>\n              Japanese automaker Nissan said it had enough chips at the moment to last until the first week of November without disruption. </p><p>\n              Some Nexperia products that used to cost just a few Chinese cents have gone up in price to two or three yuan each over the past two weeks, more than 10 times their original cost, according to a source familiar with the matter. </p><p>\n               (Reporting by Che Pan in Beijing and Wen-Yee Lee in Taipei; Writing by Brenda Goh; Editing by Jacqueline Wong and Thomas Derpinghaus)</p><p>\n            By Che  Pan and Wen-Yee Lee</p></div>",

The company predict that core operating income for fiscal 2025 will decrease 5.7% compared to the previous forecast to ¥250.0 billion.</p><p>Core operating income is expected to fall behind the initial forecast due mainly to a reduction in price gap and a decline in sales volume reflecting lower market prices in the MMA &amp; Derivatives segment and the Basic Materials &amp; Polymers segment, despite robust demand expected for various products in the Specialty Materials segment. Operating income, net income, and net income attributable to owners of the parent are anticipated to fall behind the initial forecast due to losses under special items, which are expected to be recorded in the second half of fiscal 2025 in tandem with structure reforms, on top of a decline in core operating income.</p></div>",
