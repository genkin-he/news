The company has been appointed as the technology provider and awarded 15-year operations and maintenance contracts for Mumbai's upcoming 2,000 million liters per day Bhandup and 910 million liters per day Panjrapur Water Treatment Plants. Developed by Welspun Enterprises Ltd, both facilities are scheduled to be fully operational by 2030 and are expected to meet over 60% of the city's water requirements.</p><p>Equipped with Veolia's advanced technologies, the plants will deliver high-quality, reliable water while optimizing footprint, reducing energy consumption, and enhancing operational efficiency--making them ideally suited to dense urban environments. To win these contracts, Veolia drew on 25 years of experience in India, and in particular its most significant achievement to date; the operation of the innovative Nagpur water supply project, which includes five water treatment plants with a total capacity of approximately 786 million liters per day. Thanks to digital innovations such as Hubgrade®?, Veolia was able to improve the performance of the water distribution system in the city, reducing Non-Revenue Water (NRW) from around 70% to below 30%, while delivering continuous, pressurised water to over 3.5 million residents.</p><!-- Article --><p>The company also maintains a strong operational presence in Delhi through Nangloi Water Services providing water to nearly 1 million inhabitants in the Nangloi area and across multiple cities in Karnataka, delivering integrated municipal water solutions at scale. Beyond Municipal Water, Expanding Tailored Solutions in Waste and Energy In India, Veolia plays a key role in hazardous waste treatment, one of the boosters of its strategic GreenUp program. The company operates strategic infrastructure across India's industrial hubs, including Gujarat's first Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) facility in Ankleshwar, a landmark project enabling responsible wastewater management for industrial clusters.</p><p>Veolia is developing a landfill facility in Magnad, set to become India's largest industrial hazardous waste landfill, with a capacity of 15 million metric tons and an operational lifespan of 30 years. The company is working with nearby local communities to produce green fuel for on-site use, reducing the carbon footprint of hazardous waste treatment. Veolia is also advancing expansion plans across Maharashtra, including projects near Mumbai, to further strengthen regional hazardous waste management capabilities in alignment with the evolving needs of local industries.</p><p>pioneering industrial decarbonisation, Veolia operates India's first 5-tonnes-per-day (TPD) carbon capture plant for Tata Steel in Jamshedpur, capturing CO2 directly from blast furnace gas for reuse and positioning the company at the forefront of the nation's net-zero ambitions.</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>MUMBAI, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Fears that new artificial intelligence tools could replace large IT services firms are \"overblown\" as clients still need help deploying and scaling the technology, Babak Hodjat, chief AI officer at Cognizant, told Reuters in an interview. </p><p>\n              Automated AI tools from startups such as Anthropic have stirred concerns about disruption in the business models of software and services firms globally, including India's traditionally labour-intensive IT services industry.</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              Enterprises are far from being able to rely on a single, all-purpose AI agent, said Hodjat, adding that most clients still need help engineering, integrating, and governing AI systems.</p><p>\n              \"That mapping is our job, it does not come just automatically out of the box,\" said Hodjat, whose work helped power Apple's Siri voice assistant.</p><p>\n              Nasdaq-listed Cognizant, which has more than 70% of its workforce operating out of India, forecast annual revenue above Wall Street estimates on the back of strong demand as businesses adopt AI into their workflows.</p><p>\n              Rivals Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro  have also maintained that rapid AI adoption will boost, rather than shrink, demand for software service providers.</p><p>\n              Hodjat's vote of confidence in the role of services companies comes despite AI-related job cuts already underway.</p><p>\n              Shipping and logistics management software company WiseTech Global said it would lay off nearly a third of its workforce as it integrates AI into its customer software and internal operations. TCS announced 12,000 job cuts last year, but has since denied to local media that the layoffs were AI-related.</p><p>\n              Cognizant, which generates about 30% of its code through AI and aims to reach 50%, is not worried about automation eliminating entry-level jobs. CEO Ravi Kumar S said during the company's earnings call earlier this month that it hired 25,000 fresh graduates in 2025, and expects to exceed that in 2026.</p><p>\n              Almost all of Cognizant's clients have already tried to work with AI agents, Hodjat said, but have acknowledged that they need us to deploy it within their systems for returns. </p><p></p><p> (Reporting by Haripriya Suresh in Mumbai; Editing by Janane Venkatraman)</p><p>\n            By Haripriya Suresh</p></div>",
