The increase was in line with economists' expectations. Construction spending slipped 0.4% year-on-year in December. The data was delayed by last year's government shutdown. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n              Spending on private construction projects rose 0.5% in December after easing 0.2% in November. Investment in residential construction increased 1.5% after being unchanged in November. Spending on new single-family housing projects rebounded 1.5%. Spending on multi-family housing units, which account for a small share of the housing market, rose 0.1%.</p><p>\n              Renovations increased further. Despite December's acceleration, homebuilding remained sluggish amid higher mortgage rates, more expensive building materials because of tariffs on imports, and labor shortages.</p><p>\n              A decline in mortgage rates in recent weeks could spur construction, though building lots remain scarce. Residential investment has declined for four straight quarters.</p><p>\n              Spending on private nonresidential structures like offices and factories dropped 0.7% in December. Spending on nonresidential structures has contracted for eight consecutive quarters, despite a surge in the construction of data centers to support artificial intelligence. </p><p>\n              Investment in public construction projects decreased 0.5% after falling 0.2% in November.

Amazon will also invest $50 billion in OpenAI, starting with an initial $15 billion investment and followed by another $35 billion in the coming months when certain conditions are met. Partnering to bring new advanced AI capabilities to enterprises worldwide.</p><p>OpenAI and Amazon are jointly developing a Stateful runtime Environment powered by OpenAI's models, which will be available through Amazon Bedrock. Stateful developer environments are the next generation of how frontier models will be used, seamlessly enabling models to access elements like compute, memory, and identity. A Stateful runtime Environment allows developers to keep context, remember prior work, work across software tools and data sources, and access compute.</p><!-- Article --><p>They're designed to handle ongoing projects and workflows. These stateful developer environments will be trained to run optimally on AWS's infrastructure and integrated with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore and infrastructure services so customers' AI applications and agents run seamlessly with the rest of their infrastructure applications running in AWS. OpenAI and AWS are expanding their existing $38 billion multi-year agreement by $100 billion over 8 years.</p><p>The expansion includes OpenAI committing to consume approximately 2 gigawatts of Trainium capacity through AWS infrastructure, which will support demand for Stateful runtime, Frontier, and other advanced workloads. This agreement lowers the cost and improves the efficiency of producing intelligence at scale. Under this structure, OpenAI secures long-term capacity while working with AWS to deploy purpose-built silicon alongside its broader compute ecosystem, enabling enterprises to consume intelligence on demand without managing underlying infrastructure.</p><p>This commitment spans both Trainium3 and next-generation Trainium4 chips and will power a broad range of advanced AI workloads. Trainium4, expected to begin delivery in 2027, will provide another major performance gain, including significantly higher FP4 compute performance, expanded memory bandwidth, and increased high-bandwidth memory capacity to support increasingly capable AI systems at scale. OpenAI and Amazon will collaborate to develop customized models available to Amazon developers to power Amazon's customer-facing applications.</p><p>Amazon teams will be able to tailor OpenAI models for use across AI products and agents that serve customers directly. These capabilities will complement the models already available to Amazon developers, including Amazon's Nova family, offering another tool for teams to build and deliver at scale.</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Emese Bartha </p><br/><p>\n  Japanese policymakers will need to strike a delicate balance as they seek to stabilize the yen and keep debt services costs on Japan's significant debt manageable, Eva Sun-Wai, fund manager at M&amp;G Investments said. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  Japan's government plans aggressive fiscal stimulus to protect the country's fragile domestic growth. At the same time, the central bank will likely need to raise interest rates to fight persistent inflation. </p><p>\n\n  They will need to do this without increasing the national debt, which is estimated between 235% and 250% of GDP. </p><p>\n\n  \"Japan has always had quite a difficult combination of needing to keep interest rates low so that they don't massively increase their debt servicing costs but not keeping rates so low that the currency deteriorates meaningfully,\" she said. </p><p>\n\n  This balancing act was recently tested when long-dated Japanese government bond yields surged to record highs ahead of the Lower House election on Feb. 8 due to investor concerns over potentially unsustainable fiscal stimulus. </p><p>\n\n  Yields have since retreated. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's landslide victory ensured political stability. It reinforced her mandate to pursue expansive fiscal policies, but Takaichi has repeatedly stressed that her government will act fiscally responsibly. </p><p>\n\n  The Japanese yen has also recovered after falling to an 18-month low of 159.45 yen per U.S. dollar in mid-January, LSEG data show. The dollar last traded at 155.96 yen. </p><p>\n\n  One of the main risks Sun-Wai sees is of potential for large-scale repatriation of offshore assets--including U.S. Treasurys--back into Japanese government bonds as the Bank of Japan increases interest rates from their current low level of 0.75% and yields rise. </p><p>\n\n  Such a move could be disruptive, potentially causing big selling in U.S. Treasurys, especially as the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates further, she says. However, she considers this a low risk. </p><p>\n\n  \"I don't see the repatriation flow argument as rapid a risk as people say,\" she said. \"I still see it a risk, but I don't think it would happen quickly.\" </p><p>\n\n  A weak yen and negative real yields are among the factors that would discourage rapid asset repatriation, she said. </p><p>\n\n  Most Japanese investors are structural, long?term holders of offshore government bonds for liability-management reasons. These positions aren't leveraged, so there is no risk of rapid margin-call dynamics, she said. </p><p>\n\n  External factors which could prompt big selling in U.S. Treasurys and the dollar do pose a risk, however. </p><p>\n\n  These could include the Fed cutting rates more aggressively than expected by markets, U.S. policy uncertainty and Fed independence risks. Still, Fed independence concerns have receded with former Fed governor Kevin Warsh's nomination to Fed Chair, she said. </p><p>\n\n  Given entrenched inflation in Japan, the BOJ \"will likely need to embark on some sort of rate hike cycle, even if it's very slow and steady,\" she said. </p><p>\n\n  \"Even if it means that it's just to give them room in the next downturn so that they can cut [rates] and stimulate the economy.\" </p><p>\n\n  BOJ rate hikes will likely result in a 'bear flattening' of the Japanese bond yield curve, Sun-Wai said. This is where short-term rates rise faster than long-term rates, usually due to expectations of central bank interest-rate hikes. U.S. Treasurys show the opposite trend, with the yield curve steepening. </p><p>\n\n  Japan is now shifting from a trend over the last few decades, when it favoured bolster economic growth via a weaker yen which in turn bolstered exports, Sun-Wai said. </p><p>\n\n  M&amp;G Investments had 365 billion pounds ($491.63 billion) in assets under management as at Sept. 30, 2025. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Emese Bartha at emese.bartha@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-27-26 1009ET</p></div>",
