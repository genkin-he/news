Construction is set to begin later this year on land created through a reclamation project. </p><p>\n\n  Hyundai said 5.8 trillion won--more than 60% of the total investment--will be used to build an AI data center to support autonomous-vehicle development. </p><p>\n\n  The investment will also fund robot-component, hydrogen-production and solar-power plants within the cluster. </p><p>\n\n  KB Securities analysts Kang Seong-jin and Kim Ji-yun said Hyundai Motor is \"shifting from a traditional value stock to a growth stock powered by physical AI,\" with the transition accelerating from this year.

The group's workforce will be reduced from over 10,000 employees to just under 6,000, according to a letter to shareholders from co-founder and chief executive Jack Dorsey. <br/><br/>Management said that the restructuring is aimed at ushering in a new phase of long-term growth, with leaner teams and greater use of artificial intelligence to automate certain tasks. Chief financial officer Amrita Ahuja pointed to a shift in how the company operates as the business accelerates. The job cuts are expected to result in charges of between $450m and $500m, mainly recorded in Q1. <br/><br/>The announcement comes alongside quarterly results in line with expectations, with adjusted EPS of 65 cents on revenue of $6.25bn. Gross profit rose 24% y-o-y to $2.87bn. For the full year, Block forecast adjusted EPS of $3.66, above the $3.22 expected by the market.</p></div>",

Discovery's (WBD) studios and streaming operations, after the company's board judged a revised offer from Paramount Skydance to be superior. Paramount raised its proposal to $31 per share, all cash, for the entire group, compared with Netflix's $27.75-per-share targeted bid. <br/><br/>The new offer covers all of WBD, including its pay-TV channels such as CNN, TBS and TNT, and includes a $7bn break-up fee in the event of a regulatory block. Paramount has also committed to settle the $2.8bn owed by WBD to Netflix if their initial agreement were to collapse. Netflix had four business days to match the bid, but ultimately walked away, saying the required price would no longer make the deal financially attractive. <br/><br/>In after-hours trading, Netflix shares rose by nearly 10%, while WBD fell about 2%. Netflix executives said the negotiated deal would have created value with a clear path to regulatory approval, while stressing they had shown financial discipline. They thanked WBD management for what they described as a fair process, reiterating that the transaction was a strategic opportunity-not a necessity at any price.</p></div>",
