And so that's how we're thinking about really balancing the focus of the plant,\" Norman said. </p><p>\n              He added that Lyten expects to hire more than 600 employees in the coming months.  </p><p>\n              Truckmaker Scania, a former Northvolt customer and close partner, said it was still too early to say whether it would place orders with Lyten. </p><p>\n              Lyten also said it had sold a data-centre site in Skelleftea to EdgeConneX, a portfolio company of EQT.</p><p>\n              Completion of the deal was delayed from the original mid-October timeline.
