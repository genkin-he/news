The mission deployed DART AE, a scramjet-powered aircraft developed by Australian aerospace engineering firm Hypersonix, into a suborbital hypersonic flight environment at several times the speed of sound.</p><p>With 100% mission success across all HASTE launches, Rocket Lab is helping to shape a new era of hypersonic systems testing with speed and precision, lower costs, and a modern test platform that serves the Department of War's critical technology priorities. In under two years since its inaugural launch, HASTE has rapidly established itself as a premier commercial test platform for hypersonic systems. By combining Rocket Lab's unmatched operational speed and cadence with the versatility to support diverse mission profiles within a single test platform, HASTE is driving significant advancements in hypersonic innovation and technology readiness for the nation.</p></div>",
