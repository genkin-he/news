            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>BRUSSELS, Feb 26 (Reuters) - The EU has demanded that the United States stick to the terms of a trade deal they agreed last year after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump's global tariffs and he responded with a new, across-the-board \"import surcharge\".</p><p><b>WHAT ARE THE TERMS OF THE 'TURNBERRY DEAL'?</b></p><!-- Article --><p>\n              Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen concluded a deal at Trump's Turnberry golf course in Scotland last July.</p><p>\n              It set a broad 15% U.S. tariff for most EU exports or, for a very small range of products, the pre-existing most-favoured nation (MFN) duty rate if that is higher than 15%. Steel and aluminium tariffs remained at 50%, while no extra tariffs applied for a limited number of EU goods, including unavailable natural resources such as cork, aircraft and aircraft parts and generic pharmaceuticals and their ingredients.</p><p>\n              Washington also agreed to reduce its tariff for EU car imports to 15% from a previous 25%.</p><p>\n              The European Union committed to remove its import duties on all U.S. industrial goods and to provide preferential market access for a wide range of U.S. seafood and agricultural goods, as well as to extend zero tariffs for U.S. lobsters, as initially agreed with Trump in 2020.</p><p><b>WHAT DOES THE 'IMPORT SURCHARGE' MEAN FOR THE EU?</b></p><p>\n              The Supreme Court ruled that Trump had exceeded his authority in using the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which was the legal basis for the broad 15% tariff on EU products.</p><p>\n              So those tariffs have been superseded by Trump's new \"import surcharge\", which the U.S. began collecting at a 10% rate on Tuesday. The Trump administration is working to increase the rate to 15%, the level that had generally applied to EU exports.</p><p>\n              However, unlike the tariff terms of the EU-U.S. trade deal, the surcharge applies in addition to the MFN rate.</p><p>\n              The surcharge does not affect the tariffs on cars or steel and does not apply to critical minerals, pharmaceuticals, some electronic products, beef, tomatoes and oranges and any products subject to 'Section 232' tariffs imposed on grounds of national security.</p><p>\n              The EU has acknowledged it faces a \"transition period\" of a few months during which U.S. tariffs will be higher for certain EU exports.</p><p><b>WHICH EU PRODUCTS FACE HIGHER TARIFFS?</b></p><p>\n              Given the average U.S. MFN duty is 3.4%, overall tariffs (MFN+10%) for many EU products under the new system will be lower than 15%, particularly for industrial goods. It does become problematic if and when the surcharge rate rises to 15%.</p><p>\n              Some EU exports, though, face higher tariffs than before. The European Commission says 7% of EU exports to the U.S. are subject to an MFN duty above 5%. EU goods exports to the U.S. totalled 536 billion euros ($631.9 billion) in 2024.</p><p>\n              Products affected include textiles, clothing and shoes, with rates on footwear up to 48%, and consumer goods, including suitcases and handbags, glassware, pillows and cushions and some light fittings.</p><p>\n              Of agricultural and food goods, MFN rates above 5% apply for many dairy products, with Edam and Parmesan cheeses at 10% and Roquefort at 8%, as well as for certain fruit and vegetables, including melons, strawberries, Brussels sprouts and carrots.</p><p>\n              ($1 = 0.8482 euros)</p><p></p><p> (Reporting by Philip BlenkinsopEditing by Gareth Jones)</p><p>\n            By Philip Blenkinsop</p></div>",

Just two months after the Moveworks acquisition close, the company also introduced ServiceNow EmployeeWorks, which combines Moveworks' conversational AI and enterprise search with ServiceNow?s unified portal and autonomous workflows to turn natural language requests into governed, end-to-end execution for nearly 200 million employees.</p><p>As enterprises evaluate AI platforms, two competing paradigms have emerged: feature-function AI bolted onto disconnected SaaS apps, and unified platforms that execute work through proven enterprise workflows with AI built in. The difference is fundamental: the feature approach requires enterprises to maintain, integrate, and manage the complexity themselves. ServiceNow eliminates the complexity by unifying conversational AI, workflows, enterprise data, security, and governance on a platform purpose-built for mission-critical operations.</p><!-- Article --><p>ServiceNow?s Autonomous Workforce deploys AI specialists with defined roles to augment teams. Unlike AI agents that complete individual tasks, the ServiceNow Autonomous Workforce orchestrates teams of AI specialists with roles such as a Level 1 Service Desk AI Specialist, Employee Service Agent, or Security Operations Analyst to execute work from start to finish. They work alongside humans, follow established processes and policies set by the organization, learn from outcomes and employee feedback, and importantly, improve over time. ServiceNow is introducing the first AI specialist available out-of-the-box for customers, a Level 1 Service Desk AI Specialist.</p><p>This AI specialist autonomously diagnoses and resolves common IT support requests end-to-end ? password resets, software access provisioning, network troubleshooting ? using enterprise knowledge bases, historical incident data, and proactive remediation workflows.</p><p>It is designed to operate 24/7 with assignments aligned to specific skillsets and deliverables and escalate issues when human intervention is needed. At ServiceNow, Autonomous Workforce is handling 90%+ of employee IT requests. Early results show newest AI specialist, the L1 Service Desk AI Specialist, is already resolving assigned IT cases autonomously, and it's 99% faster than when these cases are handled by human agents.</p><p>AI models without workflows are probabilistic ? they see patterns, form ideas, and give different answers for the same questions. The enterprise, however, needs deterministic outcomes ?</p><p>governance, security, auditability, and operations that don't hallucinate. Because ServiceNow combines probabilistic intelligence with deterministic workflow orchestration, AI specialists can interpret a request, decide the right action using business context, and execute autonomously across systems with governance built in through the ServiceNow AI Control Tower. Every action is traceable and governed by policies embedded in the workflow layer itself.</p><p>ServiceNow is bringing the power of Moveworks to the ServiceNow AI Platform and delivering immediate value to customers with ServiceNow EmployeeWorks, a conversational front door for the enterprise. Available where employees already work and collaborate ? whether in Teams, Slack, or on any browser ?</p><p>ServiceNow EmployeeWorks connects Moveworks? conversational AI chat and deep enterprise search with ServiceNow?s unified portal and autonomous workflows, turning intent into coordinated action across systems. The platform understands organizational structure, approvals, and authorization ? executing tasks that require multi-system coordination while maintaining governance and audit trails.</p><p>Availability: ServiceNow EmployeeWorks is generally available to customers. The first AI specialist for Autonomous Workforce, a Level 1 Service Desk AI Specialist, is in controlled availability and expected to be generally available second quarter of 2026; Moveworks continues to be offered as a standalone product within the ServiceNow portfolio. Organizations can acquire the Moveworks platform as an independent AI solution or as an integrated component of their ServiceNow deployment, ensuring flexibility in enterprise-wide implementation.</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>Ericsson announced a successful live proof of concept of its ISAC (Integrated Sensing and Communication) technology at the company's U.S. Headquarters in Plano, Texas, signaling a major step forward in the evolution of networks that both connect and sense the world around them. The live proof of concept centered on drone detection using Ericsson's massive-MIMO radios, showcasing the network's ability to track unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) within surrounding airspace. This proof of concept demonstrates that the US is a global leader in ISAC technology which enhances national security, optimizes spectrum use, and drives economic growth.</p><p>ISAC is an innovative technology that enables use cases across commercial, public safety and defense scenarios, enabling faster adoption of new emerging technologies like autonomous systems and drone delivery in commercial settings. From a defense scenario, itaugments national security and provides an additional layer of safety. ISAC integrates sensing and spatial location of passive (not connected) objects into the mobile communication network - extending network functionality beyond connectivity by enabling the detection and characterization of objects and movement using existing infrastructure.</p><!-- Article --><p>The capability is progressing in 3GPP with initial studies in Release 19 and is expected to form part of early 6G standardization, showing the foundation for broad, scalable sensing applications. Safer, smarter infrastructure: Network-based sensing can support use cases by augmenting local sensors with wide-area network awareness. Efficient path to scale: ISAC is designed to reuse existing mobile network sites, spectrum, and hardware, enabling pragmatic introduction and coverage at scale.</p><p>Road to 6G: 3GPP studies have begun, with ISAC poised to become a foundational capability in the 6G era. The proof of concept underscores Ericsson's commitment to advancing 6G-era capabilities and collaborating with the broader ecosystem to validate real-world scenarios and deployment approaches across sites, spectrum, and hardware integration levels. Ericsson has invested more than $150 million in the factory and is the only manufacturer making telecom equipment at scale in the US.</p><p>The highly automated, 300,000-square-foot facility supports more than 550 US manufacturing jobs and strengthens secure, resilient domestic supply chains. As 6G technology matures, Ericsson plans to build-on this US-based manufacturing foundation to support future deployments.</p></div>",
