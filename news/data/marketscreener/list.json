            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>Universal Music Group (UMG) reported better-than-expected Q3 results on Thursday evening, with the music label notably benefiting from strong pre-orders for \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" the latest album by American pop star Taylor Swift.<br/><br/>The Netherlands-based group reported adjusted EBITDA for the past quarter up 6.9% to €664m, including an 11.6% increase at constant exchange rates, resulting in an operating margin improvement of 0.4 percentage point to 22%.<br/><br/>Its quarterly revenue rose 5.3% to €3.02bn, including growth of 10.2% at constant exchange rates, with the 4.8% decline in revenue from online streaming more than offset by strong sales of physical media, which rose 18% thanks to the success of Taylor Swift's latest album.<br/><br/>Other top-selling artists during the quarter included Japanese rock band Mrs. Green Apple, pop singer Sabrina Carpenter, and country singer Morgan Wallen.<br/><br/>In a reaction note, analysts at DZ Bank—who have a \"buy\" rating on the stock—praised the group's accelerated growth, a trend they believe will continue given the success of Taylor Swift's album and the increase in Spotify's subscription price.<br/><br/>However, the German bank believes that the stock could gain new momentum with a US listing, which would attract more investors, while judging that now is a good time to buy the stock given the recent decline in its share price, which has led to it being historically undervalued.<br/><br/>Listed on Euronext Amsterdam, UMG were up over 2.6% at noon on Friday. The stock has been largely stagnant since its split from Vivendi and its IPO four years ago.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Swedish online music giant Spotify is set to release its quarterly results next Tuesday.</p></div>",
