This year, the focus has shifted towards which central banks will lead in terms of hiking rates.\"</p><p>\n              The Australian dollar, which was steady at $0.7106 on Friday, was on track for a monthly gain of roughly 2%.</p><p>\n              Up more than 6% for the year thus far, the Antipodean currency is the best-performing G10 currency to date, as a domestic economy in rude health continues to fuel expectations for a more hawkish Reserve Bank of Australia.</p><p>\n              \"It is conceivable that the Aussie dollar can put on one or two more (U.S.) cents from here,\" said Carol Kong, a currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.</p><p>\n              \"We are still of the view that there will be just one more 25-basis-point rate hike from the RBA this year.\"</p><p>\n              Also on the hiking path is the Bank of Japan, though that has done little to help the yen as domestic politics complicates the rate outlook, even as BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda signalled openness to a near-term hike.</p><p>\n              While the yen was up 0.2% at 155.78 in Asia, it has fallen 0.4% for the week and 0.6% for the month thus far.</p><p>\n              This week, Japan's government nominated two academics seen by markets as strong advocates of economic stimulus to join the BOJ's board.
