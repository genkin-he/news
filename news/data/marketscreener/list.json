The benchmark Kospi ended 1.0% lower. </p><p>\n\n  Hyundai said it will invest about 9 trillion won, equivalent to $6.28 billion, to build an AI, robotics and hydrogen cluster in Saemangeum, a coastal area in southwestern South Korea. </p><p>\n\n  The company and a local government signed a memorandum of understanding Friday to develop the project. Construction is set to begin later this year on land created through a reclamation project. </p><p>\n\n  Hyundai said 5.8 trillion won--more than 60% of the total investment--will be used to build an AI data center to support autonomous-vehicle development. </p><p>\n\n  The investment will also fund robot-component, hydrogen-production and solar-power plants within the cluster. </p><p>\n\n  KB Securities analysts Kang Seong-jin and Kim Ji-yun said Hyundai Motor is \"shifting from a traditional value stock to a growth stock powered by physical AI,\" with the transition accelerating from this year.
