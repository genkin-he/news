Annual adjusted EPS is expected in the range of $17.60 and $17.85, higher than its previous forecast of $17 and $17.25. </p><p>\n              Revenue at S&amp;P's ratings business jumped 12% to $1.24 billion in the three months ended September 30 from a year earlier. </p><p>\n              Analysts expect the strong bond issuance momentum to carry forward, driven by M&amp;A activity pickup, looming debt maturities and increasing data center funding. </p><p>\n              Ratings agency Moody's earlier this month also raised its annual earnings forecast.</p><p><b>PORTFOLIO SIMPLIFICATION</b></p><p>\n              S&amp;P has also been working actively to streamline its business.

Earlier this month, it struck a $1.8 billion deal for With Intelligence, in a move to deepen its private markets push.</p><p>\n              Its indices arm also shone as higher market levels boosted asset-based revenues.
