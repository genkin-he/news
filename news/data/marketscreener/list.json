And Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Beth Hammack said she had opposed Wednesday's rate cut because inflation is too high.Â Â </p><p>\n              On Friday, traders were pricing in a 65% probability of a December rate cut, down from 72.8% on Thursday and 91.7% a week ago, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.</p><p>\n              \"The theme today is pretty similar to what we saw yesterday.

Davidson.</p><p>\n              Jake Seltz, portfolio manager for the Empiric LT Equity team at Allspring, said investors \"may have gotten in front of their skis\" in their bets for lower rates.Â </p><p>\n              Â Some grocery stocks traded lower on Friday on worries about a dip in November sales if federal food aid benefits, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP,Â  lapse in the ongoing government shutdown.</p><p>\n              Two federal judges ruled on Friday that President Donald Trump's administration cannot suspend food aid for millions of Americans during the shutdown, saying the government must use contingency funds to pay for the benefits.

The Dow rose 2.5% for the month, for its sixth straight monthly gain and its longest monthly advance since January 2018.Â </p><p>\n              For the week, the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.7% while the Nasdaq added 2.24% and the Dow climbed 0.75%.</p><p>\n              Of the 315 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported third-quarter results so far, 83.2% have surpassed analysts' estimates, according to LSEG data. That is well above the historical average, where roughly 67% of firms beat forecasts.Â </p><p>\n              With a lack of economic data from the government due to the month-long shutdown, Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital, said investors were keenly focused on earnings reports.</p><p>\n              \"The government isn't giving us the data that we have become dependent on, so we're using companies as we should by the way for guidance about how the economy is going,\" she said.Â Â </p><p>\n              In other moves, Warner Bros Discovery jumped 8.7% following a Reuters report that Netflix was actively exploring a bid for the company's studio and streaming business.Â </p><p>\n              Netflix rose 2.7% after it unveiled plans for a 10-for-1 stock split.</p><p>\n              Western Digital closed up 8.7% after rallying to an all-time high following its forecast of quarterly earnings above Wall Street estimates.
