This compares with the 2.1 billion pounds it returned through stock repurchases last year. </p><p>\n\n  Elliott said in a statement it will continue to work with LSEG to realize the full potential of its assets, close the valuation gap to industry peers and generate long-term value. </p><p>\n\n  LSEG declined to comment on the latest statement from Elliott. A spokesperson for the group previously said \"LSEG maintains an active and open dialogue with our investors, while remaining focused on executing our strategy.\" </p><p>\n\n  Elliott had been pushing LSEG to consider a new multibillion-pound share buyback and lift margins toward those of rivals, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. </p><p>\n\n  LSEG is a big financial-data provider and exchange operator that competes with peers such as S&amp;P Global and Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange. </p><p>\n\n  Its stock has slid 27% over the past year amid concerns that new artificial-intelligence tools could hit demand for its financial data and analytics tools. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Adam Whittaker at adam.whittaker@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-27-26 0654ET</p></div>",

However, he noted that it remains unclear whether this is the case and to what extent. Chief Financial Officer Dirk Elvermann pointed out that the direct impact of the tariffs on the group has been \"relatively minor.\" The reason, he explained, is the strong local business, with 80 to 90 percent of products sold in the US also being manufactured there.\n              \n<p>The US Supreme Court last week overturned tariff regulations issued by US President Donald Trump. The court's decision concerned IEEPA tariffs, which Trump had imposed based on an emergency law. These tariffs are estimated to have generated more than $175 billion.</p><p></p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n              \n(Reporting by Patricia Weiß, edited by Ralf Banser.
