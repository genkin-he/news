According to Rich Benton, vice president of Sikorsky, this technology can transform the way the military conducts missions by reducing risks to personnel.<br/><br/>These results validate the potential of MATRIX technology to expand the use of autonomous helicopters in resupply and rescue missions in hostile environments.</p></div>",
