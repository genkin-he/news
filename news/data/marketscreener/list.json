            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>BRUSSELS/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -European truck manufacturers including Traton's Scania, Volvo and Daimler Truck have urged the European Union to soften its CO2 emissions rules for the sector, a letter seen by Reuters showed.</p><p>\n              The industry is under pressure to cut its planet-warming emissions. But electric trucks still make up a small fraction of the market, as they cost significantly more than diesel models and buyers remain concerned about charging infrastructure.</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              In a letter to the European Commission dated Oct. 13, the companies called for changes to the EU's credit system which rewards manufacturers whose emissions fall below both the bloc's targets and a linear trajectory between target years. Instead, they want credits for simply beating the headline targets.</p><p>\n              Christian Levin, CEO of Scania and Traton, told Reuters the letter was \"a cry out for help\". </p><p>\n              \"We're not arguing the targets are wrong... but it's going to be very, very difficult,\" said Levin, who is also the chair of the European automobile manufacturers' association's (ACEA) commercial vehicles board.</p><p>\n              A spokesperson for Daimler Truck said the industry had invested heavily in electrification but faced \"draconian\" penalties for missing targets - despite factors outside of their control, including battery manufacturing and charging infrastructure.</p><p>\n              \"The best would be to remove these stupid fines on the industry, and rather force everyone in the system through incentives or penalties to do the job together,\" Levin added.</p><p>\n              Under EU law, truckmakers must cut emissions from new trucks by 15% by 2025, rising to 90% in 2040, compared to 2019 levels.</p><p>\n              Most truckmakers are on track to meet the 2025 goal - mainly through improving their diesel-powered lineup rather than selling more electric trucks.  </p><p>\n              Environmental campaigners warn that weakening the targets could slow Europe's shift to electrification and open the door to Chinese producers. Campaign group Transport &amp; Environment said the proposed changes could cut EU sales of zero-emission trucks by 27% in 2030.</p><p>\n              The European Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen recently promised heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers \"concrete measures to assist them to reach their targets\", in a separate letter to EU leaders. </p><p>\n              Brussels is already considering weakening its 2035 car CO2 emissions target, following pressure from industry and member states.</p><p></p><p> (Reporting by Kate Abnett in Brussels and Marie Mannes in Stockholm; additional reporting by Christina Amann, Ilona Wissenbach, Giulio Piovaccari)</p><p>\n            By Kate Abnett and Marie Mannes</p></div>",

The milestone marks a significant step for OTTO by Rockwell Automation, part of the company's 2023 acquisition of Clearpath Robotics, and reinforces Rockwell's commitment to advancing smart manufacturing through automation. The new 25,000 square feet OTTO production space at the Milwaukee campus is now assembling the OTTO 600 and OTTO 1200 AMRs, robots designed to move heavy materials safely and efficiently across busy factory floors and in tight spaces.</p><p>By reducing reliance on manual forklifts, the AMRs help manufacturers increase safety, improve transition times, minimize damage to goods, and create more resilient and sustainable operations. What makes these robots unique: Laser scanners scan the room more than 30 times per second, building a virtual map in their memory of the room around them. Through shared communication, each robot is aware of the other robots in the room and their locations, even around corners.</p><!-- Article --><p>Every OTTO AMR completes over 15 miles of driving before being considered ready to ship to the customer. Expanding OTTO production to Milwaukee is part of Rockwell's broader strategy to enhance manufacturing resiliency. Clearpath and OTTO will continue producing AMRs at their Canadian facilities in Ontario, while the Milwaukee operation adds capacity and proximity to U.S. customers.</p><p>This move follows Rockwell's recent announcement of a $2 billion investment in plants, digital infrastructure, and talent to grow share, build resilience, and expand margins. The new production space at Milwaukee headquarters is opening on schedule, just ahead of November's Automation Fair in Chicago. Customer tours of the OTTO Milwaukee space are expected to start in early 2026.</p></div>",
