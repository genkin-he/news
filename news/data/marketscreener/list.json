            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Dow Jones Newswires Staff </p><br/><p>\n  U.S. futures were up, while global markets were mostly lower after many indexes hit record highs this week. The highly anticipated agreement between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping received a muted response with market watchers saying China appeared set to maintain the rare-earth curbs introduced in the spring, and businesses expecting more rocky times ahead for U.S.-China commerce. Gold rose, while oil fell. </p><!-- Article --><br/><p>\n  --U.S. futures for the S&amp;P 500 were up 0.6% and futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1% after both indexes closed lower Thursday following earnings from Meta Platforms and Microsoft. Tech stocks fell on concerns over increased spending outlooks for the two companies. </p><br/><p>\n  --Asia stocks were mostly lower, except Japan's Nikkei which closed up 2.1% after data indicated the economy is showing signs of improvement. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index closed 0.8% lower, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1.4%. </p><br/><p>\n  --All major indexes in Europe were lower, with London's FTSE down 0.3% and Germany's DAX 0.4% lower. France's CAC 40 was down 0.15% and the Stoxx 600 fell 0.4%, lead by the technology sector which was down 0.9%. Bucking the trend were Fuchs and Puig which were up 9.5% and 7.9%, respectively after third-quarter earnings. </p><br/><p>\n  --U.S. Treasury yields edged higher in Asian trade across the curve except for the two-year maturity, but moves were overall small after this week's major central-bank policy decisions. The two-year Treasury yield was down 0.1 basis point at 3.612%, while the 10-year yield rose 1.2bps to 4.103%, according to Tradeweb. </p><br/><p>\n  --Eurozone government bond yields rose in early trade, absorbing the European Central Bank's policy meeting on Thursday. The ECB left the key interest rates unchanged, as expected, and sounded relatively relaxed about the eurozone's growth outlook. The 10-year German Bund yield rose 0.8bp to 2.646%, according to Tradeweb. </p><br/><p>\n  --The dollar remained higher, supported by reduced bets for another interest-rate cut in December after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said it was far from a done deal. The Fed delivered a widely expected 25-basis-point rate cut on Wednesday. The DXY dollar index rose 0.1% to 99.658, close to the three-month high of 99.724 reached Thursday. </p><br/><p>\n  --Bitcoin recovered marginally but remains below the key $110,000 level following losses sustained overnight after a tech-led selloff in U.S. stocks. Reduced market bets for another interest-rate cut by the Fed in December also weighed on risk appetite. Bitcoin rose 1.9% to $109,559 after reaching a one-and-a-half-week low of $106,396 late Thursday, LSEG data show. </p><br/><p>\n   --Gold prices rose in early trading as investors digest the trade deal between the U.S. and China and the Fed's hawkish tone on December interest-rate cuts. Futures in New York are up 0.4% to $4,032.10 a troy ounce after retreating back below the $4,000 mark earlier this week, and are now set for monthly gains of more than 4%. </p><br/><p>\n  --Oil prices were headed for a monthly loss of nearly 3% ahead of Sunday's OPEC+ meeting. In early trade, Brent crude and WTI both slipped 0.6% to $63.98 and $60.20 a barrel, respectively. The market has largely priced in a modest output increase of 137,000 barrels a day for December, but concerns over a growing supply glut continue to weigh on sentiment. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Barcelona Editors at barcelonaeditors@dowjones.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-31-25 0537ET</p></div>",

The first phase of SK Group's AI factory is due to be completed by late 2027. </p><p>\n\n  The Hyundai-Nvidia tie-up will focus on AI capabilities for autonomous vehicles, smart factories and robotics, and building regional AI data centers. The firms will work closely with government stakeholders to develop an ecosystem for the technology that \"will result in an approximately $3 billion investment,\" Nvidia said in a statement. </p><p>\n\n  The announcements come as countries race to build an edge in AI. </p><p>\n\n  Technological self-reliance was at the heart of China's latest economic development plan, while a Japan-U.S. investment cooperation factsheet earlier this week outlined billions in investment projects that focused heavily on AI. </p><p>\n\n  South Korea's government under President Lee Jae Myung has designated the AI sector as one of the economy's new growth engines, and set the goal of becoming one of the world's top three AI hubs. </p><p>\n\n  According to the announcement from Nvidia, the Korean government, through the Ministry of Science and ICT, is investing in sovereign AI infrastructure, including the deployment of over 50,000 of the company's latest GPUs. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Kimberley Kao at kimberley.kao@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-31-25 0531ET</p></div>",
