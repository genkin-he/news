This research will leverage Cowellnex?s independently acquired, high-precision gut microbiota data obtained through shotgun metagenomic analysis*1?one of Japan?s most detailed gut microbiota tests?accumulated over approximately three years through its ?MicroBio Me?*2 service. The companies aim to commercialize and introduce the resulting new testing services to the market in the future. Gut microbiota has been gaining attention in recent years from a health maintenance perspective. However, because the composition (types and ratios) of gut bacteria varies greatly among individuals, dietary approaches also differ. As a result, indicators that show the desired state of gut microbiota for each person and concrete action guidelines are not yet sufficiently developed. The commonly used 16S rRNA gene analysis*3 helps grasp broad bacterial classifications but provides limited information compared with shotgun metagenomic analysis. Furthermore, methods academically established for test items or food recommendations based on gut microbiota data specifically for Japanese individuals currently do not exist. Against this backdrop, expectations are increasing for more accurate gut microbiota testing and for testing items and personalized food recommendations based on such data. In the MicroBio Me business operated by Cowellnex, the company has accumulated highly precise data over approximately three years using shotgun metagenomic analysis, one of the most detailed gut microbiota tests available in Japan. Leveraging these data, Cowellnex will create new test parameters that take into account the characteristics of the gut environment of Japanese people, and will develop an algorithm (mechanism) that proposes foods based on those parameters. In this joint research, Cowellnex will be responsible for providing data, formulating hypotheses for test parameters and food recommendations, and conducting acceptability verification. Metagen will be responsible for conducting metabolic pathway analysis based on its expertise in gut environment research and bioinformatics, as well as for developing the algorithm (mechanism) for food recommendations. Through this joint research, it will become possible not only to identify which gut bacteria are present but also to predict the overall capability of the gut environment?including interactions among gut bacteria?to produce beneficial metabolites. A series of consecutive chemical reactions along metabolic pathways carried out by gut bacteria. Through these processes, dietary fiber is broken down and various metabolites are produced.<br/>\nCowellnex plans to commercialize the results of this joint research as new testing services and launch them in the market. Even after the research concludes, Cowellnex will continue accumulating data and studying ways to utilize them, contributing to improving testing accuracy and developing ingredients that help regulate gut microbiota. By leveraging its strength in high-precision data obtained through shotgun metagenomic analysis, Cowellnex will accelerate innovation in the gut microbiota domain and create a market for personalized gut health solutions based on gut microbiota composition.\n    \n    </div>",

Discovery (WBD) said a new $111 billion offer from Paramount Skydance (PSKY) is a better deal for shareholders than the one it agreed to earlier with Netflix (NFLX). Netflix will now have four business days to come up with a new proposal that beats Paramount or it will lose the fight for one of the industry's oldest film and TV studios. Paramount has offered $31 a share for all of Warner Bros. while Netflix has bid $27.75 a share for the company's studios and HBO business. Paramount Chief Executive Officer David Ellison has been pursuing Warner Bros. for months, efforts that prompted the parent of HBO and CNN to put itself up for sale in October. After Warner Bros. signed a deal in early December with Netflix, Paramount kept up the fight. Bloomberg News Senior Editor and Entertainment Team Leader Chris Palmeri joins Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss.

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Elena Vardon </p><br/><p>\n  Swiss Re's shares traded higher after the reinsurer paired its quarterly results with a surprise $1 billion share buyback, signaling a more aggressive stance on capital returns. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  The Zurich-based group on Friday said that it would repurchase $1.5 billion of its own shares over the course of the year. The program includes the introduction of a recurring annual $500 million buyback as announced late last year, plus the $1 billion top up. </p><p>\n\n  The stock climbed around 5% in early trading to hit its highest level since before a December investor day that had weighed on shares. </p><p>\n\n  J.P. Morgan analysts described the unexpected extra buyback as \"the culmination of a number of resilience building activities and strong [Swiss Solvency Test ratio].\" The move reflects a pattern of proactive capital management often seen as pricing cycles soften, where underwriters prioritize capital returns over chasing volume, Jefferies wrote in a note to clients. </p><p>\n\n  Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods struck a more cautious note and questioned the sustainability of such payouts as the total capital return slightly exceeded net operating capital generation for the year. </p><p>\n\n  For the full year, Swiss Re reported a 47% jump in net profit to a record $4.8 billion, beating its own guidance of more than $4.4 billion for 2025. The increase was driven by disciplined underwriting and a benign catastrophe environment in its property and casualty units, which helped offset a weaker showing in its life and health business. </p><p>\n\n  Performance in the last three months of the year was more nuanced. Swiss Re's net income reached $717 million, beating the company-compiled consensus of $687 million but falling sharply from the $1.05 billion recorded a year earlier. The top-line was also softer as insurance revenue slipped 6% to $11.14 billion while its investment result fell 12% to $966 million, with both metrics trailing consensus expectations. </p><p>\n\n  The quarterly print was weighed down by a review of underperforming life and health portfolios in Australia, Israel and South Korea. Swiss Re had warned this would shave off $250 million from its fourth-quarter earnings, leading it to miss its the division's annual profit target. While the review is now completed, analysts remain divided with some noting that the managed impact should reassure while others cautioned it may take some quarters of clean results to believe the issues are in the rearview mirror. </p><p>\n\n  \"All three of our business units are positioned to deliver consistent results,\" Chief Executive Officer Andreas Berger said. The company maintained its $4.5 billion net profit target for 2026, which includes a $1.7 billion contribution from the rehabilitated life and health business. </p><p>\n\n  In addition to the buybacks, the board proposed a 9% increase to its annual dividend to $8.0 per share. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Elena Vardon at elena.vardon@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-27-26 0439ET</p></div>",

This might look like great news for producers, but higher energy costs generally constrain demand.</p><p>\n              The International Energy Agency is forecasting a 2026 surplus of almost 4 million barrels a day, as stronger crude prices suppress consumption. There could be a limit to what OPEC+ can do to manage the supply side, when the IEA forecasts most extra crude will come from the \"American quintet\" - the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Argentina, and Guyana, none of which are in the group.</p><p><b>3/ BEIJING MAPS GROWTH, TOKYO TESTS BOND DEMAND</b></p><p>\n              Asia's two largest economies will offer key signals to markets. China decides on economic goals, while Japan tests demand in its volatile bond sector.</p><p>\n              Beijing convenes its closely watched National People's Congress, where officials are expected to set out targets for growth, inflation, and spending.</p><p>\n              At December's planning conference, policymakers pledged to maintain a \"proactive\" fiscal policy to stimulate consumption and investment.</p><p>\n              Tokyo will sell 10-year and 30-year government bonds. Yields on those tenors shot to historic levels in January, rattling global debt markets, on concerns about runaway stimulus from Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. A measure of calm has returned, but that was shaken on Wednesday when Takaichi's government nominated two dovish academics to the Bank of Japan's board.</p><p><b>4/ HEIGHTENED TENSIONS</b></p><p>\n              The run-up in crude oil prices is an indication that geopolitics is again top of mind for investors. The most visible sign of heightened global anxiety is the price of gold, which has been tentatively edging higher again amid fears that talks between the U.S. and Iran aimed at averting conflict will collapse.</p><p>\n              As investors increasingly cite geopolitical anxiety as one of their main concerns, the range of assets potentially affected by these tensions is growing. The dollar and Treasury securities, for instance, remain in the hot seat as U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged, including at this week's State of the Union address, to replace tariffs overturned by the Supreme Court with other levies.</p><p>\n              Longstanding relationships between asset classes are being questioned, and the definition of safe havens and \"risk on\" assets is up for grabs. Today, the focus is on oil and gold; tomorrow it could be ... anything.</p><p>\n              5/ MEXICAN STANDOFFThe dust is far from settled after the killing of Mexico's notorious drug lord \"El Mencho\" last weekend, but traders there will have something else to watch on Monday, when a bill to slash spending on electoral processes by 25% goes to Congress.</p><p>\n              The reforms would cut financing for political parties, limit daily TV and radio time, require labels for AI-made content, ban bots, scrap consecutive reelection from 2030 and cap pay for elected representatives and electoral officials. </p><p>\n              Opposition party leaders warn it could undermine the entire democratic system and approval won't be easy. The bill will require two-thirds backing of each chamber of Congress, leaving President Claudia Sheinbaum's Morena party relying on its Labor and Green Party allies, both of whom have concerns.</p><p>\n              Coming at a time when Mexico is gearing up for crucial trade USMCA renegotiations and with disgruntled drug cartels now trying to whip up a war, it's a lot to be dealing with.       </p><p></p><p> (Graphics by Kripa Jayaram and Ron Bousso; Compiled by Samuel Indyk; Editing by Amanda Cooper and Nivedita Bhattacharjee)</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>HONG KONG, Feb 27 (Reuters) - China's yuan is surging against the U.S. dollar, boosted by booming exports and aided by falling U.S. interest rates and the wobbly greenback.</p><p>\n              The yuan strengthened 4.4% last year in its biggest annual gain since 2020, and has firmed about 2% so far in 2026, hovering near three-year highs.</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              China's central bank moved to slow the pace of yuan appreciation on Friday, scrapping risk reserves requirements for forex forward contracts in a move that would encourage dollar buying.</p><p>\n              The People's Bank of China (PBOC) may deploy additional measures to prevent the yuan from appreciating too quickly, analysts say. </p><p>\n              Here are the tools at its disposal: </p><p><b>** FX REQUIREMENTS RATIO</b></p><p>\n              The PBOC said on Friday it would scrap the 20% reserves requirements for forex forward contracts, starting on March 2.</p><p>\n              The move would reduce the cost of dollar buying, and reverses a decision in September 2022 to raise the risk reserve requirements to stem the yuan's rapid losses and capital outflows. </p><p>\n              \"It sends a clear policy signal that regulators want to prevent excessive yuan appreciation, which will help stabilize market expectations,\" said Wang Qing, chief macroeconomic analyst at Orient Golden Credit Rating.</p><p>\n              Next, the PBOC could raise outright the amount of foreign exchange that financial institutions must hold as reserves, which would require dollar buying and tighten onshore dollar liquidity - slowing yuan gains. It is currently at 4%, having been reduced from 6% in 2023 as a measure to try and stem yuan weakness.</p><p><b>** COUNTER-CYCLICAL FACTOR IN YUAN'S DAILY GUIDANCE FIX</b></p><p>\n              Since December, the central bank has been setting its daily yuan official guidance at levels weaker than market projections, signaling its attention to slow the pace of yuan appreciation. </p><p>\n              The gap has widened this week to record levels, signifying the PBOC's growing discomfort with the yuan's rise and its strong intent to manage market expectations. </p><p><b>** STATE BANK DOLLAR BUYING </b></p><p>\n              China's major state-owned banks bought dollars in the onshore spot market and held them in an unusually strong effort to rein in yuan strength, Reuters reported in December.</p><p>\n              The lenders did not appear to recycle the dollars into the swap market, likely aimed at tightening dollar liquidity and so raising the cost of long yuan bets.</p><p>\n              Although the PBOC itself wasn't seen directly in the market, the state banks could have been acting on behalf of the central bank, said Brad Setser, a currency expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, in a recent blog post. </p><p>\n              \"All the activity is with the state banks,\" he noted estimating a \"nearly unprecedented\" level of backdoor intervention in December.</p><p><b>** VERBAL GUIDANCE </b></p><p>\n              PBOC officials frequently make public statements to reaffirm its commitment to keep the yuan \"basically stable\", and warn against the risk of currency overshooting.</p><p>\n              The central bank has also repeatedly urged market participants to use derivatives to hedge against currency risks, rather than making one-way bets on the yuan. </p><p><b>** DIRECT INTERVENTION </b></p><p>\n              In extreme cases, the PBOC can directly buy and sell foreign currencies in the market to influence exchange rates.</p><p>\n              During the 2015-16 China market crash, the PBOC sold dollars in the market to stablize a slumping yuan.</p><p>\n              In recent years, China's central bank has refrained from direct intervention, which is evidenced by its relatively stable foreign currency reserves.</p><p></p><p> (Reporting by Jiaxing Li in Hong Kong; Editing by Kim Coghill)</p></div>",

The shares fell 5.5% to $184.89 in New York, marking the biggest one-day drop since April 16. The decline followed a first-quarter sales outlook that -- on its face -- looked impressive. Nvidia easily beat the average analyst estimate and delivered a 73% surge in fourth-quarter revenue. The reaction was a stark reminder of the skepticism now surrounding Nvidia. After explosive sales growth turned the chipmaker into the world's most valuable company, investors are seeking stronger assurances that booming AI spending can be maintained. Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Semiconductor Analyst Kunjan Sobhani, and Senior Technology Credit Analyst Robert Schiffman both join Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss.
