            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  OPENING CALL </p><p>\n\n     Stock futures were rising early Friday, after a solid batch of earnings reinforced hopes that the tech rally can roll on. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n     The three major indexes fell in a messy day of trading on Thursday, but they looked set to rebound after earnings from Apple and Amazon, both of which beat the Street's bottom-line expectations. </p><p>\n\n     \"Just as the tech mood had soured yesterday, this morning that has mostly turned around following results from Apple and Amazon after the closing bell,\" Deutsche Bank said. </p><p>\n\n     \"This renewed momentum has helped sentiment after a more challenging day yesterday despite the positive outcomes from the U.S.-China trade discussions.\" </p><p>\n\n     Meanwhile, the government shutdown is nearing a full month, active-duty military personnel are due their next paycheck, and effects on airports are getting worse. </p><p>\n\n     The nation's air-traffic controllers first missed their paycheck this week, and Transportation Security Administration employees--including airport screeners--are also going without pay. </p><p>\n\n     That increases the risk of further flight cancellations mere weeks away from the air-travel Super Bowl: Thanksgiving week. </p><p>\n\n     Navan fell 20% Thursday when the software firm became the largest company to go public during the shutdown. </p><p>\n\n     Its performance could give pause to companies looking to stage IPOs during the period. </p><p>\n\n     Stocks to Watch </p><p>\n\n     Amazon.com reported revenue up 13% and strong cloud sales. The stock rose 12% premarket. </p><p>\n\n     Apple was up 2.6%  after September-quarter revenue hit a record, despite supply constraints. </p><p>\n\n     Reddit's revenue and profit rose on advertising demand. The stock gained 9% after the bell. </p><p>\n\n     SPS Commerce  cut its sales outlook after recording revenue below expectations. Shares dropped 26% </p><p>\n\n     Watch For: </p><p>\n\n     Personal Income &amp; Spending for September and Employment Cost Index for 3Q are due; Chicago Business Barometer - ISM-Chicago Business Survey - Chicago PMI for October; Canada GDP for August; Earnings from Canadian National Railway, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, AbbVie and Colgate-Palmolive. </p><p>\n\n     Today's Top Headlines/Must Reads: </p><p>\n\n     -How Chevron Got Caught in the Clash Between the U.S. and Venezuela </p><p>\n\n     -The Long Road to a U.S.-China Trade Pact </p><p>\n\n     -Amazon's Cloud Business Won't Be an AI Laggard for Long </p><p>\n\n     MARKET WRAPS </p><p>\n\n     Forex: </p><p>\n\n     The dollar remained higher,  supported by reduced bets for another rate cut in December after Powell said it was far from a done deal. </p><p>\n\n     \"If the government shutdown continues, it would not be obvious that the Fed will continue with rate cuts,\" Jefferies said. </p><p>\n\n     The euro-dollar exchange rate remained driven by dollar moves  following the ECB meeting, ING said. </p><p>\n\n     There's some speculation in the market that the euro could fall below $1.15 but this looks unlikely given prospects of further weak U.S. jobs data. </p><p>\n\n     The eurozone economy is also showing a slight improvement, it added. </p><p>\n\n     Bonds: </p><p>\n\n     Treasury yields edged higher  across the curve, except for the two-year maturity, but moves were overall small following this week's major central bank policy decisions. </p><p>\n\n     Barclays strategists recommended 3.61% as an entry level for the two-year Treasurys  saying it believed two-year yields can fall by 25 basis points. </p><p>\n\n     TD Securities doesn't expect Treasury auction size increases until at least late 2026,  with the Treasury likely keeping guidance unchanged. </p><p>\n\n     \"Treasury should continue bringing more supply in bills as coupon auction sizes remain unchanged--especially as QT is coming to an end and reserve management purchases may be in the cards in 2026.\" </p><p>\n\n     Energy: </p><p>\n\n     Oil prices were headed for a monthly loss of nearly 3%  ahead of Sunday's OPEC+ meeting. </p><p>\n\n     The market has largely priced in a modest output increase of 137,000 barrels a day for December, but concerns over a growing supply glut continue to weigh on sentiment. </p><p>\n\n     Meanwhile, the trade agreement with China did little to resolve questions over Chinese purchases of Russian oil, analysts said. </p><p>\n\n     \"There has been no indication on the Chinese side as to whether they will stop buying,\" according to ANZ. </p><p>\n\n     \"There was also hope that China would agree to purchases of U.S. oil and gas as part of a broader U.S.-China deal.\" </p><p>\n\n     Metals: </p><p>\n\n     Gold prices rose  as investors digested the trade deal with China and the Fed's hawkish tone on December rate cuts. </p><p>\n\n     Futures in New York are up 0.4% to $4,032.10 a troy ounce after retreating back below the $4,000 mark earlier this week, and are now set for monthly gains of more than 4%. </p><p>\n\n     \"We expect gold prices to remain elevated in the coming weeks, especially as central bank purchases remain high,\" BMI said. </p><p>\n\n     However, \"risks are slated to the downside as the Fed has downplayed the possibility of another cut in December and the trade deal between the U.S. and China has abated a lot of the uncertainty in the market.\" </p><p>\n\n     UOB maintained its positive outlook for gold and raised price forecasts  to $4,000 by 4Q 2025, $4,100 by 1Q 2026, $4,200 by 2Q 2026, and $4,300 by 3Q 2026. </p><pre style=\"font-size:14px\">\n\n   TODAY'S TOP HEADLINES </pre><p>\n\n     Elon Musk's SpaceX Set to Win $2 Billion Pentagon Satellite Deal </p><p>\n\n     SpaceX is set to receive $2 billion to develop satellites that can track missiles and aircraft under President Trump's Golden Dome project, people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>\n\n     The funding was included in the tax-and-spending bill that Trump signed in July, but wasn't publicly linked to a contractor. The planned \"air moving target indicator\" system could eventually field as many as 600 satellites, some of the people said. </p><p>\n\n     Samsung Electronics, Nvidia to Build AI Factory in New Chip Deal </p><p>\n\n     Nvidia has struck a spate of deals with some of South Korea's biggest companies that will see more than a quarter-million of its chips deployed across the country. </p><p>\n\n     The tie-ups with Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Motor Group and other Korean industrial giants were announced Friday as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang visited South Korea to attend a summit. </p><p>\n\n     Audi Cuts Profitability Guidance Again </p><p>\n\n     Audi cut its full-year margin guidance again as U.S. tariffs, restructuring costs and the postponement of an electric-vehicle platform weigh on profitability at the German automaker. </p><p>\n\n     \"We are responding to the challenging overall economic situation and intensified competition with stringent cost control measures and are continuing to work on our financial performance,\" Audi Chief Financial Officer Juergen Rittersberger said. \"At the same time, we are making our business model future-proof and resilient.\" </p><p>\n\n     French Inflation Eases After ECB Holds Rates </p><p>\n\n     French inflation cooled a little in October despite an unexpectedly strong upswing in the economy, likely helping keep European Central Bank policymakers on course to hold interest rates well into next year. </p><p>\n\n     Consumer prices were 0.9% higher than the same month of last year, down from 1.1% in September, EU-harmonized figures published by statistics agency Insee showed Friday. </p><p>\n\n     More Home Purchases Are Falling Through in an Uncertain Economy </p><p>\n\n     Trish DaCosta saved for more than five years to buy a home in Nashville, Tenn., and was thrilled when her offer on a roughly $400,000, three-bedroom house was accepted. Then, a month before closing earlier this year, she was laid off from her job in public relations. </p><p>\n\n     When she learned she lost her job, the first call she made was to her real-estate agent to pull the offer. </p><p>\n\n     Wall Street Is Punishing Stocks When Earnings Fail to Sparkle </p><p>\n\n     The market isn't far from all-time highs and many experts would argue that stocks are priced for perfection. That is a problem because top companies like Meta Platforms and Chipotle are reporting earnings and issuing outlooks that are a little less than perfect. </p><p>\n\n     Chipotle illustrates what is happening. The popular Mexican food chain's results, released late Wednesday, weren't bad per se: Earnings and revenue matched Wall Street's forecasts. But the company said same-store sales for the fourth quarter are now likely to decline, a sign of slowing demand that Wall Street wasn't expecting. </p><p>\n\n     Hezbollah Is Rearming, Putting Cease-Fire at Risk </p><p>\n\n     Lebanese militant group Hezbollah is rebuilding its armaments and battered ranks, defying the terms of a cease-fire agreement and raising the prospect of renewed conflict with Israel, according to people familiar with Israeli and Arab intelligence. </p><p>\n\n     The intelligence shows Iranian-backed Hezbollah is restocking rockets, antitank missiles and artillery, the people said. Some of those weapons are coming in via seaports and weakened but still functional smuggling routes through Syria, some of the people said. Hezbollah is manufacturing some new weapons itself, one of the people said. </p><p>\n\n     Trump Pivots Second Term Toward Foreign Policy </p><p>\n\n     BUSAN, South Korea-President Trump wrapped up his six-day swing through Asia by touting trade deals and new investments in the U.S. But as he arrives back in Washington, the gold-plated receptions abroad are giving way to a shuttered government and deepening voter anxiety about the economy. </p><p>\n\n     The split screen sheds light on why Trump has turned much of his second-term attention to foreign policy. </p><p>\n\n     Trump's Vow to Resume Nuclear Tests Leaves Experts Puzzled </p><p>\n\n     WASHINGTON-A day after President Trump vowed to resume testing of nuclear weapons, the White House wasn't answering questions about the details, leaving members of Congress, experts and even the administration's nominee to command U.S. nuclear forces uncertain what he meant. </p><p>\n\n     \"I don't have insights into the president's intent,\" Vice Adm. Richard Correll said at his Senate confirmation hearing to lead U.S. Strategic Command, after he was asked whether Trump wanted to step up missile flight tests or resume underground nuclear detonations for the first time in more than three decades. </p><p>\n\n     Write to clare.kinloch@wsj.com </p><p>\n\n     TODAY IN CANADA </p><p>\n\n     Earnings (3Q): </p><p>\n\n     Canadian National Railway </p><p>\n\n     Cenovus Energy </p><p>\n\n     Imperial Oil Ltd </p><p>\n\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-31-25 0615ET</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>NEW YORK (Reuters) -A resilient U.S. stocks rally heads into a busy week of corporate results, with investors concerned about the strength of the artificial intelligence trade and about how aggressively the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates.</p><p>\n              On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 backed off somewhat from record highs but the benchmark index remained on pace for its third straight week of gains, despite wobbling after megacap companies posted mixed results. Doubt also grew that more interest rate cuts were imminent after the Fed eased by a quarter point on Wednesday, as expected.</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              Following the October monetary policy meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said an interest rate cut at the next meeting in December was \"not a foregone conclusion.\" Investors had expected that move to be almost a done deal.</p><p>\n              Corporate earnings have broadly topped expectations. Third-quarter S&amp;P 500 profits are on pace to have climbed 12.5% from a year earlier, according to LSEG IBES. More than 130 index companies will report in the coming week.</p><p>\n              Making some investors nervous, the rally has lifted the S&amp;P 500's forward price-to-earnings multiple above 23, putting the market's valuation around its highest since the dot-com bubble 25 years ago, according to LSEG Datastream.</p><p>\n              \"If we assume that we're getting close to the ceiling on valuations as investors may be reluctant to pay multiples closer to what they were in the tech bubble, I think earnings will have to do the heavy lifting to drive returns forward,\" said Angelo Kourkafas, senior global investment strategist at Edward Jones.</p><p>\n              The first week of November kicks off a traditionally rosy period for stocks. Still, given the strong performance so far in 2025, some investors question whether some year-end cheer has been pulled forward. The S&amp;P 500 is up 16% year-to-date, while the Nasdaq Composite has gained 22%.</p><p>\n              Since 1950, November ranks as the best performing month and December the third-best for the S&amp;P 500 on average, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. November has an average gain of 1.87% in that time, with December averaging an increase of 1.43%, just behind April's 1.47%.</p><p>\n              With 44% of S&amp;P 500 companies that reported as of Wednesday, 83% exceeded earnings expectations. That beat rate would be the sixth highest on record if it holds, according to strategists at Ned Davis Research.</p><p>\n              Still, there have been hiccups. On Thursday, shares of Meta Platforms and Microsoft slid following their quarterly reports. Both announced spending increases to fuel AI expansions.</p><p>\n              Alphabet also boosted its projected capital spending, but its shares rose as investors were more accepting of the Google parent's ability to fund its plans from its cash flow.</p><p>\n              Enthusiasm over AI has helped drive the S&amp;P 500 up 90% since the bull market began just over three years ago. But investors are wary of potential overexuberance tied to the theme and eager for evidence that AI investments are paying off.</p><p>\n              \"Investors want to know not only what the growth prospects look like, which has been the focus as these stocks have skyrocketed ... but also how much are they spending and what sort of return does that imply,\" said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management.</p><p>\n              Tech companies reporting next week include semiconductor firms Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm and data analytics company Palantir Technologies.

By contrast, Google Cloud lost billions between 2018 and 2022 due to heavy investments in servers, datacenters and chips until it turned its first profit in 2023. </p><p>\n              Now, with generative AI, Alphabet sees a chance to close the gap with rivals Microsoft and Amazon, which hold 20% and 30% market share respectively.</p><p>\n              Making Google Cloud a contender has come at a cost: Alphabet has already shocked Wall Street twice during quarterly earnings this year by proclaiming higher-than-expected capital spending due to the need to build more infrastructure to fulfill cloud demand.</p><p>\n              \"This is the moment Google Cloud was waiting for,\" Dave McCarthy, who directs coverage of the cloud industry for research firm IDC. \"A lot of the future growth at Alphabet is being looked at through its potential.\"</p><p>\n              In exclusive interviews with Reuters, senior Alphabet executives mapped out the gameplan that transformed the also-ran into a growth driver: a cultural shift to a more customer-driven sales approach; changing how it worked with rivals; and a renewed focus on delivering profits.</p><p><b>'GET OUT OF HERE, KID'</b></p><p>\n              Back when Kurian joined Alphabet, Google Cloud struggled to win enterprise customers, unlike the ads side of the business which was dealing with the biggest companies in the world.</p><p>\n              \"We would go to the ads team asking, 'Hey, can you help us out with this customer?' And they would basically be like, 'Get out of here, kid,'\" said Josh Gwyther, a startup founder who worked at Google Cloud from 2016 to 2025.</p><p>\n              That's not a problem anymore: Google's scope of AI offerings have brought it into conversations with large companies that previously only considered Amazon and Microsoft. </p><p>\n              \"The ads business is extremely healthy, but it's not going to grow at the pace that we are,\" said Matt Renner, Google Cloud's president of global revenue. </p><p>\n              Nine of the 10 leading AI labs are now customers, Kurian said at an industry conference in September. They include OpenAI, Anthropic and Safe Superintelligence. Details of Google's deals with two of those labs were first reported by Reuters earlier this year.</p><p>\n              To get there, Kurian took a mallet to traditional practices, replacing it with what several employees called an \"un-Googley\" culture. </p><p>\n              Kurian, who left a job as one of Larry Ellison's highest-paid lieutenants at Oracle, brought financial discipline to Google's \"loosely-run, ground-up culture\" that encouraged side projects and experimentation, said Chirag Mehta, a tech analyst who worked at Google Cloud from 2017 to 2021.</p><p>\n              To slash costs, Kurian opened new offices in cheaper locations, such as North Carolina and Poland. He audited Google Cloud's contracts for internal services and renegotiated those where he deemed his unit was being overcharged by other departments, as was first reported in The Information.</p><p>\n              He has ordered employees to focus on revenue rather than bookings. Google Cloud also shifted its sales strategy to target customers by sector rather than geography. That helped reduce sales reps being assigned accounts in industries where they lacked specialized knowledge, said Renner.</p><p>\n              Its focus on generative AI has allowed it to catch up with rivals Microsoft and Amazon from a technical standpoint, according to some analysts. </p><p>\n              \"We believe that the three clouds competitively are on roughly equal footing,\" said Goldman Sachs managing director Eric Sheridan. \"That's a very different competitive positioning for Google Cloud now than two or three years ago.\"</p><p><b>WORKING WITH THE ENEMY</b></p><p>\n              For years, Alphabet had reserved the lion's share of its own chips, or TPUs, for in-house use only. That changed in 2022, when Kurian successfully lobbied to move the group selling TPUs from Google's core engineering unit into Google Cloud.</p><p>\n              That move drastically increased Google Cloud's allocation of TPUs because the unit could now freely offer the chips rather than having to receive approval from another part of the company, according to two people familiar with the move.</p><p>\n              At a time when the world was scrambling for compute, Alphabet made the decision to make its chips available to not just its own DeepMind AI unit, but also to its competitors. </p><p>\n              That decision stoked tensions internally, according to former employees of both units, but it gave Kurian a stronger sales pitch for courting customers.</p><p>\n              \"We are the only hyperscaler with both silicon and models of our own,\" he said. \"How deep is your technical differentiation when the same stuff that you're reselling can be bought from somebody else?\"</p><p>\n              Google Cloud quickly leveraged the opportunity to petition Anthropic to test TPUs as a viable alternative to Nvidia's GPUs, according to a former Google Cloud executive involved in the partnership.</p><p>\n              By 2024, Anthropic had seen enough to deploy Alphabet's TPUs at scale. In October, it expanded its deal with Google to use as many as one million TPUs, worth tens of billions of dollars. The startup, which is now valued at $183 billion, has also tapped Amazon for chips as it reduces its dependency on Nvidia, which controls about 80% of the AI chip market.</p><p>\n              \"The whole world was sort of on GPUs, OpenAI in particular,\" said Dan Rosenthal, who manages Anthropic's partnerships with Google and Amazon. The need for chips \"pushed us to be more flexible,\" he said.</p><p>\n              Other AI developers including Apple and Safe Superintelligence have since adopted Alphabet's TPUs. Pichai told analysts on an earnings conference call this week that Alphabet is \"investing in TPU capacity to meet the tremendous demand we are seeing from customers and partners.\"</p><p>\n              And although Google Cloud launched an enterprise version of its flagship model Gemini in October, Kurian told Reuters he would welcome adding OpenAI's family of enterprise models to Google Cloud if the ChatGPT maker was interested.</p><p><b>POWER SHIFT</b></p><p>\n              The ascent of Google Cloud is shifting the balance of power inside Alphabet. Current and former executives told Reuters Kurian has gained clout at Google's weekly \"leads,\" the agenda-setting meetings where division leaders jostle over resources and priorities.</p><p>\n              \"What Thomas has been a powerful voice for is making sure that when we say we're focusing on the user, that we're focusing on the enterprise customer too,\" Pichai said.</p><p>\n              It still has a long way to catch up with its rivals and it will be expensive to get there. In July, Pichai hiked Alphabet's projected capital spending for 2025 by $10 billion to $85 billion. This week, he raised the projection again to between $91 billion and $93 billion, adding that 2026 was likely to run an even larger bill.</p><p>\n              With concerns over an AI bubble growing, Pichai told Reuters that he expects Google Cloud's business to have \"a lot of resilience\" against short-term market corrections. \"From our standpoint, we've been doing the AI thing for a decade now, and we're going to be doing it a decade from now.\"</p><p></p><p>(Reporting by Kenrick Cai in San Francisco.
