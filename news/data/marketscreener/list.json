We continue to see strong demand in the areas of AI and core infrastructure, and we are focused on accelerating capacity,\" said CEO Andy Jassy.<br/><br/>For the last three months of 2025, Amazon expects operating income of between $21bn and $26bn, compared to $21.2bn a year earlier, with revenue of between $206bn and $213bn, up 10% to 13%.</p></div>",

Seoul will invest $350 billion in the U.S.--including $200 billion of cash installments, capped at $20 billion annually to minimize financial-market risks. In return, the Trump administration will lower tariffs on a swath of items, including vehicles, to 15% from 25%. </p><p>\n\n  The lower U.S. duty is welcome news for Hyundai, which has been subject to a 25% levy since April due to the protracted negotiations. The deal would bring its tariff on par with those faced by its Japanese and European rivals. </p><p>\n\n  Nomura estimated that the reduced auto tariff would boost Hyundai's fourth-quarter operating profit by 9% from the prior quarter. Increased local production of vehicles in the U.S. and lower duties will help lift the carmaker's annual operating profit by 13% in 2026, analysts Angela Hong and Won Kang said in a report. </p><p>\n\n  The tariff relief should alleviate market concerns about competition in the U.S., as Korean original equipment manufacturers \"are now able to compete on an equal footing with Japanese and European peers,\" HSBC analyst Will Cho wrote in a note. </p><p>\n\n  HSBC raised its 2025-2027 operating profit forecasts for Hyundai by 10%-14%, citing the lower tariffs and other efforts to improve profit margins in the U.S. </p><p>\n\n  Hyundai on Thursday reported weaker third-quarter earnings, partly due to U.S. tariffs, with net profit and operating profit falling 21% and 29%, respectively, from a year earlier. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Kwanwoo Jun at kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-31-25 0317ET</p></div>",

The new tenant will move into CTPark SulechOW later this year, when they will occupy nearly 46% of the developed area of the park through 33,376 sqm of warehouse space and a 1,074 sqm office area. This growing demand for warehouse facilities highlights the rapid growth of the third-party logistics (3PL) sector in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), driven by factors such as nearshoring, regional manufacturing growth, and the rise of e-commerce.</p><p>As demand for modern logistics infrastructure continues to grow, investment in flexible and facilities with CTP ensures logistics providers are well-equipped to meet the evolving needs of an extensive modern client base. In addition to the new tenant, Domator24, a Polish manufacturer of gaming chairs and metal furniture, also operates at CTPark SuleChow. Located less than 70km from Germany, the park's proximity to the German border and good transport infrastructure make Sulechow increasingly important as an alternative to the main logistics locations in western Poland.</p><!-- Article --><p>As part of CTP's investment, a building with an area of 74,995 sqm has been completed so far and there are also plans to build a second warehouse with an area of 12,837 sqm. CTPPark Sulechow is the second investment by CTP in Poland'sLubuskie Province, in addition to CTPark Ilowa which is located directly on the A18 motorway leading to the German border and where CTP has developed two buildings with a total area of 99,148 sqm so far.</p></div>",
