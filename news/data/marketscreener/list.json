Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal were expecting a 0.3% increase. </p><p>\n\n  Over the 12 months through January, wholesale prices were up 2.9%. </p><p>\n\n  PPI inflation reflects the prices that businesses receive for their goods and services, including in business-to-business transactions, but without retailers' markups or distribution costs. These figures are more volatile than the widely tracked consumer-price index, which reflects the prices shoppers see at businesses and online. </p><p>\n\n  Wall Street analysts watch the producer-price index closely, however, because some of its price data are blended with CPI figures and import prices to calculate the personal-consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric. </p><p>\n\n  Analysts can therefore use Friday's numbers to refine their forecasts for the January PCE inflation report, due on March 13. Those refreshed forecasts will arrive later Friday morning. </p><p>\n\n  Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com </p><p>\n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-27-26 0857ET</p></div>",
