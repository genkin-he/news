The cells will supply its battery energy storage business in Gdansk, Poland, which it also bought out of the Northvolt bankruptcy.</p><p>\n              Northvolt's main customers included Volkswagen, BMW and Volvo Cars, but Lyten's chief sustainability and marketing officer Keith Norman said winning back automakers will take time.</p><p>\n              \"It's a wonderful market to be in, but it's a very difficult market to get into because it just takes time, rightly so,\" he said. \"They need consistency, and that requires spending a large amount of time testing and validating and working with them.\"</p><p>\n              Automotive qualification can take years, though Norman said Lyten hopes the process will move faster because former Northvolt customers already know the cells.</p><p>\n              For now, the company is targeting sectors such as battery-energy storage, data centres and defence.</p><p>\n              \"Some of the other markets that we're looking at ... we can get cells in customers' hands in large-scale commercial quantities much more quickly. And so that's how we're thinking about really balancing the focus of the plant,\" Norman said. </p><p>\n              He added that Lyten expects to hire more than 600 employees in the coming months.  </p><p>\n              Truckmaker Scania, a former Northvolt customer and close partner, said it was still too early to say whether it would place orders with Lyten. </p><p>\n              Lyten also said it had sold a data-centre site in Skelleftea to EdgeConneX, a portfolio company of EQT.</p><p>\n              Completion of the deal was delayed from the original mid-October timeline.
