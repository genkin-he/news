            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>ServiceNow launched Autonomous Workforce, AI specialists that can execute jobs with the scope, authority, and governance required for enterprise work ? freeing people to focus on strategic problem solving and personalized service. Just two months after the Moveworks acquisition close, the company also introduced ServiceNow EmployeeWorks, which combines Moveworks' conversational AI and enterprise search with ServiceNow?s unified portal and autonomous workflows to turn natural language requests into governed, end-to-end execution for nearly 200 million employees.</p><p>As enterprises evaluate AI platforms, two competing paradigms have emerged: feature-function AI bolted onto disconnected SaaS apps, and unified platforms that execute work through proven enterprise workflows with AI built in. The difference is fundamental: the feature approach requires enterprises to maintain, integrate, and manage the complexity themselves. ServiceNow eliminates the complexity by unifying conversational AI, workflows, enterprise data, security, and governance on a platform purpose-built for mission-critical operations.</p><!-- Article --><p>ServiceNow?s Autonomous Workforce deploys AI specialists with defined roles to augment teams. Unlike AI agents that complete individual tasks, the ServiceNow Autonomous Workforce orchestrates teams of AI specialists with roles such as a Level 1 Service Desk AI Specialist, Employee Service Agent, or Security Operations Analyst to execute work from start to finish. They work alongside humans, follow established processes and policies set by the organization, learn from outcomes and employee feedback, and importantly, improve over time. ServiceNow is introducing the first AI specialist available out-of-the-box for customers, a Level 1 Service Desk AI Specialist.</p><p>This AI specialist autonomously diagnoses and resolves common IT support requests end-to-end ? password resets, software access provisioning, network troubleshooting ? using enterprise knowledge bases, historical incident data, and proactive remediation workflows.</p><p>It is designed to operate 24/7 with assignments aligned to specific skillsets and deliverables and escalate issues when human intervention is needed. At ServiceNow, Autonomous Workforce is handling 90%+ of employee IT requests. Early results show newest AI specialist, the L1 Service Desk AI Specialist, is already resolving assigned IT cases autonomously, and it's 99% faster than when these cases are handled by human agents.</p><p>AI models without workflows are probabilistic ? they see patterns, form ideas, and give different answers for the same questions. The enterprise, however, needs deterministic outcomes ?</p><p>governance, security, auditability, and operations that don't hallucinate. Because ServiceNow combines probabilistic intelligence with deterministic workflow orchestration, AI specialists can interpret a request, decide the right action using business context, and execute autonomously across systems with governance built in through the ServiceNow AI Control Tower. Every action is traceable and governed by policies embedded in the workflow layer itself.</p><p>ServiceNow is bringing the power of Moveworks to the ServiceNow AI Platform and delivering immediate value to customers with ServiceNow EmployeeWorks, a conversational front door for the enterprise. Available where employees already work and collaborate ? whether in Teams, Slack, or on any browser ?</p><p>ServiceNow EmployeeWorks connects Moveworks? conversational AI chat and deep enterprise search with ServiceNow?s unified portal and autonomous workflows, turning intent into coordinated action across systems. The platform understands organizational structure, approvals, and authorization ? executing tasks that require multi-system coordination while maintaining governance and audit trails.</p><p>Availability: ServiceNow EmployeeWorks is generally available to customers. The first AI specialist for Autonomous Workforce, a Level 1 Service Desk AI Specialist, is in controlled availability and expected to be generally available second quarter of 2026; Moveworks continues to be offered as a standalone product within the ServiceNow portfolio. Organizations can acquire the Moveworks platform as an independent AI solution or as an integrated component of their ServiceNow deployment, ensuring flexibility in enterprise-wide implementation.</p></div>",

The live proof of concept centered on drone detection using Ericsson's massive-MIMO radios, showcasing the network's ability to track unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) within surrounding airspace.

The proof of concept underscores Ericsson's commitment to advancing 6G-era capabilities and collaborating with the broader ecosystem to validate real-world scenarios and deployment approaches across sites, spectrum, and hardware integration levels. Ericsson has invested more than $150 million in the factory and is the only manufacturer making telecom equipment at scale in the US.</p><p>The highly automated, 300,000-square-foot facility supports more than 550 US manufacturing jobs and strengthens secure, resilient domestic supply chains.
