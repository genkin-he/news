The group's workforce will be reduced from over 10,000 employees to just under 6,000, according to a letter to shareholders from co-founder and chief executive Jack Dorsey. <br/><br/>Management said that the restructuring is aimed at ushering in a new phase of long-term growth, with leaner teams and greater use of artificial intelligence to automate certain tasks. Chief financial officer Amrita Ahuja pointed to a shift in how the company operates as the business accelerates. The job cuts are expected to result in charges of between $450m and $500m, mainly recorded in Q1. <br/><br/>The announcement comes alongside quarterly results in line with expectations, with adjusted EPS of 65 cents on revenue of $6.25bn. Gross profit rose 24% y-o-y to $2.87bn. For the full year, Block forecast adjusted EPS of $3.66, above the $3.22 expected by the market.</p></div>",
