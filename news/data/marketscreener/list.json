(SoftBank), Keysight Technologies, and zTouch Networks are demonstrating Autonomous Agentic AI-RAN (AgentRAN) at Mobile World Congress (MWC) Barcelona 2026. AgentRAN is a first-of-its-kind system that coordinates a hierarchy of AI agents to translate high-level operator intents into real-time, autonomous 5G and 6G network configurations and services.</p><p>The demonstration is the latest milestone in a collaboration anchored at Northeastern University, where INSI has served as a nexus for industry-ac academic partnerships at the frontier of intelligent wireless networks. Over the past few years, Northeastern has built deep research ties with SoftBank on AI-native architectures, leading to multiple publications, AI-RAN Alliance demonstrations, and innovation in next-generation wireless. INSI collaborate with Keysight on AI-RAN testing and spun off zTouch Networks to commercialize technology on open, GPU-accelerated RAN infrastructure.</p><!-- Article --><p>This demo brings those threads together for the first time around a shared vision: truly autonomous, AI-driven radio access networks. At the heart of the demo is AgentRAN, developed at Northeastern's Open6G AI-RAN Alliance Lab. Operators express goals in natural language - such as \"maximize throughput while prioritizing emergency traffic\" - and the AgentRAN Manager decomposes these intents into actions for specialized agents operating across the RAN stack.</p><p>The agents are powered by the SoftBank's Large Telecom Model (LTM), a purpose-built foundation model trained on telecom-specific KPIs, configurations, and domain data--f further optimized with high-fidelity training data generated using Keysight's RF digital twin channel emulation solutions with real world accurate 3D ray tracing capabilities (RaySIM, PROPSIM) for more accurate decisions than generic cloud models can deliver. The Northeastern Open6G AI-Ran lab, using Keysight's PROPSIM, demonstrates multiple agentic scenarios, deployed on an end-to-end programmable private 5G AI-RAN infrastructure, managed and orchestrated by zTouch Networks' zTouch.OS. Using Keysight's AI-RAN performance scoring solution, the system shows clear performance gains linked to the use of SoftBank's LTM, high fidelity training datasets generated by Keysight RF digital twin solutions, and zTouch Networks' zTouch\".OS.</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Paul Vieira </p><br/><p>\n  OTTAWA--Anger over President Trump's trade policy has fueled a notable increase in Canadian spending on domestic products and local tourism, according to research from the Bank of Canada. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  The central bank's analysis, published Thursday, also suggests that momentum behind buying Canadian remains solid with no sign of ebbing. </p><p>\n\n  \"Should Canadian consumers continue to prefer domestic products over U.S. goods and services, this spending shift could not only affect the composition of Canada's gross domestic product but also have an impact on inflationary pressures,\" the report said. The research was conducted by the central bank's analysts and produced independently from the Bank of Canada's governing council, which decides on rate policy. </p><p>\n\n  Trump's protectionist trade policy, along with musings from Trump about using economic force to annex Canada as a 51st state, triggered a Buy Canadian movement in the country. People vowed not to travel to the U.S., and Statistics Canada data bear this out. Grocers continue to prominently mark certain products in aisles as made-in-Canada. </p><p>\n\n  Overall, trade-policy uncertainty has cast a pall over the Canadian economy, as companies curb investment plans and hiring until the future of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade treaty, or USMCA, is settled. Senior Bank of Canada officials have called the pending U.S.-led review of USMCA later this year as an important risk to the economic outlook. </p><p>\n\n  Statistics Canada data earlier this week indicated trips by Canadians to the U.S. fell by 25% in 2025 -- or the largest year-over-year decline ever recorded excluding the Covid-19 pandemic period. The Bank of Canada report indicates that Canadians, instead, took 4% more trips domestically between the first and third quarters of last year, and spent 10% more on travel and tourism during that same timeframe. </p><p>\n\n  As for the purchasing of goods, the Bank of Canada analysts used detailed, transaction-level data from NielsenIQ. The data indicate that since March, 2025, households have shifted food spending away from U.S. products and toward Canadian ones. \"The shift is modest but clearly visible,\" the report said. The central bank said the shift was more pronounced in categories such as coffee and fruit juice. </p><p>\n\n  \"Outside of food, where Canadian substitutes are often harder to find, we see no comparable shift in spending patterns,\" the central bank research said. The report added that retaliatory tariffs imposed by Canada on certain goods might have also prompted a shift away from U.S. products -- although Prime Minister Mark Carney dropped most of those duties in late August. </p><p>\n\n  Most Canadian exports arriving in the U.S. are free of tariffs, because they comply with the terms under USMCA. The White House also provided an exemption for Canada and Mexico from Trump's new global tariff of 15%, revealed about a week ago after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling invalidating his original levies. It's unclear whether that exemption will remain as part of the U.S. review of USMCA. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-26-26 1308ET</p></div>",
