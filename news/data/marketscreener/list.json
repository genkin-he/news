            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>SAN JOSE, California, Feb 26 (Reuters) - ASML Holding's next-generation chipmaking machine is ready for manufacturers to start bringing it into use for production at high volumes, a senior executive told Reuters, a big step for the chip industry.</p><p>\n              The Dutch company produces the world's only commercial extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) tools, which are a critical piece of equipment for chipmakers. This new tool will help chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  and Intel produce more powerful and efficient chips, by eliminating several costly and complex steps from the chip-manufacturing process, data from ASML shows.</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              ASML plans to release this data, which represents a key milestone, at a technical conference in San Jose on Thursday, the company's chief technology officer, Marco Pieters, told Reuters on Wednesday.</p><p>\n              It has taken ASML years to develop the costly, next-generation tools as chipmakers have attempted to determine at what point it makes economic sense to begin to use them for mass production.</p><p>\n              But given that the current generation of EUV tools is approaching the technical limit of their ability to make complex AI chips, the next-generation machines - called High-NA EUV tools - are key for the AI industry to improve chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and help chipmakers deliver their AI chip roadmaps on time to meet surging demand.</p><p>\n              The new tools cost roughly $400 million, twice the cost of the original EUV machines.</p><p>\n              The High-NA EUV tools now experience limited downtime, have produced 500,000 dinner-plate-sized silicon wafers and can draw sufficiently precise patterns that make up the circuits on the chip, the ASML data shows, Pieters said. In combination, the three data points indicate the tools are ready for manufacturers.</p><p>\n              \"I think that it's at a critical point to look at the amount of learning cycles that have happened,\" he said, referring to the number of tests that have been conducted on the machines by customers.</p><p>\n              Despite their technical readiness, it will take two to three years for companies to conduct enough testing and development to integrate them into manufacturing.</p><p>\n              \"(Chipmakers) have all the knowledge to qualify these tools,\" Pieters said.</p><p>\n              Pieters also said the company has achieved roughly 80% uptime at the moment and plans to achieve 90% by the end of the year. The imaging data ASML plans to release is enough to convince customers to replace multiple steps with the older-generation tools with a single High-NA step, Pieters said. The 500,000 wafers the machines have processed have allowed the company to work out many of the kinks.</p><p></p><p>(Reporting by Max A.

            "title": "Johnson & Johnson Announces Preliminary Results From Phase 1b Study Of Pasritamig In Combination With Docetaxel In Advanced Prostate Cancer",
            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson announced preliminary results from a Phase 1b study evaluating pasritamig (JNJ-78278343), a first-in-class bispecific T-cell engaging antibody, in combination with docetaxel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The combination demonstrated a safety profile consistent with docetaxel alone, with no new or unexpected safety signals observed. The regimen also showed clinically meaningful efficacy, including high rates of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses and sustained PSA reductions, supporting continued development and advancement into Phase 3 studies.</p><p>Pasritamig is designed to engage the immune system through a novel mechanism of action, binding CD3 on T cells and human kallikrein 2 (KLK2). KLK2 is a novel, highly specific prostate cancer target with minimal expression outside prostate tissue. By both activating and directing T cells to KLK2-expressing tumor cells, pasritamig enables targeted immune engagement.</p><!-- Article --><p>This differentiated, prostate-specific approach was intentionally built to focus immune activity on prostate cancer cells, which may help limit effects on healthy tissue, and supports administration in a doctor's office rather than hospital setting. In the study, pasritamig was evaluated in combination with docetaxel in an outpatient setting in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer whose disease had progressed following androgen receptor pathway inhibitor therapy. Approximately half of the patients (45%) had received at least one prior taxane-based regimen.</p><p>The primary endpoint was safety and identification of the recommended regimen for further development in Phase 2/3 studies, with secondary and exploratory endpoints assessing clinical activity, including PSA response rates. As of December 9, 2025, 51 patients had received pasritamig plus docetaxel, including patients who were pretreated with a median of three prior therapies (range, 1-9). Reductions of 50% or greater in PSA levels were achieved in 64.7% of patients overall and in 75.0% of taxane-naïve patients.</p><p>Reductions of 90% or greater in PSA levels were achieved in 39.2% of patients overall and 53.6% of taxane-naïve patients. Among taxane-naïve patients with bone-only disease, confirmed PSA reductions of 50% or greater and 90% or greater were observed in 88.2% and 76.5% of patients, respectively. Patients were able to continue pasritamig beyond docetaxel discontinuation.</p><p>Those patients received a median of six docetaxel doses every three weeks and eight pasritamig doses every six weeks, supporting the potential for sustained disease control over time. The safety profile of pasritamig plus docetaxel was consistent with the known safety profile of docetaxel in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurring in at least 20% of patients included fatigue (60.8%), alopecia (41.2%), diarrhea and nausea (31.4% each), peripheral edema (27.5%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (25.5%) and dysgeusia (23.5%).</p><p>Pasritamig-related adverse events occurring in at least 10% of patients were fatigue (33.3%) and non-chronic diarrhea (11.8%). Grade 3 or higher TRAEs attributed to docetaxel were observed in 29.4% of patients, compared with only two percent attributed to pasritamig. No patients experienced cytokine release syndrome of any grade or treatment-related deaths.</p><p>Two ongoing Phase 3 studies are evaluating pasritamig in the metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer setting. KLK2-comPAS (NCT07164443) is evaluating pasritamig as monotherapy, and KLK2-PASenger (NCT07225946) is evaluating pasritamig in combination with docetaxel. Beyond these Phase 3 studies, pasritamig is also being evaluated in earlier-phase combination studies.</p><p>Pasritamig monotherapy has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation in China and Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, supporting its continued clinical development. The Phase 1b study (NCT05818683) is an open-label trial evaluating the safety and clinical activity of pasritamig in combination with docetaxel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) whose disease has progressed following treatment with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor. The primary objective is to determine the recommended regimen for further development based on safety, with secondary and exploratory endpoints assessing clinical activity.</p><p>Pasritamig was administered intravenously every six weeks, with initial step-up doses given during the first treatment cycle, in combination with docetaxel administered intravenously every three weeks. Treatment was delivered in an outpatient setting. Corticosteroids were used only as standard premedication for docetaxel, and hematopoietic growth factor support was permitted as needed.</p><p>Pasritamig (JNJ-78278343) is an investigational T-cell-redirecting bispecific antibody (bsAb) targeting human kallikrein 2 (KLK2) on prostate cancer cells and CD3 receptor complexes on T cells, leveraging the body's immune system to selectively target and eliminate cancer cells. This innovative approach is being evaluated in pretreated patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), a patient population with limited treatment options.</p></div>",

But the 9th Circuit said Trump would have taken the same action whether or not he intended to punish unions. </p><p>\n              Trump's order \"expresses that the President's primary - if not only - concern with union activity was its interference with national security,\" Circuit Judge Daniel Bress, a Trump appointee, wrote for the court. </p><p>\n              Eliminating collective bargaining would allow agencies to alter working conditions and fire or discipline workers more easily, and it could prevent unions from challenging Trump administration initiatives in court.</p><p>\n              The panel reversed a ruling issued last year by U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco that had temporarily blocked Trump's order. The 9th Circuit had paused Donato's ruling in August pending the outcome of the appeal. A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., had in May paused a similar ruling that had also blocked Trump's order.</p><p>\n              The White House and the unions involved in the case did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>\n              Trump's order exempted more than a dozen federal agencies from obligations to bargain with unions. They include the Departments of Justice, State, Defense, Treasury, and Health and Human Services.</p><p>\n              Trump's executive order exempted agencies that he said \"have as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work\" from collective bargaining obligations, significantly expanding an existing exception for workers with duties implicating national security.</p><p></p><p>(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; editing by David Gaffen)</p><p>\n            By Daniel Wiessner</p></div>",
