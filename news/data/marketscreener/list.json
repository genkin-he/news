Viehbacher praised \"another strong financial performance driven by the commercial momentum of our newly launched products, the resilience of our MS franchise and our disciplined cost management.\"<br/><br/>Biogen revised its 2025 adjusted EPS forecast to between $14.50 and $15.00, down from a previous range of $15.50 to $16.00.<br/><br/>This revision includes a positive effect of $0.25 related to the improvement in the underlying business, offset by an expected negative impact of approximately $1.25 in Q4 related to IPR&amp;D expenses from external growth operations.<br/><br/>The 2025 revenue forecast has been raised: the group now expects stable growth of +1% at constant exchange rates, compared with a previous estimate of stability.<br/><br/>The stock is down just under 2% in pre-market trading in New York. <br/><br/><br/></p></div>",
