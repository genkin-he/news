            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Megumi Fujikawa </p><br/><p>\n  TOKYO--The Japanese economy is showing some signs of improvement, a slew of data indicated Friday, amid heightened speculation over the timing of the Bank of Japan's next interest-rate hike. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  Evidence of economic resilience could firm expectations that the central bank will resume monetary tightening soon, though it has only one more opportunity to do so this year. </p><p>\n\n  The latest inflation print for the Tokyo metropolitan area--considered an early indicator of nationwide trends--showed that a key gauge of price growth remained above the BOJ's target. </p><p>\n\n  Core consumer inflation, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, climbed 2.8% in October from a year earlier as the effects of water bill subsidies rolled out in the Tokyo area faded, government data showed. </p><p>\n\n  That was faster than September's 2.5% rise and the 2.6% increase expected in a poll of economists by data provider Quick. </p><p>\n\n  Seasonal factors may have influenced the print. October marks the start of the second half of the fiscal year, a period often conducive to price revisions, said Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute's Yoshiki Shinke. </p><p>\n\n  Prices for many items went up during the month, showing that \"firms' willingness to raise prices remains strong,\" the economist said. The Tokyo figures showed that food prices, excluding fresh items, rose 1.1% from the previous month. </p><p>\n\n  The pickup in inflation is in line with the BOJ's forecasts as it continues to gauge when to resume monetary tightening. </p><p>\n\n  The central bank on Thursday left its policy rate unchanged at 0.5% amid uncertainty about the impact of U.S. tariffs and domestic political shifts. It expects core consumer prices to rise 2.7% in the year ending March 2026. </p><p>\n\n  Despite persistent inflation, consumer appetite recovered in September, according to separate government figures released Friday. Retail sales rose 0.5% from a year earlier, following a 0.9% fall in August. </p><p>\n\n  Another set of figures signaled resilience in the industrial sector. Industrial production rose 2.2% in September from the previous month, compared with the 1.5% drop in August and economists' forecast for a 1.6% rise. </p><p>\n\n  The activity prints suggest that third-quarter growth data, which is due Nov. 17, may show a milder-than-anticipated contraction, said Marcel Thieliant, head of Asia-Pacific at Capital Economics. </p><p>\n\n  \"The economy should return to growth this quarter,\" he said. </p><p>\n\n  Though economists think the next BOJ rate hike is a matter of when, not if, some see it as difficult for the central bank to take action before next year, in part because new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi prefers an accommodative monetary policy. Her cabinet is compiling an economic stimulus package that could have implications for monetary policymaking. </p><p>\n\n  Given the current economic situation, the BOJ's decision to stand pat was \"extremely reasonable,\" Japan's finance minister, Satsuki Katayama, said in a local media interview on Thursday. She added that it is much trickier in Japan to revive consumer sentiment than in the U.S., which has massive purchasing power. </p><p>\n\n  The yen weakened to an eight-month low against the dollar this week, and remained soft as BOJ Gov. Kazuo Ueda reiterated his wait-and-see stance on Thursday. </p><p>\n\n  The central bank governor wants to see more positive economic data, including on wage growth, before raising rates again. </p><p>\n\n  The yen reached around 154.15 Friday morning in Tokyo. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-30-25 2318ET</p></div>",
