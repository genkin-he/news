Conversely, Gardasil/Gardasil 9 declined 24% to $1.75bn, penalized by lower demand in China.<br/><br/>Adjusted gross margin improved to 81.9% from 80.5% a year earlier, while adjusted R&amp;D expenses decreased 32% to $4bn.<br/><br/>\"We continue to generate value through our innovative portfolio of medicines and vaccines, while securing our future with targeted investments in our pipeline,\" said Robert M. Davis, Merck's chairman and CEO.<br/><br/>Building on this momentum, the group has raised and tightened its adjusted EPS forecast for FY 2025, now expected to be between $8.93 and $8.98 (up from $8.87 to $8.97 previously). Annual sales are anticipated to be between $64.5bn and $65.0bn, a slightly higher range despite an estimated negative currency impact of 0.5%.<br/><br/>Despite these positive results, the stock is down over 3% in pre-market trading in New York.</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Elena Vardon and Tracy Qu </p><br/><p>\n  Shares in Societe Generale traded lower after the French lender reigned in expectations about a further share buyback despite posting a rise in third-quarter profit. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  Chief Executive Slawomir Krupa has been restructuring the bank in the past two years by selling assets that aren't part of its core business to simplify operations, strengthen its balance sheet and build a strong capital buffer. </p><p>\n\n  The quarterly print is further proof that turnaround efforts are paying off but since hopes of increased shareholder returns have underpinned a doubling in the value of its shares this year, the update was met with disappointment when the group held off on announcing another program. </p><p>\n\n  The stock initially gained in early European exchanges on what analysts described as another solid quarter of progress but reversed course to shed as much as 5% by midday on Thursday. </p><p>\n\n  Societe Generale had said it would consider paying out any excess capital above its target to shareholders and recently completed the 1 billion buyback it announced in late July. At the end of the third quarter, its common equity tangible 1 ratio--which measures capital strength--stood at 13.7%, above the 13.0% level at which it said it would consider distributions. </p><p>\n\n  \"The fact that SG did not announce a share buyback program with 3Q results might disappoint some but as the CET 1 ratio continued to increase plus SG reiterated its capital target, this might only be a timing factor,\" RBC Capital Markets a wrote in a note to clients. Jefferies analysts also pointed to an absence of news on distributions, adding that \"banks with meaningful excess capital ought to be buying their shares back at a 20% discount to tangible book.\" </p><p>\n\n  For the three month period, the French lender reported an 11% rise in net profit to 1.52 billion euros ($1.76 billion). This beat expectations of a 1.305 billion-euro result taken from a Visible Alpha poll due to lighter costs and provisions for bad loans. The group said it isn't exposed to recent high-profile bankruptcies in the U.S. and has negligible exposure to the country's regional banks. </p><p>\n\n  Net banking income--its top-line metric--fell 2.7% to 6.655 billion euros due to recent disposals but still beat consensus' 6.41 billion-euro estimate. Excluding these asset sales, income rose 3.8% led by growth in its French retail, private banking and insurance division, while its investment bank posted a mixed performance and revenue from its division housing international retail and mobility and financial services contracted. </p><p>\n\n  \"There is still a lot to do to get where we want to be, but real tangible results have pointed us in the right direction,\" Krupa said. The bank is on track to surpass its annual targets, he added. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Elena Vardon at Elena.Vardon@wsj.com and Tracy Qu at tracy.qu@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-30-25 0816ET</p></div>",

There isn't much variance relative to market expectations across the divisions, with upstream coming in ahead of consensus, and downstream divisions slightly below, the analysts say. Underlying cash flow from operations was slightly lower than consensus provided by Visible Alpha, the analysts say. On a stated basis--which excludes leases and hybrids--the company reported a fall in net debt to $24.6 billion from $25.9 billion, they say. Looking forward, the key for the French energy major will be to derisk the $2 billion planned divestments, which look to be across a number of assets, RBC adds.

The 7% beat to net earnings consensus was driven by the upstream and the integrated gas divisions, while cash flow generation was supported by higher volumes and an improved performance in its integrated gas division, they add.

The rise in gold has outpaced equities and bonds, it notes, adding that steepening yield curves, fiscal uncertainty, and risks to Fed independence might continue to support gold buying by central banks and retail investors. Further support for gold prices could also come from falling real interest rates amid slowing growth and Fed rate cuts, and weakening of the U.S. dollar after the recent consolidation, it says. It maintains a positive stance on gold, and raises its 12-month target to $4,600 an ounce. Spot gold is last at $3,969/oz, according to LSEG data.
