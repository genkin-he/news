Ermotti will remain Group CEO until at least early 2027,\" a UBS spokesperson said when asked by Reuters about the NZZ report, adding that it was \"premature to speculate about the timing of Sergio stepping down\". </p><p>\n              \"When the time comes to decide on a successor, the Board will be able to draw on a strong bench of internal candidates, but will of course fulfill its fiduciary duty by also evaluating external candidates,\" the spokesperson added.</p><p><b>MEASURES TO PREVENT FINANCIAL CRISES</b></p><p>\n              In June, the Swiss government proposed measures aimed at preventing future banking crises following the 2023 collapse of Credit Suisse. The plans could require UBS to hold up to $24 billion in additional capital.</p><p>\n              Other proposals include that UBS can no longer count software and deferred tax assets towards its Common Equity Tier 1 capital, whiles its foreign units must be fully backed with CET1 capital.</p><p>\n              UBS has rejected the proposals, arguing they would make Switzerland less competitive.</p><p>\n              NZZ said the bank was looking at different potential outcomes of that discussion, and that it might determine whether the bank remains based in Switzerland or moves its headquarters abroad.</p><p>\n              \"We will do everything we can to ensure that UBS can continue to operate successfully as a global bank from Switzerland. Nevertheless, the Board of Directors is obliged to prepare for all scenarios,\" the spokesperson said.    </p><p></p><p> (Reporting by Francois Murphy, Editing by Louise Heavens)</p></div>",
