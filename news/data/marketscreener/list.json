            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Matt Grossman </p><br/><p>\n  Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan pushed back on the Federal Reserve's quarter-point interest-rate cut this week, arguing that the risk of a slowing job market didn't justify swerving away from the task of corralling inflation. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  Speaking at a conference in Dallas Friday morning, Logan observed that weaker job creation hasn't led to a drastic rise in the unemployment rate, partly because the pool of people looking for work has ebbed. Meanwhile, she said, she isn't convinced inflation is on a firm track back toward the Fed's 2% target. </p><p>\n\n  That combination suggests the Fed should be more reluctant to cut rates to support the labor market with rate cuts, which weaken the Fed's anti-inflation stance, Logan said. </p><p>\n\n  Logan hasn't been a member of the Fed's policy committee this year, under the system that rotates votes annually among the Fed's 12 reserve-bank presidents. But she made it clear that if she had gotten a vote this week, she would have dissented against the Fed's cut. </p><p>\n\n  \"I would have preferred to hold interest rates steady,\" Logan said, according to a published version of her remarks. She said later in the speech that she is also skeptical that a further cut in December will be the right move. </p><p>\n\n  The Fed's decision to cut rates by a quarter point to a range of 3.75% to 4% at a second straight meeting was contentious, with two voters dissenting. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid took the same view as Logan, arguing the Fed should have kept rates still. Fed governor Stephen Miran dissented in the other direction, backing a half-point rate cut. </p><p>\n\n  In a press conference after the vote, Chair Jerome Powell said that another cut in December--something that many traders had been counting on--was far from a foregone conclusion. His comments likely reflected a base of skepticism about further cuts among the Fed's policy committee as the group met over two days this week. </p><p>\n\n  Logan acknowledged that the labor market has weakened, but said that future policy choices could respond quickly if the situation worsens further. \"These are all risks the FOMC will be able to closely monitor and address promptly if there is evidence they are becoming more likely to materialize,\" she said, referring to the Fed's policy committee by its acronym. </p><p>\n\n  On the other hand, she expressed impatience with persistent inflation, noting that prices already rose nearly at the Fed's annual target rate between January and August alone. Inflation is \" still not convincingly headed all the way back to 2 percent,\" she said. She added that the Fed's 2% inflation target is a \"serious commitment.\" </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-31-25 0944ET</p></div>",
