However, he noted that it remains unclear whether this is the case and to what extent. Chief Financial Officer Dirk Elvermann pointed out that the direct impact of the tariffs on the group has been \"relatively minor.\" The reason, he explained, is the strong local business, with 80 to 90 percent of products sold in the US also being manufactured there.\n              \n<p>The US Supreme Court last week overturned tariff regulations issued by US President Donald Trump. The court's decision concerned IEEPA tariffs, which Trump had imposed based on an emergency law. These tariffs are estimated to have generated more than $175 billion.</p><p></p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n              \n(Reporting by Patricia Weiß, edited by Ralf Banser.

He was released on bail six months later, after which he resigned as chief minister.</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party had dismissed the allegations as \"a desperate attempt to malign his image\" ahead of national and Delhi elections.</p><p>\n              The AAP lost the Delhi election in February 2025, handing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party controls of the national capital territory for the first time in 27 years. Kejriwal, 58, had earlier won three straight elections in Delhi. </p><p>\n              \"We have always said the truth prevails,\" Kejriwal told reporters outside the Rouse Avenue district court, with tears in his eyes. \"They slapped a false case on us but the court said that we are fiercely honest.\"</p><p>\n              The CBI said it planned to appeal the ruling, stating that \"several aspects of investigation have either been ignored or not considered adequately.\" The Enforcement Directorate, which is separately examining the case, had also been pursuing charges against Kejriwal.</p><p>\n              The CBI alleges that the liquor policy implemented by Kejriwal's government gave unfair advantages to private retailers. Kejriwal and his colleagues have denied the charges.</p><p>\n              The court order also exonerated 22 other individuals, including Kejriwal's former deputy Manish Sisodia, said lawyer Sumer Singh Boparai, who represented one of the accused.
