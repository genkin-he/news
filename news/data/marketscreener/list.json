            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text article-text--clear\"><p>CCS is redefining its role as a nationwide digital infrastructure enabler, strengthening its position within China’s rapidly evolving ICT landscape amid shifting telecom investment cycles and intensifying demands for intelligent, low-carbon, and resilient network solutions. As operators moderate capex, CCS continues to broaden its strategic focus into digital infrastructure, AI-enabled services, and smart-city ecosystems, areas now central to China’s next phase of economic modernization.</p><p>\nCCS is undergoing a pivotal transformation as it balances its legacy identity as a telecom construction and maintenance specialist with the industry’s shift toward cloud-network integration, smart operations, and computing-power infrastructure. As a key pillar in China’s digital-economy buildout, CCS remains deeply linked to national informatization priorities, working closely with government bodies, state-owned enterprises, and major telecom operators to support projects spanning broadband expansion, data-center development, emergency-management systems, and digital-government platforms.</p><!-- Article --><p>\nCCS’s business model is anchored in three complementary revenue pillars: Telecommunications Infrastructure Services (TIS), Business Process Outsourcing (BPO), and Applications, Content &amp; Other (ACO) services. This diversified structure provides resilience amid fluctuating operator investment cycles while enabling CCS to scale higher-value digital solutions such as system integration, software development, cloud-network engineering, and AI-driven smart-operations platforms.</p><p>\nPositioning itself as a “New Generation Integrated Smart Service Provider,” CCS is deepening investments in technological innovation, cultivating capabilities in computing-power networks, low-carbon energy systems, and advanced digital-operations technologies. Its strategic trajectory aligns closely with China’s long-term initiatives, including East-to-West computing, smart-city modernization, and carbon-reduction infrastructure, supported by a disciplined governance framework and a commitment to steady, high-quality growth.</p><h2>\nSteady growth</h2><p>\nCCS delivered steady revenue growth in H1 25, generating RMB 76.9bn, a 3.4% y/y increase, supported by the expansion of digital infrastructure, AI-enabled services, and rising demand from non-operator and overseas markets. All three core segments—TIS, BPO, and ACO—grew during the period, with ACO leading at 11.7% growth, driven by smart-city development, green-energy initiatives, and broader digital-transformation projects.</p><p>\nProfitability remained stable, with net profit reaching RMB 2.1bn, a 0.2% y/y increase, while operating profit rose 8.4%, reflecting improved execution despite continued margin pressure from labor intensity and project-delivery costs. Gross profit and margins softened slightly due to the higher share of construction-related work but remained within a resilient operating range.</p><p>\nOperational momentum was supported by strong performance across strategic emerging businesses, with digital infrastructure, green and low-carbon solutions, AI-centric offerings, and smart-city services contributing over 40% of new contracts. CCS also strengthened its revenue mix, as domestic non-operator and overseas markets collectively exceeded 50% of total revenue for the first time, underscoring successful diversification and growing international demand across Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa.</p><h2>\nAttractive yields</h2><p>\nCCS shares have declined roughly 13.3% over the past year, reducing the group’s market capitalization to about HKD 26.9bn (USD 3.9bn). At present, the stock trades on an FY 26 P/E multiple of 7.1x, well above its five-year average of 6.6x.</p><p>\nAnalyst sentiment remains broadly constructive. The consensus target price of CNY 4.6 suggests potential upside of around 19.3% from current trading levels, while the most optimistic forecast of CNY 5.0 with upside of nearly 29.9%. Among the six analysts covering the stock, three maintain a “Buy” rating, reflecting continued confidence in CCS’s medium-term growth outlook.</p><p>\nIn FY 24, CCS paid a dividend of CNY 0.22 per share, delivering a yield of approximately 5.1%. Looking ahead, forecasts indicate an average dividend yield of about 5.9% over the coming three fiscal years.</p><h2>\nRisk metrics</h2><p>\nCCS drives growth through expanding digital infrastructure, AI enabled services, smart city solutions, diversified revenue streams, and strengthening non operator and overseas markets to reinforce its position as an integrated smart service provider.</p><p>\nCCS faces key risks including margin pressure from labor-intensive delivery, rising project-execution costs, and softer demand from domestic telecom operators amid reduced capex. Exposure to higher working-capital needs and negative free cash flow adds financial strain, while overseas expansion brings FX volatility and operational-model risks. In addition, reliance on large-scale digital-infrastructure, smart-city, and green-energy projects introduces execution and governance challenges that may influence profitability, resilience, and long-term strategic delivery.</p></div>",

Momentum has continued this year, with companies in various sectors lining up to go public. </p><p>\n\n  Sunway Healthcare's offering looks set to draw healthy demand. It has secured 20 cornerstone investors, including AHAM Asset Management, AIA, Eastspring Investments and JPMorgan Asset Management (Singapore), which have agreed to subscribe to 97.5% of the allocated shares. </p><p>\n\n  For the company, the IPO is a way to fuel its bid to establish a presence in Southeast Asia, executive chairman Jeffrey Cheah said at a press conference on Friday. </p><p>\n\n  Sunway Healthcare has been expanding its footprint across Malaysia and expects to grow its bed capacity to 3,400 by 2032. It currently has 1,805 licensed beds, said the company's president, Lau Beng Long. </p><p>\n\n  Shares of Sunway Healthcare are set to begin trading on Malaysia's main bourse on March 18. </p><p>\n\n  Maybank Investment Bank and AmInvestment Bank are advising on the offering. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Ying Xian Wong at yingxian.wong@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-27-26 0118ET</p></div>",
