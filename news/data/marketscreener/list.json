FDI flows fell in both 2023 and 2024. </p><p>\n\n  \"The global investment climate will remain challenging through the rest of 2025,\" the UN said. \"Geopolitical tensions, regional conflicts, economic fragmentation and efforts to de-risk supply chains continue to weigh on flows.\" </p><p>\n\n  Over recent years, businesses have become more wary of relying on production facilities that are far from their home bases and vulnerable to transport logjams, or in countries that could be subjected to higher tariffs or considered a threat to national security. </p><p>\n\n  Unctad said advanced economies as a whole were worst hit by the decline in FDI flows, as the value of cross-border mergers and acquisitions fell 18% to $173 billion. </p><p>\n\n  While developing countries as a whole did better, there was wide regional variation, with foreign investment in Africa down 42%. A sustained decline in overseas investment could remove or narrow a path that allowed previously poor countries such as China to raise their standards of living. </p><p>\n\n  In addition to providing good jobs, foreign investment by businesses in developing economies has helped spread new technologies and more efficient work and management practices. </p><p>\n\n  However, Unctad said the U.S. had benefited from a high level of new projects in sectors related to AI, with $103 billion invested in semiconductors and $27 billion in data centers. That accounted for more than half the $237 billion in \"greenfield\" projects during the first half, four times the average for any six-month period during the previous decade. </p><p>\n\n  The global economy has held up better than expected in the face of the big increases in tariffs that have been announced by President Trump. </p><p>\n\n  That's partly because most countries that have been subjected to higher duties have chosen not to retaliate, while businesses have found ways to soften the impact of higher duties. A boom in AI-related investment has also helped. </p><p>\n\n  However, the drop off in foreign investment, if it is not compensated for by a rise in investment within national borders, points to a weakening of the medium-term growth outlook. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-31-25 1209ET</p></div>",

            "title": "Significant Drop in Electricity Grid Fees Expected for 2026",
            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n    BERLIN (dpa-AFX) - Many electricity customers can expect relief from grid fees in 2026. This is indicated by a sample survey conducted by the Federal Network Agency among 28 distribution network operators. According to the results, grid fees for household customers will decrease nationwide by an average of 17.2 percent, or around 2 euro cents per kilowatt-hour, compared to the previous year. The relief for commercial and industrial customers is expected to be even greater, the Federal Network Agency stated upon request. The \"Welt\" newspaper had previously reported on this. However, as \"Spiegel\" also notes, there are significant regional differences.\n</p><p>\n\nFederal Subsidy</p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n\n    The federal government is planning a subsidy of 6.5 billion euros to help finance the costs of transmission networks. The corresponding legislative amendment is still undergoing parliamentary review. According to the ministry, electricity customers will also benefit from similar relief totaling 6.5 billion euros in subsequent years. This is to be achieved through grid fees and possibly also partially through other levies, which would likewise lower electricity prices.\n</p><p>\n\n\n    Grid fees are a component of the electricity price. These fees, which help finance the costly expansion of electricity networks, have risen significantly. The subsidy for transmission network costs is intended to ease the financial burden on electricity customers connected to downstream distribution networks.\n</p><p>\n\n\n    The power grid is divided into the transmission network--large overhead lines for long-distance electricity transport--and distribution networks for regional distribution. Private households are supplied through these distribution networks. Grid fees account for about a quarter of the electricity bill for private households.\n</p><p>\n\nRegional Differences</p><p>\n\n\n    Regional grid fees vary significantly from one area to another. According to energy supplier EnBW, this is due in part to different cost structures and the varying age of infrastructure. Older network infrastructure incurs higher maintenance and repair costs, which affects grid fees. Additionally, the expansion of renewable energy sources also influences grid fees, due to the costs associated with integrating renewables into the networks.\n</p><p>\n\n\n    According to the Federal Network Agency, the relief provided by the subsidy will not be \"visible\" in all network areas. The final grid fees will be published on January 1, 2026.\n</p><p>\n\n\n    According to \"Welt,\" regions most affected by the expansion of the transmission network will benefit disproportionately from the reduction in grid fees. This includes, above all, the eastern German federal states, Baden-Württemberg, and the southern part of Rhineland-Palatinate. The smallest price reductions are expected in North Rhine-Westphalia.\n</p><p>\n\n\n    As \"Spiegel\" reports, citing an analysis by service provider Enet and electricity supplier Rabot Energy, large parts of eastern Germany and Bavaria will see significant benefits, while the effect may largely fizzle out in many other regions./hoe/DP/nas\n</p></div>",
