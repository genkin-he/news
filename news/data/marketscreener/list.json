Momentum has continued this year, with companies in various sectors lining up to go public. </p><p>\n\n  Sunway Healthcare's offering looks set to draw healthy demand. It has secured 20 cornerstone investors, including AHAM Asset Management, AIA, Eastspring Investments and JPMorgan Asset Management (Singapore), which have agreed to subscribe to 97.5% of the allocated shares. </p><p>\n\n  For the company, the IPO is a way to fuel its bid to establish a presence in Southeast Asia, executive chairman Jeffrey Cheah said at a press conference on Friday. </p><p>\n\n  Sunway Healthcare has been expanding its footprint across Malaysia and expects to grow its bed capacity to 3,400 by 2032. It currently has 1,805 licensed beds, said the company's president, Lau Beng Long. </p><p>\n\n  Shares of Sunway Healthcare are set to begin trading on Malaysia's main bourse on March 18. </p><p>\n\n  Maybank Investment Bank and AmInvestment Bank are advising on the offering. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Ying Xian Wong at yingxian.wong@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-27-26 0118ET</p></div>",
