            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Megumi Fujikawa </p><br/><p>\n  TOKYO--Inflation in Japan's capital cooled below the central bank's 2% target for the first time in over a year, but the slowdown is unlikely to derail further interest rate hikes. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  While the headline figure eased, underlying price pressures in Tokyo--considered a leading indicator of nationwide trends--remain firm, with the bulk of the slowdown due to the impact of government subsidies, Friday's data showed. </p><p>\n\n  Excluding fresh food, consumer prices in the Tokyo metropolitan area rose 1.8% in February from a year earlier, compared with the 2.0% increase seen in January. The deceleration was driven largely by a 9.2% plunge in energy prices after the government rolled out subsidies to help households cope with rising living costs. </p><p>\n\n  That marked the first time the Tokyo gauge has fallen below the Bank of Japan's 2% target since October 2024, but the print likely won't shift expectations on monetary policy. </p><p>\n\n  The central bank has been maintaining a cautious but positive stance on further interest-rate hikes following a round of tightening that brought the policy rate to 0.75% in December. </p><p>\n\n  Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute economist Takuya Hoshino said the Tokyo data was \"broadly firm,\" pointing out that service prices, which have a strong correlation with wage growth, rose 1.5%, up slightly from January. </p><p>\n\n  A core measure of inflation which strips out volatile fresh food and energy prices also edged up to 2.5% in February. </p><p>\n\n  While consumer inflation excluding fresh food continued to slow, \"the results are unlikely to deter the BOJ from raising interest rates further,\" he said. </p><p>\n\n  Capital Economics economist Marcel Thieliant agreed, saying that the slew of economic indicators, including inflation figures, released Friday \"suggest that the BOJ won't wait much longer before hiking rates again.\" </p><p>\n\n  Markets are currently pricing in a nearly 60% chance of a rate hike in April, according to data from money market broker Tokyo Tanshi. Traders and BOJ officials are closely monitoring how Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's planned sales tax cut will affect price trends. </p><p>\n\n  Separate government data on Friday meanwhile signaled that consumption remains solid, with retail sales rising 1.8% in January from a year earlier. Industrial production rose 2.2% on the month in January on the back of front-loaded demand ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays, a sharp reversal from December's 0.1% decrease. </p><p>\n\n  Still, there is continued uncertainty around the outlook for Japanese manufacturers. If weakness in the sector drags on broader economic growth, that could dent the case for rate hikes. </p><p>\n\n  While the U.S. Supreme Court recently struck down so-called reciprocal tariffs, Japanese officials have warned that automobile levies continue to weigh on the industry and said they will continue monitoring the impact of President Trump's new tariffs. </p><p>\n\n  Policymakers say the nation's corporate sector remains resilient despite the headwinds posed by U.S. trade policy, but Friday's data showed factory activity is expected to weaken again in the coming months. </p><p>\n\n  Norinchukin Research Institute economist Takeshi Minami said increasing tensions between Japan and China could weigh on production down the road. Earlier this week, China said that it will ban the export of items that have potential military applications, targeting a list of Japanese companies. </p><p>\n\n  Diplomatic tensions between the two countries have intensified following Takaichi's remarks last year suggesting Japan's potential involvement in any conflict over Taiwan. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-26-26 2159ET</p></div>",

This year, the focus has shifted towards which central banks will lead in terms of hiking rates.\"</p><p>\n              The Australian dollar, which was steady at $0.7106 on Friday, was on track for a monthly gain of roughly 2%.</p><p>\n              Up more than 6% for the year thus far, the Antipodean currency is the best-performing G10 currency to date, as a domestic economy in rude health continues to fuel expectations for a more hawkish Reserve Bank of Australia.</p><p>\n              \"It is conceivable that the Aussie dollar can put on one or two more (U.S.) cents from here,\" said Carol Kong, a currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.</p><p>\n              \"We are still of the view that there will be just one more 25-basis-point rate hike from the RBA this year.\"</p><p>\n              Also on the hiking path is the Bank of Japan, though that has done little to help the yen as domestic politics complicates the rate outlook, even as BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda signalled openness to a near-term hike.</p><p>\n              While the yen was up 0.2% at 155.78 in Asia, it has fallen 0.4% for the week and 0.6% for the month thus far.</p><p>\n              This week, Japan's government nominated two academics seen by markets as strong advocates of economic stimulus to join the BOJ's board. The surprise move sends a not-so-subtle message about Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's distaste for higher interest rates, casting doubt on how much further policy can be tightened.</p><p>\n              \"Ueda flagging a possible March/April hike did little to support the yen because the guidance remains conditional on incoming data, and the political optics around appointments make markets question the pace and conviction of policy normalisation,\" said Saxo's chief investment strategist Charu Chanana.</p><p><b>ASSESSING THE RATE OUTLOOKS</b></p><p>\n              Sterling was steady at $1.3484, set to snap three straight months of gains with a 1.5% fall in February.</p><p>\n              The British pound has been undermined by a dovish tilt from the Bank of England, with traders now pricing in an 83% chance of a rate cut in March.</p><p>\n              Elsewhere, the dollar was set to gain 0.6% for the month, helped by a slightly more hawkish Federal Reserve after \"several\" policymakers signalled at January's policy meeting their openness to rate hikes if inflation remains elevated.</p><p>\n              Nonetheless, investors continue to price in two more Fed cuts this year.</p><p>\n              \"I think because there's still lingering concerns about what the Fed would be like under new Fed Chair Kevin Warsh,\" said OCBC's Sim.</p><p>\n              The U.S. Supreme Court's decision to strike down Trump's tariffs also reinforced checks and balances on presidential power, which provided some support to the dollar, said analysts.</p><p>\n              \"It suggests that the long-term prospects for the U.S. dollar might not be as grim as previously imagined,\" said Macquarie Group's FX and rates strategist Gareth Berry.    </p><p>\n              Moves in the euro were more muted, with the common currency little changed at $1.1796 on Friday and headed for a monthly loss of just over 0.4%.</p><p>\n              Expectations are for the European Central Bank to keep rates steady for months to come.</p><p>\n              In China, the country's central bank said on Friday it will scrap foreign exchange risk reserves for some forwards contracts, a move that would reduce the cost of dollar buying.</p><p>\n              The decision comes after the yuan climbed 4.4% against the dollar in 2025, its biggest annual gain since 2020, with the upward momentum continuing into the new year.</p><p>\n              The offshore yuan was last down 0.2% at 6.8585 per dollar, ahead of the onshore trade open.</p><p></p><p> (Reporting by Rae Wee; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)</p><p>\n            By Rae Wee</p></div>",
