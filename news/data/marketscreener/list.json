            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Robb M. Stewart </p><br/><p>\n  Royal Bank of Canada's earnings rose in the first quarter as the lender saw growth in its retail banking business and capital markets operations. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  The bank, the country's biggest by market value and one of the largest in North America by assets, joined its peers in Canada in turning in a stronger-than-expected profit with gains across most business segments. This came despite elevated loan-loss provisions and continued economic uncertainty with trade tensions still high globally. </p><p>\n\n  Royal Bank's net income rose to 5.79 billion Canadian dollars (US$4.23 billion), or C$4.03 a share, for the three months to Jan. 31, from C$5.13 billion, or C$3.54, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, adjusted per-share earnings rose to C$4.08 in the first quarter, topping the C$3.85 expected by analysts polled by FactSet. </p><p>\n\n  Total revenue rose 7.3% to C$17.96 billion, while analysts were expecting C$17.5 billion. The result was buoyed by record capital markets revenue for the quarter, asset growth in its wealth management arm, and revenue growth of 9% for personal banking and roughly 4% for commercial banking. </p><p>\n\n  The Toronto-based lender's return on equity, a measure of profitability closely watched by analysts, expanded by 0.8 percentage point on last year to 17.6%. </p><p>\n\n  Household spending in Canada has remained relatively resilient despite an elevated unemployment rate and the hit to parts of the economy from the Trump administration's approach to trade policy and use of tariffs. Still, the housing market has softened in recent months and economists have warned of possible stresses on households as homeowners renew mortgages at higher interest rates. Business spending also has been relatively subdued, particularly in industries exposed to the shift toward protectionist trade policies by the U.S., even as equity markets in both Canada and the U.S. notched record highs. </p><p>\n\n  Royal Bank in a letter to shareholders said it expects economic growth to remain positive across most advanced economies despite trade uncertainties. Canada's economy has shown signs of improvement in recent months and the jobless rate has edged lower, and the bank forecasts modest growth in the first half of the year after what was likely a flat final quarter of 2025. </p><p>\n\n  The bank, like many of its peers, projects the Bank of Canada will leave its policy interest rate steady through 2026 and it isn't anticipating tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Canadian goods to rise further, though the existing trade pact between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico is up for renegotiation this year. That backdrop, executives said, is expected to mean mortgage growth in Canada is modest this year given affordability challenges, economic uncertainty, and a pullback Canadian immigration. </p><p>\n\n  Royal Bank's allowance for credit losses on performing loans was steady on the prior quarter, but the allowance on performing loans was increased. </p><p>\n\n  Its provision for credit losses increased C$40 million year-over-year to C$1.09 billion, and was C$83 million higher than a quarter earlier. The result was above the C$1.06 billion analysts were looking for the bank to set aside against the risk of loan losses. </p><p>\n\n  Stephen Boland, an analyst at Raymond James in Toronto, said it was a solid quarter for Royal Bank that was again supported by markets-facing operations. He said there was a notable rise in gross impaired loans for the three months after trending lower in recent quarters, but said it wasn't overly concerning. Gross impaired loans as a percentage of loans and acceptances widened to 0.86% in the latest quarter, from 0.8% a quarter earlier and 0.78% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. </p><p>\n\n  The bank's shares fell in early trading, underperforming the broader market in Canada, declining 1.9% to narrow the gain over the last three months to just over 8%. </p><p>\n\n  Like each of Canada's other big banks, Royal Bank sits on a strong capital position that has allowed it to continue buying back shares and a quarter earlier supported a lift in its dividend. </p><p>\n\n  Royal Bank's common equity Tier 1 ratio stood at 13.7% at the end of January, up 0.5 percentage point from the same quarter last year. That remains well above the at least 11.5% of risk-weighted assets that Canada's banking regulator requires from the big lenders. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Robb M.
