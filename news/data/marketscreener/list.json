With Zepto's recent mobilisation of funds reigniting competition in the sector, Swiggy is also evaluating a separate capital raise for its 10-minute delivery unit Instamart, which was recently moved under a standalone subsidiary. While discussions with potential investors are still at an early stage, the size of the proposed Swiggy QIP, currently at $1,000 million, could go up to as high as $1,500 million, said another person aware of the fundraising.</p><p>If the placement goes through, Swiggy will be able to increase its domestic shareholding as it considers transitioning to an inventory-led model. Another person familiar with the plans said the Bengaluru-based company is also open to raising capital independently for its quick commerce business, which now operates as a step-down subsidiary. Swiggy did not respond to detailed queries sent by ET until the publication of this report.</p></div>",
