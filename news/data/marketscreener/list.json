Freight revenue rose to C$3.99 billion from C$3.92 billion. </p><p>\n\n  CN Rail operates a nearly 20,000-mile rail network and related transportation services, connecting Canada's eastern and western coasts with the U.S. Midwest and the U.S. Gulf Coast. </p><p>\n\n  On the operations side, gross ton miles increased 1% to 111.9 billion and revenue ton miles also rose 1% to 57.19 billion. GTM represents the total weight of a train multiplied by the distance traveled in miles, while RTM, a financial metric, is the weight of revenue-generating freight multiplied by the distance. </p><p>\n\n  Operating ratio, which measures efficiency, was 61.4%, down by 170 basis points from a year earlier. In this metric, a lower ratio indicates better profitability. </p><p>\n\n  For the year, Montreal-based CN Rail said it would keep its guidance unchanged, calling for mid- to high-single-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth. It also said it continues to invest net of about C$3.35 billion in its capital program. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Adriano Marchese at adriano.marchese@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-31-25 0820ET</p></div>",
