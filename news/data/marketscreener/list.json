According to Nakanishi, volumes of reverse imports are likely to be small, possibly around 20,000 cars a year. </p><p>\n              Japan exported just short of 1.4 million motor vehicles to the U.S. last year, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association.</p><p>\n              Arguably, the industry's biggest economic impact in the U.S. can't be gleaned from the trade figures. </p><p>\n              Japanese automakers have spent decades and billions of dollars to build up local operations in the U.S., moves that were prompted by trade friction that was particularly potent in the 1980s.</p><p>\n              Japan's auto industry produced 3.3 million vehicles in the U.S. last year, according to the manufacturers' association. </p><p><b>GOVERNMENT HELP NEEDED</b></p><p>\n              Reverse imports may not happen as soon as Trump or Takaichi might like. Variations in things like safety standards between the two countries meant there were necessary differences in the cars, Sato said.</p><p>\n              \"We can't just import those vehicles into Japan 'as-is',\" he said. Harmonising those standards would be necessary, and would need government help, he said.</p><p>\n              Nissan's Cartier pointed to the differences in customer needs between the two countries, given that cars produced in the U.S. are usually intended for the local market.</p><p>\n              Japanese drivers don't necessarily want the larger-style cars sold in the U.S., he said.</p><p>\n              Another hurdle: steering wheels are on the right side in Japan, and the left side in the U.S. </p><p>\n              While the overall impact might be small in terms of trade, Nakanishi said he believed the symbolism was more important.</p><p>\n              \"The symbolic significance of making the effort is huge. And that builds trust with the Trump administration. So my understanding is that this is less about business and more about maintaining and improving the relations.\" </p><p></p><p>(Reporting by Daniel Leussink, Aditi Shah and Maki Shiraki; Writing by David Dolan; Editing by Jan Harvey)</p><p>\n            By Daniel Leussink, Aditi Shah and Maki Shiraki</p></div>",

The company is doubling down on fossil fuels in a strategy revamp, aiming to grow its global upstream production output to up to 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2030, from just over 2.3 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2024. </p><p>\n\n  BP said Thursday that early analysis of the site was extremely encouraging and indicates a very large hydrocarbon column. Crucially, it said it believes that the carbon dioxide in the reservoir can be managed. </p><p>\n\n  Planning appraisals are progressing and BP expects well activities to start in early 2027. BP said it has a team accelerating work on potential development concepts, including working on plans for an early production system. </p><p>\n\n  The discovery was first announced in August but the lack of details on its size and composition made it challenging for analysts the value the find. </p><p>\n\n  BP has a 100% interest in the block. In August, it said it was on \"very good commercial terms\" with Brazil's Pre-Sal Petroleo as the production sharing manager. </p><p>\n\n  In midday trade, BP shares traded up 0.5% at 44.4 pence. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Adam Whittaker at adam.whittaker@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-30-25 0748ET</p></div>",
