            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>Feb 26 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration on Thursday moved to scrap a rule long opposed by business groups for making it harder to classify workers as independent contractors rather than employees, who can cost a company more.</p><p>\n              The U.S. Department of Labor released a proposal to repeal the 2024 rule, which it said was legally flawed and had deprived many workers of the flexibility that comes with independent contracting.</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              The rule, which the department stopped enforcing after Trump took office last year, requires a company to treat workers as employees under federal wage law when they are \"economically dependent\" on the company for work. The proposal would replace the rule with a standard favored by business groups that focuses on how much control companies have over workers. </p><p><b>TRUCKING, RETAIL SALES AMONG INDUSTRIES TO BENEFIT</b></p><p>\n              Getting rid of it will be a boon to companies in a range of industries, including trucking, healthcare, retail sales and app-based transportation and delivery services such as Uber and Instacart, which rely heavily on contractors and have been accused in scores of lawsuits of misclassifying workers to save money. </p><p>\n              Employees can cost businesses up to 30% more, according to several surveys, because they are entitled to the minimum wage, overtime pay, unemployment insurance, reimbursements for expenses and other protections not afforded to contractors.</p><p>\n              Worker classification has been one of the most contentious employment-related issues over the last decade, and trade groups lobbied heavily to repeal the 2024 rule after an effort by Republicans in Congress to block it stalled. </p><p>\n              The rule had replaced a regulation adopted during Trump's first term that said workers who own their own businesses or have the ability to work for competing companies, such as a driver who works for Uber and Lyft, can be treated as contractors. The proposal announced on Thursday would largely revive that standard.</p><p>\n              The proposal will be formally published on Friday, kicking off a 60-day period for public comment. </p><p>\n              The Biden-era rule had been expected to trigger a flood of new lawsuits alleging that workers had been misclassified as independent contractors. But that litigation never materialized, likely due to the limited amount of time the rule was in effect before the Labor Department last year signaled that it would be repealed. </p><p>\n              The rule was challenged in at least five lawsuits by freelance workers, employers and business groups, and those cases have either been dismissed or paused pending further rulemaking by the department. </p><p>\n              A Trump-appointed judge in New Mexico upheld the rule last year, rejecting a trucking company's claims that the Labor Department had exceeded its powers and improperly tried to rewrite federal law. The company's appeal has been put on hold and will likely be dismissed once the rule is repealed. </p><p></p><p>(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi, Rod Nickel)</p><p>\n            By Daniel Wiessner</p></div>",

Oracle Red Bull Racing will continue to rely on OCI, Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications, and Oracle AI to maintain its competitive edge through four key initiatives: AI-Powered Strategy Agent: Oracle and Oracle Red Bull Racing will work together to implement a new AI-powered strategy agent, marking a major step forward in how race engineers process information and make decisions; Developed with Oracle's comprehensive AI stack and designed to work alongside human engineers, the AI agent will automate data collection, interpret historical and real-time race inputs, and surface insights to help engineers respond more quickly to changing conditions.</p><!-- Article --><p>Next-Generation Hybrid Power Unit: The debut of Red Bull Ford Powertrains' next-generation hybrid engine, engineered with and tested extensively on OCI, marks a defining milestone. As a newcomer, building a power unit from the ground up in four years, competing against manufacturers with decades of engine experience, represents a significant technical achievement; The Team relied on OCI's high-performance computing, bare metal infrastructure, and large-scale simulation capabilities to design, validate, and refine its power unit in record time; Oracle has supported the program from inception and will continue to run updates and integration work through the season on OCI. Advanced Race Simulations: The 2026 regulations demand far more sophisticated modeling, and OCI enables the Team to run deeper, more granular simulations tailored to the new strategic landscape.</p><p>These next-generation models?far richer and more varied than in previous seasons?account for energy usage, active aero configurations, deployment windows, tire interactions, and thousands of potential race scenarios: This expanded simulation capability equips both drivers and strategists with clearer, data-driven guidance on how to optimize strategy decisions throughout a race weekend: As F1 leans more heavily on advanced modeling and simulation, OCI delivers the scale and speed Oracle Red Bull Racing requires to test, learn, and adapt faster than the competition. Operational Excellence: With Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications, Oracle Red Bull Racing will be able to leverage the latest AI capabilities embedded in the suite to increase efficiency, improve decision making, and maintain a competitive edge: The Team will use Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications for finance, HR, and marketing to optimize planning and budgeting, simplify payroll, improve the employee experience, as well as deepen fan engagement through personalized content, members-only rewards, and an innovative fan loyalty program.

The Taliban says women's rights are internal matters and should be addressed locally.</p><p>\n              Turk said the killing of 13 civilians in recent Pakistani airstrikes highlights the need for urgent political dialogue over further escalation.</p><p>\n              \"I am very concerned by a sharp increase in civilian casualties in cross-border clashes with Pakistani military forces,\" he said.</p><p>\n              Pakistan has said it launched airstrikes inside Afghanistan targeting militant safe havens, an allegation Kabul has repeatedly denied. The Taliban authorities condemned the strikes as a violation of Afghanistan's sovereignty and said they would respond at what they described as an appropriate time.</p><p></p><p> (Additional reporting and writing by Mohammad Yunus Yawar; editing by Ariba Shahid and Philippa Fletcher)</p><p>\n            By Emma Farge</p></div>",

            "title": "What is Trump's plan to boost retirement savings?",
            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>Feb 26 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday used his State of the Union address to announce a program that could help tens of millions of Americans save for retirement, giving those without access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan a vehicle to do so.</p><p>\n              Here's what we know about the plan - which matches worker contributions by up to $1,000 annually - the problem it's designed to address and the questions it raises: </p><!-- Article --><p><b>DOES AMERICA HAVE A RETIREMENT PROBLEM? </b></p><p>\n              Half of American workers aged between 21 and 64 have $955 or less saved for retirement, according to a report from the National Institute on Retirement Security. </p><p>\n              Of those with access to an employer-provided retirement, such as a 401(k), half have less than $40,000 saved. That is a fraction of what they will need, experts suggest. Respondents to a 2025 survey by asset manager BlackRock said they would need $2 million to retire comfortably. \"Almost no one is close,\" CEO Larry Fink wrote in his annual letter to investors. </p><p>\n              Even investors close to retirement fall well short: the survey found that 62% of Gen X investors, whose ages range from 46 to 61, have saved less than $150,000.</p><p>\n              Younger workers may defer paying into a retirement fund because of student loan repayments or to save for a down payment on a home. But because contributions made early on can grow tax-free for longer, any delay can be very costly for younger Americans trying to build a nest egg.  </p><p><b>HOW MANY AMERICANS COULD BENEFIT? </b></p><p>\n              Nearly 54 million American workers have no access to any employer-provided retirement plan, research from the Economic Innovation Group shows. Some 63 million people do not have access to an employer match, a feature that financial advisors repeatedly describe as the \"only free lunch in investing\" and key to reaching retirement savings goals over time.</p><p>\n              IS THIS THE FIRST TIME THAT A US PRESIDENT HAS TACKLED THE RETIREMENT CRISIS IN A STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS?</p><p>\n              In 2014, former President Barack Obama announced the creation of MyRA, retirement  accounts overseen by the Treasury Department, into which savers could deposit after-tax funds and that featured principal protection. For myriad reasons, these didn't catch on and the first Trump administration killed the program in 2017. Under revisions to retirement plans signed into law by former President Joe Biden in 2022, low- to moderate-income households starting next January will qualify for a government match for 50% of their retirement savings contributions, up to $1,000 annually.  </p><p><b>WHAT'S THIS NEW PLAN, EXACTLY?</b></p><p>\n              As outlined by Trump, the program would have two parts. Workers who don't already  have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan would get access to a program like the Thrift Savings Plan, available to federal workers currently. The government would match employee contributions to both these plans and existing employer plans with no match, up to $1,000 annually. Congressional action would be needed to expand the size of the match. The plans would offer investors an array of low-cost index funds from which to choose, making them more appealing than MyRA accounts, says Craig Bolanos, co-founder of VestGen Wealth Partners. </p><p><b>WHY NOT SHORE UP SOCIAL SECURITY? </b></p><p>\n              The average American depends on the government's Social Security program for the majority of income during retirement. But the program is not on a sustainable trajectory, projections show. Reserves that help cover the program's outlays are projected to run out by 2033, with ongoing payroll taxes expected to cover less than 80% of the current rate of benefits. Filling the gap could mean some combination of increasing the age at which beneficiaries become eligible, reducing benefits, or confining benefit payouts to lower-income Americans, all of which politically are non-starters. And as BlackRock's Fink has noted, Social Security is a safety net, not a recipe for financial security.</p><p><b>WHAT ARE THE HURDLES?</b></p><p>\n              The plan is light on details. The administration will need to build public awareness. The State of the Union announcement may help, financial advisors say, but also make it easy for people to act. Research has shown that the simpler it is for investors to save, or even automatic, the more likely they are to do so. Moreover, even if uptake is strong, there is no guarantee that lower-income Americans faced with other affordability challenges will be willing or able to contribute. \"Most of them are not flexible with their cash flow to even consider putting money aside,\" says Green Bee Advisory's Catherine Valega. </p><p>\n              There are also questions about the cost to the government, already running a substantial budget deficit, and whether there could be more efficient means - perhaps by bolstering an existing program like Social Security - to improve Americans' retirement security.</p><p>\n              But some welcome the initiative. Michael Lofley, a financial advisor at HBKS in Florida, said that one of his clients, a small business owner who already offers a 401(k) plan to his 10 employees, is considering adding these, and the related \"Trump accounts\" for his employees' children, as part of the suite of benefits he offers.    </p><p></p><p>(Reporting by Ann Saphir and Suzanne McGee; additional reporting by Steve Holland and Andy Sullivan in Washington; Editing by Sharon Singleton)</p><p>\n            By Suzanne McGee and Ann Saphir</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>SAN JOSE, California, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence chip designer Broadcom said that it expects to sell at least 1 million chips by 2027 based on its stacked design tech, an executive told Reuters on Wednesday.</p><p>\n              The forecast, which Reuters is the first to report, marks a new product and sales target for Broadcom that could represent a revenue stream potentially worth billions of dollars.</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              Harish Bharadwaj, vice president of product marketing, said the 1 million chips the company projects it will sell are based on an approach Broadcom developed that stacks two chips on top of one another, allowing the distinct pieces of silicon to be tightly bound to improve the speed at which data can flow from one chip to another.</p><p>\n              The company has refined the technology over five years to the point where its first customer, Fujitsu, is making engineering samples to test the design. Fujitsu plans to produce the stacked, or 3D, chips later this year. </p><p>\n              The million-chip figure includes several additional designs beyond the Fujitsu chip.</p><p>\n              The company's stacking approach gives its customers the ability to build chips that have more horsepower and use less energy to tackle the rapidly growing computing requirements AI software presents, Bharadwaj said. </p><p>\n              \"Now, pretty much all of our customers are adopting this technology,\" he said.</p><p>\n              Broadcom does not typically design entire AI chips itself. It works with companies such as Google for its tensor processing units (TPUs) and ChatGPT maker OpenAI for its in-house custom processors. The Broadcom engineers help translate an early design into the physical layout of a chip that can be fabricated by manufacturers such as TSMC.</p><p>\n              The company's chip business has grown significantly because of the custom deals with companies such as Google. Broadcom projected that its AI chip revenue would double year-over-year to $8.2 billion in its first fiscal quarter. </p><p>\n              As a result, Broadcom has emerged as one of the most significant competitors to Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, as it races to produce silicon that competes with the chip giants.</p><p>\n              Fujitsu is using the new tech for a data center chip. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is fabricating the chip using its cutting-edge 2-nanometer process and fusing it with a 5-nanometer chip.</p><p>\n              Companies can mix and match which manufacturing process TSMC uses with the Broadcom technology. TSMC fuses the top and bottom chip during the fabrication process. </p><p>\n              Broadcom has several more designs in the works and expects to ship two more products based on the stacking tech in the second half of this year and to sample an additional three in 2027.</p><p>\n              The company spent roughly five years developing the groundwork for the stacked chip tech and testing various designs to come up with a commercial product. Engineers are working to make chips that have as many as eight stacks of two chips each.</p><p></p><p> (Reporting by Max A.

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>Feb 26 (Reuters) - Warner Bros Discovery, at the center of a high-stakes bidding war, reported a 6% drop in quarterly revenue, hurt by declines for its traditional TV and film businesses though its HBO Max streaming service gained subscribers with buzzy series like \"Heated Rivalry\".</p><p>\n              The company in its earnings statement on Thursday did not address its discussions with Paramount Skydance , whose latest offer threatens to upend an existing deal with Netflix. Paramount enticed Warner Bros' board back to the bargaining table last week by raising the possibility of an improved cash offer.</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              Warner Bros' overall revenue came in at nearly $9.5 billion, in line with an LSEG consensus estimate.</p><p>\n              On the bright side, HBO Max continued to grow, helped by series like \"Heated Rivalry\" and \"It: Welcome to Derry\". </p><p>\n              Warner Bros added 3.5 million streaming subscribers in the quarter, bringing its total number worldwide to 131.6 million.</p><p>\n              The streaming group's revenue rose 5% to nearly $2.8 billion, but adjusted earnings fell 4% to $393 million due to the end of an unspecified distribution deal.</p><p>\n              Warner Bros' traditional businesses, however, were hurting, with adjusted income for its film and TV studio group tumbling 23% to $728 million.</p><p>\n              The film studio, which released nine movies that opened at the top of the box office in 2025, had no major theatrical releases in the holiday quarter. The television studio, meanwhile, was hit by the timing of content renewals with its revenue sliding 18%.</p><p>\n              Warner Bros' television network group, Discovery Linear Networks, saw a continued erosion of its business amid an industry-wide loss of pay TV subscribers.</p><p>\n              The television unit's revenue fell to $4.2 billion, down 12% from a year earlier, and adjusted income dropped to $1.4 billion, a 27% plunge from the same quarter a year earlier.</p><p>\n              Investor attention is likely to be focused on any clues that may be gained about the deal discussions.</p><p>\n              Warner Bros' board has said it has not determined whether the revised Paramount proposal is superior to the merger with Netflix, but that directors will engage further. Should a superior deal emerge, Netflix has four business days to revise its offer.</p><p></p><p> (Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles and Harshita Mary Varghese in Bengaluru; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)</p></div>",
