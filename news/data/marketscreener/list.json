Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal were expecting a 0.3% increase. </p><p>\n\n  Over the 12 months through January, wholesale prices were up 2.9%. </p><p>\n\n  PPI inflation reflects the prices that businesses receive for their goods and services, including in business-to-business transactions, but without retailers' markups or distribution costs. These figures are more volatile than the widely tracked consumer-price index, which reflects the prices shoppers see at businesses and online. </p><p>\n\n  Wall Street analysts watch the producer-price index closely, however, because some of its price data are blended with CPI figures and import prices to calculate the personal-consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric. </p><p>\n\n  Analysts can therefore use Friday's numbers to refine their forecasts for the January PCE inflation report, due on March 13.

The source said further talks between the government and Leonardo were likely in the coming days.</p><p>\n              A spokesperson for Leonardo declined to comment.</p><p>\n              A ministry spokesperson said: \"The UK's New Medium Helicopter programme is ongoing and no final procurement decisions have yet been made. That outcome will be confirmed in due course,\" a MoD spokesperson said. </p><p>\n              Sky News said defence minister John Healey had been due to visit the factory in Yeovil on Thursday to announce the deal but pulled out because the finance ministry had yet to sign it off.</p><p>\n              The government has previously said it needs to finalise its defence investment plan before it can award the helicopter contract. </p><p>\n              That plan has been delayed from the autumn amid media speculation about a 28 billion pound ($38 billion) hole in the military budget, despite Prime Minister Keir Starmer's pledges to boost defence spending. </p><p>\n              The Yeovil facility dates back to 1915, when it was known as Westland and made planes used in World War One. It pivoted to helicopters in the 1950s and has recently produced the Merlin and Apache helicopters.</p><p>\n              As well as the 3,000 jobs on site, a further 9,000 jobs in the supply chain are supported by the factory.</p><p>\n              ($1 = 0.7422 pounds)</p><p></p><p> (Reporting by Sarah Young and Giulia Segreti; Editing by Kevin Liffey)</p></div>",
