That is better than the 393,000 additions analysts had been looking for, according to FactSet. Xfinity Mobile's revenue rose 14% year-over-year, to $1.25 billion. </p><p>\n\n  The company meanwhile lost 257,000 domestic video customers as viewers continue to cut the cord on cable TV. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast that it would shed 310,000 video customers. Revenue for the cable business was down 5%, at $6.59 billion. </p><p>\n\n  Comcast also lost 104,000 broadband customers in the U.S., once again bucking the expectations of analysts who had been expecting 143,000 broadband customers to exit. Domestic broadband revenue was up slightly, at $6.43 billion. </p><p>\n\n  In total, the company lost 210,000 customer relationships, or 1.4% from a year earlier, while the average total revenue it brings in per customer relationship was up slightly. </p><p>\n\n  Peacock, the streaming app of Comcast's NBCUniversal, saw revenue decline about 10%, to $1.36 billion, from the same quarter last year, which included the Olympics. Peacock's tally of paid subscribers was up 14% from year-ago, at 41 million, and roughly flat compared with the June quarter. </p><p>\n\n  Revenue from the company's Universal Studios theme parks was up 18.7%, at $2.72 billion, while revenue from its studios was up 6.1%, at $3 billion. </p><p>\n\n  In total, revenue ticked down 2.7%, to $31.2 billion, ahead of analyst projections for a steeper drop to $30.7 billion, according to FactSet. </p><p>\n\n  Comcast posted a quarterly profit of $3.33 billion, or 90 cents a share, compared with $3.63 billion, or 94 cents a share, in the same quarter a year earlier. </p><p>\n\n  Stripping out one-time items, adjusted earnings were $1.12 a share, two cents ahead of the consensus estimate of analysts polled by FactSet. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-30-25 0715ET</p></div>",
