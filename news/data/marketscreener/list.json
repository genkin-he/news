But the 9th Circuit said Trump would have taken the same action whether or not he intended to punish unions. </p><p>\n              Trump's order \"expresses that the President's primary - if not only - concern with union activity was its interference with national security,\" Circuit Judge Daniel Bress, a Trump appointee, wrote for the court. </p><p>\n              Eliminating collective bargaining would allow agencies to alter working conditions and fire or discipline workers more easily, and it could prevent unions from challenging Trump administration initiatives in court.</p><p>\n              The panel reversed a ruling issued last year by U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco that had temporarily blocked Trump's order. The 9th Circuit had paused Donato's ruling in August pending the outcome of the appeal. A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., had in May paused a similar ruling that had also blocked Trump's order.</p><p>\n              The White House and the unions involved in the case did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>\n              Trump's order exempted more than a dozen federal agencies from obligations to bargain with unions.

Netflix had earlier this month granted Warner Bros a seven-day waiver to seek a \"best and final offer\" from Paramount for the company.</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              Pursuant to the terms of the Netflix merger agreement, this notice initiates a four-business-day period during which Netflix may propose revisions to the agreement, Warner Bros said.</p><p>\n              Shares of Paramount Skydance were up more than 1.5% in extended trading.</p><p>\n              Netflix, which is looking to buy Warner Bros' streaming and studio businesses, agreed in December to pay $27.75 a share, saying the offer, along with a planned spinoff of Warner Bros' cable assets, would deliver a greater shareholder value.</p><p>\n              The bid partly depends on the debt level of those assets, which would be separately listed as Discovery Global, as well as the company's equity value once it starts trading. </p><p>\n              Estimates of Discovery Global's value vary greatly. Warner Bros said it could fetch between $1.33 and $6.86 a share, but Paramount said it is almost worthless.</p><p>\n              MoffettNathanson analysts had said a Paramount bid of $34 a share would have ended debate about Discovery Global's value. </p><p>\n              In its revised bid, Paramount raised the termination fee it would pay should the deal fail to gain regulatory approval, to $7 billion from $5.8 billion. </p><p><b>NETFLIX'S FINANCIAL MUSCLE </b></p><p>\n              With about $9.03 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of December, the creator of \"Stranger Things\" has ample financial muscle to raise its offer.</p><p>\n              Either deal will reshape the power structure of Hollywood by handing the suitor one of the industry's most-coveted studios and an extensive content library, as well as lucrative entertainment franchises such as \"Game of Thrones\" and DC Comics.</p><p>\n              Paramount has argued it has a clearer path to U.S. regulatory approval than Netflix and had indicated that if Warner Bros rejects the new bid, it would be ready to launch a board challenge at this year's annual meeting.</p><p>\n              One of Paramount's director candidates could be a big shareholder in Warner Bros, hedge fund Pentwater Capital Management CEO Matthew Halbower said.</p><p>\n              Activist investor Ancora Holdings, which owns a small stake in Warner Bros, has also stepped up pressure on the HBO owner by saying the company did not adequately engage with Paramount.</p><p>\n              Warner Bros has previously said its board has a track record of acting in the best interests of the company and shareholders.</p><p>\n               (Reporting by Aditya Soni and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)</p></div>",
