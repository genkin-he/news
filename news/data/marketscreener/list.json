            "title": "Canada's Economy Contracts in Fourth Quarter, Capping a Soft Year -- 2nd Update",
            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Robb M. Stewart </p><br/><p>\n  OTTAWA--Canada's economy shrank as it closed out 2025, yet still managed to show resilience against the U.S. administration's protectionist shift. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  Gross domestic product declined at an annualized rate of 0.6% in the October-to-December period to 2.502 trillion Canadian dollars, the equivalent of US$1.829 trillion, Statistics Canada said Friday. </p><p>\n\n  The contraction was slightly steeper than the 0.2% economists expected following a recovery in the prior quarter. But the weakness was largely thanks to a big withdrawal from business inventories that offset growth in exports, and increases in both household and government spending. </p><p>\n\n  Industry-level activity strengthened in the final month of the year, though advance data indicates a shaky start to this year and no growth as activity was likely held back by snowstorms and severe cold temperatures. </p><p>\n\n  Canada was broadsided last year by President Trump's tariffs, particularly the country's trade exposed industries and sectors singled out by the White House's sectoral levies on steel, aluminum, lumber and other goods that enter the U.S. in large volumes. </p><p>\n\n  Over 2025, Canadian real GDP grew 1.7%, the slowest pace since a drop in 2020 during the global pandemic, largely due to a decline in exports to the U.S. </p><p>\n\n  Yet data for the final quarter of last year highlights continued strength at home and a recovery in exports, helped by efforts to direct shipments to markets beyond the U.S. </p><p>\n\n  Final domestic demand, a gauge of spending by all sectors of the economy, grew 2.4% on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter after falling 0.5% the previous quarter. Household spending rose 0.4% on a nonannualized basis after weakening slightly in the prior quarter, leaving household consumption for the year up 2.3% and in line with the 2.2% pace in each of the previous two years. </p><p>\n\n  Added to that was a second consecutive quarter of increased government spending and a massive increase in defense spending. Investment by Canadian businesses dipped slightly for the quarter, though there was a sharp increase in spending on machinery and equipment, primarily computers. Overall, capital investment was up in 2025 with the jump in spending on weapons systems and a slight increase in residential construction. </p><p>\n\n  The relatively positive composition of GDP data for the quarter is expected to allow the Bank of Canada to remain on the sidelines after keeping its policy interest rate steady twice in a row, economists said. That is despite the central bank projecting a flat fourth quarter, and the possibility the first quarter of 2026 will undershoot the 1.8% growth it most recently forecast. </p><p>\n\n  Dominique Lapointe, director of macroeconomic strategy at Manulife Investment Management, said that while the fourth quarter surprised to the downside there was a revision to the contraction seen in the second quarter to just 0.9% annualized from a prior estimate of 1.8%. \"From the Bank of Canada's perspective, this leaves the output gap largely unchanged, albeit negative, and doesn't open the door to additional rate cuts,\" he said. </p><p>\n\n  The biggest drag on GDP came from the drawdown in inventories, </p><p>\n\n  an often volatile metric, after businesses boosted stocks the previous two quarters. For the year, non-farm inventories fell for the first year since 2020, even as farm stocks rose for the first time in three years with strong crop production. </p><p>\n\n  The country's exports, meanwhile, were up 1.5% for the final quarter, driven by shipments of unwrought gold and of aluminum. Yet despite the recovery in the second half of 2025, exports for 2025 were down 1.7% as trade with the U.S. failed to fully recover. Imports nudged up 0.3% in the final quarter, but were down 0.4% for the year after a steep decline in the third quarter. </p><p>\n\n  Prime Minister Mark Carney, elected last April as a counter to President Trump, has pledged to strengthen the resilience of Canada's economy and decouple it from a dependence on its biggest trading partner. The push includes efforts by the former central banker to bring financial relief to sectors hit hardest by tariffs while pushing for a doubling of non-U.S. exports over the next decade. There are indications these efforts are bearing fruit: the U.S. has gone from being the destination for roughly 70% of Canadian exports to about 64% at the latest count. </p><p>\n\n  Economists expect soft momentum in 2026 and the central bank has forecast growth will average about 1.1% for the year. A new federal groceries and essentials benefit is expected to offer a boost at mid-year with other fiscal measures, and the recovery in exports should support stronger growth in the second half, though that hinges on trade talks between with the U.S., said Michael Davenport, senior Canada economist at Oxford Economics. </p><p>\n\n  The national data agency said industry-level GDP in December was up 0.2% from the month before, the strongest growth since September as manufacturing increased after contracting two months running. Still, the advance estimate indicates GDP was essentially unchanged in January, as increases in mining, oil and gas extraction, and finance and insurance, were offset by renewed weakness in manufacturing and real estate weakness. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Robb M.

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Giulia Petroni </p><br/><p>\n  Here's a look at what happened in oil markets in the week of Feb. 23-27 and what the focus will be in the days to come. </p><!-- Article --><br/><p>\n  OVERVIEW: Oil prices jumped on Friday, driven by concerns over potential U.S. action against Iran after talks in Geneva ended without a breakthrough. Crude benchmarks are at their highest level in about seven months, with Brent crude above $72 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate at $66 a barrel. </p><br/><p>\n  MACRO: Markets are still betting that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates further this year, though the pace of potential cuts remains uncertain. </p><p>\n\n  The latest U.S. producer price index data showed that wholesale inflation unexpectedly accelerated in January. The PPI is closely watched because several of its components feed into the calculation of the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. </p><p>\n\n  At the same time, uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariff policy and the future of existing trade agreements following a recent Supreme Court ruling continues to weigh on market sentiment. </p><br/><p>\n  GEOPOLITICAL RISKS: The U.S. and Iran are set to resume discussions next week after the latest round of talks concluded on Thursday without reaching an agreement. Further negotiations \"at a technical level\" will take place in Vienna, Oman's Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi said in a post on X. </p><p>\n\n  Markets remain cautious, however, as any escalation in tensions could threaten energy flows, particularly after Washington increased its military presence in the Middle East. The impact of potential U.S. military action on oil prices would largely depend on whether it disrupts global supply and shipping traffic through the Strait of Hormuz. </p><br/><p>\n  SUPPLY AND DEMAND: The broader outlook remains bearish, as global oil supply is still expected to exceed demand this year. Under normal circumstances, such a surplus would put significant downward pressure on prices. Instead, crude futures have held up, supported by persistent geopolitical tensions that continue to sustain a sizeable risk premium in the market. </p><p>\n\n  At the same time, U.S. crude inventories surged by 16 million barrels last week to 435.8 million barrels--far above expectations and marking the largest weekly increase since February 2023, the EIA said. </p><br/><p>\n  NEXT WEEK: Heightened uncertainty over developments in the Middle East is expected to keep a significant risk premium embedded in oil prices, as markets weigh the possibility of supply disruption. </p><p>\n\n  \"President Trump's deadline for an agreement expires in a week at the latest,\" analysts at Commerzbank said. \"The continuing risk of a U.S. military strike is therefore likely to remain the dominant issue on the oil market, which suggests that oil prices will remain well supported.\" </p><p>\n\n  Traders are also focused on the upcoming OPEC+ meeting on Sunday for guidance on future production policy, with the group now widely expected to resume output increases, beginning with a modest 137,000 barrel-a-day rise. </p><p>\n\n  On the economic front, investors will be watching some remarks from Federal Reserve speakers, manufacturing PMI, ADP employment figures and weekly jobless claims for fresh clues on the strength of the economy and interest-rate outlook. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Giulia Petroni at giulia.petroni@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-27-26 1207ET</p></div>",
