Adjusted EBITDA was $3.377bn, up 4%, representing 39.2% of sales compared to 38.9% a year earlier.<br/><br/>\"Despite stagnant industrial activity, Linde's teams delivered solid results, with cash flow up 8% and record EPS, while maintaining margins and return on capital among the best in the industry,\" said CEO Sanjiv Lamba.<br/><br/>The company reports that it returned $1.685bn to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks during the past quarter.<br/><br/>For Q4, Linde anticipates adjusted EPS of between $4.10 and $4.20, up 3% to 6% year-on-year. For FY 2025, the company is now targeting adjusted EPS of between $16.35 and $16.45, representing expected growth of 5% to 6%, a guidance confirmed from the previous quarter.<br/><br/>Fabrice Farigoule, who covers the stock at AlphaValue, considers the results to be \"correct\" but also \"unremarkable.\" \"It's nothing to wake the markets up in the middle of the night,\" he adds.<br/><br/>Following this announcement, the stock was down about 2% in pre-market trading in New York, as noon approaches in Europe.</p></div>",

In the third quarter of last year, the company reported revenue of C$14.2 billion. </p><p>\n\n  In its U.S. refining segment, crude throughput came to 605,300 barrels a day. Upstream production reached 832,900 barrels of oil equivalent a day, up from 771,300 a day a year ago, of which about 642,800 a day were from the oil sand segment. Analysts were expecting total production of about 830,500 barrels a day. </p><p>\n\n  Cenovus Energy recently reached a deal to acquire MEG Energy in a strategic move to expand its oil sands portfolio. The agreement included the divestiture of certain assets to Strathcona Resources, which was also in the running to acquire MEG. This proposed transaction, which will finally be voted on by MEG shareholders on Nov. 7, aims to consolidate Cenovus's position in thermal oil production in the competitive landscape of Canadian oil patch. </p><p>\n\n  For the full year, Cenovus lowered its output guidance to reflect the disposal of its 50% stake in WRB Refining LP, a joint venture with Phillips 66. It now expects downstream throughput of 510,000 barrels a day to 515,000 barrels a day, which represents a decrease of 52,500 barrels a day at the midpoint. </p><p>\n\n  Downstream turnaround expenses are now pegged at of $360 million to $380 million, lowered by $65 million at the midpoint. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Adriano Marchese at adriano.marchese@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-31-25 0652ET</p></div>",
