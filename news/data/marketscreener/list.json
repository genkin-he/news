However, he noted that it remains unclear whether this is the case and to what extent. Chief Financial Officer Dirk Elvermann pointed out that the direct impact of the tariffs on the group has been \"relatively minor.\" The reason, he explained, is the strong local business, with 80 to 90 percent of products sold in the US also being manufactured there.\n              \n<p>The US Supreme Court last week overturned tariff regulations issued by US President Donald Trump. The court's decision concerned IEEPA tariffs, which Trump had imposed based on an emergency law. These tariffs are estimated to have generated more than $175 billion.</p><p></p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n              \n(Reporting by Patricia Weiß, edited by Ralf Banser.

Analysts think the developments could be positive for economies like India that faced higher levies compared to their peers. </p><p>\n\n  Deepali Bhargava, ING's regional head of research for Asia-Pacific highlighted India and China as potential beneficiaries from the ruling, as it likely means that they will face lower tariffs than before. </p><p>\n\n  \"Trump had already lowered the punitive 50% tariff on India to 18%, and the elimination of [International Emergency Economic Powers Act] surcharges takes this relief a step further,\" she wrote in a note. It could also give India a bit more leverage when finalizing the trade deal with the U.S. </p><p>\n\n  That said, uncertainty still looms large for global trade. </p><p>\n\n  \"We expect U.S. trade policy...to become increasingly complex and more targeted resulting in a patchwork of tariff measures and trade agreements,\" BNP Paribas Equity Research said, as the Trump administration seeks to use other measures to retain higher tariffs. </p><p>\n\n  Even if tariffs are reset, India's continued growth last year suggests that it can weather the storm. The country has also been striking trade deals with other partners, including the EU, giving it access to more markets on better terms. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Kimberley Kao at kimberley.kao@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-27-26 0615ET</p></div>",
