            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n     MARKET WRAPS </p><p>\n\n     Watch For: </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n     France consumer spending, CPI; Germany unemployment, CPI; trading updates for IAG, BASF, Holcim, Pearson, Flutter Entertainment, Cellnex Telecom, </p><p>\n\n     Opening Call: </p><p>\n\n     European stock futures were mixed after Asia stocks also traded mixed. U.S. Treasurys edged lower, the dollar weakened. Gold rose and oil rose. </p><p>\n\n     Equities: </p><p>\n\n     European stock futures were mixed as investors continued to digest earnings. </p><p>\n\n     Technology stocks have borne the brunt of investors' skepticism, as concerns mount about stretched valuations and AI's impact on corporate earnings. The S&amp;P 500's information-technology sector is on track for its fourth straight monthly decline, its longest losing streak since 2018, according to Dow Jones Market Data. </p><p>\n\n     \"With higher valuations, obviously there's a lot more pressure on current earnings,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management. He attributed the dynamic to investors' looking past results and toward how AI disruption could squeeze earnings in the years ahead. </p><p>\n\n     Forex: </p><p>\n\n     The U.S. dollar weakened. A U.S. tech-led risk-off mood has returned and Treasurys have regained their hedging appeal, said two FX strategists at OCBC. </p><p>\n\n     \"With inflation concerns easing, Treasuries are regaining traction as a viable hedge during risk--off episodes, reinforcing the USD's safe--haven appeal,\" they added. </p><p>\n\n     Bonds: </p><p>\n\n     U.S. Treasury yields edged lower. While economic data have been mixed, most U.S. companies have avoided widespread layoffs - keeping a \"low-hire, low-fire\" labor market in place. So long as workers have jobs, lower mortgage rates could help improve affordability issues. </p><p>\n\n     Yet fears of layoffs might still act as a counterbalance. </p><p>\n\n     Within the bond market, \"there's been an ongoing bid related to job displacements from AI, and we've seen a drop in yields over the past couple of weeks because of that,\" LPL Financial's Gillum said in a phone interview. </p><p>\n\n     Bond-market moves overnight \"seem like a continuation of that trade,\" he noted. The strategist added that traders seemed to be more focused on AI's disinflationary impacts than on the potential for elevated inflation pressures over the next few years. </p><p>\n\n     Energy: </p><p>\n\n     Oil edged higher amid expectations that the U.S.-Iran talks will continue next week. </p><p>\n\n     Although latest round of talks over Iran's nuclear program ended on Thursday without a deal, Oman's foreign minister and a U.S. official said the two sides had made progress and would likely meet again for talks. </p><p>\n\n     The Omani said negotiations at the level of technical experts will continue in Vienna next week. This has allayed worries over imminent U.S. military action, said ANZ Research analysts. </p><p>\n\n     However, it also \"leaves little time to reach a deal before President Trump's deadline of 1-6 March,\" the analysts added. </p><p>\n\n     Metals: </p><p>\n\n     Gold rose as traders digest U.S.-Iran talks held overnight. </p><p>\n\n     The latest round of talks over Iran's nuclear program ended Thursday without a deal and both sides remained far apart on key issues. </p><p>\n\n     The U.S. increased pressure by presenting tough demands and sending more jets and warships to the region. Continuing tensions in the Middle East and Eastern Europe fuel risk aversion, said FXEM's Abdelaziz Albogdady. </p><p>\n\n     This could direct investment flows toward the precious metal, he added. </p><p>\n\n     - </p><p>\n\n     Copper fell as Chinese buyers have remained on the sidelines after returning from a weeklong Lunar New Year holiday, said ANZ Research analysts. </p><p>\n\n     The build-up of copper inventories in China was also greater than usual during the holiday period, they added. This comes as stockpiles in global exchanges rose to a record high in late January, supported by changes in U.S. trade policy and mine disruptions, they said. </p><p>\n\n     TODAY'S TOP HEADLINES </p><p>\n\n     Fed's Miran Says Four Cuts Are Appropriate This Year </p><p>\n\n     Federal Reserve governor Stephen Miran said he thinks the Fed needs to cut interest rates by about a percentage point this year in a Fox Business interview Thursday. </p><p>\n\n     \"Four cuts I think are appropriate,\" he said. \"I'd rather get them sooner than later,\" he added. </p><p>\n\n     U.K. Consumer Mood Darkens Amid Lingering Cost-Of-Living Squeeze </p><p>\n\n     U.K. consumer sentiment fell unexpectedly in February as cost-of-living pressures continue to weigh on households. </p><p>\n\n     Consumer confidence fell three points to minus 19 in the month, according to research group GfK's index, published with the Nuremberg Institute for Market Decisions on Friday. </p><p>\n\n     Jack Dorsey's Block to Lay Off 40% of Its Workforce in AI Remake </p><p>\n\n     Block, the payments company founded by Jack Dorsey that includes Square and Cash App, said Thursday that it plans to lay off 40% of its workforce, or more than 4,000 employees. </p><p>\n\n     Dorsey alluded to artificial-intelligence tools as the reason for the cuts in a letter to shareholders. </p><p>\n\n     Write to singaporeeditors@dowjones.com </p><p>\n\n     Expected Major Events for Friday </p><p>\n\n     00:01/UK: Feb UK Consumer Confidence Survey </p><p>\n\n     00:01/UK: Jan UK monthly automotive manufacturing figures </p><p>\n\n     05:30/NED: Jan PPI </p><p>\n\n     06:00/FIN: 4Q GDP </p><p>\n\n     06:00/FIN: Jan Retail sales </p><p>\n\n     07:00/SWE: Jan Foreign trade </p><p>\n\n     07:00/SWE: Jan Retail sales </p><p>\n\n     07:00/NOR: Jan Retail Sales </p><p>\n\n     07:00/SWE: 4Q GDP </p><p>\n\n     07:00/DEN: Jan Unemployment </p><p>\n\n     07:00/TUR: Jan Employment / Unemployment </p><p>\n\n     07:00/GER: Jan Foreign trade price indices </p><p>\n\n     07:30/HUN: Jan Employment &amp; unemployment </p><p>\n\n     07:30/HUN: Jan PPI </p><p>\n\n     07:45/FRA: Jan PPI </p><p>\n\n     07:45/FRA: Jan Household consumption expenditure in manufactured goods </p><p>\n\n     07:45/FRA: Feb Provisional CPI </p><p>\n\n     07:45/FRA: 4Q GDP - detailed figures </p><p>\n\n     07:45/FRA: 4Q Job creation </p><p>\n\n     08:00/SPN: Feb Flash Estimate CPI </p><p>\n\n     08:00/SWI: 4Q GDP </p><p>\n\n     08:00/SWI: Feb KOF economic barometer </p><p>\n\n     08:55/GER: Feb Labour market statistics (incl unemployment) </p><p>\n\n     09:00/ITA: Dec Industrial turnover </p><p>\n\n     09:00/BUL: Jan PPI </p><p>\n\n     09:00/ICE: 4Q GDP </p><p>\n\n     09:00/GER: Feb Bavaria CPI </p><p>\n\n     09:00/GER: Feb North Rhine Westphalia CPI </p><p>\n\n     09:00/GER: Feb Saxony CPI </p><p>\n\n     09:00/GER: Feb Brandenburg CPI </p><p>\n\n     09:00/GER: Feb Hesse CPI </p><p>\n\n     09:00/GER: Feb Baden-Wuerttemberg CPI </p><p>\n\n     10:00/MLT: Jan RPI </p><p>\n\n     10:00/CRO: 4Q Flash Estimate GDP </p><p>\n\n     10:00/CRO: 4Q GDP </p><p>\n\n     10:00/BEL: 4Q Final GDP </p><p>\n\n     10:00/ITA: Jan Foreign Trade non-EU </p><p>\n\n     10:00/GRE: Jan PPI </p><p>\n\n     10:00/GRE: Dec Turnover Index in Retail Trade </p><p>\n\n     10:00/LUX: Jan PPI </p><p>\n\n     All times in GMT.

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>SEOUL, Feb 27 (Reuters) - South Korea's exports likely rose for a ninth straight month in February as a global boom in artificial intelligence investment drove a surge in chip sales, a Reuters poll showed on Friday. </p><p>\n              Exports from Asia's fourth-largest economy, a bellwether for global trade, were projected to have risen 24.0% from a year earlier, according to a median forecast of nine economists.</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              That would be weaker than the 33.8% rise in January, when exports posted their strongest increase since August 2021, but still the second fastest year-on-year growth in the current streak that started in June 2025. </p><p>\n              Data in January and February are often distorted due to timing differences in the Lunar New Year holidays, which were in February this year and January last year. There were 19 working days in February, compared with 22 in the same month a year before.</p><p>\n              Chip prices are rising more sharply than expected, while stock inventories still remain low in South Korea and Taiwan, economists noted, as they expected strong momentum in semiconductor exports. </p><p>\n              \"There is a high possibility of semiconductor export growth exceeding 100% throughout the first half,\" said Stephen Lee, an analyst at Meritz Securities in Seoul. </p><p>\n              \"Still, there is little momentum in autos and machinery, weighed by tariff effects,\" Lee added. </p><p>\n              In the first 20 days of this month, exports rose 23.5%, led by a 134.1% surge in semiconductors. Shipments to China rose 30.8%, while those to the U.S. and the European Union grew 21.9% and 11.4%, respectively. </p><p>\n              South Korean policymakers said last week they would still follow through on a trade deal reached with Washington in November, amid renewed uncertainty in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that President Donald Trump's emergency tariffs are illegal.</p><p>\n              The Bank of Korea on Thursday raised its economic growth forecast for this year to 2.0% from 1.8%, citing a chip boom in exports, as the central bank held interest rates steady and signalled policy would stay unchanged for the next six months.</p><p>\n              In February, imports likely rose 13.0% from a year earlier, after increasing 11.6% in January, the survey also showed. That would mark the strongest rise since September 2022. </p><p>\n              The median estimate for the monthly trade balance stood at a surplus of $10.0 billion, wider than $8.71 billion in the previous month. </p><p>\n              South Korea is scheduled to report trade figures for February on Sunday, March 1, at 9 a.m. (0000 GMT).</p><p>\n               (Reporting by Jihoon LeeEditing by Shri Navaratnam)</p><p>\n            By Jihoon Lee</p></div>",

This was the second time it has expanded its buyback program after initially approving 100 billion yen in November last year. </p><p>\n\n   The company now plans to repurchase up to 90 million shares by May, representing more than 1.5% of its outstanding shares. This is a substantial increase from the 55 million shares originally announced. </p><p>\n\n  Sony said it had launched the share buyback in a bid to improve capital efficiency. It added that the plan was expanded to allow more flexibility in repurchases, after considering the current pace of buybacks and stock market trends. </p><p>\n\n  The share price move may also reflect a shift in investor flows, as stocks of other gaming companies have also risen. </p><p>\n\n  \"Sony's stock increase is likely part of a broader movement to take profits on semiconductor-related stocks following Nvidia's earnings and to repurchase gaming-related stocks that had been recently sold off heavily,\" said Morningstar equity research director Kazunori Ito. </p><p>\n\n  Sony's shares, which outperformed other gaming stocks, gained even further in reaction to the share buyback expansion, he added. </p><p>\n\n  \"We are seeing rotation into laggards like...Sony that [had] been trading woefully with AI and semiconductor related names sucking in all the flows,\" with the shift expected to continue into March, said Andrew Jackson, head of Japan equity strategy at Ortus Advisors. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Jason Chau at jason.chau@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-26-26 2329ET</p></div>",

It has voting rights of 11.5% but with the option to boost that to more than 50% if Rapidus runs into any financial or operational problems. </p><p>\n\n  The initial capital injection will be deployed immediately, with an additional 150 billion yen earmarked in the upcoming budget, bringing the government's total equity commitment in Rapidus to 250 billion yen for the 2026 fiscal year. </p><p>\n\n  The move signals a shift toward a more aggressive industrial policy as Japan pushes to regain its footing in the global silicon arms race, industry analysts said. </p><p>\n\n  Japan has pinned its hopes on Rapidus, a state-backed venture established in 2022 with the mission of developing home-grown advanced chipmaking capacity. It has also been courting foreign companies, seeking to bring their expertise into the domestic ecosystem. </p><p>\n\n  Earlier this month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. finalized an agreement to produce 3-nanometer chips at its second Japanese facility in Kumamoto, an upgrade from previous plans for more mature nodes. </p><p>\n\n  That was a major leap for Japan, which doesn't yet have capacity to mass produce advanced chips essential for artificial intelligence. </p><p>\n\n  The government has been pushing to change that, backing projects like the Kumamoto expansion, which provides a high-volume manufacturing baseline for the country. Rapidus meanwhile is focused on the even more ambitious goal of making 2-nanometer logic chips. </p><p>\n\n  To further safeguard its investment in the state-backed venture, the government will hold a so-called \"golden share\" in Rapidus, granting it veto power over board decisions to protect against economic security risks and foreign influence. </p><p>\n\n  A combined $1.07 billion investment pledge in Rapidus from 32 companies reflects renewed interest from the private sector too. </p><p>\n\n  The investment pool, which includes contributions from a broad range of domestic industry leaders, surpassed the government's initial projections for private funding. </p><p>\n\n  The capital commitment \"exceeds the initial target of 130 billion yen,\" a sign that \"expectations for the project are clearly mounting\", Akazawa said. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Yang Jie at jie.yang@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-26-26 2325ET</p></div>",
