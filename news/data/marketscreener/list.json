            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>(Alliance News) - Intesa Sanpaolo received the ECB's final decision on Friday on the capital requirements to be met from January 1, 2026, following the supervisory review and evaluation process known as SREP. The institution will have to maintain a consolidated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.97%, a level that takes into account both the minimum Pillar 1 capital requirement, set at 8%, and the additional Pillar 2 requirements introduced by the ECB, which bring the additional CET1 component to 0.93%.</p><p></p><p>Additional capital buffers designed to ensure stability and resilience are added to this threshold. The Capital Conservation Buffer at 2.5%, the O-SII Buffer for systemically important institutions at 1.25%, the countercyclical capital buffer at 0.34%, and the Systemic Risk Buffer at 0.45%. </p><!-- Article --><p></p><p>Together, these requirements define the prudential framework within which the bank will have to operate in 2026, ensuring a solid capital base.</p><p></p><p>The figures updated as of September 30 confirm Intesa Sanpaolo's robustness. Net of EUR 5.3 billion in dividends accrued in the first nine months of the year and coupons on Additional Tier 1 issues for EUR 300 million, the consolidated CET1 ratio stands at 13.9%, while the Total Capital ratio reaches 19.3%. </p><p></p><p>Considering the pro forma effects, the CET1 ratio rises to 14.9% and the Total Capital ratio to 20.5%, levels significantly higher than the requirements set by the ECB.</p><p></p><p>Intesa Sanpaolo fell 1.6% to EUR5.61 per share on Friday. </p><p></p><p>By Maurizio Carta, Alliance News reporter</p><p></p><p>Comments and questions to redazione@alliancenews.com</p><p></p><p>Copyright 2025 Alliance News IS Italian Service Ltd.

According to Rich Benton, vice president of Sikorsky, this technology can transform the way the military conducts missions by reducing risks to personnel.<br/><br/>These results validate the potential of MATRIX technology to expand the use of autonomous helicopters in resupply and rescue missions in hostile environments.</p></div>",
