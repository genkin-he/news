For the year, the company now revises sales revenue of JPY 3,672.0 billion, operating income of JPY 176.0 billion, net income of JPY 189.9 billion and basic earnings per share of JPY 91.21 against sales revenue of JPY 3,740.0 billion, operating income of JPY 202.0 billion, net income of JPY 213.0 billion and basic earnings per share of JPY 101.88 as previously forecasted. The company predict that core operating income for fiscal 2025 will decrease 5.7% compared to the previous forecast to ¥250.0 billion.</p><p>Core operating income is expected to fall behind the initial forecast due mainly to a reduction in price gap and a decline in sales volume reflecting lower market prices in the MMA &amp; Derivatives segment and the Basic Materials &amp; Polymers segment, despite robust demand expected for various products in the Specialty Materials segment. Operating income, net income, and net income attributable to owners of the parent are anticipated to fall behind the initial forecast due to losses under special items, which are expected to be recorded in the second half of fiscal 2025 in tandem with structure reforms, on top of a decline in core operating income.</p></div>",

Revenue distribution: U.S., Canada, &amp; Latin America (58%), Europe, Asia, &amp; Other (30%), and RCS (12%).</p><!-- Article --><h2>\nInnovative AirTouch N30i mask</h2><p>\nResMed Inc. has cemented its reputation for innovation in medical technology by winning two prestigious 2025 Red Dot Design Awards for its AirTouch N30i nasal cradle mask, recognized in both the Innovative Products and Medical Design &amp; Healthcare categories. The AirTouch N30i, launched in October 2024, introduces ResMed's first-ever nasal cushion made from fabric fused with silicone for enhanced comfort, breathability, and therapy adherence.</p><p>\nIn clinical studies, users rated the mask a perfect 10 out of 10 for comfort features. ResMed now boasts a global portfolio of 10,000 patents and designs, underscoring its leadership in sleep and respiratory care technology.</p><h2>\nImproved cash flow</h2><p>\nResMed reported strong performance over FY 22-25, with a revenue CAGR of 12.9%, reaching 5.2 billion US dollars in FY 25, driven by robust demand for its sleep and respiratory devices and strong unit sales of masks and accessories. EBIT rose at a CAGR of 19.0% to USD 1.7bn, with margins expanding from 28.0% to 32.8%, aided by favorable product mix.</p><p>\nFCF rose significantly from USD 131m to USD 1.2bn over FY 22-25. This improvement was aided by cash from operations which rose from USD 351m to USD 1.8bn. In addition, cash and cash equivalent increased from USD 274m to USD 1.2bn. Total debt decreased from USD 918m to USD 852m. This led to improved gearing from 27.3% to 14.3%.</p><p>\nMoreover, in Q1 26, revenue and income from operations saw significant growth, with revenue increasing notably. Gross margin improved substantially, with strong EPS and CFO. Non-GAAP metrics also showed impressive gains.</p><p>\nIn comparison, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, a local peer, reported a revenue CAGR of 1.3% over FY 21-24, reaching USD 5.4bn in FY 24. However, EBIT declined at a CAGR of minus 2.3% to USD 1.5bn, with margins expanding from 30.3% in FY 21 to 27.2% in FY 24.</p><h2>\nOptimistic analyst views</h2><p>\nOver the past 12 months, the company's stock has delivered modest returns of approximately 3.8%. In comparison, Edwards Lifesciences' stock delivered higher returns of around 21.6% over the same period.</p><p>\nResMed is currently trading at a P/E of 24.0x, based on the FY 26 estimated EPS of USD 10.5, which is lower than its 3-year historical average of 30.2x and Edwards Lifesciences' P/E of 35.2x. The company is currently trading at EV/EBIT multiple of 17.6x, based on FY 26 estimated EBIT of USD 2.0bn, which is lower than its 3-year historical average of 22.5x and Edwards Lifesciences (28.0x).</p><p>\nResMed is monitored by the 18 analysts, with 11 having 'Buy' ratings and seven having 'Hold' ratings for an average target price of USD 295.8, implying 17.3% upside potential over the current market price.</p><p>\nConsensus estimates a revenue CAGR of 7.7%, reaching USD 6.4bn over FY 25-28. EBIT is estimated to rise at a CAGR of 10.3% to USD 2.4bn with margins expanding by 250bp to 36.8%. Net profit estimated at a CAGR of 9.9% to USD 1.9bn, while EPS is expected to increase to USD 12.8 in FY 28 from USD 9.5 in FY 25. Analysts estimate an EBIT CAGR of 10.8% but net profit to decline at a CAGR of minus 25.2% for Insulet Corporation.</p><p>\nOverall, ResMed demonstrates strong growth and innovation, solidifying its leadership in digital health and medical devices. Despite facing competitive pressures and market risks, its robust financial performance, impressive product portfolio, and optimistic analyst outlook suggest a promising future. Continued investment in technology and strategic management will be crucial for maintaining its market position.</p><p>\nHowever, ResMed faces risks including market normalization, supply chain challenges, and rising costs. Its narrow competitive moat requires ongoing innovation investment. Potential downturns in healthcare spending or regulatory changes could impact its strong market position and growth trajectory.</p></div>",
