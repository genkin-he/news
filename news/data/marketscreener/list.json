            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text article-text--clear\"><p>The talks between both leaders, held at a military base in Busan, a port city in the south of the country, lasted just under two hours.</p><p>\nFor Donald Trump, the meeting with Xi Jinping was the last stop (not to say the highlight) of a diplomatic tour of Asia that began last weekend. Note that the two leaders had not met since 2019. Since Donald Trump's return to the White House, they had only spoken once on the phone, on September 19. The purpose of that call was to finalize an agreement on the sale of TikTok's US operations.</p><!-- Article --><h2>\nA truce confirmed</h2><p>\nSince then, tensions had escalated with Beijing's announcement in early October of new controls on rare earth exports. Donald Trump responded by threatening to impose 100% additional tariffs from November 1.</p><p>\nFinally, the de-escalation began over the weekend during a meeting between Chinese and American negotiators in Malaysia. Since then, signs of appeasement have already been visible. For example, the Chinese company Cofco yesterday announced that it had purchased three shipments of American soybeans. This comes after China, the largest buyer of American soybeans, had not placed any orders this year.</p><p>\nToday, the Americans and Chinese agreed on a number of measures. Beijing has agreed to suspend its controls on rare earth exports announced earlier this month for one year and to resume purchases of American soybeans. Meanwhile, Washington has decided not to expand the blacklist of Chinese companies with which American groups are prohibited from doing business.</p><p>\nThe United States has also decided to reduce the tariffs imposed as part of the fight against fentanyl from 20% to 10%, with China committing to take measures to combat the export of precursors used by Mexican cartels to manufacture this synthetic drug. This brings US tariffs on Chinese products down from 57% to 47%.</p><p>\nThe final element in this phase of warming Sino-American relations is Donald Trump's announcement that he will visit China in April, before welcoming Xi Jinping to the United States.</p><h2>\nIrritants set aside</h2><p>\nWhile the Busan meeting paved the way for de-escalation, many areas of friction were left unresolved. Starting with semiconductors, on which the US has imposed export restrictions since 2022. Earlier this week, Donald Trump hinted that he might discuss Nvidia's Blackwell chips (the most advanced) with Xi Jinping. On board Air Force One after the meeting, he said that the subject had not been discussed after all.</p><p>\nOn semiconductors, the United States still seems to be wavering between two positions. On the one hand, China must be prevented from accessing advanced technologies (which can be used by the Chinese military, amongst others), as this is a matter of national security. This was the approach taken under Joe Biden.</p><p>\nOn the other hand, there is a line of thinking, particularly pushed by tech bosses (led by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang), which argues that the best way to counter China is to make it addicted to our technologies; rather than pushing China to invest in developing its own chips, we should allow exports so that American standards prevail. The Trump administration's back-and-forth on the issue shows that this debate is not completely settled.</p><p>\nDonald Trump and Xi Jinping did not dwell on international issues either. The question of China's purchases of Russian oil was not addressed, even though the US president imposed sanctions on Russian oil for the first time last week.</p><p>\nThe issue of Taiwan was also not on the agenda. At the end of September, the Wall Street Journal reported that Beijing wanted Washington to clearly oppose Taiwan's independence, whereas the official position is currently that the US \"does not support\" independence.</p><p>\nThis weekend, Secretary of State Marco Rubio closed that door by stating that the US would not conclude a trade agreement with China in exchange for concessions on Taiwan.</p></div>",

Net profit came in at $27.46bn, largely inflated by a 2024 comparison basis that was affected by an exceptional tax charge. The group anticipates between 10% and 12% revenue growth in the December quarter, driven by \"exceptional\" demand for the iPhone 17, according to Tim Cook.</p><p>\nThe commercial momentum of the new iPhone, launched at the end of September, should enable Apple to achieve record revenue of close to $137bn, exceeding consensus expectations ($132.31bn). Cook said that several models were already out of stock, including in the previous range. While iPhone sales ($49.03bn) were slightly below expectations for the past quarter, other segments posted solid performances, particularly services ($28.75bn, +15%) and Macs ($8.73bn, +13%).</p><!-- Article --><p>\nApple continues to strengthen its position in high-margin services, which are becoming its main source of profitability. At the same time, the company is accelerating its efforts in artificial intelligence: a new version of Siri integrated with Apple Intelligence is planned for 2026, with a partnership already established with OpenAI. The group is also absorbing the costs associated with customs duties without passing them on to consumers. Despite a decline in sales in China (-4%), Tim Cook expects a return to growth as early as next quarter. Apple is thus approaching the end of the year with a solid outlook, at the crossroads of product innovation and strategic diversification. This was enough to push the stock up over 4% in after-hours rading, even though it is already at historic highs.</p></div>",
