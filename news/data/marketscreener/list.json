The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said it would lower the foreign exchange risk reserves for financial institutions when purchasing foreign exchange through currency forwards to zero from 20%, starting March 2.    The move reverses the PBOC's September 2022 decision to raise the risk reserve requirements to stem the yuan's rapid losses and capital outflows.
