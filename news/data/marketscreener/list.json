Both groups have announced the creation of a runtime environment based on OpenAI's models, which will be available via Amazon Bedrock. This infrastructure is intended to enable AWS customers to design, deploy and manage applications as well as generative AI agents. <br/><br/>As part of the deal, AWS will become the exclusive third-party cloud distribution provider for OpenAI Frontier. Companies will be able to rely on Amazon's infrastructure to build and orchestrate teams of artificial intelligence agents. OpenAI and AWS are also expanding their existing multi-year agreement, increasing it from $38bn to $100bn over eight years. The extension notably aims for OpenAI to use about 2 gigawatts of Trainium capacity via AWS infrastructure, further strengthening technological integration between both partners. <br/><br/>The new agreement comes after a major Amazon investment in OpenAI during the start-up's latest fundraising round. The companies said Amazon's total $50bn commitment would first take the form of an initial $15bn investment, followed by another $35bn \"in the coming months, once certain conditions are met.\"</p></div>",
