MasOrange surpassed Telefonica as the country's largest telecom operator in terms of number of clients. </p><p>\n              Orange has enough liquidity, including the 4.4 billion euros in cash it received as part of the merger, to acquire the remaining 50% of MasOrange, a spokesperson said on Friday, adding that Orange would maintain its dividend policy. </p><p>\n              On October 14, Orange teamed up with rivals Bouygues Telecom and Iliad's Free to submit a 17 billion euro non-binding offer to buy most of Altice France's assets, valuing the company at 21 billion euros.
