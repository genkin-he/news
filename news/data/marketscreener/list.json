The watchdog has a deadline of Nov. 4 to decide whether to clear the deal after a preliminary review or deepen its scrutiny. </p><p>\n\n  \"The Commission has already spoken to the company's existing long-term customers in Europe who were unequivocal about MMG's reliability and dependability as a trusted supplier,\" MMG said. </p><p>\n\n  If an in-depth probe were initiated, MMG said it would continue to work with regulators and was confident it could fully resolve their concerns. </p><p>\n\n  Earlier this month, the companies offered concessions to the commission to get approval for the deal. In that offer, Anglo American would buy a minimum quantity of ferronickel from two of MMG's Brazilian mines equivalent to their current sales of the metal in Europe for up to 10 years. </p><p>\n\n  MMG said Thursday that the proposed remedy would create more competition between suppliers in Europe, with both MMG and Anglo American operating in the market. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Edith Hancock at edith.hancock@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-30-25 0828ET</p></div>",
