            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Giulia Petroni </p><br/><p>\n  Here's a look at what happened in oil markets in the week of Feb. 23-27 and what the focus will be in the days to come. </p><!-- Article --><br/><p>\n  OVERVIEW: Oil prices jumped on Friday, driven by concerns over potential U.S. action against Iran after talks in Geneva ended without a breakthrough. Crude benchmarks are at their highest level in about seven months, with Brent crude above $72 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate at $66 a barrel. </p><br/><p>\n  MACRO: Markets are still betting that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates further this year, though the pace of potential cuts remains uncertain. </p><p>\n\n  The latest U.S. producer price index data showed that wholesale inflation unexpectedly accelerated in January. The PPI is closely watched because several of its components feed into the calculation of the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. </p><p>\n\n  At the same time, uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariff policy and the future of existing trade agreements following a recent Supreme Court ruling continues to weigh on market sentiment. </p><br/><p>\n  GEOPOLITICAL RISKS: The U.S. and Iran are set to resume discussions next week after the latest round of talks concluded on Thursday without reaching an agreement. Further negotiations \"at a technical level\" will take place in Vienna, Oman's Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi said in a post on X. </p><p>\n\n  Markets remain cautious, however, as any escalation in tensions could threaten energy flows, particularly after Washington increased its military presence in the Middle East. The impact of potential U.S. military action on oil prices would largely depend on whether it disrupts global supply and shipping traffic through the Strait of Hormuz. </p><br/><p>\n  SUPPLY AND DEMAND: The broader outlook remains bearish, as global oil supply is still expected to exceed demand this year. Under normal circumstances, such a surplus would put significant downward pressure on prices. Instead, crude futures have held up, supported by persistent geopolitical tensions that continue to sustain a sizeable risk premium in the market. </p><p>\n\n  At the same time, U.S. crude inventories surged by 16 million barrels last week to 435.8 million barrels--far above expectations and marking the largest weekly increase since February 2023, the EIA said. </p><br/><p>\n  NEXT WEEK: Heightened uncertainty over developments in the Middle East is expected to keep a significant risk premium embedded in oil prices, as markets weigh the possibility of supply disruption. </p><p>\n\n  \"President Trump's deadline for an agreement expires in a week at the latest,\" analysts at Commerzbank said. \"The continuing risk of a U.S. military strike is therefore likely to remain the dominant issue on the oil market, which suggests that oil prices will remain well supported.\" </p><p>\n\n  Traders are also focused on the upcoming OPEC+ meeting on Sunday for guidance on future production policy, with the group now widely expected to resume output increases, beginning with a modest 137,000 barrel-a-day rise. </p><p>\n\n  On the economic front, investors will be watching some remarks from Federal Reserve speakers, manufacturing PMI, ADP employment figures and weekly jobless claims for fresh clues on the strength of the economy and interest-rate outlook. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Giulia Petroni at giulia.petroni@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-27-26 1207ET</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>NEW YORK, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Airport security screeners across the U.S. received a fraction of their usual pay on Friday as the partial government shutdown drags on, increasing the risk that more officers will call in sick to take second jobs, or even quit.</p><p>\n              Funding for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security lapsed on February 13 after Congress failed to reach a deal on immigration enforcement reforms demanded by Democrats. That halted funding for the operation of several government agencies, including the Transportation Security Administration.</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              This shutdown is more limited than the record 43-day October-November event that closed numerous departments of government. But with TSA agents facing the possibility of losing even more pay if this one drags on further, the ripple effects could emerge again: absences, departures, and bottlenecked security lines at the nation's airports.</p><p>\n              \"People are going to get discouraged a lot quicker this time,\" said Philip Glover, national vice president of District 3 of the American Federation of Government Employees, who represents TSA workers at 19 airports in Delaware and Pennsylvania.</p><p><b>EXPECTING MORE RESIGNATIONS</b></p><p>\n              Local AFGE officials said they are expecting TSA resignations to rise, while other TSA workers, some of whom are still repaying debts from the last shutdown, again tighten their finances.  </p><p>\n              Ha Nguyen McNeill, the top official at the TSA, told Congress this month that around 1,110 transportation security officers (TSOs) left the TSA in October and November 2025, a more than 25% increase from the same time period in 2024.</p><p>\n              \"We heard reports of officers sleeping in their cars at airports to save money on gas, selling their blood and plasma and taking on second jobs to make ends meet,\" McNeill said of last year's shutdown, adding that the TSA is working to surge staffing in March, April, and May to be prepared for spring break, summer, and World Cup travel.</p><p>\n              A TSA officer at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas who asked to remain anonymous told Reuters the back-to-back shutdowns are making her reconsider the future of her nine-year career at the agency. \"I want to keep this job at least for the medical benefits, but sometimes I think I would be better off to abandon ship to reinvest myself elsewhere,\" the 34-year-old said.</p><p>\n              Workers for a second time in four months have to find a way to make ends meet without pay as the agency's management is pressing workers more on absences, as some call in sick to take on odd jobs to pay bills and fill their gas tanks, local AFGE officials said. </p><p>\n              \"Officers are looking at other alternatives just to maintain some kind of stability,\" said Darrell English, president of AFGE Local 777, which represents TSA workers in Illinois and Wisconsin. \"That's the backlash that's coming down the line from these continuous shutdowns.\"</p><p>\n              Neal Gosman, treasurer of the AFGE Local 899 in Minnesota, said that several of his colleagues with high seniority decided to retire shortly after this shutdown started.</p><p>\n              \"Maybe it's just coincidence and these are older people who've been there a while, but somehow they decided to pull the trigger this week,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>(Reporting by Doyinsola Oladipo in New York; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington)</p><p>\n            By Doyinsola Oladipo and David Shepardson</p></div>",

According to the median estimate forecast by five economists polled by The Wall Street Journal, consumer prices are expected to have fallen 0.49% on year in February. </p><p>\n\n  This was likely due to lower domestic petrol and diesel prices, as well as softer pork prices, said Eugene Tan of Moody's Analytics.

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Dow Jones Newswires staff </p><br/><p>\n  Below are the most important global events likely to affect FX and bond markets in the week starting March 2. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  U.S. jobs data will mark the highlight of the coming week as investors remain uncertain about when the Federal Reserve is next likely to cut interest rates. </p><p>\n\n  In Europe, attention will center on eurozone inflation data and the spring statement by the U.K.'s treasury chief. In Asia, the Bank of Japan's policy outlook, Australia's growth figures and China's annual parliamentary sessions are in focus. </p><br/><p>\n  U.S. </p><br/><p>\n  U.S. jobs data are back in focus in the coming week, with monthly nonfarm payrolls data for February due on Friday. </p><p>\n\n  Investors will be looking to see whether January's surprisingly strong payrolls numbers were a one-off. This comes amid uncertainty over whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the coming months, although analysts say it would likely take a particularly weak number to move the dial much on rate expectations. </p><p>\n\n  \"Our view is that it would take quite a lot to get the Fed thinking about an imminent rate cut,\" ING economists said in a note. </p><p>\n\n  U.S. money markets aren't pricing in a rate cut until July at the earliest, LSEG data show. ING doesn't expect another reduction until June. </p><p>\n\n  Ahead of Friday's key data, ADP private payrolls figures for February will be released Wednesday, followed by weekly jobless claims Thursday. </p><p>\n\n  The latest ISM surveys for February for manufacturing and services activity will be released on Monday and Wednesday, respectively. These will be keenly watched for indications of the overall performance of the U.S. economy, particularly amid uncertainty over U.S. tariff policy and tensions between the U.S. and Iran. U.S. January retail sales data are also released Friday. </p><br/><p>\n  Eurozone </p><br/><p>\n  The eurozone data calendar thins out after the usual end-of-month avalanche. </p><p>\n\n  Spanish, Italian, French, German and eurozone manufacturing and services PMI data are due on Monday and Wednesday, respectively. </p><p>\n\n  Italy will release yearly GDP data on Monday and flash estimate CPI data for February on Tuesday, when the same data is also scheduled from the eurozone as a whole. </p><p>\n\n  Eurozone unemployment figures for January are scheduled for Wednesday and retail sales data for the same month on Thursday. Germany will publish manufacturing orders data for January on Friday. </p><p>\n\n  Final fourth-quarter GDP and employment data from the eurozone are due on Friday. </p><p>\n\n  \"For now, the economy still looks to be 'in a good place', albeit one that the European Central Bank thinks requires vigilance and agility,\" Investec analyst Sandra Horsfield says in a note. </p><p>\n\n  The Netherlands will launch a new 10-year bond via a Dutch Direct Auction on Tuesday, aiming to issue between 6 billion euros and 7 billion euros. Germany will auction April 2031 bonds on Tuesday and a February 2033 green Bund on Wednesday. Spain and France will hold bond auctions on Thursday. Italy will issue a new series of retail-only BTP Valore, with subscriptions running between Monday and Friday. </p><br/><p>\n  U.K. </p><br/><p>\n  Focus in the U.K. will be on Tuesday's spring statement, a twice-yearly report on U.K. public finances which Treasury chief Rachel Reeves will present before lawmakers. This will be followed by an announcement on gilt issuance by the Debt Management Office. </p><p>\n\n  Markets expect Reeves to announce an improved fiscal position, including solid fiscal headroom. Gilt investors also expect government debt issuance to fall in the fiscal year to April 2027. Analysts said this could help push yields on U.K. government bonds lower. </p><p>\n\n  Economic data include final purchasing managers' data for February on manufacturing on Monday, then on services Wednesday. Data on consumer credit and mortgage lending for January are released on Monday, as well as the latest Nationwide house price index for February. The BRC's shop price index for February is released Tuesday. </p><br/><p>\n  Poland </p><br/><p>\n  Poland's central bank announces an interest-rate decision on Wednesday, where it could announce a 25 basis-point reduction in its key policy rate to 3.75%. </p><p>\n\n  HSBC economists expect a rate cut due to evidence of declining inflation. </p><p>\n\n  \"We continue to expect that during the March meeting the rate-setters will have a new inflation forecast that will show a downward revision to the Polish central bank's 2026 inflation forecast, to or even below the 2.5% target,\" they said in a note. This should be enough to warrant a rate cut, they said. </p><br/><p>\n  Japan </p><br/><p>\n  Investors will look for clues on the timing of the Bank of Japan's next rate increase in speeches by BOJ officials. Deputy Gov. Ryozo Himino will meet local leaders in Wakayama, Japan, on Monday. Governor Kazuo Ueda is scheduled to appear at the  \"FIN/SUM 2026\" event in Tokyo on Tuesday. </p><p>\n\n  Japan's Ministry of Finance will auction about 2.6 trillion yen of 10-year government bonds on Tuesday and around 700 billion yen of 30-year bonds on Thursday. The 30-year sale may draw strong demand from pension funds and insurers seeking higher yields. </p><p>\n\n  Auto sales figures for February are also scheduled for release on Monday. </p><br/><p>\n  Australia </p><br/><p>\n  Bond traders will focus on Australia's fourth-quarter 2025 growth data due Wednesday. </p><p>\n\n  The economy is expected to have grown 2.1% in calendar 2025 while operating near full capacity, adding to inflation pressures. </p><p>\n\n  The week will therefore be dominated once again by a discussion about a decade of weak productivity growth, excessive government spending and the potential for the Reserve Bank of Australia to raise interest rates in the coming months, perhaps as early as mid-March. </p><p>\n\n  The release on Thursday of the household spending indicator for January will also be closely watched by the central bank, given that strong consumer spending will add to the case for higher interest rates. </p><p>\n\n  RBA Governor Michele Bullock will deliver a speech on Tuesday. Bullock has been indicating that the central bank is closely monitoring data, including quarterly inflation numbers in late April that are likely to be critical in setting the scene for an interest rate increase in May. </p><p>\n\n  For the RBA, the data will point to whether aggregate capacity constraints are more or less worrisome than before. January's household spending data should show consumer activity starting 2026 at a subdued pace, while house price data is likely to confirm another strong monthly increase. </p><br/><p>\n  China </p><br/><p>\n  China returns from the Lunar New Year holiday to a busy week of data and policy announcements, including the annual meetings of its top legislature and advisory body. </p><p>\n\n  The National People's Congress, part of the \"Two Sessions,\" will open on Thursday. Beijing is expected to announce key economic targets for 2026, including GDP growth. </p><p>\n\n  ING economists forecast the growth target will be lowered to \"above 4.5%\" from \"around 5.0%\" in recent years. Fiscal targets, including the deficit-to-GDP ratio and bond issuance, are also expected. </p><p>\n\n  A reduced growth target would mark the first in four years. Citi economists said such a move would signal measured stimulus. They anticipate 1 trillion yuan in fiscal support, a possible 10-basis-point rate cut and a 50-basis-point reserve requirement ratio cut this year. </p><p>\n\n  Further measures could focus on stabilizing the labor market, boosting household income and domestic demand as well as advancing AI adoption. </p><p>\n\n  Official PMIs due Wednesday are likely to reflect disruption from February's extended holidays. ANZ economist Krystal Tan expects the manufacturing PMI to fall to 49.0 from 49.3, and the non-manufacturing PMI to edge down to 49.3 from 49.4. Small and midsize firms may show particular weakness, with tourism gains offset by softness in construction and finance. </p><p>\n\n  Private PMIs compiled by RatingDog are also due Wednesday. Foreign-exchange reserves data will be released Saturday. </p><br/><p>\n  Asian PMIs </p><br/><p>\n  Monday brings February manufacturing PMIs for Taiwan, Japan, India, Vietnam and other economies. </p><p>\n\n  Investors will look for signs that renewed U.S. tariff uncertainty has affected business sentiment, especially after The Supreme Court struck down Trump's global tariffs as illegal. </p><p>\n\n  The ruling may offer temporary relief for some exporters, but trade policy remains uncertain. Momentum is likely to remain supported by a strong tech-led export cycle, which remains largely insulated from the tariff shifts, ANZ added. </p><br/><p>\n  Malaysia </p><br/><p>\n  Malaysia's central bank will announce its rate decision Thursday afternoon. </p><p>\n\n  With inflation contained and labor-cost growth moderate, Citi expects Bank Negara to keep its policy rate unchanged at 2.75% through 2026. Policymakers are likely to favor a gradual appreciation of the ringgit to tighten monetary conditions. </p><br/><p>\n  South Korea </p><br/><p>\n  South Korea is expected to report solid February exports on Mar. 1, driven by robust semiconductor demand despite fewer working days in the month. </p><p>\n\n  A Wall Street Journal poll of nine economists forecast exports rose 25.6% from a year earlier, after a revised 33.8% increase in January. Early February trade data suggest chip exports are on track for a monthly record. Imports likely rose 13.6%, resulting in a $10.10 billion trade surplus--wider than January's revised $8.72 billion surplus. </p><p>\n\n  February inflation data are due Friday. Headline inflation is expected to remain near the central bank's 2% target after easing to a five-month low of 2.0% in January from 2.3% in December. </p><br/><p>\n  Indonesia </p><br/><p>\n  Indonesia will release January trade and February inflation data Monday afternoon. </p><p>\n\n  Headline inflation likely rose in February due to base effects and stronger demand during Ramadan, Kenanga Investment Bank said. </p><p>\n\n  January export growth may moderate as base effects fade after a temporary rise in late 2025, RHB said in a note. However, exports should maintain moderate growth over 2026, driven by ongoing efforts to diversify markets, RHB added. </p><br/><p>\n  Philippines, Thailand </p><br/><p>\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-27-26 1144ET</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n    MUNICH (dpa-AFX) - BMW is once again recalling hundreds of thousands of vehicles worldwide due to a potential fire hazard. This is according to a recall notice published in the database of the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA), which the Munich-based automaker has confirmed. The affected models include the i5, 7 Series, M5, 5 Series, and i7, produced between June 9, 2022, and December 5, 2025.\n</p><p>\n\n\n\n    Globally, 337,374 vehicles are potentially affected, with 29,441 of them located in Germany, according to the KBA. The authority stated that improper routing of the cockpit wiring harness \"could, when replacing the microfilter, cause damage to the cables, leading to a short circuit with smoke development and potentially resulting in a fire.\" As a countermeasure, the routing of the cockpit wiring harness will be inspected and, if necessary, corrected.\n</p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n\n\nWhat customers need to know now</p><p>\n\n\n\n    \"No accidents have been reported in connection with this issue,\" a BMW spokesperson stated. If a vehicle has already undergone an oil service and thus a microfilter replacement, an immediate inspection and, if needed, reworking of the cables is necessary. If no oil service and therefore no microfilter replacement has yet taken place, there is no immediate need for action; reworking during the first oil service will suffice, the spokesperson said.\n</p><p>\n\n\n\n    As early as last autumn, BMW had recalled hundreds of thousands of cars because, in that instance as well, a starter problem could, in the worst case, lead to fires.\n</p><p></p></div>",
