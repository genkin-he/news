In early trade, Brent crude and WTI both slip 0.6% to $63.98 and $60.20 a barrel, respectively. The market has largely priced in a modest output increase of 137,000 barrels a day for December, but concerns over a growing supply glut continue to weigh on sentiment. Meanwhile, the trade agreement between the U.S. and China did little to resolve questions over Chinese purchases of Russian oil, analysts say. \"There has been no indication on the Chinese side as to whether they will stop buying,\" according to ANZ. \"There was also hope that China would agree to purchases of U.S. oil and gas as part of a broader U.S.-China deal.\" (giulia.petroni@wsj.com) </p><p>\n\n  -- </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  Gold Rises With Focus on U.S.-China Trade, Fed Rate-Cut Prospects -- Market Talk </p><p>\n\n  0847 GMT - Gold prices rise in early trading as investors digest the trade deal between the U.S. and China and the Federal Reserve's hawkish tone on December interest-rate cuts.

Despite the commodity's narrowing price advantage over soybean oil, which could slow exports, BMI thinks palm oil remains competitively priced, providing a stable demand floor. BMI raises its 2025 average crude palm oil price forecast to 4,320 ringgit a ton from 4,150 ringgit a ton. Over the long term, slower production growth in Malaysia and Indonesia, due to land and environmental constraints, is expected to keep palm oil prices structurally firm, with a slight easing to 4,300 ringgit a ton in 2026, BMI adds.

These include consistent central-bank allocation and investor buying of gold across various investment products, the head of markets strategy says. \"All these purchases of gold have one key common important motivation, i.e. the need for safe haven diversification of portfolio amidst the increasingly volatile de-dollarization narrative,\" he adds.

The two oils often move in tandem due to their use in similar products. While increased soybean oil supply could weigh on demand for crude palm oil, firm biodiesel demand under Indonesia's B50 mandate, seasonal monsoon-related production slowdown and lower Malaysian inventories should limit downside risks. Unless China significantly scales up its soybean imports from the U.S., the overall impact on palm oil fundamentals may remain limited, she adds. TA maintains a neutral rating on Malaysia's plantation sector. It rates United Malacca at buy, Kuala Lumpur Kepong at hold, and SD Guthrie and IOI at sell.

The U.S. dollar index--which measures the greenback against a basket of other major currencies--is up 0.3% to 99.81, making dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for international buyers. The pullback comes as traders assess the Federal Reserve's hawkish tone on December rate cuts and the U.S.-China trade agreement. Yet, copper is still headed for a weekly gain of more than 5%, supported by concerns over global supply following a series of disruptions at major mines this year.

After spiking on U.S. sanctions against Russia's largest oil company, prices have retreated with higher OPEC+ output and weaker seasonal demand containing advances. While the \"overarching bearish balance outlook continues to accelerate,\" risk premiums still exist as Russian output is likely to be a key focus, analysts at Rystad Energy say in a note. Rystad raised its Brent price forecast for 4Q to $63 a barrel from $62 a barrel.
