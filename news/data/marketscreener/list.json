By Vicky Ge Huang </p><p>\n\n     The European Central Bank held interest rates steady on Thursday, as investors question whether the central bank's most aggressive easing campaign since the financial crisis is really done. The decision came a day after the Federal Reserve cut rates for the second time this year. Meanwhile, the Fed is planning to shrink the number of staff at its banking supervision arm by about one-third by the end of 2026, according to an internal memo seen by The Wall Street Journal. And on the trade front, it still looks like commerce is going to be rocky for years to come as the U.S. and China fail to address their underlying conflicts. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n     Top News The ECB and Fed Are Going in Different Directions. Can It Last? </p><p>\n\n     The European Central Bank held its key interest rate at 2% , where it has been since June. The central bank cut rates by 2 percentage points in a year before hitting pause over the summer. </p><p>\n\n     The ECB's came a day after the Federal Reserve cut rates.

The reductions would leave the Fed's supervision and regulation division with about 350 people, down from a previously authorized head count of 500, according to the memo. The cuts were announced by the Fed's new top regulatory official, Vice Chair Michelle Bowman, during a morning meeting. </p><p>\n\n     Economy U.S.-China Truce Brings Little Peace for Firms Caught in Standoff </p><p>\n\n     After a face-to-face with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, President Trump said the meeting wasn't just nice, it was a 12 on a scale of one to 10.

Executing that will require reconciling two conflicting goals: ramping up economic stimulus and maintaining fiscal discipline.

They expect the Fed to pause after Wednesday's decision to cut interest rates was accompanied by what they describe as \"notably hawkish\" comments. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said a December rate cut was \"far from\" a foregone conclusion and pointed to deepening divisions among policymakers about how to interpret the outlook. UniCredit's analysts forecast just one more rate cut in mid-2026 and expect that President Trump will be \"unable to decisively influence monetary policy.\" - Jessica Fleetham </p><p>\n\n     Lagarde Hints ECB Could Hold Rates for Some Time </p><p>\n\n     European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde gave the impression at the press conference that it won't lower its key interest rate in the coming months, Commerzbank's Joerg Kraemer says in a note. The case for keeping interest rates stable was reinforced by Lagarde reiterating her statement that the bank is in \"a good place\" regarding current interest rates, he says. Lagarde noted that risks to the economy have declined due to trade compromises and a ceasefire in the Middle East, though stopped short of describing the overall economic risks as tilted upward. \"We continue to expect the ECB to maintain the deposit rate at 2% at least until the end of next year,\" Kraemer says. - Edward Frankl </p><p>\n\n     Bank of Japan Still Likely to Raise Policy Rate in December </p><p>\n\n     The Bank of Japan is still likely to raise its policy rate by 25 bps in December, DBS Group Research's Ma Tieying says in commentary. Labor unions in Japan are expected to set 2026 wage negotiation targets around November-December, the senior economists says. The Japanese Trade Union Confederation, also known as Rengo, has already signaled a 5% wage increase target for 2026, the same as this year, she says. Also, the likelihood of a BOJ rate hike in December may increase if the Fed holds off on a rate cut at its December meeting, giving the BOJ a window to act that month, the economist adds. - Ronnie Harui </p><p>\n\n     About Us </p><p>\n\n     WSJ Pro Central Banking brings you central banking news, analysis and insights from WSJ's global team of reporters and editors.

The stock has been largely stagnant since its split from Vivendi and its IPO four years ago.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Swedish online music giant Spotify is set to release its quarterly results next Tuesday.</p></div>",
