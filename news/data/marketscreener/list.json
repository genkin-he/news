The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) outlines a roadmap to commercial fusion in Europe that begins with building demonstration stellarator Alpha near the Max Planck Institute for plasma Physics (IPP) in Garching. When operational in the 2030s, Alpha will become the first stellarator to demonstrate net energy gain, meaning its plasma will generate more energy than it consumes.</p><p>The demonstration stellarator will additionally allow Proxima and its partners to test and validate key fusion technologies under real-world conditions and in shorter development cycles, accelerating the path to building the first stellarator fusion power plant, Stellaris. Site secured for Stellaris power plant: The Stellaris commercial power plant is planned for the site of a former nuclear fission power plant in Gundremmingen, currently being decommissioned by RWE. This agreement marks Europe's first major step toward commercial fusion power, as the continent's leadership in fusion research moves into industrial deployment.</p><!-- Article --><p>Alpha and Stellaris will together create thousands of jobs and supplier contracts for European manufacturers and engineers, from construction and manufacturing to advanced electrical, magnet systems, and more. The long-term aim is to make fusion an integral part of Europe's energy system, reduce dependence on imported energy, and, for the first time, apply Europe's fusion expertise to a grid-connected commercial project. Under the MoU, the free State of Bavaria, Proxima Fusion, RWE and IPP will work together on site selection, permitting and regulatory processes, project structure, and financing.</p><p>IPP will lead on plasma physics and the scientific leadership of demonstration stellarator Alpha. Proxima Fusion will lead on engineering, public procurement processes, and construction. RWE will contribute its extensive experience in the construction and operation of complex power plant facilities, as well as its strong global industrial network.</p><p>Proxima intends to finance approximately 20% of the project's total costs through private international investors. Subject to federal funding, the Free State of Bavaria has indicated a potential state co-financing contribution of 20%. RWE has also signaled its willingness to participate financially within the framework of the MoU.</p><p>All four partners are pooling their efforts to maximize chances of success in securing federal funding under the High-Tech Agenda Germany.</p></div>",

Pharmacogenetic Test, a new laboratory developed test designed to help inform clinicians on dosing tacrolimus, a commonly prescribed immunosuppressive drug for transplant recipients to lower the risk of rejection. For transplant recipients, finding the right tacrolimus dose as early as possible can be life-changing.</p><p>If the dose is too low, the body may reject the new organ. If it is too high, patients face increased risks of injury, infection and other serious complications. Yet patients process tacrolimus differently based in part on their genetics, making standard dosing approaches difficult and often leading to repeated adjustments during the most vulnerable period after transplant.</p><!-- Article --><p>Thermo Fisher's new TacroType Pharmacogenetic Test provides genetic insights that can help clinicians better understand how an individual patient is likely to metabolize tacrolimus--supporting more informed dosing decisions from the start and helping reduce the trial-and-error approach that many patients experience today. The new test addresses this challenge by providing clinicians with actionable genetic insights that can support more personalized tacrolimus dosing decisions. Using a simple buccal swab sample, the test identifies a patient's CYP3A5 genotype, which influences how quickly tacrolimus is metabolized and how a patient may respond to therapy.</p><p>When performed prior to transplant, TacroType provides genetic information that may help inform early tacrolimus dosing decision. This insight enables more informed initial dosing decisions that complement, rather than replace, ongoing therapeutic drug monitoring. By moving beyond conventional dosing approaches, clinicians may be able to reduce the risk of adverse effects while supporting better long-term graft and patient outcomes.</p><p>The TacroType test is offered as a one-time pharmacogenetic assessment using rapid, qPCR-based CYP3A5 genotyping services. By providing clinicians with patient-specific information to support tacrolimus dosing Decision, the test may enable clinicians to help patients reach target tacrolimus levels more efficiently and with fewer dose adjustments.</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Kirk Maltais </p><br/><p>\n  --Wheat for May delivery rose 0.8% to $5.74 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade Thursday, with fund traders again covering short positions as global risk factors mount ahead of the weekend. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  --Corn for May delivery rose 0.4% to $4.43 3/4 a bushel. </p><p>\n\n  --Soybeans for May delivery fell 0.2% to $11.63 a bushel. </p><br/><p>\n  HIGHLIGHTS </p><br/><p>\n  Back in the Saddle: Traders of wheat futures seemingly ran out of gas Wednesday for their spree of short-covering, but went right back to it in Thursday's trading. The movement higher doesn't appear supported by fundamentals, said Charlie Sernatinger of Marex in a note. \"We are still looking for that elusive fundamental reason why wheat is hanging in around its highs after a 49-cent rally since the beginning of the calendar year,\" says Sernatinger. </p><p>\n\n  Summit Squabble: A story from the South China Morning Post said the potential summit between President Trump and Chinese president Xi is experiencing issues, which the story attributes to \"planning gaps and weak coordination on the U.S. side.\" The story was a pressure point for soybeans Thursday,  as well as livestock futures, due to the export demand from those products coming from China. </p><br/><p>\n  INSIGHT </p><br/><p>\n  Always in the Background: Analysts are keeping a close eye on how the Brazilian harvest is progressing, and preparing for the surge of Brazilian soybeans hitting the global export market. The record amount of soybeans expected from Brazil may create a short-term ceiling for prices. \"It would be unusual for the biggest soybean harvest the world has ever seen (Brazil) to not slow down price gains in the beans at some point,\" said Doug Bergman of RCM Alternatives in a note. </p><p>\n\n  Missing the Mark: Export sales of U.S. corn fell below the expectations of analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal this week. The USDA said Thursday that corn export sales across the 2025/26 and 2026/27 marketing years totaled 697,500 metric tons for the week ended Feb. 19. Analysts had forecast sales to land between 900,000 tons and 1.8 million tons. Soybean and wheat sales landed on the low end of analyst expectations for the week. </p><p>\n\n  New Sale: The USDA said this morning that 178,000 metric tons of corn were sold to Japan, with 154,000 tons for delivery during the 2026/2027 marketing year and an additional 24,000 tons for 2027/28 delivery. While the market welcomes flash sales, Thursday's notice isn't the one many traders were hoping to see -  that would be a sale of soybeans to China, which was rumored among market participants this week. </p><br/><p>\n  AHEAD </p><br/><p>\n  --The USDA will release its monthly Agricultural Prices report at 3 p.m. ET Friday. </p><p>\n\n  --The CFTC will release its weekly Commitment of Traders report at 3:30 p.m. ET Friday. </p><p>\n\n  --The USDA will release its weekly Grain Export Inspections report at 11 a.m. ET Monday. </p><p>\n\n  --The USDA will release its monthly Grain Crushings report at 3 p.m. ET Monday. </p><br/><p>\n   Write to Kirk Maltais at kirk.maltais@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-26-26 1525ET</p></div>",
