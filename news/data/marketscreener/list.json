Analysts had expected 287.50 billion won for the quarter, according to a FactSet-compiled consensus. </p><p>\n\n  Revenue fell 1.4% to 21.874 trillion won, and operating profit dropped 8.4% to 688.90 billion won, in line with the company's preliminary estimates. </p><p>\n\n  Growth at the company's home-appliance and auto-parts segments stayed resilient despite challenges from higher tariffs and soft demand in major global markets, with revenue rising 4.7% and 1.4%, respectively. </p><p>\n\n  The sluggishness in its media and entertainment segment, which includes televisions, continued, with revenue slumping 9.5%. Costs associated with marketing and early retirement programs for employees in the segment weighed on operating profit. </p><p>\n\n  Shares of LG Electronics were flat after the results. The stock has underperformed the broader market this year, gaining by around 5% compared with the benchmark Kospi's roughly 70% gain. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Kwanwoo Jun at kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-31-25 0147ET</p></div>",

Although negotiations are still at an early stage, the news was enough to spark activity on the Milan Stock Exchange, where TIM shares rose by 4.8%. This suggests that the market is betting on the consolidation of a fragmented and fiercely competitive sector, Il Sole notes.</p><p></p><p>\nIliad Italia could be valued at over EUR3 billion. Among the options under consideration are a joint venture with Wind Tre or the transfer of Italian operations in exchange for a stake in a European spin-off that CK Hutchison is reportedly preparing. However, the French group has repeatedly stated it is only interested in deals that offer concrete industrial benefits and a leading role, the newspaper adds.</p><p></p><p>\nBoth companies have declined to comment on the rumors. Any restructuring, however, will have to contend with Brussels: following the 2016 Wind-3 merger, the EU imposed a moratorium on new mergers until 2026, facilitating Iliad's entry to ensure competition.</p><p></p><p>\nAccording to Agcom, Wind Tre holds a 24% share of the mobile market and Iliad 10.9%; combined, they would surpass Fastweb+Vodafone, which together have 30%, while TIM remains the market leader with 26.6%.</p><p></p><p>\nBy Claudia Cavaliere, Alliance News reporter</p><p></p><p>\nComments and questions to redazione@alliancenews.com</p><p></p><p>\nCopyright 2025 Alliance News IS Italian Service Ltd.

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n     MARKET WRAPS </p><p>\n\n     Watch For: </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n     Eurozone and France inflation; trading updates for CaixaBank, Impala Platinum, Danske Bank, Aker Solutions </p><p>\n\n     Opening Call: </p><p>\n\n     European stock futures were lower after Asia stocks fell. The dollar and U.S. Treasurys were flat. Gold and oil futures were lower. </p><p>\n\n     Equities: </p><p>\n\n     European equity futures were lower after post-earnings slumps in Meta Platforms and Microsoft shares weighed on major stock indexes on Wall Street. </p><p>\n\n     Investors gave a thumbs down to Meta's plans to spend even more to stay in the artificial-intelligence race, marking the stock's biggest one-day decline in more than three years. </p><p>\n\n     Yields on Meta's bonds jumped after the company said it was looking to raise at least $25 billion from a jumbo debt sale. Increased spending plans also cast a shadow over an otherwise-stellar Microsoft earnings report. </p><p>\n\n     \"None of these companies can keep up this huge spending on AI forever,\" said David Trainer, chief executive of New Constructs, an investment-research firm. </p><p>\n\n     Forex: </p><p>\n\n     The European Central Bank is seen by some analysts as needing to do more to support growth and offset the impact of a strong euro. </p><p>\n\n     The currency's rise has revived concerns about too-low inflation in the eurozone, because it makes imports cheaper. If the Fed keeps cutting rates, as widely expected by investors, it could amplify the pressure, by boosting the relative appeal of the euro. </p><p>\n\n     \"Even if the ECB still tries to make us believe that it's done cutting rates, I am convinced that the Fed's rate cuts, a strengthening euro, and the delayed impact from U.S. tariffs could still force the ECB to cut rates in December or early next year,\" said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING in Frankfurt. </p><p>\n\n     Bonds: </p><p>\n\n     U.S. Treasury yields held steady as traders pared bets on an interest-rate cut in December after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said one was far from a done deal. </p><p>\n\n     Powell's statement \"caught the market a little off-guard as it reduced visibility into future rate cuts and highlighted a growing divide among policymakers,\" Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, wrote to clients. </p><p>\n\n     Energy: </p><p>\n\n     Oil fell in the early trading session. \"The market is now watching this weekend's OPEC+ meeting and discussions of its output policy,\" said ANZ Research analysts in a research report. </p><p>\n\n     \"The U.S. sanctions on Russian oil companies significantly lift risks to supply,\" the analysts said. </p><p>\n\n     This could prompt OPEC+ to approve another increase of 137,000 barrels per day in supply for December, the analysts added. </p><p>\n\n     Metals: </p><p>\n\n     Gold edged lower, paring some of the overnight gains seen amid prospects of continued central-bank demand. </p><p>\n\n     Central-bank purchases of the precious metal climbed 28% on quarter to an estimated net 220 tons in 3Q, the World Gold Council said in a report. </p><p>\n\n     \"Central banks are likely to continue their buying spree,\" it said, adding that \"demand has broadened, with hitherto dormant banks becoming active.\" </p><p>\n\n     - </p><p>\n\n     Iron ore fell as prices face near-term downward pressure as supply has been strong, with port inventories accumulating quickly, said Nanhua Futures analysts in a research note. </p><p>\n\n     Meanwhile, demand has been weighed amid a lack of policy support. Downward pressure may persist unless steel mills achieve large-scale production cuts, they noted. </p><p>\n\n     TODAY'S TOP HEADLINES </p><p>\n\n     China Factory Activity Gauge Signals Deepening Manufacturing Gloom </p><p>\n\n     China's economic momentum continued to weaken, with a manufacturing gauge signaling mounting headwinds for the world's second-largest economy. </p><p>\n\n     The official manufacturing purchasing managers index saw a sharp drop to 49.0 in October, from 49.8 in September, putting it below the 50 threshold that separates an expansion in activity from a contraction for seven straight months. </p><p>\n\n     U.S.-China Truce Brings Little Peace for Businesses Caught in Superpower Standoff </p><p>\n\n     After a face-to-face with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, President Trump said the meeting wasn't just nice, it was a 12 on a scale of one to 10. </p><p>\n\n     But for businesses caught between the two superpowers, the ugly reality remains: The U.S. and China haven't addressed their underlying conflicts. Commerce is going to be rocky for years to come. </p><p>\n\n     Federal Reserve to Reduce Bank Supervision Staff by 30% </p><p>\n\n     Federal Reserve officials are planning to reduce the staff of its banking supervision arm by 30% by the end of next year, according to an internal memo seen by The Wall Street Journal. </p><p>\n\n     The reductions would leave the Fed's supervision and regulation division with about 350 people, down from a previously authorized head count of 500, according to the memo. The cuts were announced by the Fed's new top regulatory official, Vice Chair Michelle Bowman, during a morning meeting. </p><p>\n\n     Hezbollah Is Rearming, Putting Cease-Fire at Risk </p><p>\n\n     Lebanese militant group Hezbollah is rebuilding its armaments and battered ranks, defying the terms of a cease-fire agreement and raising the prospect of renewed conflict with Israel, according to people familiar with Israeli and Arab intelligence. </p><p>\n\n     The intelligence shows Iranian-backed Hezbollah is restocking rockets, antitank missiles and artillery, the people said. Some of those weapons are coming in via seaports and weakened but still functional smuggling routes through Syria, some of the people said. Hezbollah is manufacturing some new weapons itself, one of the people said. </p><p>\n\n     The ECB and Fed Are Going in Different Directions. Can It Last? </p><p>\n\n     The European Central Bank held interest rates steady on Thursday, as investors question whether the institution's most aggressive easing campaign since the financial crisis is really done. </p><p>\n\n     The ECB held its key interest rate at 2%, where it has been since June. The central bank cut rates by 2 percentage points in a year before hitting pause over the summer. </p><p>\n\n     Disney Channels Go Dark on YouTube TV </p><p>\n\n     Disney channels including ESPN, ABC and FX vanished from Google's YouTube TV platform after the two sides failed to come to terms on a new distribution agreement. </p><p>\n\n     The channels went dark in roughly 10 million homes shortly before midnight Eastern time. Disney and YouTube TV had held contentious negotiations leading up to the channels being removed. The deadline to reach a deal was 11:59 p.m. ET on Thursday. </p><p>\n\n     Big Tech Is Spending More Than Ever on AI and It's Still Not Enough </p><p>\n\n     Silicon Valley's biggest companies are already planning to pour $400 billion into artificial intelligence efforts this year. They all say it's nowhere near enough. </p><p>\n\n     Meta Platforms says it is still running up against capacity constraints as it tries to train new AI models and power its existing products at the same time. Microsoft says it is seeing so much customer demand for its data-center-driven services that it plans to double its data-center footprint in the next two years. And Amazon.com says it is racing to bring more cloud capacity online as soon as it can. </p><p>\n\n     Write to singaporeeditors@dowjones.com </p><p>\n\n     Expected Major Events for Friday </p><p>\n\n     05:30/NED: Oct Flash Estimate CPI </p><p>\n\n     06:00/FIN: Sep Retail sales </p><p>\n\n     07:00/TUR: Sep Foreign Trade </p><p>\n\n     07:00/GER: Sep Retail Trade </p><p>\n\n     07:00/GER: Sep Foreign trade price indices </p><p>\n\n     07:00/UK: Oct Nationwide House Price Index </p><p>\n\n     07:30/HUN: Sep PPI </p><p>\n\n     07:30/SWI: Sep Retail Sales </p><p>\n\n     07:45/FRA: Sep PPI </p><p>\n\n     07:45/FRA: Oct Provisional CPI </p><p>\n\n     10:00/ITA: Oct Provisional CPI </p><p>\n\n     10:00/ITA: Oct Cities CPI </p><p>\n\n     10:00/LUX: Sep PPI </p><p>\n\n     10:00/EU: Oct Flash Estimate euro area inflation </p><p>\n\n     10:00/GRE: Aug Turnover Index in Retail Trade </p><p>\n\n     10:00/CYP: Sep PPI </p><p>\n\n     11:00/POR: Sep Industrial production index </p><p>\n\n     15:59/UKR: Sep POSTPONED: Industrial Production </p><p>\n\n     16:59/SPN: Sep Budget deficit </p><p>\n\n     16:59/BEL: Sep PPI </p><p>\n\n     16:59/SPN: Aug Monthly Balance of Payments </p><p>\n\n     All times in GMT.
