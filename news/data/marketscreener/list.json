The first phase of SK Group's AI factory is due to be completed by late 2027. </p><p>\n\n  The Hyundai-Nvidia tie-up will focus on AI capabilities for autonomous vehicles, smart factories and robotics, and building regional AI data centers. The firms will work closely with government stakeholders to develop an ecosystem for the technology that \"will result in an approximately $3 billion investment,\" Nvidia said in a statement. </p><p>\n\n  The announcements come as countries race to build an edge in AI. </p><p>\n\n  Technological self-reliance was at the heart of China's latest economic development plan, while a Japan-U.S. investment cooperation factsheet earlier this week outlined billions in investment projects that focused heavily on AI. </p><p>\n\n  South Korea's government under President Lee Jae Myung has designated the AI sector as one of the economy's new growth engines, and set the goal of becoming one of the world's top three AI hubs. </p><p>\n\n  According to the announcement from Nvidia, the Korean government, through the Ministry of Science and ICT, is investing in sovereign AI infrastructure, including the deployment of over 50,000 of the company's latest GPUs. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Kimberley Kao at kimberley.kao@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-31-25 0531ET</p></div>",

It also removed its Chinese CEO, citing concerns that its technology could be appropriated by Wingtech.</p><p>\n              Nexperia's move came after the Dutch chipmaker's Chinese unit resumed supplying semiconductors to local customers but stipulated that all sales to distributors would need to be settled using the Chinese yuan. Previously, transactions had been settled with foreign currencies like the U.S. dollar.</p><p>\n              The company produces large volumes of chips in the Netherlands that are widely used in the automotive and consumer electronics industries. Some 70% of the Netherlands-produced chips are packaged in China and sold mostly to distributors.</p><p>\n              \"While we have maintained shipments for as long as commercially feasible, continuing the current flow of supply from our front-end sites is no longer justifiable,\" the letter said. </p><p>\n              \"Unless these contractual obligations are fully satisfied, we cannot resume wafer supply to the site. Nexperia is developing alternative solutions to ensure (that) supply (is) continuing to our customers.\"</p><p>\n              Nexperia added that the decision did not reflect an intention to withdraw from its site in Dongguan or from the Chinese market as a whole, adding that it remained committed to finding a resolution to the problem. </p><p>\n              Nexperia said it is financially independent of Wingtech and it does not raise capital from Wingtech, the letter showed.</p><p>\n              Nexperia confirmed that it sent the letter but said it could not comment further. Nexperia China and Wingtech did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>\n              Court filings showed that the seizure by the Dutch government came as U.S. pressure was rising on Nexperia after Wingtech was placed on a restricted-export list, though Dutch authorities say governance shortcomings were the trigger. </p><p>\n              On October 4, China's commerce ministry blocked Nexperia from exporting chips from China.</p><p>\n              Industry bodies have sounded the alarm over the possible impact on production, with Stellantis  saying on Thursday that it had set up a \"war room\" to monitor the situation. </p><p>\n              Japanese automaker Nissan said it had enough chips at the moment to last until the first week of November without disruption. </p><p>\n              Some Nexperia products that used to cost just a few Chinese cents have gone up in price to two or three yuan each over the past two weeks, more than 10 times their original cost, according to a source familiar with the matter. </p><p>\n               (Reporting by Che Pan in Beijing and Wen-Yee Lee in Taipei; Writing by Brenda Goh; Editing by Jacqueline Wong and Thomas Derpinghaus)</p><p>\n            By Che  Pan and Wen-Yee Lee</p></div>",
