Six of the \"Magnificent Seven\" U.S. tech megacaps have now reported, with Nvidia - which has just become the world's first $5 trillion company - due to report in three weeks' time.</p><p>\n              In Asia, Japan's Nikkei had rallied over 2%, boosting its weekly and monthly gains to 6% and 16.4%, respectively. That was the largest monthly rise since 1990, turbocharged by hopes for aggressive fiscal stimulus under new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.</p><p>\n              This week has also seen the Bank of Japan hold interest rates steady despite many economists predicting a hike.</p><p>\n              Chinese blue chips and Hong Kong's Hang Seng both skidded roughly 1.5% though after data showed China's factory activity contracted at the fastest pace in six months in October.  </p><p>\n              Investors also locked in gains after a trade truce reached by U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, which will lead to reduced U.S. tariffs on imports of Chinese goods and continued rare earth exports from China.</p><p><b>SUBTLE SHIFTS</b></p><p>\n              This week, major central bank meetings have delivered decisions that have subtly shifted expectations. The biggest surprise came from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell who pushed back against the market's sanguine view about a rate cut in December. </p><p>\n              Both Treasuries and European government bonds were steady on Friday, but were set for weekly losses. </p><p>\n              Two-year Treasury yields were flat at 3.6085%, having risen 12 basis points this week already, while the 10-year yield was steady at 4.0969% and up 10 bps for the week.</p><p>\n              Germany's 10-year Bund yields, the euro area's benchmark, were up 1.5 basis points on the day at 2.65% and set for a weekly rise of 2.5 bps.</p><p>\n              The rise in yields offered support to the U.S. dollar , which was holding near three-month highs at 99.5 against its major peers, although resistance seems heavy at 99.564 and 100.25. </p><p>\n              The euro was flat at $1.1569 after the ECB kept its rates at 2% for the third meeting in a row and sounded moderately more positive on growth prospects.</p><p>\n              The central bank also published a survey on Friday showing euro zone bloc firms are seeing a slight improvement in business conditions and that investment into sectors like artificial intelligence is booming. </p><p>\n              \"What the data this week suggests is that maybe we have got something fundamentally wrong about the impact of trade tariffs,\" Morgan Stanley's Chief Europe Economist Jens Eisenschmidt said, also highlighting the boost from AI.</p><p>\n              \"It doesn't make me revise anything dramatically, but it makes me think.\"    </p><p>\n              In the commodities markets, oil prices fell and were headed for a third straight monthly fall as a stronger dollar capped gains and rising supply from major producers offset new Western sanctions on Russian exports.</p><p>\n              Brent crude futures slipped 0.9% to $64.55 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at $60.10, down 0.8%.</p><p>\n              Spot gold prices retraced some of the overnight gains and were down 0.3% to $4,008 per ounce. They were down 2.5% for the week and well below the record high of $4,381 hit just last week. </p><p>\n               (Reporting by Marc Jones in London and Stella Qiu in Sydney; editing by Andrew Heavens)</p><p>\n            By Marc Jones and Stella Qiu</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Dow Jones Newswires Staff </p><br/><p>\n  U.S. futures were up, while global markets were mostly lower after many indexes hit record highs this week. The highly anticipated agreement between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping received a muted response with market watchers saying China appeared set to maintain the rare-earth curbs introduced in the spring, and businesses expecting more rocky times ahead for U.S.-China commerce. Gold rose, while oil fell. </p><!-- Article --><br/><p>\n  --U.S. futures for the S&amp;P 500 were up 0.6% and futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1% after both indexes closed lower Thursday following earnings from Meta Platforms and Microsoft. Tech stocks fell on concerns over increased spending outlooks for the two companies. </p><br/><p>\n  --Asia stocks were mostly lower, except Japan's Nikkei which closed up 2.1% after data indicated the economy is showing signs of improvement. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index closed 0.8% lower, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1.4%. </p><br/><p>\n  --All major indexes in Europe were lower, with London's FTSE down 0.3% and Germany's DAX 0.4% lower. France's CAC 40 was down 0.15% and the Stoxx 600 fell 0.4%, lead by the technology sector which was down 0.9%. Bucking the trend were Fuchs and Puig which were up 9.5% and 7.9%, respectively after third-quarter earnings. </p><br/><p>\n  --U.S. Treasury yields edged higher in Asian trade across the curve except for the two-year maturity, but moves were overall small after this week's major central-bank policy decisions. The two-year Treasury yield was down 0.1 basis point at 3.612%, while the 10-year yield rose 1.2bps to 4.103%, according to Tradeweb. </p><br/><p>\n  --Eurozone government bond yields rose in early trade, absorbing the European Central Bank's policy meeting on Thursday. The ECB left the key interest rates unchanged, as expected, and sounded relatively relaxed about the eurozone's growth outlook. The 10-year German Bund yield rose 0.8bp to 2.646%, according to Tradeweb. </p><br/><p>\n  --The dollar remained higher, supported by reduced bets for another interest-rate cut in December after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said it was far from a done deal. The Fed delivered a widely expected 25-basis-point rate cut on Wednesday. The DXY dollar index rose 0.1% to 99.658, close to the three-month high of 99.724 reached Thursday. </p><br/><p>\n  --Bitcoin recovered marginally but remains below the key $110,000 level following losses sustained overnight after a tech-led selloff in U.S. stocks. Reduced market bets for another interest-rate cut by the Fed in December also weighed on risk appetite. Bitcoin rose 1.9% to $109,559 after reaching a one-and-a-half-week low of $106,396 late Thursday, LSEG data show. </p><br/><p>\n   --Gold prices rose in early trading as investors digest the trade deal between the U.S. and China and the Fed's hawkish tone on December interest-rate cuts. Futures in New York are up 0.4% to $4,032.10 a troy ounce after retreating back below the $4,000 mark earlier this week, and are now set for monthly gains of more than 4%. </p><br/><p>\n  --Oil prices were headed for a monthly loss of nearly 3% ahead of Sunday's OPEC+ meeting. In early trade, Brent crude and WTI both slipped 0.6% to $63.98 and $60.20 a barrel, respectively. The market has largely priced in a modest output increase of 137,000 barrels a day for December, but concerns over a growing supply glut continue to weigh on sentiment. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Barcelona Editors at barcelonaeditors@dowjones.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-31-25 0537ET</p></div>",
