It also removed its Chinese CEO, citing concerns that its technology could be appropriated by Wingtech.</p><p>\n              Nexperia's move came after the Dutch chipmaker's Chinese unit resumed supplying semiconductors to local customers but stipulated that all sales to distributors would need to be settled using the Chinese yuan. Previously, transactions had been settled with foreign currencies like the U.S. dollar.</p><p>\n              The company produces large volumes of chips in the Netherlands that are widely used in the automotive and consumer electronics industries. Some 70% of the Netherlands-produced chips are packaged in China and sold mostly to distributors.</p><p>\n              \"While we have maintained shipments for as long as commercially feasible, continuing the current flow of supply from our front-end sites is no longer justifiable,\" the letter said. </p><p>\n              \"Unless these contractual obligations are fully satisfied, we cannot resume wafer supply to the site. Nexperia is developing alternative solutions to ensure (that) supply (is) continuing to our customers.\"</p><p>\n              Nexperia added that the decision did not reflect an intention to withdraw from its site in Dongguan or from the Chinese market as a whole, adding that it remained committed to finding a resolution to the problem. </p><p>\n              Nexperia said it is financially independent of Wingtech and it does not raise capital from Wingtech, the letter showed.</p><p>\n              Nexperia confirmed that it sent the letter but said it could not comment further. Nexperia China and Wingtech did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>\n              Court filings showed that the seizure by the Dutch government came as U.S. pressure was rising on Nexperia after Wingtech was placed on a restricted-export list, though Dutch authorities say governance shortcomings were the trigger. </p><p>\n              On October 4, China's commerce ministry blocked Nexperia from exporting chips from China.</p><p>\n              Industry bodies have sounded the alarm over the possible impact on production, with Stellantis  saying on Thursday that it had set up a \"war room\" to monitor the situation. </p><p>\n              Japanese automaker Nissan said it had enough chips at the moment to last until the first week of November without disruption. </p><p>\n              Some Nexperia products that used to cost just a few Chinese cents have gone up in price to two or three yuan each over the past two weeks, more than 10 times their original cost, according to a source familiar with the matter. </p><p>\n               (Reporting by Che Pan in Beijing and Wen-Yee Lee in Taipei; Writing by Brenda Goh; Editing by Jacqueline Wong and Thomas Derpinghaus)</p><p>\n            By Che  Pan and Wen-Yee Lee</p></div>",

The company specializes in technologies for sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other respiratory conditions, offering cloud-connected devices and AI-powered software to enhance home healthcare.</p><p>\nResMed operates in over 140 countries and its platforms, such as myAir and AirView, support millions of users and clinicians, emphasizing innovation and data-driven care. Net sales are divided among medical devices (51.8%), masks (35.7%), and software as a service (12.5%).

Revenue distribution: U.S., Canada, &amp; Latin America (58%), Europe, Asia, &amp; Other (30%), and RCS (12%).</p><!-- Article --><h2>\nInnovative AirTouch N30i mask</h2><p>\nResMed Inc. has cemented its reputation for innovation in medical technology by winning two prestigious 2025 Red Dot Design Awards for its AirTouch N30i nasal cradle mask, recognized in both the Innovative Products and Medical Design &amp; Healthcare categories. The AirTouch N30i, launched in October 2024, introduces ResMed's first-ever nasal cushion made from fabric fused with silicone for enhanced comfort, breathability, and therapy adherence.</p><p>\nIn clinical studies, users rated the mask a perfect 10 out of 10 for comfort features. ResMed now boasts a global portfolio of 10,000 patents and designs, underscoring its leadership in sleep and respiratory care technology.</p><h2>\nImproved cash flow</h2><p>\nResMed reported strong performance over FY 22-25, with a revenue CAGR of 12.9%, reaching 5.2 billion US dollars in FY 25, driven by robust demand for its sleep and respiratory devices and strong unit sales of masks and accessories. EBIT rose at a CAGR of 19.0% to USD 1.7bn, with margins expanding from 28.0% to 32.8%, aided by favorable product mix.</p><p>\nFCF rose significantly from USD 131m to USD 1.2bn over FY 22-25. This improvement was aided by cash from operations which rose from USD 351m to USD 1.8bn. In addition, cash and cash equivalent increased from USD 274m to USD 1.2bn. Total debt decreased from USD 918m to USD 852m. This led to improved gearing from 27.3% to 14.3%.</p><p>\nMoreover, in Q1 26, revenue and income from operations saw significant growth, with revenue increasing notably. Gross margin improved substantially, with strong EPS and CFO. Non-GAAP metrics also showed impressive gains.</p><p>\nIn comparison, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, a local peer, reported a revenue CAGR of 1.3% over FY 21-24, reaching USD 5.4bn in FY 24. However, EBIT declined at a CAGR of minus 2.3% to USD 1.5bn, with margins expanding from 30.3% in FY 21 to 27.2% in FY 24.</p><h2>\nOptimistic analyst views</h2><p>\nOver the past 12 months, the company's stock has delivered modest returns of approximately 3.8%. In comparison, Edwards Lifesciences' stock delivered higher returns of around 21.6% over the same period.</p><p>\nResMed is currently trading at a P/E of 24.0x, based on the FY 26 estimated EPS of USD 10.5, which is lower than its 3-year historical average of 30.2x and Edwards Lifesciences' P/E of 35.2x. The company is currently trading at EV/EBIT multiple of 17.6x, based on FY 26 estimated EBIT of USD 2.0bn, which is lower than its 3-year historical average of 22.5x and Edwards Lifesciences (28.0x).</p><p>\nResMed is monitored by the 18 analysts, with 11 having 'Buy' ratings and seven having 'Hold' ratings for an average target price of USD 295.8, implying 17.3% upside potential over the current market price.</p><p>\nConsensus estimates a revenue CAGR of 7.7%, reaching USD 6.4bn over FY 25-28. EBIT is estimated to rise at a CAGR of 10.3% to USD 2.4bn with margins expanding by 250bp to 36.8%. Net profit estimated at a CAGR of 9.9% to USD 1.9bn, while EPS is expected to increase to USD 12.8 in FY 28 from USD 9.5 in FY 25. Analysts estimate an EBIT CAGR of 10.8% but net profit to decline at a CAGR of minus 25.2% for Insulet Corporation.</p><p>\nOverall, ResMed demonstrates strong growth and innovation, solidifying its leadership in digital health and medical devices. Despite facing competitive pressures and market risks, its robust financial performance, impressive product portfolio, and optimistic analyst outlook suggest a promising future. Continued investment in technology and strategic management will be crucial for maintaining its market position.</p><p>\nHowever, ResMed faces risks including market normalization, supply chain challenges, and rising costs. Its narrow competitive moat requires ongoing innovation investment. Potential downturns in healthcare spending or regulatory changes could impact its strong market position and growth trajectory.</p></div>",
