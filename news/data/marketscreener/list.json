This recommendation covers children aged 2 to 11 years with moderate-to-severe CSU, an inadequate response to histamine-1 antihistamines (H1AH) and who are naïve to anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) therapy for CSU. A final decision is expected in the coming months.</p><p>The positive CHMP opinion in young children is supported by data from the LIBERTY-CUPID clinical trial program, including two Phase 3 trials, Study A and Study C, in which children aged 6 to 11 years participated, and the single-arm, CUPIDKids Phase 3 trial in children aged 2 to 11 years with CSU.Dupixent is approved for CSU in certain adults and adolescents in several jurisdictions, including the United States (U.S.), the EU and Japan. In the U.S., a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) has been accepted for review seeking approval for Dupixent in certain children aged 2 to 11 years with CSU. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decision is expected by April 2026.</p><!-- Article --><p>The safety and efficacy of Dupixent for CSU in adults and adolescents have not been fully evaluated outside of jurisdictions where it has been approved. The safety and efficacy of Dupixent for CSU in children aged 2 to 11 years have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.</p></div>",
