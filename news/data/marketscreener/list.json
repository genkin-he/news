(CNT E.P.), Ecuador's national telecommunications operator, have officially launched the country's first commercial 5G network, marking a major step in its digital transformation. Powered by Nokia's 5G technology, the network delivers speeds of up to 1.5 Gbps--10 times faster than 4G--and ultra-low latency, enabling seamless streaming, rapid downloads and reliable connectivity for more Ecuadorians. The rollout will pave the way for new digital services and innovation in strategic areas such as virtual education, telemedicine, smart cities, connected mobility and the Internet of Things (IoT).</p><p>Building on CNT's current 4G network, the deployment includes 188 5G sites in Guayaquil, the city in Ecuador, and other regions as Samborondon, Daule, Duran, Manta, Portoviejo, Salinas, and Santa Elena, operating in the N78, 3.5 GHz band. This initiative supports the Ecuadorian government's digital transformation policy and was developed in coordination with the Ministry of Telecommunications and the Information Society to expand access to high-speed coverage nationwide by mid-2026, enabling a more inclusive and sustainable digital society. Nokia will supply equipment from its AirScale Radio Access Network (RAN) portfolio, designed to deliver superior performance and energy efficiency.</p><!-- Article --><p>The comprehensive suite includes a pre-integrated, portable, outdoor 'all-in-one' cabinet solution engineered to significantly minimize energy consumption, alongside cutting-edge Massive MIMO radios, baseband, and remote radio head (RRH) solutions. Nokia's AirScale portfolio is powered by its energy-efficient ReefShark System-on-Chip technology for maximum performance, efficiency and reliability. CNT will also benefit from Nokia's AI-powered intelligent network management system, MantaRay NM, offering a consolidated network view.</p><p>Nokia will also integrate its best-in-class IP routing and optical transport solutions into CNT's 5G network. This addition will enable seamless data transmission across dynamic wireless environments, reducing latency and packet loss to ensure consistent and reliable connectivity. The solution leverages Nokia's Network Services Platform (NSP); an open, modular system that automates the operation of transport networks using advanced features to support critical applications such as emergency communications and smart city infrastructure.</p><p>As a B2B technology innovation leader, the company are pioneering networks that sense, think and act by leveraging work across mobile, fixed and cloud networks. In addition, create value with intellectual property and long-term research, led by the award-winning Nokia Bell Labs, which is celebrating 100 years of innovation. With truly open architectures that seamlessly integrate into any ecosystem, high-performance networks create new opportunities for monetization and scale.</p><p>Service providers, enterprises and partners worldwide trust Nokia to deliver secure, reliable and sustainable networks today - and work with to create the secure, reliable and sustainable networks.</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Kirk Maltais </p><br/><p>\n  --Wheat for December delivery fell 1.5% to $5.24 1/2 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade Thursday, as market participants focused on soybeans following trade talks between the U.S. and China. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  --Corn for December delivery fell 1% to $4.29 3/4 a bushel. </p><p>\n\n  --Soybeans for January delivery rose 1.1% to $11.06 1/2 a bushel. </p><br/><p>\n  HIGHLIGHTS </p><br/><p>\n  Left Unsaid: Reports about the agricultural part of the U.S.-China trade truce mention China will resume buying U.S. soybean exports, but don't disclose information on corn or wheat, which pressured prices today. \"Corn and wheat not only were left out of the trade agreement, but also have a negative seasonal tendency beginning in early November,\" Midwest Market Solutions'  Brian Hoops said. \"Without news from the trade agreement, positive fundamental information is lacking for corn and even more so for wheat.\" </p><p>\n\n  Good Showing: Indications that China plans to purchase 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans this year, along with 25 million tons annually for the next three years, pushed CBOT soybean futures up over the $11 a bushel mark overnight. It's the first time that threshold has been passed since July 2024. President Trump posted on Truth Social that he \"had a truly great meeting with President Xi of China,\" mentioning that China agreed to purchase \"massive amounts of Soybeans, Sorghum, and other Farm products.\" Further details were scant throughout the day. </p><br/><p>\n  INSIGHT </p><br/><p>\n  Different Scenario: China isn't looking to build its livestock herds, but instead move more animals through its meat-processing pipeline. That may become a big factor influencing how CBOT soybeans trade, more so than promises made during this week's meetings between the U.S. and China. \"Amid a massive liquidation of their hog herd, [we doubt] that China wants to import greater tonnages of soybeans in 2025/26,\" AgResource said in a note. The firm also adds that Brazilian prices remain more competitive, making the U.S. a less-favored alternative until margins ease. </p><p>\n\n  Delayed Reaction: Aid payments that have been directed to farmers in the wake of U.S. trading disputes with numerous partners may be slowing down what would otherwise be a necessary change in the input costs for farmers to plant every spring. In a report this week, analysts with Rabobank said payments coming from the Trump Administration may be creating this delay. If land values alone were to backtrack from current levels, then the price competitiveness of U.S. soybeans would be closer to par with that of soybeans out of Brazil's Mato Grosso region, Rabobank said. </p><br/><p>\n  AHEAD </p><br/><p>\n  Note: The government shutdown is impacting the timing of USDA reports and data releases. </p><p>\n\n  --AGCO Corp. will release its third quarter earnings report at 7:30 a.m. ET Friday. </p><p>\n\n  --Zoetis Inc. will release its third quarter earnings report at 7 a.m. ET Tuesday. </p><p>\n\n  --Mosaic Co. will release its third quarter earnings report after the  stock market closes on Tuesday. </p><br/><p>\n   Write to Kirk Maltais at kirk.maltais@wsj.com </p><p>\n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-30-25 1544ET</p></div>",
