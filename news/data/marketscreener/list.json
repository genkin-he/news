But Israeli intelligence detected a meeting on Saturday morning, and the strikes were moved forward, the sources said.</p><p>\n              The location of the meeting was not immediately clear.</p><p>\n              But Khamenei's high-security compound in Tehran was struck at the beginning of the operation, and satellite imagery reviewed by Reuters confirmed that it had been destroyed.</p><p>\n              The impact of Khamenei's death remained to be seen.</p><p>\n              But in a pre-attack assessment, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency concluded that he could be replaced by IRGC hardliners, according to two sources briefed on the intelligence. </p><p></p><p> (Reporting by Jonathan Landay, Phil Stewart, Gram Slattery in Washington and Parisa Hafezi in Dubai.
