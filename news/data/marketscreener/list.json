            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>Feb 26 (Reuters) - Warner Bros Discovery said Paramount Skydance's revised $31-a-share offer was superior to its existing deal with Netflix, giving the streaming giant four business days to respond or walk away from the bidding war for the coveted Hollywood studio. </p><p>\n              The high-stakes battle could be in its final stretch after the announcement on Thursday. Netflix had earlier this month granted Warner Bros a seven-day waiver to seek a \"best and final offer\" from Paramount for the company.</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              Pursuant to the terms of the Netflix merger agreement, this notice initiates a four-business-day period during which Netflix may propose revisions to the agreement, Warner Bros said.</p><p>\n              Shares of Paramount Skydance were up more than 1.5% in extended trading.</p><p>\n              Netflix, which is looking to buy Warner Bros' streaming and studio businesses, agreed in December to pay $27.75 a share, saying the offer, along with a planned spinoff of Warner Bros' cable assets, would deliver a greater shareholder value.</p><p>\n              The bid partly depends on the debt level of those assets, which would be separately listed as Discovery Global, as well as the company's equity value once it starts trading. </p><p>\n              Estimates of Discovery Global's value vary greatly. Warner Bros said it could fetch between $1.33 and $6.86 a share, but Paramount said it is almost worthless.</p><p>\n              MoffettNathanson analysts had said a Paramount bid of $34 a share would have ended debate about Discovery Global's value. </p><p>\n              In its revised bid, Paramount raised the termination fee it would pay should the deal fail to gain regulatory approval, to $7 billion from $5.8 billion. </p><p><b>NETFLIX'S FINANCIAL MUSCLE </b></p><p>\n              With about $9.03 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of December, the creator of \"Stranger Things\" has ample financial muscle to raise its offer.</p><p>\n              Either deal will reshape the power structure of Hollywood by handing the suitor one of the industry's most-coveted studios and an extensive content library, as well as lucrative entertainment franchises such as \"Game of Thrones\" and DC Comics.</p><p>\n              Paramount has argued it has a clearer path to U.S. regulatory approval than Netflix and had indicated that if Warner Bros rejects the new bid, it would be ready to launch a board challenge at this year's annual meeting.</p><p>\n              One of Paramount's director candidates could be a big shareholder in Warner Bros, hedge fund Pentwater Capital Management CEO Matthew Halbower said.</p><p>\n              Activist investor Ancora Holdings, which owns a small stake in Warner Bros, has also stepped up pressure on the HBO owner by saying the company did not adequately engage with Paramount.</p><p>\n              Warner Bros has previously said its board has a track record of acting in the best interests of the company and shareholders.</p><p>\n               (Reporting by Aditya Soni and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)</p></div>",

The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) outlines a roadmap to commercial fusion in Europe that begins with building demonstration stellarator Alpha near the Max Planck Institute for plasma Physics (IPP) in Garching. When operational in the 2030s, Alpha will become the first stellarator to demonstrate net energy gain, meaning its plasma will generate more energy than it consumes.</p><p>The demonstration stellarator will additionally allow Proxima and its partners to test and validate key fusion technologies under real-world conditions and in shorter development cycles, accelerating the path to building the first stellarator fusion power plant, Stellaris. Site secured for Stellaris power plant: The Stellaris commercial power plant is planned for the site of a former nuclear fission power plant in Gundremmingen, currently being decommissioned by RWE. This agreement marks Europe's first major step toward commercial fusion power, as the continent's leadership in fusion research moves into industrial deployment.</p><!-- Article --><p>Alpha and Stellaris will together create thousands of jobs and supplier contracts for European manufacturers and engineers, from construction and manufacturing to advanced electrical, magnet systems, and more. The long-term aim is to make fusion an integral part of Europe's energy system, reduce dependence on imported energy, and, for the first time, apply Europe's fusion expertise to a grid-connected commercial project. Under the MoU, the free State of Bavaria, Proxima Fusion, RWE and IPP will work together on site selection, permitting and regulatory processes, project structure, and financing.</p><p>IPP will lead on plasma physics and the scientific leadership of demonstration stellarator Alpha. Proxima Fusion will lead on engineering, public procurement processes, and construction. RWE will contribute its extensive experience in the construction and operation of complex power plant facilities, as well as its strong global industrial network.</p><p>Proxima intends to finance approximately 20% of the project's total costs through private international investors. Subject to federal funding, the Free State of Bavaria has indicated a potential state co-financing contribution of 20%. RWE has also signaled its willingness to participate financially within the framework of the MoU.</p><p>All four partners are pooling their efforts to maximize chances of success in securing federal funding under the High-Tech Agenda Germany.</p></div>",
