Revenue jumped 54% year-on-year to $17.6bn, well above the $16.01bn anticipated. Adjusted EPS reached $7.02, compared with $5.69 expected. These exceptional results prompted the group to raise its annual forecasts, with revenue now expected between $63bn and $63.5bn for 2025, and adjusted EPS of $23 to $23.70.Â </p><p>\nSales of Mounjaro, a treatment for type 2 diabetes, more than doubled in one year, reaching $6.52bn, while sales of Zepbound, a weight loss drug, grew 184% to $3.57bn. In the US, overall sales rose 45%, driven by a sharp increase in prescription volumes. Net income for the quarter was $5.58bn, compared with $970m a year earlier. The stock is currently up over 2%.</p><!-- Article --><p>\nBuilding on its lead in the GLP-1 treatment market, Eli Lilly continues to strengthen its position with strategic partnerships, such as the one announced with <a href=\"/quote/stock/WALMART-INC-4841/\" onclick=\"gaEvent('Out', 'zonebourse', '51502533');\">Walmart</a> to facilitate access to Zepbound.

They posted comparable sales growth of 4.2% and 6.5%, respectively. Burger King comparative sales rose 3.1%. </p><p>\n\n  The results come as budget-conscious consumers pull back on spending. While higher-priced fast-casual chains like Chipotle--which recently cut guidance on the back of slowing sales--are feeling the squeeze, traditional quick-service restaurants appear to be shrugging off the pressure. </p><p>\n\n  Restaurant Brands, as well as other major quick-service players like Yum Brands, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut, have seen their sales pick up, suggesting that diners could be trading down to the more value-based offerings of fast-food restaurants rather than forgoing eating out entirely. </p><p>\n\n  In an investor call Thursday, management said consumer habits across income levels have remained largely stable throughout the year. While noting a slight softness among lower and middle-income groups, management said this trend is not new and that its third-quarter results reflect a year-long focus on delivering consistent value in that environment. </p><p>\n\n  Net income in the third quarter rose to $315 million, or 96 cents a share, up from $252 million, or 79 cents a share, in the prior-year period. On an adjusted basis, earnings per-share of $1.03 came in better than expected as well. </p><p>\n\n  Tim Hortons' system-wide sales growth was 4.8% to $2.03 billion, while Burger King's was 2.3% to $2.96 billion. As for the Popeyes brand, it posted system-wide sales growth of 0.7% to $1.52 billion, and Firehouse Subs reported 11% growth to $332 million. The international segment rose just over 12% to $5.45 billion. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Adriano Marchese at adriano.marchese@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-30-25 1043ET</p></div>",
