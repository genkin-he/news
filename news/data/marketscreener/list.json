            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>MOSCOW, Feb 26 (Reuters) - The rouble is set to tumble by nearly a quarter this year after the government, faced with falling energy revenues, announced plans to save more money in a yuan-denominated fiscal reserve fund, a top Russian banker and analysts said on Thursday.</p><p>\n              However, a weaker rouble, which has long been seen as overvalued, will bolster the state budget's revenues from oil sales, helping the government to deal with a growing deficit. It will also prop up revenues of exporting companies, a potential boost to Russia's flagging economic growth.</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              Russia's deteriorating finances, caused by Western pressure on its oil sales, may add some urgency to slow-moving, U.S.-mediated peace talks with Ukraine, in which Washington is offering major economic incentives to both sides.</p><p>\n              German Gref, the powerful CEO of Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, said the rouble has no chance to remain as strong as in 2025, when it rallied by 45% against the dollar. He said the currency could tumble by 23% from its current level of 77 to the dollar, to end the year around 100.</p><p>\n              \"This year, I don't see any chance of having such a strong rouble. It is counterproductive by all conceivable and inconceivable measures. It's counterintuitive, and everything else you can think of,\" Gref told a conference call after Sberbank's 2025 results announcement.</p><p>\n              Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Wednesday the government would divert more money into the fiscal reserve fund to prevent its depletion. That implies reduced foreign currency sales by the state, a factor that has supported the rouble.</p><p>\n              Operations by the government and the central bank currently account for over one-tenth of Russia's thin foreign currency market. The government and the central bank have been criticised for propping up the rouble.</p><p>\n              \"This means that the volumes of currency sales from the National Wealth Fund may decrease in the future, which in turn means that the support for the rouble from the budgetary mechanism will weaken,\" Alfa Bank analysts said. At the start of February, analysts in a Reuters poll saw the rouble at 88 to the dollar in 12 months.  </p><p><b>'ROUTINE DIFFICULTIES'</b></p><p>\n              Siluanov's announcement came a day after a late-night, hours-long meeting between President Vladimir Putin and top government and central bank officials on how to deal with the budget deficit and a sanctions-related fall in energy revenues.</p><p>\n              The Kremlin said on Thursday the sharp fall in these revenues, which were down by 24% in 2025 and halved in February in year-on-year terms, as well as the growing budget deficit, were \"routine difficulties\" that could be fixed thanks to overall macroeconomic stability.</p><p>\n              Sberbank released an optimistic economic outlook for 2026, projecting growth between 1% and 1.5%, above the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) estimate of 0.8%, with Gref arguing that a weaker rouble would prove an important factor.</p><p>\n              \"It is not possible to definitively assess the dynamics of economic growth for the full year in February. It will depend on a number of factors, including the dynamics of the rouble exchange rate,\" Gref said.</p><p>\n              Russia's economic growth slowed sharply in 2025 due to prohibitive interest rates, which stalled investment. Gref said investment and growth would resume when the central bank's key interest rate falls to 12% from the current 15.5%.</p><p>\n              The rallying rouble and the high key rate have helped the central bank bring inflation down.</p><p>\n              Some central bank board members at a rate-setting meeting on February 13 warned that a weaker rouble and falling oil revenues created inflationary risks, according to the minutes, published on Thursday.</p><p>\n               (Writing by Gleb Bryanski; Editing by Mark Trevelyan and Gareth Jones)</p><p>\n            By Elena Fabrichnaya and Gleb Bryanski</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>WASHINGTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - The average rate on the popular U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell below 6% this week for the first time in 3-1/2 years, but economists said the improvement was likely temporary and on its own insufficient to boost housing demand unless supply increased.</p><p>\n              The 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 5.98%, the lowest level since September 2022, from 6.01% last week, mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac said on Thursday. It averaged 6.76% during the same period a year ago. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n              The drop followed a decline in the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield after the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday struck down President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, which he had pursued under a law meant for use in national emergencies. </p><p>\n              Trump swiftly imposed a 10% global tariff for 150 days to replace some of the emergency duties, before raising the rate to 15% over the weekend. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage tracks the 10-year Treasury yield.</p><p>\n              \"This legal tug-of-war has triggered a flight to safety among investors, pushing bond prices higher and yields lower, helping mortgage rates settle around 6%,\" said Jiayi Xu, an economist at Realtor.com. \"However, as this week's decline stems from market volatility rather than fundamental economic data, more supportive economic data is needed to establish a consistent trend.\"</p><p>\n              Trump ordered the Federal Housing Finance Agency - which oversees Freddie Mac and another mortgage finance giant Fannie Mae - to purchase $200 billion of bonds issued by the two companies to help lower the cost of home loans. </p><p>\n              But the average rate on the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to 5.44% this week from 5.35% in the prior week. It averaged 5.94% during the same period a year ago. </p><p><b>SUPPLY IS KEY FOR THE HOUSING MARKET</b></p><p>\n              Economists are skeptical that mortgage purchases will significantly improve housing affordability.</p><p>\n              Minutes of the Federal Reserve's January 27-28 policy meeting published last week, describing a briefing by a New York Fed official responsible for implementing monetary policy, noted that plans by the administration to buy mortgage bonds had caused \"a notable decline in mortgage-backed securities yields relative to those on comparable-maturity Treasury yields.\"</p><p>\n              Despite that move in the market, the official \"observed that the decline was unlikely to result in a material increase in mortgage refinancing because current mortgage rates are well above the weighted average rate of outstanding mortgages,\" the minutes said.</p><p>\n              Trump is under pressure to bring down costs, including for housing, as he and his fellow Republicans face a tough battle to retain control of the U.S. Congress in this year's mid-term elections. Economists and policymakers say a dearth of properties for sale, especially starter homes, was weighing on the housing market. </p><p>\n              The inventory of previously owned houses is well below its pre-pandemic level. Many homeowners hold mortgages with rates below 5%, creating what has been called a rate-lock. </p><p>\n              Though supply improved last year, progress has stalled. There have been reports of homeowners pulling their houses off the market because of lower prices. House prices increased 1.8% in the 12 months through December after climbing 2.1% in November, the Federal Housing Finance Agency said on Tuesday. </p><p>\n              Economists and trade groups say the Trump administration's trade and immigration policies, which have raised prices for building materials and appliances and undercut labor supply, were constraining builders' ability to break ground on new single-family housing projects. Building lots are also scarce amid state and local government regulations.</p><p>\n              Still, the slowdown in the 30-year fixed mortgage rate could encourage some potential sellers to list their homes, and draw prospective home buyers into the market.</p><p>\n              \"While buying power has already increased $30,000 from last year, mortgage rates below 6% could be an important psychological threshold,\" said Kara Ng, senior economist at Zillow. \"Round numbers matter, and that headline alone could prompt many sidelined buyers to take another peek at the housing market.\" </p><p></p><p>(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani, additional reporting by Michael S.
