Netflix had earlier this month granted Warner Bros a seven-day waiver to seek a \"best and final offer\" from Paramount for the company.</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              Pursuant to the terms of the Netflix merger agreement, this notice initiates a four-business-day period during which Netflix may propose revisions to the agreement, Warner Bros said.</p><p>\n              Shares of Paramount Skydance were up more than 1.5% in extended trading.</p><p>\n              Netflix, which is looking to buy Warner Bros' streaming and studio businesses, agreed in December to pay $27.75 a share, saying the offer, along with a planned spinoff of Warner Bros' cable assets, would deliver a greater shareholder value.</p><p>\n              The bid partly depends on the debt level of those assets, which would be separately listed as Discovery Global, as well as the company's equity value once it starts trading. </p><p>\n              Estimates of Discovery Global's value vary greatly. Warner Bros said it could fetch between $1.33 and $6.86 a share, but Paramount said it is almost worthless.</p><p>\n              MoffettNathanson analysts had said a Paramount bid of $34 a share would have ended debate about Discovery Global's value. </p><p>\n              In its revised bid, Paramount raised the termination fee it would pay should the deal fail to gain regulatory approval, to $7 billion from $5.8 billion. </p><p><b>NETFLIX'S FINANCIAL MUSCLE </b></p><p>\n              With about $9.03 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of December, the creator of \"Stranger Things\" has ample financial muscle to raise its offer.</p><p>\n              Either deal will reshape the power structure of Hollywood by handing the suitor one of the industry's most-coveted studios and an extensive content library, as well as lucrative entertainment franchises such as \"Game of Thrones\" and DC Comics.</p><p>\n              Paramount has argued it has a clearer path to U.S. regulatory approval than Netflix and had indicated that if Warner Bros rejects the new bid, it would be ready to launch a board challenge at this year's annual meeting.</p><p>\n              One of Paramount's director candidates could be a big shareholder in Warner Bros, hedge fund Pentwater Capital Management CEO Matthew Halbower said.</p><p>\n              Activist investor Ancora Holdings, which owns a small stake in Warner Bros, has also stepped up pressure on the HBO owner by saying the company did not adequately engage with Paramount.</p><p>\n              Warner Bros has previously said its board has a track record of acting in the best interests of the company and shareholders.</p><p>\n               (Reporting by Aditya Soni and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)</p></div>",
