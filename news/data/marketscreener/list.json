            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Emese Bartha </p><br/><p>\n  Japanese policymakers will need to strike a delicate balance as they seek to stabilize the yen and keep debt services costs on Japan's significant debt manageable, Eva Sun-Wai, fund manager at M&amp;G Investments said. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  Japan's government plans aggressive fiscal stimulus to protect the country's fragile domestic growth. At the same time, the central bank will likely need to raise interest rates to fight persistent inflation. </p><p>\n\n  They will need to do this without increasing the national debt, which is estimated between 235% and 250% of GDP. </p><p>\n\n  \"Japan has always had quite a difficult combination of needing to keep interest rates low so that they don't massively increase their debt servicing costs but not keeping rates so low that the currency deteriorates meaningfully,\" she said. </p><p>\n\n  This balancing act was recently tested when long-dated Japanese government bond yields surged to record highs ahead of the Lower House election on Feb. 8 due to investor concerns over potentially unsustainable fiscal stimulus. </p><p>\n\n  Yields have since retreated. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's landslide victory ensured political stability. It reinforced her mandate to pursue expansive fiscal policies, but Takaichi has repeatedly stressed that her government will act fiscally responsibly. </p><p>\n\n  The Japanese yen has also recovered after falling to an 18-month low of 159.45 yen per U.S. dollar in mid-January, LSEG data show. The dollar last traded at 155.96 yen. </p><p>\n\n  One of the main risks Sun-Wai sees is of potential for large-scale repatriation of offshore assets--including U.S. Treasurys--back into Japanese government bonds as the Bank of Japan increases interest rates from their current low level of 0.75% and yields rise. </p><p>\n\n  Such a move could be disruptive, potentially causing big selling in U.S. Treasurys, especially as the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates further, she says. However, she considers this a low risk. </p><p>\n\n  \"I don't see the repatriation flow argument as rapid a risk as people say,\" she said. \"I still see it a risk, but I don't think it would happen quickly.\" </p><p>\n\n  A weak yen and negative real yields are among the factors that would discourage rapid asset repatriation, she said. </p><p>\n\n  Most Japanese investors are structural, long?term holders of offshore government bonds for liability-management reasons. These positions aren't leveraged, so there is no risk of rapid margin-call dynamics, she said. </p><p>\n\n  External factors which could prompt big selling in U.S. Treasurys and the dollar do pose a risk, however. </p><p>\n\n  These could include the Fed cutting rates more aggressively than expected by markets, U.S. policy uncertainty and Fed independence risks. Still, Fed independence concerns have receded with former Fed governor Kevin Warsh's nomination to Fed Chair, she said. </p><p>\n\n  Given entrenched inflation in Japan, the BOJ \"will likely need to embark on some sort of rate hike cycle, even if it's very slow and steady,\" she said. </p><p>\n\n  \"Even if it means that it's just to give them room in the next downturn so that they can cut [rates] and stimulate the economy.\" </p><p>\n\n  BOJ rate hikes will likely result in a 'bear flattening' of the Japanese bond yield curve, Sun-Wai said. This is where short-term rates rise faster than long-term rates, usually due to expectations of central bank interest-rate hikes. U.S. Treasurys show the opposite trend, with the yield curve steepening. </p><p>\n\n  Japan is now shifting from a trend over the last few decades, when it favoured bolster economic growth via a weaker yen which in turn bolstered exports, Sun-Wai said. </p><p>\n\n  M&amp;G Investments had 365 billion pounds ($491.63 billion) in assets under management as at Sept. 30, 2025. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Emese Bartha at emese.bartha@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  02-27-26 1009ET</p></div>",

Both groups have announced the creation of a runtime environment based on OpenAI's models, which will be available via Amazon Bedrock. This infrastructure is intended to enable AWS customers to design, deploy and manage applications as well as generative AI agents. <br/><br/>As part of the deal, AWS will become the exclusive third-party cloud distribution provider for OpenAI Frontier. Companies will be able to rely on Amazon's infrastructure to build and orchestrate teams of artificial intelligence agents. OpenAI and AWS are also expanding their existing multi-year agreement, increasing it from $38bn to $100bn over eight years. The extension notably aims for OpenAI to use about 2 gigawatts of Trainium capacity via AWS infrastructure, further strengthening technological integration between both partners. <br/><br/>The new agreement comes after a major Amazon investment in OpenAI during the start-up's latest fundraising round. The companies said Amazon's total $50bn commitment would first take the form of an initial $15bn investment, followed by another $35bn \"in the coming months, once certain conditions are met.\"</p></div>",
