            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Kirk Maltais </p><br/><p>\n  --Wheat for December delivery rose 1.8% to $5.33 1/4 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade Friday, as traders got their books in order on the last business day of the month. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  --Soybeans for January delivery rose 0.7% to $11.15 1/2 a bushel. </p><p>\n\n  --Corn for December delivery rose 0.3% to $4.31 1/2 a bushel. </p><br/><p>\n  HIGHLIGHTS </p><br/><p>\n  Leading the Push: CBOT grains rallied in afternoon trading despite the U.S. dollar showing strength throughout the day, with the WSJ Dollar Index up 0.2%. Typically, a stronger U.S. dollar makes U.S. grain exports less attractive for global customers versus the exports of other countries. Seemingly outweighing this uptick in the dollar is the desire of traders to get their books in order ahead of the weekend, said Brady Huck of Advance Trading. </p><p>\n\n  The Next Episode: The agricultural market is now looking past the U.S.-China deal and spent the day searching for the next major mover of futures. \"Grain action and volume slowed considerably overnight with the U.S.-China trade deal having come and gone,\" said Matt Zeller of StoneX in a note. Zeller adds that with the government shut down, it will be difficult for traders and analysts to get confirmation of whether or not China is following through with promised purchases, although reports of cargoes did circulate today. </p><br/><p>\n  INSIGHT </p><br/><p>\n  Going the Distance: Some analysts are unsure if soybean purchasing under the pending U.S.-China trade truce will take place as promised, even amid reports of Chinese buyers securing some new soybean cargoes. One reason is because there are no penalties described to enforce China's purchasing of 12 million metric tons of soybeans in this marketing year, along with 25 million tons of soybeans annually for the following three years. \"Whether China secures 25 MMTs in future years depends on the price relationships between South America and the U.S.\" AgResource said in a note. \"China buys what China needs at the cheapest price offered -- it's that simple.\" </p><p>\n\n  Dried Out: The U.S. Drought Monitor, which has remained in operation through the government shutdown, is showing dryness spread throughout the eastern Corn Belt states. Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri all have small pockets of extreme or exceptional drought, according to the latest map, but also large areas of dry conditions ranging from abnormally dry to severe drought. The USDA's Crop Progress report has not been published since late September, so traders and analysts are unsure of crop conditions through the harvest -- but the dryness likely hasn't helped those conditions. </p><br/><p>\n  AHEAD </p><br/><p>\n  Note: The government shutdown is impacting the timing of USDA reports and data releases. </p><p>\n\n  -Zoetis Inc. will release its third quarter earnings report at 7 a.m. ET Tuesday. </p><p>\n\n  -Mosaic Co. will release its third quarter earnings report after the  stock market closes on Tuesday. </p><p>\n\n  -Tyson Foods Co. will release its fourth quarter earnings report at 7:30 a.m. ET Monday. </p><br/><p>\n   Write to Kirk Maltais at kirk.maltais@wsj.com </p><p>\n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-31-25 1519ET</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Paul Vieira </p><br/><p>\n  Energy envoys from the Group of Seven economies unveiled in Toronto on Friday about two dozen deals aimed at unlocking billions worth of critical minerals. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  Canadian Energy and Resources Minister Tim Hodgson said the transactions mark a coordinated effort to counter China's dominance in the field. </p><p>\n\n  \"We are serious about reducing market concentration and dependencies, safeguarding national security and sovereignty, mobilizing capital and driving investments in sustainable critical minerals projects,\" he said, according to prepared remarks he was scheduled to deliver. Canada is leading the G7 presidency this year. </p><p>\n\n  The deals include offtake agreements, in which there's a commitment to buy a miner's production, and stockpiling pacts, in which a party agrees to acquire and store production for future use. Some of the Canada-focused deals include financing for Nouveau Monde Graphite's mine near Montreal, and Rio Tinto's scandium plant in Quebec. </p><p>\n\n  Hodgson added that Italian energy company Eni has indicated its intention to pursue critical minerals opportunities in Canada, such as lithium and graphite. </p><p>\n\n  Overall, he said the deals would unlock about $4.5 billion in critical-minerals projects. </p><p>\n\n  Meanwhile, Hodgson added Canada's cabinet had issued an order to designate critical minerals as \"essential to Canadian defense and national interests,\" thereby allowing Canada to launch its own defense-stockpiling regime. \"By protecting domestic production under volatile global conditions, we ensure a secure supply of critical minerals to Canadian and allied defence industries.\" </p><p>\n\n  Canada has tried to champion closer integration among the big Western developed economies on the production of critical minerals. Since the 1990s, China has used aggressive tactics to build up and maintain its lock over rare-earth minerals, which are essential to making magnets needed for cars, wind turbines, jet fighters and other products. </p><p>\n\n  China has imposed restrictions this year, including a sudden move in October to tighten curbs on rare-earth exports. In a meeting Thursday between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Beijing promised to ease some of the controls it imposed on exports of processed rare-earth minerals for one year. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-31-25 1515ET</p></div>",
