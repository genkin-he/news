            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>GSK plc announced that Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) has accepted for review a new drug application (NDA) for bepirovirsen, an investigational antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), for the treatment of adults with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Chronic hepatitis B is a major public health challenge, affecting more than 250 million people worldwide and nearly one million people in Japan. The current standard of care - nucleos(t)ide analogues - often requires lifelong therapy and the functional cure rates remain low, typically only 1%.</p><p>Functional cure occurs when the chronic hepatitis B virus DNA and viral protein - hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) - are at levels low enough to be undetectable in the blood for at least 24 weeks after stopping all treatment, and can be controlled by the immune system without medication. Functional cure is associated with significant reduction in the risk of long-term liver complications, including liver cancer. It is estimated that ~56% of liver cancer cases globally are caused by CHB.</p><!-- Article --><p>The regulatory submission is supported by positive results from the B-Well 1 and B-Well 2 Phase III trials, where bepirovirsen demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful functional cure rate. Functional cure rates were significantly higher with bepirovirsen plus standard of care compared with standard of care alone across all ranked endpoints, including in patients with lower baseline HBsAg levels where an even greater effect was observed. Bepirovirsen demonstrated an acceptable safety and tolerability profile consistent with previous studies.</p><p>The data are anticipated to be presented at a congress and submitted for scientific peer-reviewed publication in 2026. Bepirovirsen was granted SENKU designation in Japan in August 2024, reflecting its innovation and potential to address a disease with high unmet medical need. SENKU designation is intended to facilitate early patient access through an expedited regulatory review process.</p></div>",
