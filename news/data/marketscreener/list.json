At this stage, it is clear that the 2025 financial year will be less successful than 2024, with free cash flow expected to be below €1.5bn over twelve months—identical to the average of the last five years, which, hopefully, will not be an insurmountable horizon forever.</p><p>\nThe cloud and artificial intelligence are promising opportunities, of course, but Nokia is no stranger to broken promises. Since being knocked off its pedestal in mobile telephony by Apple and Samsung, the Finnish company has made numerous attempts at reinvention, without ever managing to convert the try.</p><p>\nA famous Anglo-Saxon stock market aphorism states that \"The four most expensive words in the English language are: This time it's different.\" Halo effect linked to commitment However, with Nvidia's stock market valuation now back to its 10-year high, investors are betting that this time will be different...</p></div>",

Miller </p><br/><p>\n  Merck reported higher third-quarter profit and boosted its full-year outlook, as demand for its flagship Keytruda cancer drug continues to rise. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  The pharmaceutical company reported net income of $5.79 billion, or $2.32 a share, up from $3.16 billion, or $1.24 a share, the year prior. </p><p>\n\n  Adjusted earnings were $2.58 a share. Analysts were expecting $2.35, according to FactSet. </p><p>\n\n  Revenue rose 4% to $17.28 billion, beating Wall Street's expectation of $16.97 billion. Keytruda sales rose 10% to $8.14 billion, with the company saying demand for the drug as a treatment for a wide range of cancers continues to be robust. </p><p>\n\n  Sales for its Gardasil vaccine for HPV fell 24% to $1.75 billion, primarily due to lower demand in China, while revenue from the company's animal health segment rose 9% to $1.62 billion, due to strength in livestock products. </p><p>\n\n  The company raised its full-year adjusted earnings guidance to $8.93 to $8.98 a share, up from its prior outlook of $8.87 to $8.97 a share. </p><p>\n\n  Merck narrowed its full-year sales guidance to $64.5 billion to $65 billion, compared with its previous forecast of $64.3 billion to $65.3 billion. </p><p>\n\n  Analysts see full-year sales of $64.66 billion and adjusted earnings of $8.91 a share. </p><p>\n\n  In July, the company said it would cut jobs and reduce real estate as part of a cost-cutting plan intended to redirect resources to new product launches. </p><p>\n\n  Merck's main U.S. patent for Keytruda expires in 2028, opening the door for lower-cost versions to cut into a significant portion of the company's sales. </p><p>\n\n  Last month, the FDA approved a form of Keytruda administered by injection rather than intravenously, which could help the company offset the impact of the patent expiration. Merck said the new form of the drug, called Qlex, would provide greater convenience as it can be offered in a wider variety of settings and can be given in one minute every three weeks as opposed to a 30-minute IV infusion. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Nicholas G.
