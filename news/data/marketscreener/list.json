At Week 148, in evaluable patients, the interim analysis showed that Nemluvio maintain long-term disease control with a consistent safety profile: Over 70% of patients achieved clear or almost clear skin lesions based on Investigator's Global Assessment score, and over 85% achieved more than 75% of healed lesions based on prurigo activity score.

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text article-text--clear\"><p>Japan’s electronics market reached 111.2 billion US dollars in 2023, rose to USD 116.2bn in 2024, and is projected to hit USD 162.7bn by 2032 at a 4.3% CAGR. This steady climb feels like a testament to a nation that has long married precision engineering with craftsmanship, a reputation that turns heads across shelves of consumer electronics.</p><p>\nThe industry’s spectrum, from smartphones and wearables to home appliances, audio-visual devices, and smart-home ecosystems, leans on that cultural insistence on meticulous design and innovation.</p><!-- Article --><p>\nToday’s trends deliver momentum while narrating smart devices, IoT integration, robotics, and next-generation audiovisual experiences that reshape daily life. Semiconductors dominate as the beating heart of automation, mobility, and industrial systems, yet consumer segments race ahead because of rising demand for connected living.</p><p>\nJapan’s strengths in advanced manufacturing, R&amp;D intensity, and cross-industry collaboration keep leaders such as Sony, Panasonic, Sharp, and Toshiba relevant, their names synonymous with quality and technological leadership.</p><p>\nLooking forward, domestic demand, AI-enabled devices, and Society 5.0 policies suggest the sector is expanding into smarter, integrated ecosystems. The country’s tradition of craftsmanship remains a competitive moat, reinforcing trust and premium positioning, while innovation and policy support ensure Japan stays a guiding light in the global consumer electronics story.</p><p>\nAmidst this evolving backdrop, Sony, founded in 1946, weaves entertainment, technology, and finance into a single narrative. Its Games &amp; Network Services craft worlds for PlayStation players, while Music and Movies orchestrate global hits. Electronics Products &amp; Solutions combine TVs, audio, cameras, and smartphones with Internet services, while Imaging &amp; Sensing Sensors power innovation. Finance and other ventures, from insurance to disc manufacturing, round out the story.</p><h2>\nPixels to profits</h2><p>\nAdding numbers to the tale: Across 9M 25, the group recorded revenue of JPY 9.4tn, which represented a decent 2.3% y/y uptick. Imaging &amp; Sensing Solutions provided momentum with stronger mobile image sensor shipments alongside favorable mix, while Music rode the continued swell of streaming, live events, and merchandising, and Game &amp; Network Services benefited from higher digital software and network services sales.</p><p>\nRiding this wave, operating income surged 21% y/y to JPY 1.3tn, lifting the operating margin by 210bp to 13.6%. The ripple effects reached net income, which climbed 13.1% y/y to JPY 961.7bn, and EPS, which rose to JPY 158.3 from JPY 139.2 a year earlier.</p><p>\nBuoyed by the sustained run, management refreshed its FY 25 outlook, projecting revenue of JPY 12.3tn, a 2.2% y/y rise, operating income of JPY 1.5tn, up 20.6% y/y, and net income of JPY 1.1tn, representing 5.9% y/y growth. Analysts will be watching whether this momentum can persist into later quarters.</p><h2>\nUptrend, upbeat</h2><p>\nInvestors are now watching a steady rally in the company's share price, which dropped 10.5%, nudging the market capitalization to JPY 19.6tn (USD 125.5bn). The firm is trading at a forward P/E of 17.4x, using 2026 earnings, in-line with the three-year average of 17.4x.</p><p>\nMarket watchers remain upbeat, tallying 20 'Buy' ratings and two 'Hold' calls, driving the average target price up to JPY 4,969.1, which implies a 50.9% upside from today's levels.</p><h2>\nBalancing act</h2><p>\nSony’s narrative remains compelling, with its diverse entertainment, sensing, and electronics businesses reinforcing the broader story of Japan’s precision-built comeback.</p><p>\nYet even as momentum hums, the plot thickens: shifting consumer tastes could temper demand for high-end gadgets, semiconductor bottlenecks may test supply discipline, and intense global competition pressures margins. Streaming and gaming also hinge on subscription sentiment, while regulatory scrutiny and geopolitical tensions continue to shadow cross-border operations.</p><p>\nThe tale of Sony’s resurgence will thus depend not only on its ability to stay creative and capital-efficient but also on navigating these quieter risks that could unsettle an otherwise steady climb.</p></div>",

This compares with a $4.8 billion result for 2025, which it described on Friday as a record high  and said reflects disciplined underwriting, strong investment returns and low large loss activity beyond the first quarter. </p><p>\n\n  \"Having completed the comprehensive review of underperforming portfolios in L&amp;H Re, all three of our business units are positioned to deliver consistent results,\" Chief Executive Officer Andreas Berger said.
