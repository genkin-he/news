            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>Rockwell Automation, Inc. announced the first autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) have officially rolled off the production line at its global headquarters in Milwaukee. The milestone marks a significant step for OTTO by Rockwell Automation, part of the company's 2023 acquisition of Clearpath Robotics, and reinforces Rockwell's commitment to advancing smart manufacturing through automation. The new 25,000 square feet OTTO production space at the Milwaukee campus is now assembling the OTTO 600 and OTTO 1200 AMRs, robots designed to move heavy materials safely and efficiently across busy factory floors and in tight spaces.</p><p>By reducing reliance on manual forklifts, the AMRs help manufacturers increase safety, improve transition times, minimize damage to goods, and create more resilient and sustainable operations. What makes these robots unique: Laser scanners scan the room more than 30 times per second, building a virtual map in their memory of the room around them. Through shared communication, each robot is aware of the other robots in the room and their locations, even around corners.</p><!-- Article --><p>Every OTTO AMR completes over 15 miles of driving before being considered ready to ship to the customer. Expanding OTTO production to Milwaukee is part of Rockwell's broader strategy to enhance manufacturing resiliency. Clearpath and OTTO will continue producing AMRs at their Canadian facilities in Ontario, while the Milwaukee operation adds capacity and proximity to U.S. customers.</p><p>This move follows Rockwell's recent announcement of a $2 billion investment in plants, digital infrastructure, and talent to grow share, build resilience, and expand margins. The new production space at Milwaukee headquarters is opening on schedule, just ahead of November's Automation Fair in Chicago. Customer tours of the OTTO Milwaukee space are expected to start in early 2026.</p></div>",

Powered by the Equifax Cloud??, the UC Power of Attorney Manager helps streamline the POA process, allowing employers to submit, track, and complete POAs across multiple entities digitally to help save time and reduce administrative burden.</p><p>When employers engage third-party experts to support their UC programs, they are typically required to complete POA forms provided by their state unemployment agencies. Each state has a POA process as part of its UC management. This makes the process more complex, especially for large employers with multiple entities and employees in multiple states, and in states where employers are required to register third-party administrators online.</p><!-- Article --><p>The UC Power of Attorney Manager consolidates POAs through a central portal, sorting documents by the state's signature requirements, using AI to review completed POAs for improved accuracy, and providing step-by-step instructions for each form, including steps for registering third party administrators online. This enables employers to reduce manual review, helping them respond to claims faster while improving accuracy with state requirements. The UC Power of attorney Manager, available now, joins the entire range of Equifax UC management services developed to help employers reduce unemployment risk and better control costs through more automation and stronger regulatory practices.</p><p>These are part of a broad portfolio of Equifax HR management solutions that help employers with their evolving payroll, tax management, and regulatory needs.</p></div>",
