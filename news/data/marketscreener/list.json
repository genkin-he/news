Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected adjusted earnings of $1.82 a share. </p><p>\n\n  Exxon attributed the lower earnings to weaker crude prices, bottom-of-cycle chemical margins, higher depreciation, growth costs and lower base volumes stemming from divestments. </p><p>\n\n  These headwinds were partially offset by volume growth in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oil field, where the company said it set a production record of nearly 1.7 million oil-equivalent barrels per day. At the Exxon-led project in Guyana, quarterly production surpassed 700,000 barrels per day. </p><p>\n\n  Exxon said it sent $9.4 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Connor Hart at connor.hart@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-31-25 0648ET</p></div>",
