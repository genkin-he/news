            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Matt Grossman </p><br/><p>\n  Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan pushed back on the Federal Reserve's quarter-point interest-rate cut this week, arguing that the risk of a slowing job market didn't justify swerving away from the task of corralling inflation. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  Speaking at a conference in Dallas Friday morning, Logan observed that weaker job creation hasn't led to a drastic rise in the unemployment rate, partly because the pool of people looking for work has ebbed. Meanwhile, she said, she isn't convinced inflation is on a firm track back toward the Fed's 2% target. </p><p>\n\n  That combination suggests the Fed should be more reluctant to cut rates to support the labor market with rate cuts, which weaken the Fed's anti-inflation stance, Logan said. </p><p>\n\n  Logan hasn't been a member of the Fed's policy committee this year, under the system that rotates votes annually among the Fed's 12 reserve-bank presidents. But she made it clear that if she had gotten a vote this week, she would have dissented against the Fed's cut. </p><p>\n\n  \"I would have preferred to hold interest rates steady,\" Logan said, according to a published version of her remarks. She said later in the speech that she is also skeptical that a further cut in December will be the right move. </p><p>\n\n  The Fed's decision to cut rates by a quarter point to a range of 3.75% to 4% at a second straight meeting was contentious, with two voters dissenting. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid took the same view as Logan, arguing the Fed should have kept rates still. Fed governor Stephen Miran dissented in the other direction, backing a half-point rate cut. </p><p>\n\n  In a press conference after the vote, Chair Jerome Powell said that another cut in December--something that many traders had been counting on--was far from a foregone conclusion. His comments likely reflected a base of skepticism about further cuts among the Fed's policy committee as the group met over two days this week. </p><p>\n\n  Logan acknowledged that the labor market has weakened, but said that future policy choices could respond quickly if the situation worsens further. \"These are all risks the FOMC will be able to closely monitor and address promptly if there is evidence they are becoming more likely to materialize,\" she said, referring to the Fed's policy committee by its acronym. </p><p>\n\n  On the other hand, she expressed impatience with persistent inflation, noting that prices already rose nearly at the Fed's annual target rate between January and August alone. Inflation is \" still not convincingly headed all the way back to 2 percent,\" she said. She added that the Fed's 2% inflation target is a \"serious commitment.\" </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-31-25 0944ET</p></div>",

And I'd find it difficult to cut rates again in December unless there is clear evidence that inflation will fall faster than expected or that the labor market will cool more rapidly.\"</p><!-- Article --><p>\n              Logan's remarks follow the Fed's decision on Wednesday to lower its policy rate for a second time this year by a quarter of a percentage point to what is now a range of 3.75%-4.00%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the move was aimed at preventing the labor market from slowing further.</p><p>\n              Another rate cut in December, he said, is not a foregone conclusion, particularly given the lack of official economic data including measures of inflation and unemployment while the federal government shutdown continues. </p><p>\n              Logan, who does not have a vote on the Fed's policy-setting committee this year, said that private-sector data, state-level unemployment claims, and the Fed's own network of business and community contacts do give the central bank visibility into the economy, and the picture is far from troubling.</p><p>\n              Consumer spending has slowed but still exceeds the longer-run trend; stock-market gains are fueling demand from wealthier households; large companies are \"enthusiastically\" putting money into artificial intelligence and data centers; lower-income households and smaller companies are faring less well but still are stable, she said.</p><p>\n              \"The risks to the labor market do lie mainly to the downside,\" Logan said, adding that she has a close eye on recent layoff announcements, and noting that a sudden drop in the stock market and a longer-than-expected government shutdown could pose risks to spending and economic activity. \"The remaining risks to employment are ones we can monitor closely and respond to if they are becoming more likely to materialize, not ones that currently warrant further preemptive action.\"</p><p>\n              Meanwhile, she said, inflation - though not at an emergency level - is still too high and too slow to return to the Fed's 2% goal. \"Our obligation to the public is to deliver on this commitment,\" she said.</p><p>\n              Logan said she supported the Fed's decision this week to stop shrinking its balance sheet, saying that elevated money market rates show the balance sheet is much closer to its normal size. Indeed, she said, if the recent rise in rates on overnight repurchase agreements for Treasuries proves not to be temporary, the Fed will need to restart asset purchases to keep bank reserves ample.</p><p>\n              She reiterated her view that the Fed should stop targeting the fed funds rate, an outdated target in her view, and should move to targeting a repo rate like the tri-party general collateral rate.</p><p>\n              (Reporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Paul Simao)</p></div>",
