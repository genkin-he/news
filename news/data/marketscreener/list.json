This combination ensures precise targeting of tumor cells while minimizing off-target effects, offering a promising treatment for solid tumors such as lung cancer, esophageal cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, prostate cancer, and others. ICP-B794 has demonstrated superior anti-tumor activity in animal models compared with other ADCs, and exhibited significant tumor-killing effects even in large tumors.</p><!-- Article --><p>  Currently, there are no B7-H3 targeted therapies approved for marketing globally. B7-H3 is a type I transmembrane protein that is highly expressed across multiple solid tumor types. Due to its tumor-specific expression, it is considered a highly promising anti-tumor target.</p><p>  Dr. Jasmine Cui, the co-founder, chairwoman and CEO of InnoCare, said, “B7-H3 is specifically expressed in a wide range of solid tumors. ICP-B794 was developed from our proprietary ADC platform, and its differentiated design offers potential to provide precise treatment options for cancer patients. We will continue to expand our portfolio with multiple ADC candidates and bring more hope to cancer patients worldwide.</p><p>  The ADC platform developed by InnoCare is positioned to target hard-to-treat cancers. Through its innovated platform technology, it can achieve stronger tumor killing effects and a better safety profile when developing novel ADC drugs, which will offer better treatment option for cancer patients globally.</p><p><strong>About InnoCare</strong></p><p>  InnoCare is a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company committed to discovering, developing, and commercializing first-in-class and/or best-in-class drugs for the treatment of cancers and autoimmune diseases with unmet medical needs in China and worldwide.
