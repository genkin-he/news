            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Dean Seal </p><br/><p>\n  Gilead Sciences raised its full-year profit guidance and said royalty and contract revenue buoyed third-quarter sales while demand for its Covid-19 treatment sank. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  The biopharmaceutical company said Thursday that it now expects earnings of $6.65 to $6.85 a share for the full year, up from its previous outlook of $5.85 to $6.15 a share. </p><p>\n\n  Adjusted earnings, which strip out one-time items, are now on track to hit $8.05 to $8.25 a share, Gilead said, adding a dime to the low-end of its previous range. </p><p>\n\n  The company also bumped up its product sales outlook, adding $100 million to the low end of guidance it previously gave. </p><p>\n\n  Third-quarter revenue rose 3% to $7.8 billion, topping analyst forecasts for $7.45 billion, according to FactSet. </p><p>\n\n  Product sales were down 2% at $7.3 billion due to declines for Veklury, the Covid-19 treatment that saw a 60% drop in sales, and its cell therapy portfolio. That was partially offset by growth for its HIV products and Livdelzi, a liver-disease treatment. Excluding Veklury, product sales were up 4%. </p><p>\n\n  Royalty, contract and other revenue streams meanwhile increased to $424 million from just $30 million a year earlier. </p><p>\n\n  Gilead reported quarterly profit of $3.05 billion, or $2.43 a share, compared with $1.25 billion, or $1 a share, last year. The year-earlier quarter included a pre-tax, in-process research and development impairment charge that didn't recur. </p><p>\n\n  Adjusted earnings were $2.47 a share. Analysts polled by FactSet had been expecting $2.13 a share. </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-30-25 1642ET</p></div>",
