            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>(Reuters) -The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq were poised for a strong start on Friday after upbeat forecasts from Apple and Amazon helped calm nerves, a day after the indexes suffered their sharpest drop in more than three weeks.</p><p>\n              Amazon's shares surged 12.9% in premarket trading, after the company forecast quarterly sales above estimates on the back of its cloud revenue rising at the fastest clip in nearly three years. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n              Apple rose 2.6% as its forecast for iPhone sales in the holiday quarter surpassed Wall Street expectations. </p><p>\n              With all the \"Magnificent Seven\" megacaps except Nvidia  having reported quarterly results, investors have had a fresh look at how aggressively Big Tech majors such as Microsoft and Meta are spending on artificial intelligence. </p><p>\n              \"The worry is not that these companies are spending huge amounts, but that we're not seeing the payout in the earnings just yet, and that we may not see earnings catch up with the huge amount of spending,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at Swissquote Bank.    </p><p>\n              On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq posted their steepest percentage declines since October 10, with the benchmark index closing at its lowest in more than a week.</p><p>\n              Of the 278 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported third-quarter results so far, 83.1% have surpassed analysts' estimates, according to LSEG data. That's well above the historical average, where roughly 67% of firms beat forecasts. </p><p>\n              At 08:23 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 125 points, or 0.26%, S&amp;P 500 E-minis were up 61.25 points, or 0.89%, and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 383.25 points, or 1.48%.</p><p><b>MONTHLY GAINS DESPITE TEMPERED FED OUTLOOK</b></p><p>\n              The tech-heavy Nasdaq was on track for its seventh consecutive monthly advance, its longest streak since May 2017. The S&amp;P 500 and blue-chip Dow were headed for their sixth. </p><p>\n              While expectations for faster Federal Reserve rate cuts buoyed stocks earlier in the month, markets are still adjusting to a shift in policy outlook after the central bank delivered a widely expected quarter-point rate cut but signaled that another move in December was not a \"foregone conclusion\".</p><p>\n              The Fed's cautious language prompted traders to scale back bets on a third cut this year, with futures now pricing in a 67.9% chance of a similar-sized move in December, down from nearly 90% earlier in the week.</p><p>\n              In other premarket moves, Warner Bros Discovery shares rose 3% following a Reuters report that Netflix was actively exploring a bid for the company's studio and streaming business. </p><p>\n              Netflix added 1.7% as it unveiled plans for a 10-for-1 stock split.</p><p><a href=\"/quote/stock/GETTY-IMAGES-HOLDINGS-INC-141526815/\" onclick=\"gaEvent('Out', 'reuters', '51517256');\">Getty Images</a> leapt 51.5% after signing a global multi-year licensing agreement with Perplexity AI. </p><p>\n              Western Digital jumped 11% on forecasting quarterly earnings above Wall Street estimates. </p><p>\n              Strategy rose 6.5% after posting a profit in the third quarter, compared with a loss a year earlier. </p><p>\n               (Reporting by Pranav Kashyap and Nikhil Sharma in Bengaluru; Editing by Mrigank Dhaniwala, Krishna Chandra Eluri and Devika Syamnath)</p><p>\n            By Pranav Kashyap and Nikhil Sharma</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"txt-s4 article-text\"><p>\n  By Matt Grossman </p><br/><p>\n  Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan pushed back on the Federal Reserve's quarter-point interest-rate cut this week, arguing that the risk of a slowing job market didn't justify swerving away from the task of corralling inflation. </p><!-- Article --><p>\n\n  Speaking at a conference in Dallas Friday morning, Logan observed that weaker job creation hasn't led to a drastic rise in the unemployment rate, partly because the pool of people looking for work has ebbed. Meanwhile, she said, she isn't convinced inflation is on a firm track back toward the Fed's 2% target. </p><p>\n\n  That combination suggests the Fed should be more reluctant to cut rates to support the labor market with rate cuts, which weaken the Fed's anti-inflation stance, Logan said. </p><p>\n\n  Logan hasn't been a member of the Fed's policy committee this year, under the system that rotates votes annually among the Fed's 12 reserve-bank presidents. But she made it clear that if she had gotten a vote this week, she would have dissented against the Fed's cut. </p><p>\n\n  \"I would have preferred to hold interest rates steady,\" Logan said, according to a published version of her remarks. She said later in the speech that she is also skeptical that a further cut in December will be the right move. </p><p>\n\n  The Fed's decision to cut rates by a quarter point to a range of 3.75% to 4% at a second straight meeting was contentious, with two voters dissenting. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid took the same view as Logan, arguing the Fed should have kept rates still. Fed governor Stephen Miran dissented in the other direction, backing a half-point rate cut. </p><p>\n\n  In a press conference after the vote, Chair Jerome Powell said that another cut in December--something that many traders had been counting on--was far from a foregone conclusion. His comments likely reflected a base of skepticism about further cuts among the Fed's policy committee as the group met over two days this week. </p><p>\n\n  Logan acknowledged that the labor market has weakened, but said that future policy choices could respond quickly if the situation worsens further. \"These are all risks the FOMC will be able to closely monitor and address promptly if there is evidence they are becoming more likely to materialize,\" she said, referring to the Fed's policy committee by its acronym. </p><p>\n\n  On the other hand, she expressed impatience with persistent inflation, noting that prices already rose nearly at the Fed's annual target rate between January and August alone. Inflation is \" still not convincingly headed all the way back to 2 percent,\" she said. She added that the Fed's 2% inflation target is a \"serious commitment.\" </p><br/><p>\n  Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com </p><br/><p>\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\n\n  10-31-25 0944ET</p></div>",
