This growing demand for warehouse facilities highlights the rapid growth of the third-party logistics (3PL) sector in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), driven by factors such as nearshoring, regional manufacturing growth, and the rise of e-commerce.</p><p>As demand for modern logistics infrastructure continues to grow, investment in flexible and facilities with CTP ensures logistics providers are well-equipped to meet the evolving needs of an extensive modern client base. In addition to the new tenant, Domator24, a Polish manufacturer of gaming chairs and metal furniture, also operates at CTPark SuleChow. Located less than 70km from Germany, the park's proximity to the German border and good transport infrastructure make Sulechow increasingly important as an alternative to the main logistics locations in western Poland.</p><!-- Article --><p>As part of CTP's investment, a building with an area of 74,995 sqm has been completed so far and there are also plans to build a second warehouse with an area of 12,837 sqm.

Building on their strategic collaboration, Hyundai Motor Group and NVIDIA are now entering a new phase of collaboration, shifting from strategic adoption of advanced software platforms and infrastructure to joint innovation of core physical AI technologies. Together, they will codevelop AI capabilities for mobility solutions, a next-generation smart factory and on-device semiconductor advancements to strengthen Hyundai Motor Group?s future capabilities.</p><p>As part of this endeavor, Hyundai Motor Group and NVIDIA aim to enable integrated AI model training, validation and deployment using 50,000 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs. In addition, in support of the Korean government?s initiative to build a national physical AI cluster, Hyundai Motor Group and NVIDIA will work closely with government stakeholders to accelerate ecosystem development. This will result in an approximately $3 billion investment to advance the physical AI landscape in Korea.</p><!-- Article --><p>Key efforts include the establishment of an NVIDIA AI Technology Center, Hyundai Motor Group?s Physical AI Application Center and regional data centers. This will also foster dynamic exchanges with NVIDIA?s engineers and technicians, helping cultivate Korea?s next generation of physical AI talent. Hyundai Motor Group Advances Automotive With NVIDIA AI Factory: With its NVIDIA Blackwell-based AI factory, Hyundai Motor Group will deploy essential infrastructure for powering every phase of innovation ?</p><p>bringing together in-vehicle AI, autonomous driving, factory automation and robotics into one intelligent, interconnected ecosystem.

They are also down 10% in North America, due to the impact of tariffs. Europe is a bit surprising, however, where volumes are resisting year on year.</p><!-- Article --><p>\nThe situation is no better in the van and financing segments. As a result, consolidated operating profit fell to €4.3bn, compared with €10.4bn at the same time last year, while net profit halved.</p><p>\nIt is fortunate that the group is defending a good balance sheet in this harsh economic climate, which seems to have no end in sight for the moment. It has nevertheless reduced its dividend and suspended its share buyback plan for the last nine months; however, this was due to resume in November, albeit on a more modest scale.</p><p>\nAffected by the same problems, <span style=\"color: #3598db;\"><a href=\"https://www.marketscreener.com/news/bmw-another-victim-of-a-sluggish-market-ce7d5adad888f220\" onclick=\"gaEvent('Out', 'zonebourse', '51511573');\" style=\"color: #3598db;\">BMW warned earlier this month that it would have to reduce its profit targets for this year</a></span>.

It is therefore hardly surprising that its share price has also returned to the level it was at at that time, especially since the capital has remained divided into a more or less equivalent number of shares in the meantime.</p></div>",
