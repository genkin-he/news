The new med’s progress is tracking ahead of all recently launched analogs in schizophrenia, Lenkowsky said, as the drug has surpassed 2,400 weekly total scripts.</p>\n<p>“There’s clearly more work to do,” the BMS exec acknowledged. “In year two, we need to continue to increase both breadth and depth of prescribing […] We’ve onboarded our expanded field force now in the community and in the hospital setting.”</p>\n<p>BMS is working hard to get more doctors to try out Cobenfy. To help build physician confidence, the company is resorting to peer education for new prescribers, introducing real-world data and running a phase 4 study to address the key question of how to switch from a D2 drug to Cobenfy.</p>\n<p>“Based on the leading indicators that we’re seeing, Cobenfy is going to deliver continued, steady growth in schizophrenia, and longer-term growth is going to be fueled by additional indications,” Lenkowsky said, adding that “we are confident that Cobenfy will be a big drug over time.”</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n<p>But as one analyst pointed out on Thursday’s call, investors have grown nervous around a key potential Cobenfy expansion opportunity in Alzheimer’s disease psychosis following some recent management comments.</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"0c773446-f56b-4e59-a4ca-55d8dbab4de8\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/pharma/mfn-deadline-approaches-bms-says-it-will-offer-cobenfy-uk-same-price-it-charges-us\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">In UK, Big Pharma pressure campaign rolls on as Bristol Myers plans US-level pricing for Cobenfy</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>During the company’s second-quarter earnings call in July, BMS’ then-chief medical officer Samit Hirawat, M.D., mentioned that as part of a bigger project to improve success for all BMS clinical programs, the New Jersey pharma was conducting clinical trial site reviews of the Adept-2 trial, which is slated to read out this year as the first of three Cobenfy phase 3 studies in Alzheimer’s disease psychosis. BMS has said it’ll need positive readouts from two of the three trials to be able to file with the FDA.</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t read too much into it, other than to say that there’s a lot of focus on us being able to deliver on each of the stages of our strategy,” Boerner said Thursday.</p>\n<p>“If I step back from the specific studies, remember the work that we’re doing in development fits with the focus that we have on execution, really across the company,” the CEO added. “And given the importance of the late-stage studies, I think it’s prudent that we take whatever learnings we can and pull whatever appropriate levers we can to ensure that we deliver these studies with the highest [probability of technical success] and on time.”</p>\n<p>Hirawat was recently <a href=\"https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/bms-names-astrazenecas-cristian-massacesi-new-chief-medical-officer\">succeeded by </a>Cristian Massacesi, M.D., who came over from AstraZeneca.

We’re sharing ideas to do that. Ex-U.S. prices need to come up. We’ve seen some good progress, for example, in the U.K., but more needs to be done. And accomplishing those objectives while preserving the ecosystem for innovation that we have in the U.S. is what we’re focused on.”</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"row media-content-body article-body mb-lg-4\" id=\"article-body-row\">\n<div class=\"col content\">\n<p>Alnylam’s closely watched launch of its rare disease drug Amvuttra continued to outpace Wall Street expectations.</p>\n<p>Riding its March expansion into the heart condition of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM), Amvuttra generated $685 million sales in the third quarter. The haul came 11% above analysts’ consensus estimates, according to a Jefferies note Oct. 27.</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[300,250]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"10\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250],[320,50]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot1Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-1_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p>Thanks to the strong performance, Alnylam has increased its full-year sales guidance again, now expecting total TTR franchise revenues in a range between $2.475 billion and $2.525 billion, a $275 million (10%) increase at midpoint.</p>\n<p class=\"ad-container\" style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :class=\"{ 'mobile-ad': false }\" :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"false\" :hide-on-mobile=\"false\" :randomize-element-id=\"true\" :sizes=\"[['fluid']]\" ad-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" class=\"inline-native-ad pos-14\" placeholder-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" pos=\"14\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos3\"></div>\n<p class=\"ad-container\" style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :hide-on-desktop=\"0\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :out-of-page=\"true\" :pos=\"8\" ad-id=\"contentEmbedOne\" placeholder-id=\"content-embed-one\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p>The Jefferies team, which was more bullish on Amvuttra’s performance than consensus, previously pegged Alnylam’s TTR franchise to reach above $2.6 billion this year, according to an earlier note. In the Oct. 27 note, the team put its Amvuttra third-quarter projection at $732 million, markedly above consensus.</p>\n<div class=\"d-inline\"><div class=\"t1-ad-slot my-5 my-lg-4\" data-ad-slot-id=\"38\"></div></div>\n<p>ATTR-CM patient demand for Amvuttra about doubled in the U.S. in the third quarter versus the previous three months that ended in June. That expansion shows “a very healthy sign” of Amvuttra’s launch progression, Alnylam’s chief commercial officer Tolga Tanguler said in an interview with Fierce Pharma.</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"11\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250],[320,50]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot2Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-2_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p>Back in the second quarter, which was Amvuttra’s first full quarter on the ATTR-CM market, Tanguler <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/alnylam-exceeds-50b-market-cap-amvuttra-heart-disease-launch-wows-wall-street\">reported </a>the initiation of 1,400 ATTR-CM patients on Amvuttra and about $150 million revenue in the specific indication. Back then, Amvuttra’s $492 million quarterly sales handily beat analysts’ expectations by 40%. Besides ATTR-CM, the RNA interference therapy is also approved since June 2022 in ATTR-polyneuropathy, another subtype of the TTR protein disorder that affects the nervous system.</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"cfb98667-fd11-4c85-9368-291d521e1873\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/pharma/alnylam-exceeds-50b-market-cap-amvuttra-heart-disease-launch-wows-wall-street\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">Alnylam exceeds $50B market cap as Amvuttra heart disease launch wows Wall Street</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Because Amvuttra is reimbursed under the buy-and-bill model and healthcare facilities keep stocking the drug using the same code regardless of its end application, it’s difficult to separate specific contribution of each indication to Amvuttra, Tanguler explained.</p>\n<p>Still, Tanguler described a “very steady” ATTR-PN business. Based on an approximately doubling of ATTR-CM patient demand, Tanguler said it “would be safe to assume” that U.S. sales from ATTR-CM uses also roughly doubled sequentially to about $300 million in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>Some of the strong momentum that Alnylam reported in the second quarter remained in effect in the third quarter, according to Tanguler.</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n<p>“What we’re really seeing is, first of all, a […] balanced and broad demand,” Tanguler said.</p>\n<p>Amvuttra, a TTR silencer, is competing with Pfizer’s mainstay Vyndamax and BridgeBio’s newer TTR stabilizer Attruby. Wednesday, BridgeBio reported third-quarter Attruby revenue of $108 million in the U.S. and 5,259 unique patient prescriptions as of Oct. 25.</p>\n<p>Amvuttra is “highly competitive” in first-line treatment, which is “a very good signal of the robustness and the health of the business,” Tanguler said.</p>\n<p>“Doctors want to treat this early and hard,” Tanguler observed, pointing to an emerging theme where physicians would use Amvuttra upfront rather than wait until patients have progressed on an oral stabilizer.</p>\n<p>There have been some combination uses in the commercial setting, including in patients who have mixed ATTR-CM and -PN phenotypes, but Tanguler again said it’s not the main driver of Amvuttra uses.</p>\n<p>The drug is gaining traction in both academic centers and in the community setting, where Alnylam has established alternative sites of care from which patients can receive the quarterly injection closer to their homes, Tanguler said. About 90% of the patients have access to these sites of care within 10 miles, he added.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Alnylam has set up treatment processes at all the approximately 170 priority health systems for Amvuttra, and the company is now “going deeper in those centers,” he added.</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"04d3bfa6-0605-485b-9527-53a36d727fdb\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/pharma/pfizer-discontinue-low-dose-attr-drug-vyndaqel-us-ahead-2028-patent-loss\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">Pfizer to discontinue low-dose ATTR drug Vyndaqel in US ahead of 2028 patent loss</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Outside of the U.S., Amvuttra <a href=\"https://investors.alnylam.com/press-release?id=29101\">got an ATTR-CM approval </a>from the European Commission in June, and it’s also cleared in Japan.</p>\n<p>Alnylam is still in early stages of the ATTR-CM launch ex-U.S. with availability only in Germany and Japan so far, Tanguler said. In Germany, where price negotiations are ongoing, Tanguler described “more of a softer launch” in the European country.</p>\n<p>“But in Japan, I’m really encouraged,” the Alnylam CCO said. “We’re seeing a step change. Granted, it’s relatively a small market right now, but when I think of the analogs of similar type of products and specialty and how those products have picked up, we're seeing a very nice, robust, very competitive uptake that is, frankly, category defining.”</p>\n<p>Alnylam recently <a href=\"https://investors.alnylam.com/press-release?id=29256\">updated</a> 48-month data from the phase 3 Helios-B trial that earned Amvuttra its ATTR-CM approvals. On time to first cardiovascular event or all-cause mortality, four years of Amvuttra treatment led to a 37% relative risk reduction compared to patients who received placebo first and then Amvuttra in the open-label extension period. For patients who were not on any background TTR silencer, the treatment effect was bigger, at 42%. For death risk specifically, continuous Amvuttra led to a 37% reduction in the overall population versus 39% in the monotherapy population.</p>\n<p>While the new data set “seems to really resonate,” Tanguler said, “we need more time for the market to start actually really understanding and appreciating this. And again, I like where we are. We’re building the right momentum. But it’s going to take us some time to continue to establish our dominance.”</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

In marketing, I get to do all of those things—I’m just doing it in a different way.</p>\n<p>I’m still solving a problem, trying to reach a specific audience with a specific message. I'm still using my scientific background and the years of training to read papers and understand how scientific innovations work. Now, I just apply them to making sure that everyone gets to learn about those innovations and that they get out into the world. It’s an interesting way to be a part of the engine of biopharma innovation without holding the pipette at the bench.</p>\n<p><strong>FPMK: What has been the most rewarding or challenging project you’ve worked on so far?</strong></p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n<p><strong>KM:</strong> My favorite projects are the ones where you have to dig deep to solve a complex problem. For one project, we had a client come to us who needed to significantly reduce their digital media spend, and they didn’t know how to do that. We worked with them to take a strategic look at their business goals and their spend and then to refine their campaign targeting and their messaging to make sure that they were reaching the audience they were trying to reach, a very specific stakeholder audience. And then, once they reached that audience, we helped them use the right language and visuals that would resonate. We were able to dramatically reduce their spend, while improving their lead generation.</p>\n<p>The challenge is not just creating good content that looks great, but it’s also aligning the strategy, the storytelling, all of those things, to bridge the gap from the science and the innovations to communicating with the target audience.</p>\n<p><strong>FPMK: If you could give one piece of advice to industry veterans who’ve been in pharma marketing for decades, what would it be?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KM:</strong> Stay curious and be open to change. Our landscape is evolving so quickly in terms of the ways that people get information. People used to turn to traditional news sources, but that’s no longer how the majority of our country gets its news. It’s from social media. We apply all the things we’ve learned about those kinds of changes, but the fundamentals remain the same. At the end of the day, we’re still trying to get the right message to the right person at the right time. The best outcomes happen when we combine fresh perspectives and are open to change, but also take advice from people who’ve been doing this for a long time.</p>\n<p><strong>FPMK: What do you like to do when you’re not helping clients reach their target audiences?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KM:</strong> The No. 1 thing I’m doing when I’m not working is watching sports. I’m from the Midwest, which has a huge football culture. I live in Minnesota, and everyone loves hockey here. I spend all fall—every Saturday and Sunday—watching football, college football, pro football. I love to go to hockey games. That’s what I’m doing when I’m not working: anything and everything to do with sports.</p>\n<p class=\"editor_note\">Know a standout early-career pharma marketing pro?

The company collectively produces more than 60 billion doses each year and asserts that it has “over 1,000 active development programs at any given time.”</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"2cba6556-aebf-4153-ac89-09709426dc90\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/pharma/novo-holdings-set-close-165b-catalent-buy-after-clearing-us-closing-conditions\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">Novo Holdings set to close $16.5B Catalent buy in 'coming days' after deal clears antitrust hurdles</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Elsewhere, in a further sign of Catalent’s evolution this year, the company late last month <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/catalent-moves-new-global-hq-novo-sale-nears-1-year-anniversary\">opened the doors</a> to its new global corporate headquarters in Tampa.

The website said U.K. guidelines recommend all newly diagnosed asthma patients aged 12 years and up should receive a certain regimen. However, a complainant noted that another regimen is recommended for some patients. Symbicort is approved in both populations. </p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[300,250]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"10\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250],[320,50]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot1Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-1_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">AstraZeneca accepted that it made “an unintentional error” by failing to accurately reflect the full U.K. guidelines. Yet the drugmaker denied that the error constituted a patient safety risk, arguing that there was no theoretical risk of an overdose. That view underpinned AstraZeneca’s argument that it neither failed to maintain high standards nor brought discredit on the industry.</p>\n<p class=\"ad-container\" style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :class=\"{ 'mobile-ad': false }\" :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"false\" :hide-on-mobile=\"false\" :randomize-element-id=\"true\" :sizes=\"[['fluid']]\" ad-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" class=\"inline-native-ad pos-14\" placeholder-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" pos=\"14\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos3\"></div>\n<p class=\"ad-container\" style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :hide-on-desktop=\"0\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :out-of-page=\"true\" :pos=\"8\" ad-id=\"contentEmbedOne\" placeholder-id=\"content-embed-one\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The PMCPA panel reached a different conclusion, questioning the robustness of the review and approval process for the webpage and determining that the shortcomings represented a failure to maintain high standards.

The argument rested on the belief that the video complied with the code and that Organon wasn’t accountable for the content of the webinar.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Organon’s provision of the promotional video undermined that argument in the eyes of the PMCPA panel. The video meant Organon had influenced the balance and scope of the webinar, the panel said.

Her cancer experience, unfortunately, remains far too common.<br/><br/>Young adults with cancer still fall into a diagnosis, treatment and support void between pediatric and older-adult cancer care. They must overcome delays and skepticism, all while navigating a care ecosystem not designed with their needs in mind. They are the invisible generation of cancer patients.<br/><br/>“Pediatric patients have their parents taking care of financial and legal decisions. Older adults have Medicare and established relationships with primary care physicians and at least some experience with the healthcare system,” explains IPG Health chief medical officer Sommer Bazuro, PhD. “And then you have this in-between group that may fall through the cracks.”<br/><br/>Imre Varju, MD, PhD, MA, CHES, group director, patient support strategy at YuzuYello, an IPG Health company, agrees, adding, “Nothing about the care journey serves these populations well.”<br/><br/><strong>‘I didn’t expect it to happen to me’</strong><br/><br/>Many of the challenges stem from what Laura Catalusci, MA, MCHES, executive director, account management at YuzuZest, an IPG Health company, calls “the I-didn’t-expect-it-to-happen-to-me factor.” Adults between the ages of 18 and 50 are consumed by careers and relationships and family. Upon receiving a cancer diagnosis, it all comes crashing to a halt.<br/><br/>“What they think is, ‘This is not the plan I had when I woke up this morning,’” Catalusci adds.<br/><br/>The cancer-care system reinforces that sense of unreality. To begin with, many young patients are told they are too young for cancer. This creates a disconnect with the symptoms they are experiencing, which can spiral into feelings of self-doubt and isolation.<br/><br/>“If I’m a patient and I hear skepticism from a physician, I’m going to start questioning myself,” notes Annie Foster, group director, social media creative at IPG Health.<br/><br/>Worse, symptoms like fatigue and weight loss are often explained away or otherwise discounted, even when they are consistent with cancer. “In most stories we have heard from patients, they had to ask several times before reluctantly being offered testing,” says Corrine Ellsworth-Beaumont, PhD, MFA and CEO of <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.knowyourlemons.org/__;!!N96JrnIq8IfO5w!k2UqJkGLyAqKUylMwFW7PTDp9tjTznfSrK9KNSva5Z8Z9S9tHWTLCWJg7fchaTRWdE5kp8Z1dutfWfE1wA$\" title=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.knowyourlemons.org/__;!!N96JrnIq8IfO5w!k2UqJkGLyAqKUylMwFW7PTDp9tjTznfSrK9KNSva5Z8Z9S9tHWTLCWJg7fchaTRWdE5kp8Z1dutfWfE1wA$\">Know Your Lemons Foundation</a>, a breast health charity. “This often led to delays in their diagnosis – by not being marked as urgent, or taking several visits before they were referred.”<br/><br/>Barriers to effective cancer care vary by age, gender, geography, culture and so much more. People with cancer between the ages of 18 and 30 may be less established personally and professionally, and often don’t have a regular primary care physician. Those in their 30s may be juggling careers, childcare and a mortgage; those in their 40s might simultaneously be caring for children and aging parents. Individuals in the first two groups might also be concerned about the potential effects of cancer treatment on their fertility.<br/><br/>In other words, young adults tend to have a lot going on. As a result, they might prioritize other aspects of their lives over their health. “You get people who believe they can diet and exercise their way out of any health situation,” Bazuro says.<br/><br/>Then there’s the financial toxicity that often comes with cancer in early adulthood, and a health-insurance infrastructure seemingly custom-built to compound the disorientation experienced by individuals who have just learned they are sick. This, Ricki Fairley, CEO of <a href=\"https://touchbbca.org/\">TOUCH, The Black Breast Cancer Alliance</a>, explains, strikes young adults at precisely the time they’re least well-equipped to manage it.<br/><br/>“What does a 20- or 30-year-old know about any of this? I had breast cancer in my 50s, when I had a career and a house and a life. How are young people expected to cope with it all?”<br/><br/>Meanwhile, individuals on insurance plans with lower monthly premiums (and thus higher deductibles) sometimes find themselves delaying treatment in order to preserve their financial solvency.<br/><br/>“People on the younger age of the spectrum are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured, and they probably haven’t had to deal with out-of-pocket costs or prior approvals before this,” says Sanja Zivkovic, strategic planning director at Mosaic Group, an IPG Health company. “If you know you’re going to be paying more every time you see a doctor or get a test, you might wait until your symptoms are more severe before getting help.”<br/><br/><strong>The path ahead</strong><br/><br/>Foster believes the road to transcending these barriers starts with education. “We need to give young people information about their own bodies so they can recognize changes or recognize symptoms when they’re most treatable,” she explains. And that information needs to be conveyed in the social channels where many young adults go in search of community.<br/><br/>“They can more easily find their people on social media. What you find is they share both empathy and information – ‘Hey, here’s something that worked for me; maybe it’ll work for you,’” Foster adds.<br/><br/>All information, however, needs to be carefully calibrated to account for age, gender and cultural differences. It also needs to be administered judiciously. “There’s data from the web, social media and wearables, and sometimes it’s hard to tell what’s credible or actionable,” Zivkovic explains. “The goal is for patients to be informed but not overwhelmed. More data doesn’t always lead to better decision-making.”<br/><br/>Then there’s the scourge of health misinformation that proliferates online. “The internet is a great place for patients to find support, but there’s also this huge mass of downright incorrect information that people have access to,” notes Zac Getty, senior manager of education at Fight Colorectal Cancer. “You see all kinds of alternative treatments and pseudoscientific woo-woo, which erodes trust in providers… It’s hard to find verifiable information.”<br/><br/>Bazuro, for her part, thinks the cancer-care experience needs to be filtered through a patient-experience lens. She’d like to see healthcare providers, administrators and technologists collaborate to remove as much of the friction from the process as possible, whether by initiating one-click scheduling for physician visits and treatments or by easing access to imaging and diagnostics.<br/><br/>“That’s the expectation of all the young adult age groups, because that’s how everything else in their lives works. The more time people have to sit and ponder, the less likely it is they’re going to act.”<br/><br/>Such action, Catalusci says, can be spurred by ambassadors – former patients familiar with the twists and turns of treatment and recovery, who often pick up where oncologists and other care providers leave off. “Too often we rely on physicians for everything. Ambassadors have lived experience to share, because they’ve been through it themselves,” she explains.<br/><br/>Fairley, on the other hand, touts the caregiving and support bona fides of her organization’s nurse navigators, who are on call 24/7/365 and available to advise breast cancer patients on everything from sexual activity during treatment to locating nearby houses of worship or yoga studios. Their most important role, she adds, “is to give a hug. You can get medicine from the doctors, but sometimes what you need is that hug.”<br/><br/>Pharma can and should play a role as well. Varju would like to see more young adults with cancer steered toward the formal support programs offered by pharmaceutical companies.<br/><br/>“There’s so little awareness of these programs,” he says. “If you get patients into support programs the moment they start on a medication, they are much more likely to stay adherent.”<br/><br/>Finally, nearly every observer believes that the cancer-care experience must increasingly prioritize survivorship support. Individuals in their 20s, 30s or 40s have a very different road ahead of them than those treated for cancer later in life. Young survivors inevitably emerge from their care as very different people than they were prior to diagnosis, yet they’re often expected to resume life as if the interruption was a mere blip on the radar.<br/><br/>“All you’ve known for the past few years is treatment. Where do you go from there? There’s no road map,” Getty says.<br/><br/>That’s probably why, more than a year after Acosta’s care team gave her a long-awaited and hard-earned NED designation – no evidence of disease – she has chosen to focus her advocacy efforts on survivorship.<br/><br/>“I felt like I was walking up a hill and, once I got to the top of it, instead of flat land I just dropped right down,” Acosta recalls. “For so many people, it’s like, ‘Okay, you’re good, see you in three months,’ when what they may need is help looking for a job or getting out of debt. That’s the next big obstacle for us to address.”</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
