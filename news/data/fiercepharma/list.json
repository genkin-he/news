In marketing, I get to do all of those things—I’m just doing it in a different way.</p>\n<p>I’m still solving a problem, trying to reach a specific audience with a specific message. I'm still using my scientific background and the years of training to read papers and understand how scientific innovations work. Now, I just apply them to making sure that everyone gets to learn about those innovations and that they get out into the world. It’s an interesting way to be a part of the engine of biopharma innovation without holding the pipette at the bench.</p>\n<p><strong>FPMK: What has been the most rewarding or challenging project you’ve worked on so far?</strong></p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n<p><strong>KM:</strong> My favorite projects are the ones where you have to dig deep to solve a complex problem. For one project, we had a client come to us who needed to significantly reduce their digital media spend, and they didn’t know how to do that. We worked with them to take a strategic look at their business goals and their spend and then to refine their campaign targeting and their messaging to make sure that they were reaching the audience they were trying to reach, a very specific stakeholder audience. And then, once they reached that audience, we helped them use the right language and visuals that would resonate. We were able to dramatically reduce their spend, while improving their lead generation.</p>\n<p>The challenge is not just creating good content that looks great, but it’s also aligning the strategy, the storytelling, all of those things, to bridge the gap from the science and the innovations to communicating with the target audience.</p>\n<p><strong>FPMK: If you could give one piece of advice to industry veterans who’ve been in pharma marketing for decades, what would it be?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KM:</strong> Stay curious and be open to change. Our landscape is evolving so quickly in terms of the ways that people get information. People used to turn to traditional news sources, but that’s no longer how the majority of our country gets its news. It’s from social media. We apply all the things we’ve learned about those kinds of changes, but the fundamentals remain the same. At the end of the day, we’re still trying to get the right message to the right person at the right time. The best outcomes happen when we combine fresh perspectives and are open to change, but also take advice from people who’ve been doing this for a long time.</p>\n<p><strong>FPMK: What do you like to do when you’re not helping clients reach their target audiences?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KM:</strong> The No. 1 thing I’m doing when I’m not working is watching sports. I’m from the Midwest, which has a huge football culture. I live in Minnesota, and everyone loves hockey here. I spend all fall—every Saturday and Sunday—watching football, college football, pro football. I love to go to hockey games. That’s what I’m doing when I’m not working: anything and everything to do with sports.</p>\n<p class=\"editor_note\">Know a standout early-career pharma marketing pro?

Novo Holdings, which acts as a holding company for Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, first <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/novo-holdings-antes-165b-poach-catalent-selling-three-fill-finish-sites-novo-nordisk\">telegraphed</a> plans to buy Catalent in February 2024.</p>\n<p>As part of the transaction, Novo Nordisk itself acquired three Catalent fill-finish facilities around the globe for $11 billion.</p>\n<p>With the change in ownership, “it was just a great time to take a look at ourselves and decide ‘who are we,’ and ‘how do we want to show up?’” Hunt said of the original rebrand impetus. “It’s not necessarily a new Catalent per se,” she emphasized. “It’s just a clearer one.”</p>\n<p>Even after the site changeover, Catalent currently boasts more than 40 facilities across four continents, Hunt said.</p>\n<p>In its press release, the CDMO noted that it’s supported development and production of products “representing half of all FDA approvals” in the past decade. The company collectively produces more than 60 billion doses each year and asserts that it has “over 1,000 active development programs at any given time.”</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"2cba6556-aebf-4153-ac89-09709426dc90\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/pharma/novo-holdings-set-close-165b-catalent-buy-after-clearing-us-closing-conditions\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">Novo Holdings set to close $16.5B Catalent buy in 'coming days' after deal clears antitrust hurdles</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Elsewhere, in a further sign of Catalent’s evolution this year, the company late last month <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/catalent-moves-new-global-hq-novo-sale-nears-1-year-anniversary\">opened the doors</a> to its new global corporate headquarters in Tampa.

The website said U.K. guidelines recommend all newly diagnosed asthma patients aged 12 years and up should receive a certain regimen. However, a complainant noted that another regimen is recommended for some patients. Symbicort is approved in both populations. </p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[300,250]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"10\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250],[320,50]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot1Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-1_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">AstraZeneca accepted that it made “an unintentional error” by failing to accurately reflect the full U.K. guidelines. Yet the drugmaker denied that the error constituted a patient safety risk, arguing that there was no theoretical risk of an overdose. That view underpinned AstraZeneca’s argument that it neither failed to maintain high standards nor brought discredit on the industry.</p>\n<p class=\"ad-container\" style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :class=\"{ 'mobile-ad': false }\" :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"false\" :hide-on-mobile=\"false\" :randomize-element-id=\"true\" :sizes=\"[['fluid']]\" ad-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" class=\"inline-native-ad pos-14\" placeholder-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" pos=\"14\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos3\"></div>\n<p class=\"ad-container\" style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :hide-on-desktop=\"0\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :out-of-page=\"true\" :pos=\"8\" ad-id=\"contentEmbedOne\" placeholder-id=\"content-embed-one\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The PMCPA panel reached a different conclusion, questioning the robustness of the review and approval process for the webpage and determining that the shortcomings represented a failure to maintain high standards. Believing the materials raised a “genuine patient safety concern,” the panel concluded that AstraZeneca brought discredit on the industry.</p>\n<div class=\"d-inline\"><div class=\"t1-ad-slot my-5 my-lg-4\" data-ad-slot-id=\"38\"></div></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the case of Organon, the PMCPA <a href=\"https://www.pmcpa.org.uk/cases/completed-cases/case02620824-complainant-v-organon/\">contacted</a> the drugmaker after receiving a complaint about a webinar the company sponsored.

She insisted on a colonoscopy, which revealed a six-centimeter mass in her rectum. \"The doctor said, 'Fortunately, we did this early,'\" she recalls, referring to undergoing the procedure before the recommended age of 30 for patients with Lynch syndrome, a condition that increases the risk of certain cancers. “That’s the moment when I was like: Self-advocacy works.

Her cancer experience, unfortunately, remains far too common.<br/><br/>Young adults with cancer still fall into a diagnosis, treatment and support void between pediatric and older-adult cancer care. They must overcome delays and skepticism, all while navigating a care ecosystem not designed with their needs in mind. They are the invisible generation of cancer patients.<br/><br/>“Pediatric patients have their parents taking care of financial and legal decisions. Older adults have Medicare and established relationships with primary care physicians and at least some experience with the healthcare system,” explains IPG Health chief medical officer Sommer Bazuro, PhD. “And then you have this in-between group that may fall through the cracks.”<br/><br/>Imre Varju, MD, PhD, MA, CHES, group director, patient support strategy at YuzuYello, an IPG Health company, agrees, adding, “Nothing about the care journey serves these populations well.”<br/><br/><strong>‘I didn’t expect it to happen to me’</strong><br/><br/>Many of the challenges stem from what Laura Catalusci, MA, MCHES, executive director, account management at YuzuZest, an IPG Health company, calls “the I-didn’t-expect-it-to-happen-to-me factor.” Adults between the ages of 18 and 50 are consumed by careers and relationships and family. Upon receiving a cancer diagnosis, it all comes crashing to a halt.<br/><br/>“What they think is, ‘This is not the plan I had when I woke up this morning,’” Catalusci adds.<br/><br/>The cancer-care system reinforces that sense of unreality. To begin with, many young patients are told they are too young for cancer. This creates a disconnect with the symptoms they are experiencing, which can spiral into feelings of self-doubt and isolation.<br/><br/>“If I’m a patient and I hear skepticism from a physician, I’m going to start questioning myself,” notes Annie Foster, group director, social media creative at IPG Health.<br/><br/>Worse, symptoms like fatigue and weight loss are often explained away or otherwise discounted, even when they are consistent with cancer. “In most stories we have heard from patients, they had to ask several times before reluctantly being offered testing,” says Corrine Ellsworth-Beaumont, PhD, MFA and CEO of <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.knowyourlemons.org/__;!!N96JrnIq8IfO5w!k2UqJkGLyAqKUylMwFW7PTDp9tjTznfSrK9KNSva5Z8Z9S9tHWTLCWJg7fchaTRWdE5kp8Z1dutfWfE1wA$\" title=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.knowyourlemons.org/__;!!N96JrnIq8IfO5w!k2UqJkGLyAqKUylMwFW7PTDp9tjTznfSrK9KNSva5Z8Z9S9tHWTLCWJg7fchaTRWdE5kp8Z1dutfWfE1wA$\">Know Your Lemons Foundation</a>, a breast health charity. “This often led to delays in their diagnosis – by not being marked as urgent, or taking several visits before they were referred.”<br/><br/>Barriers to effective cancer care vary by age, gender, geography, culture and so much more. People with cancer between the ages of 18 and 30 may be less established personally and professionally, and often don’t have a regular primary care physician. Those in their 30s may be juggling careers, childcare and a mortgage; those in their 40s might simultaneously be caring for children and aging parents. Individuals in the first two groups might also be concerned about the potential effects of cancer treatment on their fertility.<br/><br/>In other words, young adults tend to have a lot going on. As a result, they might prioritize other aspects of their lives over their health. “You get people who believe they can diet and exercise their way out of any health situation,” Bazuro says.<br/><br/>Then there’s the financial toxicity that often comes with cancer in early adulthood, and a health-insurance infrastructure seemingly custom-built to compound the disorientation experienced by individuals who have just learned they are sick. This, Ricki Fairley, CEO of <a href=\"https://touchbbca.org/\">TOUCH, The Black Breast Cancer Alliance</a>, explains, strikes young adults at precisely the time they’re least well-equipped to manage it.<br/><br/>“What does a 20- or 30-year-old know about any of this? I had breast cancer in my 50s, when I had a career and a house and a life. How are young people expected to cope with it all?”<br/><br/>Meanwhile, individuals on insurance plans with lower monthly premiums (and thus higher deductibles) sometimes find themselves delaying treatment in order to preserve their financial solvency.<br/><br/>“People on the younger age of the spectrum are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured, and they probably haven’t had to deal with out-of-pocket costs or prior approvals before this,” says Sanja Zivkovic, strategic planning director at Mosaic Group, an IPG Health company. “If you know you’re going to be paying more every time you see a doctor or get a test, you might wait until your symptoms are more severe before getting help.”<br/><br/><strong>The path ahead</strong><br/><br/>Foster believes the road to transcending these barriers starts with education. “We need to give young people information about their own bodies so they can recognize changes or recognize symptoms when they’re most treatable,” she explains. And that information needs to be conveyed in the social channels where many young adults go in search of community.<br/><br/>“They can more easily find their people on social media. What you find is they share both empathy and information – ‘Hey, here’s something that worked for me; maybe it’ll work for you,’” Foster adds.<br/><br/>All information, however, needs to be carefully calibrated to account for age, gender and cultural differences. It also needs to be administered judiciously. “There’s data from the web, social media and wearables, and sometimes it’s hard to tell what’s credible or actionable,” Zivkovic explains. “The goal is for patients to be informed but not overwhelmed. More data doesn’t always lead to better decision-making.”<br/><br/>Then there’s the scourge of health misinformation that proliferates online. “The internet is a great place for patients to find support, but there’s also this huge mass of downright incorrect information that people have access to,” notes Zac Getty, senior manager of education at Fight Colorectal Cancer. “You see all kinds of alternative treatments and pseudoscientific woo-woo, which erodes trust in providers… It’s hard to find verifiable information.”<br/><br/>Bazuro, for her part, thinks the cancer-care experience needs to be filtered through a patient-experience lens. She’d like to see healthcare providers, administrators and technologists collaborate to remove as much of the friction from the process as possible, whether by initiating one-click scheduling for physician visits and treatments or by easing access to imaging and diagnostics.<br/><br/>“That’s the expectation of all the young adult age groups, because that’s how everything else in their lives works. The more time people have to sit and ponder, the less likely it is they’re going to act.”<br/><br/>Such action, Catalusci says, can be spurred by ambassadors – former patients familiar with the twists and turns of treatment and recovery, who often pick up where oncologists and other care providers leave off. “Too often we rely on physicians for everything. Ambassadors have lived experience to share, because they’ve been through it themselves,” she explains.<br/><br/>Fairley, on the other hand, touts the caregiving and support bona fides of her organization’s nurse navigators, who are on call 24/7/365 and available to advise breast cancer patients on everything from sexual activity during treatment to locating nearby houses of worship or yoga studios. Their most important role, she adds, “is to give a hug. You can get medicine from the doctors, but sometimes what you need is that hug.”<br/><br/>Pharma can and should play a role as well. Varju would like to see more young adults with cancer steered toward the formal support programs offered by pharmaceutical companies.<br/><br/>“There’s so little awareness of these programs,” he says. “If you get patients into support programs the moment they start on a medication, they are much more likely to stay adherent.”<br/><br/>Finally, nearly every observer believes that the cancer-care experience must increasingly prioritize survivorship support. Individuals in their 20s, 30s or 40s have a very different road ahead of them than those treated for cancer later in life. Young survivors inevitably emerge from their care as very different people than they were prior to diagnosis, yet they’re often expected to resume life as if the interruption was a mere blip on the radar.<br/><br/>“All you’ve known for the past few years is treatment. Where do you go from there? There’s no road map,” Getty says.<br/><br/>That’s probably why, more than a year after Acosta’s care team gave her a long-awaited and hard-earned NED designation – no evidence of disease – she has chosen to focus her advocacy efforts on survivorship.<br/><br/>“I felt like I was walking up a hill and, once I got to the top of it, instead of flat land I just dropped right down,” Acosta recalls. “For so many people, it’s like, ‘Okay, you’re good, see you in three months,’ when what they may need is help looking for a job or getting out of debt. That’s the next big obstacle for us to address.”</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

As the report notes, fewer than 20% of millennial healthcare professionals (HCPs) say they trust branded pharma websites, while only about a third of U.S. patients trust pharmas’ direct-to-consumer ads.</p>\n<p class=\"ad-container\" style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :class=\"{ 'mobile-ad': false }\" :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"false\" :hide-on-mobile=\"false\" :randomize-element-id=\"true\" :sizes=\"[['fluid']]\" ad-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" class=\"inline-native-ad pos-14\" placeholder-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" pos=\"14\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos3\"></div>\n<p class=\"ad-container\" style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :hide-on-desktop=\"0\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :out-of-page=\"true\" :pos=\"8\" ad-id=\"contentEmbedOne\" placeholder-id=\"content-embed-one\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p>Havas Lynx urged drugmakers to use those findings to reshape their outreach strategies to focus less on product promotion and more on educational content and disease state awareness campaigns, which reportedly already outperform DTC ads in measures of trust and engagement.</p>\n<div class=\"d-inline-block my-4\"><div class=\"t1-ad-slot my-5 my-lg-4\" data-ad-slot-id=\"38\"></div></div>\n<p>“If pharma can pivot from promotion to public health shapers, from selling to serving, it can reclaim its relevance,” the report claims. “By becoming data-driven disease educators, not simply prescription pushers, pharma has the chance to make a meaningful impact—not just on patient lives, but on public trust itself.”</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"11\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot2Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-2_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p>More than 70% of HCPs say pharma has a responsibility to battle misinformation, but only 40% believe the industry is currently doing enough, according to the agency’s data.</p>\n<p>As for where pharmas should direct that refocused strategy, the whitepaper notes that misinformation is rampant across practically every disease area. Particularly vulnerable are conditions that are linked to emotional distress, complex science and limited treatment options, such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, obesity, chronic pain, infectious diseases and mental health conditions.</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"ac2ccd1f-d452-4cc3-8cbf-ec0f1b6bf126\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/marketing/havas-creates-ad-market-reaching-underserved-patients-drive-health-equity\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">Havas creates health ad market for reaching underserved patients</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The report wraps up by offering “the three Cs” to guide the process of combatting misinformation: counsel, curb and correct. Under that framework, education efforts should aim, respectively, to teach the public how to properly evaluate health information and spot misinformation; to slow the spread of misinformation, including by pressuring social media platforms to stop profiting off inaccurate info; and to debunk specific points of misinformation.</p>\n<p>“The spread of health misinformation isn’t just a concern; it’s a profound threat to patient well-being and the very foundation of evidence-based medicine,” Havas Lynx CEO Claire Knapp said in a Thursday <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/havas-lynx-launches-new-white-paper-doctored-truths-urging-pharma-to-lead-the-fight-against-health-misinformation-302591613.html\">release</a>, adding that the whitepaper “underscores the immense responsibility and opportunity for the pharmaceutical industry” in addressing the issue.</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n<p>“Pharma could hold the antidote—with its deep scientific expertise and extensive reach, it is uniquely positioned to reclaim trust and safeguard health outcomes,” Knapp added. “It’s not just an ethical imperative, but a strategic necessity for the industry’s future.”</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"row media-content-body article-body mb-lg-4\" id=\"article-body-row\">\n<div class=\"col content\">\n<p>Novartis has filed suit against AstraZeneca’s rare disease unit, claiming that certain marketing materials for Alexion’s Ultomiris create an inaccurate impression of Novartis’ rival drug Fabhalta.</p>\n<p>Both Ultomiris and Fabhalta are approved to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), among other autoimmune diseases on the meds' labels. In an Oct. 17 filing in Delaware federal court, Novartis took issue, in part, with a <a href=\"https://ultomirishcp.com/pnh/terminal-and-proximal-complement-control\">page</a> on Ultomiris’ U.S. healthcare professional-facing website offering information about the drug’s effects.</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[300,250]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"10\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot1Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-1_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p>Under the bolded heading “Block the cause,” the webpage touts Ultomiris as being able to induce complete inhibition of the terminal complement, activation of which can lead to potentially life-threatening PNH complications. Though the site doesn’t mention Fabhalta, a proximal complement inhibitor, by name, it does say that “proximal complement inhibition may not lead to complete terminal complement inhibition”—an “implied superiority claim,” per Novartis, that “lacks any evidentiary support.”</p>\n<p class=\"ad-container\" style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :class=\"{ 'mobile-ad': false }\" :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"false\" :hide-on-mobile=\"false\" :randomize-element-id=\"true\" :sizes=\"[['fluid']]\" ad-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" class=\"inline-native-ad pos-14\" placeholder-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" pos=\"14\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos3\"></div>\n<p class=\"ad-container\" style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :hide-on-desktop=\"0\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :out-of-page=\"true\" :pos=\"8\" ad-id=\"contentEmbedOne\" placeholder-id=\"content-embed-one\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p>Novartis went on in the complaint to argue that “Alexion has gone to great lengths to spread its false messaging” beyond the website, including in verbal discussions with HCPs, sales calls and “Alexion-sponsored symposia,” where it has allegedly asserted that, in contrast to terminal complement inhibitors like Ultomiris, proximal complement inhibitors like Fabhalta don’t fully block terminal complement activity and can lead to an increased risk of infection.</p>\n<div class=\"d-inline-block my-4\"><div class=\"t1-ad-slot my-5 my-lg-4\" data-ad-slot-id=\"38\"></div></div>\n<p>The marketing materials and activities cited in the dispute date back at least to March 2025, per Novartis.</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"11\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot2Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-2_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p>In sum, Novartis accused Alexion of launching “a false and misleading marketing campaign that is unsupported by scientific evidence and wrongly suggests that its product, ULTOMIRIS (ravulizumab), is superior in efficacy and safety to Novartis’ FABHALTA (iptacopan) for treating paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.”</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"9501db3c-a7f5-4871-ac67-e91d8ba0353a\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/marketing/novartis-earns-fdas-ire-misleading-romantic-storyline-fabhalta-tv-ad\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">Novartis earns FDA's ire for 'misleading' romantic storyline of Fabhalta TV ad</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>According to the Swiss pharma, clinical data suggest that Fabhalta is “at least as effective” as Ultomiris in treating PNH and controlling potential complications like intravascular hemolysis and thrombosis.</p>\n<p>“Alexion’s deceptive messaging misleads healthcare professionals, distorts prescribing decisions, and harms both Novartis and the patients who rely on accurate, evidence-based information,” Novartis wrote in the filing.</p>\n<p>Alexion declined to comment on ongoing litigation.</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n<p>Novartis said in the complaint that it reached out to Alexion in March 2025 “warning of the significant public health concerns posed” by the “Block the Cause” campaign and requesting that Alexion immediately cease the claims. According to Novartis, Alexion responded a month later with a letter that “doubled down” on its clams of the superiority of terminal complement inhibitors in treating PNH.</p>\n<p>In the filing, Novartis requested a jury trial and an injunction forcing Alexion to cease its “unfair competitive tactics,” which, it claims, “are causing immediate and irreparable competitive and commercial injury to Novartis and to its goodwill and reputation.”</p>\n<p>Novartis also said it is entitled to damages—of an amount to be determined by the court—based, in part, on sales that may have been diverted from Fabhalta to Ultomiris by Alexion’s marketing materials.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
