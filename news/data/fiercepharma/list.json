A third of GLP-1-interested respondents said they’d prefer to hear drug side effect information listed without any visuals, while 28% said audio makes it easier to focus on important safety info—outweighing the broader survey pool on both counts.</p>\n<p>“And yet audio remains dramatically underutilized by pharma,” Clement wrote, citing data showing that barely 1% of pharma ad budgets go to digital audio, even as digital audio listeners spend more than four hours a day on average with the medium.</p>\n<p>That listening time often overlaps with “key health touchpoints,” per the article. While around 80% of the overall survey pool respondents said they listen to audio content while heading to or from doctor’s appointments, during their daily health regimens and more, that number rises to 86% among the GLP-1-interested segment.</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"11\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250],[320,50]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot2Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-2_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p>“Those are not passive media moments.

Over the past six years, the company has landed deals with <a href=\"https://genedit.com/news/genedit-and-editas-medicine-enter-into-exclusive-license-and-collaboration-agreement-for-nanoparticle-gene-therapy-delivery/\">Editas Medicine</a>, <a href=\"https://genedit.com/news/sarepta-therapeutics-and-genedit-share-progress-on-research-collaboration-and-announce-agreement-to-develop-gene-editing-therapeutics-for-neuromuscular-diseases/\">Sarepta Therapeutics</a> and Roche’s <a href=\"https://genedit.com/news/genedit-announces-multiyear-collaboration-and-license-agreement-with-genentech-to-develop-novel-nanoparticles-to-deliver-genetic-medicines-for-autoimmune-disease/\">Genentech</a>, and raised $50 million from backers including Eli Lilly across a two-part series A round. Those funds supported the nomination of a lead candidate.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The series B round was co-led by Yuanta Investment and DSC Investment, with additional participation from several other new and existing investors.</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"7d20c575-56b7-4270-9efd-81d632858b76\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/marketing/amneal-and-vantai-unveil-fresh-branding-kick-2026-plans\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">Amneal and VantAI unveil fresh branding to kick off 2026 plans</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Building on a platform for delivering genetic medicines to the immune, cardiac, pulmonary and central nervous systems, BreezeBio has developed an immune modulation therapy to treat Type 1 diabetes. The asset, BRZ-101, delivers autoantigens encoded by mRNA and tolerogenic co-factors to antigen-presenting cells. </p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"11\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250],[320,50]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot2Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-2_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The goal is to induce antigen-specific regulatory T cells to block the autoimmune response that drives Type 1 diabetes without affecting the rest of the immune system. BreezeBio said the drug candidate has induced antigen-specific immune tolerance in autoimmune disease models, including a mouse model of diabetes, and been well tolerated in mice and nonhuman primates.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the new influx of funding, BreezeBio will advance BRZ-101 toward the clinic while also continuing to develop its delivery platform, where next steps include enabling delivery of in vivo CAR-T therapies to T cells. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The company is also moving forward in its collaboration with Genentech. Last year, Genentech made the first milestone payment in a package worth up to $629 million, and BreezeBio said in this week's announcement that R&amp;D activities have continued to progress since passage of that first milestone.</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>",

At the time, the goal was to cut Roctavian’s direct annual expenses to $60 million starting in 2025 and make the product profitable by the end of 2026.</p>\n<p>Now, after BioMarin was unsuccessful in finding a “qualified buyer” to take on the product, the company will officially withdraw the med from the market, it said. This decision resulted in charges of about $240 million over the fourth quarter of 2025, including a $119 million inventory write-off and $118 million in asset value impairments.</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"11\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250],[320,50]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot2Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-2_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p>Roctavian sales came out to $36 million in 2025, up from 2024’s $26 million. The drug was still seeing some commercial use in its end of days, with a man in Michigan becoming the state’s first patient to use the therapy outside of clinical trials upon being infused in January, the Detroit Free Press <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2026/02/18/hemophilia-a-gene-therapy-clinical-trials/88707929007/?gnt-cfr=1&amp;gca-cat=p&amp;gca-uir=true&amp;gca-epti=z115424p116550l116050c116550e1122xxv115424d--47--b--47--&amp;gca-ft=164&amp;gca-ds=sophi\">reported</a> earlier this month.</p>\n<p>Still, broad uptake has long been an uphill battle for the gene therapy as it competes with a variety of treatments including, Roche’s blockbuster Hemlibra, Sanofi’s newer sales driver Altuviiio and Novo Nordisk’s Alhemo. Common gene therapy hurdles, such as eligibility limitations and reimbursement struggles, also pulled Roctavian back. </p>\n<p>Upon taking the helm in 2023, Hardy had outlined <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/sales-still-stagnant-biomarin-mulls-over-hemophilia-gene-therapy-roctavians-future\">three potential paths</a> for the drug. While the focus at the time was on “establishing the opportunity” for Roctavian, a divestment was listed as Hardy’s third option.<br/> </p>\n<h3><strong>BioMarin's post-Roctavian future </strong></h3><p><br/>As BioMarin leaves Roctavian behind, the company is looking to a new chapter after inking its largest-ever transaction late last year with a $4.8 billion acquisition of Amicus Therapeutics. The deal gives BioMarin two potential blockbusters in Fabry disease drug Galafold and Pompe disease combination treatment Pombiliti-Opfolda. The addition of Amicus’ portfolio would “accelerate BioMarin’s revenue growth immediately upon close,” Hardy said at the time. </p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n<p>The deal is expected to wrap up in the second quarter of this year. Any contribution from the Amicus products is excluded from BioMarin’s 2026 guidance, which forecasts between $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion in full-year sales. In 2025, the company collected revenue of $3.2 billion, up 13% from 2024. </p>\n<p>BioMarin attributed much of its yearly growth to market gains for its collection of enzyme therapies, as well as achondroplasia treatment Voxzogo. </p>\n<p>With $927 million in 2025 sales, Voxzogo is the company’s biggest revenue driver. But William Blair analysts argued in a Tuesday note that BioMarin will ultimately require “additional business development” to fully offset the anticipated Voxzogo erosion to come from new market entrants over the next two years.</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"6608aa66-1b80-41d6-8c4c-9fac266b1c08\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/pharma/biomarin-pulls-rare-disease-marriage-48b-buyout-amicus\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">BioMarin makes its largest-ever transaction, paying $4.8B for fellow rare disease drugmaker Amicus</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>That competition could come from BridgeBio and its oral candidate infigratinib, which recently <a href=\"https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/bridgebio-preps-approval-push-after-dwarfism-drug-increases-height-children-phase-3\">showed</a> a statistically significant improvement in annualized height velocity from baseline in a phase 3 trial of children with achondroplasia. Mizuho analysts predicted that BridgeBio’s option could “very well end up being the agent of choice for this indication,” pointing to the wide age group trialed and the convenience of an oral offering. Voxzogo, meanwhile, is administered as a daily subcutaneous injection. </p>\n<p>However, BioMarin has another achondroplasia option up its sleeve in its early-stage BMN 333, which could be a “potentially superior version of Voxzogo,” an Evercore ISI analyst pointed out after the company revealed positive phase 1 <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biomarin-shows-promising-data-longer-acting-version-voxzogo\">results</a> in August.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

The decision positions Havas to lead Indivior’s integrated strategy, creative, media and digital efforts across healthcare professional and direct-to-consumer audiences.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Greg James, CEO of Havas Media Network North America, said in a statement that the client win “is a strong validation of our converged strategy in North America.” James said Indivior came to Havas for integration, rather than an advertising solution, and Havas met that need by “uniting creative, media, and experience around a single strategy.”</p>\n<p class=\"ad-container\" style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :class=\"{ 'mobile-ad': false }\" :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"false\" :hide-on-mobile=\"false\" :randomize-element-id=\"true\" :sizes=\"[['fluid']]\" ad-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" class=\"inline-native-ad pos-14\" placeholder-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" pos=\"14\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p class=\"ad-container\" style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :hide-on-desktop=\"0\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :out-of-page=\"true\" :pos=\"8\" ad-id=\"contentEmbedOne\" placeholder-id=\"content-embed-one\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Indivior previously worked with the agency’s consumer health and wellness group Havas Tonic, which is now called Jacques NY.

Seeking to accelerate growth of its opioid use disorder drug Sublocade, Indivior last year began the “Move Forward in Recovery” DTC campaign, a patient activation initiative built around a TV ad. </p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"11\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250],[320,50]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot2Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-2_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Patrick Barry, chief commercial officer at Indivior, discussed the push to address opioid use disorder stigma on an earnings call in October, saying, “This campaign is being deployed with sustained investment levels through an omnichannel approach, including national television, digital and social media and in-office and point-of-care materials, along with a newly designed patient website.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Indivior is investing in Sublocade marketing in the face of competition from Braeburn, which <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-buprenorphine-treatment-option-opioid-use-disorder%5C\">won</a> FDA approval for a rival long-acting injectable treatment for opioid use disorder in 2023. Barry said on the call that Indivior has a 75% market share. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That said, Indivior and Braeburn are fighting over a small piece of the wider market, with long-acting injectables accounting for just 8% of all opioid use disorder treatment sales. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Long-acting injectables have captured a larger share of other markets, including HIV and schizophrenia. Increasing penetration in the opioid use disorder market could drive further rises in Sublocade sales, which are <a href=\"https://ir.indivior.com/news-releases/news-release-details/indivior-provides-full-year-2026-financial-guidance-and-business\">forecast</a> to total up to $945 million this year.</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>",

At the 24-month point, about 92% of the 1,460 Erleada patients included in the analysis were still living, compared to just under 86% of 287 Nubeqa patients.</p>\n<p>J&amp;J has since gone on to promote the findings in a slideshow presentation and one-page overview available on its Medical Connect website for healthcare providers, per the lawsuit.</p>\n<p>According to Bayer, the analysis is “scientifically flawed” and “misinforms healthcare providers and patients in an effort to increase its market share in a concentrated and increasingly competitive prostate cancer treatment market,” as the company wrote in a Monday <a href=\"https://www.bayer.com/en/us/news-stories/nubeqa-false-advertising-suit\">release</a> announcing the suit.</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"11\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250],[320,50]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot2Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-2_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p>Bayer said it filed the lawsuit following “J&amp;J’s refusal to cease and desist” its promotion of the head-to-head analysis. </p>\n<p>J&amp;J did not immediately respond to Fierce Pharma Marketing’s request for comment. </p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"9b1f5a23-6041-4690-9825-fae57937fe79\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/marketing/novartis-sues-azs-alexion-over-false-and-misleading-ultomiris-marketing\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">Novartis sues AZ's Alexion over 'false and misleading' Ultomiris marketing</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Bayer laid out several of what it termed the “numerous and fatal methodological flaws” at the core of the analysis.</p>\n<p>For one, it said, J&amp;J’s use of retrospective real-world data in the head-to-head comparison does not align with the FDA’s more rigorous standards for claiming direct superiority. For another, it suggested that the considerable difference in cohort sizes “skews statistical analyses and undermines the reported outcomes.”</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n<p>Bayer also pointed out that Nubeqa hadn’t been approved for use without docetaxel for “97% of the time period used in the J&amp;J analysis.” That approval <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/bayer-gains-fda-expansion-fast-rising-prostate-cancer-drug-nubeqa\">arrived last summer</a>; the analysis stretched from August 2022 to June 2025.</p>\n<p>That factor “creates severe selection bias and makes the superiority claim inherently false,” according to Bayer, which claimed that the analysis further compounded concerns linked to off-label use of Nubeqa by failing to “adequately measure and balance critical prognostic and baseline characteristics, such as non-cancer comorbidities.”</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, Bayer took issue with J&amp;J’s claim that the analysis followed patients through 24 months: “This is patently untrue as at least 60% of patients in both cohorts initiated their treatment after June 2023 and could not have been evaluated for 24 months of follow-up before the analysis ended in June 2025,” it wrote in this week’s release.</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"f64148ce-b6c5-4269-b509-7f3105f172a0\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/pharma/bayer-files-separate-lawsuits-against-moderna-jj-and-pfizerbiontech-over-covid-vaccines\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">Bayer files separate lawsuits against Moderna, J&amp;J and Pfizer-BioNTech over COVID vaccine tech</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In the lawsuit, Bayer requested a permanent injunction stopping J&amp;J from disseminating the analysis and its claims, as well as an order for its rival to put out a “corrective press release” dispelling the claims. </p>\n<p>Bayer is also asking for a judgment that would require J&amp;J to pay Bayer its “unjust profits,” as well as both compensatory and threefold punitive damages and reimbursement for Bayer’s court costs. The complaint alleges damages of at least $75,000, a typical federal court jurisdictional threshold, though the final amount has not yet been determined.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
