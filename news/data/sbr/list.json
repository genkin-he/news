This positive outlook is driven primarily by the semiconductors segment, which is projecting strong output to meet sustained demand from AI-related markets. On the other hand, the other segments are projecting similar or lower production.</p><p>In the transport engineering cluster, a net weighted balance of 14% of firms expect a higher level of activity in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2025. The aerospace segment continues to project increased aircraft engine repair work.</p><p>However, the marine &amp; offshore engineering and land segments project lower output, amid continued headwinds to the global economy.</p><p>A net weighted balance of 5% of firms in the precision engineering cluster project a rise in output in the December quarter. The precision modules &amp; components segment is forecasting higher output of optical products and bonding wires, whilst the majority of the machinery &amp; systems firms foresee output to remain broadly unchanged from the previous quarter.</p><p>On the other hand, a net weighted balance of 8% of firms in the biomedical manufacturing cluster is projecting a lower level of production in Q4. This is largely attributed to the pharmaceuticals segment forecasting reduced production of active pharmaceutical ingredients on the back of a different product mix.</p>\n</div>",

Growth will be driven by jobs in solar, energy storage systems, and low-carbon electricity imports. The traditional power and gas workforce is also forecast to grow by 13%, or 800 workers, over the same period.</p><p>The survey also identified evolving capabilities needed for Singapore’s energy transition, including expertise in solar photovoltaic system design, assessment of low-carbon electricity imports, and future operations of carbon capture and storage systems, as well as hydrogen and ammonia supply networks.</p><p>From 2022 to 2024, Singapore’s energy sector workforce grew by 4%, or 310 workers, led by increases in the traditional power and gas sectors. The number of engineers rose by nearly 13%, while technical officers increased by about 7%.</p><p>EMA Chief Executive Puah Kok Keong said the shift toward clean energy represents both technological and workforce transformation. “We look forward to welcoming more youths and mid-career professionals to the energy workforce, as we step up our efforts to reduce carbon emissions from electricity generation,” he said.</p><p>EMA has also refreshed its Clean Energy Jobs-Skills Insight resource, developed with SkillsFuture Singapore, to highlight in-demand jobs and skills across the energy sector.</p><p>To strengthen workforce capabilities, EMA is working with educational institutions on new training programmes. The Institute of Technical Education launched a Technical Engineer Diploma in Electrical Engineering (Clean Energy) in April 2025, while Singapore Polytechnic and the Singapore Institute of Technology are offering continuing education courses on renewable energy and smart grids.</p><p>Ngee Ann Polytechnic has revised its Diploma in Electrical Engineering curriculum and introduced an Industry Immersion Internship Programme, which counts toward the work experience required to become a Licensed Electrical Technician. EMA is also facilitating internships and mentorships to connect students with industry partners.</p><p>Companies are contributing to workforce development as well. Keppel has grown its skilled workforce in integrated power operations by 30% and invested over 3,650 hours in structured training. Sembcorp Solar Singapore, in partnership with Singapore Polytechnic, plans to train up to 100 professionals by 2027 and is piloting the use of AI-assisted remotely operated vehicles for inspecting floating solar farms.</p><p>EMA said it will continue working with IHLs and industry partners to build a skilled and future-ready workforce to support Singapore’s energy transition.</p>\n</div>",
