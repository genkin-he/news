That is, these have more storage capacity than HBMs, but are still fast enough to be utilized in AI inferencing (albeit not as quick as HBM).</p><p class=\"css-14ve0pc\">Sandisk has previously argued that this hybrid architecture is central to AI services that need user applications but <a class=\"css-uubm0\" href=\"https://www.sandisk.com/en-za/company/newsroom/blogs/2025/scaling-beyond-the-wall-inside-sandisks-high-bandwidth-flash-for-ai\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">require</a> a significant amount of fast interconnect between GPUs. The latest announcement also notes that HBF technology is expected to be more cost-efficient compared to alternatives of similar scale. </p><p class=\"css-14ve0pc\">The launch, which was shared in an kick-off event on Thursday evening, starts SK Hynix and Sandisk’s workflow that was announced when the two companies signed a Memorandum of Understanding “to standardize the specification, define technology requirements and explore the creation of a technology ecosystem” last August, per Sandisk’s <a class=\"css-uubm0\" href=\"https://www.sandisk.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/2025/2025-08-06-sandisk-to-collaborate-with-sk-hynix-to-drive-standardization-of-high-bandwidth-flash-memory-technology\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a> at the time. Ultimately, by collaborating with SK Hynix, one of the three key HBM suppliers, to standardize and commercialize the technology, Sandisk is manufacturing somewhat of a first-mover advantage to offer a system-level “AI-optimized memory architecture” required for AI inference markets, rather than focusing on the performance of a single chip element. </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"css-12fbs19\"><p class=\"css-14ve0pc\">One enigma I’m noticing in the AI boom?</p><p class=\"css-14ve0pc\">The publicly available chatbots, effectively the best universal manifestation of artificial intelligence we have, feel more or less the same to me. That is, <i>commoditized.</i></p><p class=\"css-14ve0pc\">Maybe this is a skill issue; I’m not the most high-tech person. That being said, I have experienced substantial performance gaps between paid and free versions, and am aware that more specialized tools offer better tailored results for certain tasks (i.e. Claude Code). But still, I’m Gemini-first, but polyAImorous when it comes to chatbot usage.</p><p class=\"css-14ve0pc\">Based on how Big Tech companies treat GPUs, the inputs used to train and run many chatbots, those seem to be anything but commoditized.</p><p class=\"css-14ve0pc\">Two of the AI chip deals reached by <span class=\"css-7t8xmc\"><a class=\"inline-stock css-1iix00n\" href=\"https://robinhood.com/us/en/stocks/AMD/?source=sherwood\"><span class=\"inline-stock-name\">Advanced Micro Devices</span></a></span>, the No. 2 in GPUs, have involved the company forking over the rights to potentially massive equity stakes in the company in exchange for securing these buyers. First was <a class=\"css-uubm0\" href=\"https://sherwood.news/markets/amd-openai-deal-ai-chips-data-centers-10-percent-stake/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI</a>, then <a class=\"css-uubm0\" href=\"https://sherwood.news/markets/amd-soars-after-striking-deal-meta-ai-chips-100-billion/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tuesday’s pact</a> with <span class=\"css-7t8xmc\"><a class=\"inline-stock css-1iix00n\" href=\"https://robinhood.com/stocks/META?source=sherwood\"><span class=\"inline-stock-name\">Meta</span></a></span>.</p><p class=\"css-14ve0pc\">Lisa Su and co. seemingly can’t get customers on normal terms the way Jensen Huang and co. can. </p><p class=\"css-14ve0pc\"><span class=\"css-7t8xmc\"><a class=\"inline-stock css-1iix00n\" href=\"https://robinhood.com/stocks/nvda?source=sherwood\"><span class=\"inline-stock-name\">Nvidia</span></a></span>, which reports earnings Wednesday after the close, enjoys a dominant market position. Sure, it <a class=\"css-uubm0\" href=\"https://sherwood.news/markets/coreweave-soars-on-usd6-3-billion-cloud-computing-purchasing-agreement-with/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">subsidizes its customers’ acquisitions of chips</a>, but it could be argued that this is just a way in investing in its own success by trying to make sure the company has <a class=\"css-uubm0\" href=\"https://sherwood.news/markets/bank-of-america-explains-why-nvidia-almost-has-to-invest-in-openai-and-intel/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">as many viable future clients as possible</a>. Nvidia and Meta’s “multi-year, multi-generational strategic partnership” that will see the social media giant buy millions of GPUs in the former didn’t involve the chip designer needing to give Mark Zuckerberg any potential equity exposure.</p><p class=\"css-14ve0pc\">Nvidia’s offerings are able to command a significant premium because its hardware not only comes with a track record, but it’s also attached to the CUDA software system that AI developers are comfortable with.</p><p class=\"css-14ve0pc\">In a sense, some of the best industry comps here are found in energy (something AI data centers chock-full of GPUs need a lot of!).</p><p class=\"css-14ve0pc\">Different forms of crude can be refined into the same kind of gasoline; your car won’t know the difference. Similarly, hydropower, solar power, or natural gas can all be used to generate electricity, and as long as the lights are on, people won’t be able to tell which one it was.</p></div>",

As the top African producer of the metal, Zimbabwe <a class=\"css-uubm0\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/zimbabwe-spodumene-exports-up-11-2025-revenue-flat-soft-prices-2026-02-03/#:~:text=Lithium%20prices%20have%20however%20rallied,strives%20for%20more%20local%20processing.\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">exported</a> some 1.13 million metric tons, or $514 million worth, of lithium-bearing spodumene concentrate in 2025. </p><p class=\"css-14ve0pc\">Zimbabwe’s mines minister said the ban would remain in effect until companies comply with government requirements, <a class=\"css-uubm0\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-25/zimbabwe-suspends-exports-of-lithium-concentrates-raw-minerals\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">per Bloomberg</a>.</p><p class=\"css-14ve0pc\">The ban adds further supply pressure into a market that’s already seen prices squeeze higher, with benchmark lithium futures roughly doubling since the end of October 2025. That’s spurred the shares of companies like Albemarle, which has gained more than 90% over the same time frame — a rare bright spot in an EV supply chain that’s generally been pretty depressed recently.</p><p class=\"css-14ve0pc\">Some Wall Street analysts have gotten more bullish on the sector, too. Albemarle scored an upgrade from Bank of America analysts earlier this month, who cited the lithium market’s improvement in structural fundamentals, as Chinese supply restrictions combined with growing demand for utility-scale battery storage applications provide further support for lithium prices. Futures prices for lithium carbonate remain above $18 per kilogram, having been as high as $21 per kilogram in January.</p></div>",
