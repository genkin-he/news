That is, these have more storage capacity than HBMs, but are still fast enough to be utilized in AI inferencing (albeit not as quick as HBM).</p><p class=\"css-14ve0pc\">Sandisk has previously argued that this hybrid architecture is central to AI services that need user applications but <a class=\"css-uubm0\" href=\"https://www.sandisk.com/en-za/company/newsroom/blogs/2025/scaling-beyond-the-wall-inside-sandisks-high-bandwidth-flash-for-ai\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">require</a> a significant amount of fast interconnect between GPUs. The latest announcement also notes that HBF technology is expected to be more cost-efficient compared to alternatives of similar scale. </p><p class=\"css-14ve0pc\">The launch, which was shared in an kick-off event on Thursday evening, starts SK Hynix and Sandisk’s workflow that was announced when the two companies signed a Memorandum of Understanding “to standardize the specification, define technology requirements and explore the creation of a technology ecosystem” last August, per Sandisk’s <a class=\"css-uubm0\" href=\"https://www.sandisk.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/2025/2025-08-06-sandisk-to-collaborate-with-sk-hynix-to-drive-standardization-of-high-bandwidth-flash-memory-technology\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a> at the time. Ultimately, by collaborating with SK Hynix, one of the three key HBM suppliers, to standardize and commercialize the technology, Sandisk is manufacturing somewhat of a first-mover advantage to offer a system-level “AI-optimized memory architecture” required for AI inference markets, rather than focusing on the performance of a single chip element. </p></div>",

Sure, it <a class=\"css-uubm0\" href=\"https://sherwood.news/markets/coreweave-soars-on-usd6-3-billion-cloud-computing-purchasing-agreement-with/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">subsidizes its customers’ acquisitions of chips</a>, but it could be argued that this is just a way in investing in its own success by trying to make sure the company has <a class=\"css-uubm0\" href=\"https://sherwood.news/markets/bank-of-america-explains-why-nvidia-almost-has-to-invest-in-openai-and-intel/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">as many viable future clients as possible</a>.

As the top African producer of the metal, Zimbabwe <a class=\"css-uubm0\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/zimbabwe-spodumene-exports-up-11-2025-revenue-flat-soft-prices-2026-02-03/#:~:text=Lithium%20prices%20have%20however%20rallied,strives%20for%20more%20local%20processing.\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">exported</a> some 1.13 million metric tons, or $514 million worth, of lithium-bearing spodumene concentrate in 2025. </p><p class=\"css-14ve0pc\">Zimbabwe’s mines minister said the ban would remain in effect until companies comply with government requirements, <a class=\"css-uubm0\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-25/zimbabwe-suspends-exports-of-lithium-concentrates-raw-minerals\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">per Bloomberg</a>.</p><p class=\"css-14ve0pc\">The ban adds further supply pressure into a market that’s already seen prices squeeze higher, with benchmark lithium futures roughly doubling since the end of October 2025. That’s spurred the shares of companies like Albemarle, which has gained more than 90% over the same time frame — a rare bright spot in an EV supply chain that’s generally been pretty depressed recently.</p><p class=\"css-14ve0pc\">Some Wall Street analysts have gotten more bullish on the sector, too. Albemarle scored an upgrade from Bank of America analysts earlier this month, who cited the lithium market’s improvement in structural fundamentals, as Chinese supply restrictions combined with growing demand for utility-scale battery storage applications provide further support for lithium prices. Futures prices for lithium carbonate remain above $18 per kilogram, having been as high as $21 per kilogram in January.</p></div>",
