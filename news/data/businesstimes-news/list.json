it also cast a light on numerous personalities and companies linked to him, from politicians and tech billionaires to Wall Street banks and Hollywood celebrities.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Global Counsel is just one entity caught in the fallout from a saga that has toppled companies, sent individuals to jail, and counts among those implicated US President Donald Trump and former Prince Andrew. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Here are some others: </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">SpaceX and Elon Musk </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Tesla CEO Elon Musk is known to have socialised with Epstein after the latter’s conviction as a sex offender in 2008.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The tech billionaire, who was invited to Epstein’s island but denies ever visiting it, has sought to publicly distance himself from the disgraced financier for years. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">E-mails released by the DOJ show Epstein visited SpaceX’s headquarters in 2013, although Musk claimed in 2020 that Epstein never toured his potentially US$800 billion space company, which is eyeing an initial public offering this year. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Notably, Epstein attempted to bring three foreign national women onto the premises, which raised security concerns; access to SpaceX’s facilities is often limited to US citizens as the firm manufactures defence-related technology. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Fed chair nominee Kevin Warsh</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Trump’s nominee to <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/international/global/what-does-kevin-warshs-nomination-mean-fed\" target=\"_blank\">replace US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell</a> has been named in the DOJ documents. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Kevin Warsh, a 55-year-old Wall Street and public service veteran, once worked at Morgan Stanley, which has past links to Epstein.  </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Bill Gates and the Gates Foundation</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Microsoft co-founder <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/telcos-media-tech/bill-gates-cancels-keynote-address-india-ai-summit\" target=\"_blank\">abruptly withdrew</a> from India’s AI Impact Summit amid increasing scrutiny of his links to Epstein after e-mails revealed correspondence between the financier and Gates Foundation staff.   </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While Gates’ absence was perceived as <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/international/indias-ai-summit-where-big-ambitions-met-hard-realities\" target=\"_blank\">an additional setback</a> for the flagship summit, the six-day event nonetheless garnered over US$200 billion in investment pledges for India’s AI infrastructure. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Gates has expressed regret over meeting Epstein. He has maintained that the relationship with Epstein was restricted to philanthropy-related discussions. He has also said that he neither did nor witnessed anything illicit. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Virgin Group founder Richard Branson</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">E-mails showed that the British entrepreneur who founded the Virgin Group had a warm relationship with Epstein. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Branson corresponded with Epstein in 2013, after the latter’s conviction. A Virgin Group spokesperson has said that contact between Branson and Epstein took place on a few occasions. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">According to the <em>Financial Times</em>, Epstein offered donations to Virgin Unite, the nonprofit arm of Branson’s Virgin Group, but the foundation blocked Epstein’s money after carrying out due diligence.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Peter Mandelson and Global Counsel</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The former UK cabinet minister faces allegations of suspected misconduct in public office. He is also under investigation for allegedly disclosing market-sensitive government information to Epstein when he was a minister. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This comes after e-mails between Mandelson and Epstein were determined to contain market-sensitive information that should not have been disclosed to those outside the government. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Police <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/international/former-uk-ambassador-mandelson-arrested-after-epstein-revelations\" target=\"_blank\">arrested Mandelson</a> on Monday (Feb 23) in relation to a misconduct probe, stemming from his ties to Epstein. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Mandelson, who has publicly expressed regret for associating with Epstein, was released from police custody on bail hours after his arrest. His lawyers claimed that his arrest resulted from “baseless” suspicions of intent to abscond. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">JPMorgan Chase and Jamie Dimon </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">America’s biggest bank has faced several lawsuits over its troubled relationship with Epstein, who was a client of 15 years – from 1998 to 2013 – before being kicked out. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In 2019, JPMorgan flagged more than US$1 billion in suspicious transactions linked to Epstein, who had moved hundreds of millions of dollars through the lender to Russian banks. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">JPMorgan chief executive officer and Wall Street veteran Jamie Dimon has claimed he did not know of Epstein’s activities until news broke of the criminal operations in 2019.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, top executives at the New York-based bank were actively involved with Epstein, and some staff even kept in contact with him after he shifted his accounts to Deutsche Bank.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">JPMorgan deputies linked to Epstein include its former private banking chief Jes Staley and its current asset and wealth-management chief Mary Erdoes, who was aware of his sex-offender status. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In 2023, JPMorgan agreed to pay the US Virgin Islands – where Epstein’s island is located – a US$75 million settlement for a lawsuit that accused the bank of enabling Epstein’s sex trafficking. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">That same year, it reached a US$290 million settlement with Epstein’s victims. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Wasserman Group leader, Hollywood talent agent Casey Wasserman</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Hollywood talent agent Casey Wasserman came under fire after flirtatious e-mails he exchanged in 2003 with Epstein’s accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell – who is now serving a 20-year prison sentence – surfaced from the Epstein files. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">His talent agency has lost high-profile clients, including pop star Chappell Roan and former US football player Abby Wambach. This has led him to announce plans to put up his agency for sale. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While Wasserman remains in charge of the organising committee of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, there are widespread calls for him to step down. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Deutsche Bank</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Germany’s largest lender banked Epstein from 2013 to 2018 and processed hundreds of transactions for him. These included payments to victims and suspected accomplices.   </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">New York state regulators accused the Frankfurt-based bank of failing to properly vet Epstein’s transactions despite publicly available data of his sexual offences. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Deutsche Bank agreed to pay regulators a US$150 million settlement for compliance failures involving Epstein. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Morgan Stanley </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The investment bank continued to secure banking relationships with entities linked to Epstein following his conviction, opening accounts for his trusts from 2015 to 2019. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Documents showed Morgan Stanley had notified Epstein that it would cease its banking relationship with him after closing a trust account in 2017. However, it subsequently opened another account linked to him in 2019; this was closed shortly afterwards. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Former WEF chief Borge Brende</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The president of the World Economic Forum (WEF) announced his resignation on Thursday after the organisation opened an independent probe into his relationship with Epstein. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Brende, who was previously Norwegian foreign minister, dined with Epstein thrice at business dinners and corresponded with him via e-mail and text messages. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He claims to have been unaware of Epstein’s criminal activity before the two met in 2018. He has also expressed remorse for not investigating Epstein more thoroughly.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Google co-founder Sergey Brin</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Sergey Brin visited Epstein’s island and made dinner plans at his New York City townhouse in 2003, before the financier was convicted as a sex offender. He also corresponded with Maxwell.</p></div>",

The company has said it has not finalised an IPO decision.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">At the same time, the battle over technological guardrails had raised concerns that the Defense Department would follow US law but few other constraints when deploying AI for national-security missions, regardless of safety or ethics terms required by the technology’s developers.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Anthropic had sought guarantees that its AI would not be used for fully autonomous weapons or for mass domestic surveillance - applications in which the Pentagon has said it had no interest.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Anthropic was the first frontier AI lab to put its models on classified networks via cloud provider Amazon.com and the first to build customised models for national security customers, the startup has said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Its product Claude is in use across the intelligence community and armed services.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">US Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat and vice-chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, criticised the action taken by Trump, a Republican.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The president’s directive to halt the use of a leading American AI company across the federal government, combined with inflammatory rhetoric attacking that company, raises serious concerns about whether national security decisions are being driven by careful analysis or political considerations.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Tech companies and the Pentagon have repeatedly locked horns since at least 2018, when employees at Alphabet’s Google protested against the Pentagon’s use of the company’s AI to analyse drone footage. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A rapprochement ensued with companies including Amazon and Microsoft jousting for defence business, while several big-tech CEOs pledged cooperation last year with the Trump administration.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But theoretical “killer robots” have remained a concern held by human-rights and technology activists.
