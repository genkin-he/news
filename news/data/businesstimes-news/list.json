This was primarily due to weaker healthcare sales, as consumer confidence softened amid an uncertain macroeconomic environment.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Conversely, the company recorded lower expenses during the period. The cost of sales fell 18.9 per cent to S$46.3 million, in line with the lower revenue. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Distribution and marketing expenses shrank by 40.3 per cent to S$15.4 million, mainly driven by reduced activities for the healthcare segment. Finance expenses also dropped by 29.1 per cent, largely due to lower borrowing rates.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As a result of these factors, Haw Par’s gross margin remained stable at 55.3 per cent in the second half of 2025, sitting slightly above the 55 per cent margin in the corresponding period of the preceding year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the full year, Haw Par’s profit rose 16.3 per cent to S$265.5 million. This bottom-line growth occurred despite a 6.1 per cent decrease in full-year revenue to S$230 million, which was dragged down by the drop in demand for healthcare in the second half of the year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Its healthcare segment revenue contracted 6.9 per cent to S$210.4 million. Haw Par attributed this drop primarily to lower sales in Asia, noting that consumers have become increasingly cautious in their spending amid weaker sentiment in certain markets. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, tighter cost management on operating expenses helped improve the operating margin. Consequently, the healthcare segment’s operating profit grew by 7.2 per cent to S$67.1 million in 2025.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Revenue from its other segments, which comprise Leisure and Property, improved by 4 per cent to S$19.6 million.

The Kospi Index fell 1 per cent to snap a six-day winning streak. Local institutions and retail investors, meanwhile, were net buyers. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Korean stocks have been on a tear, trouncing other markets as the benchmark soared 170 per cent since an April low. Home to Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, the country has been a direct beneficiary of the memory boom, sidestepping turbulence even as the so-called “AI scare trade” rattled investors elsewhere. Yet the relentless rally driven by a handful of stocks has started to look precarious to some.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“A large sell number tells you sentiment is being reset and positioning is being cleaned up,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets. “Memory upcycle has been a clear narrative, so when volatility rises, the quickest move is to reduce exposure in crowded trades. That can create big flow prints even if fundamentals are intact.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The gauge soared past the 6,000 threshold this week, just a month after surpassing President Lee Jae-myung’s political goal of 5,000. The country’s market valuation even exceeded that of European heavyweights Germany and France. The frenzy to gain exposure to Korean names caused abnormal moves and volumes in exchange-traded funds listed overseas.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Despite the massive selling by foreigners, few see this as a bearish turning point. Kospi still trades at 10.4 times forward earnings estimates, compared to S&amp;P 500’s 21.3 and MSCI Asia-Pacific at 15.3. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The corporate governance reform is also making headway. The parliament this week approved a long-debated legal revision requiring companies to cancel treasury shares. A day later, the president urged a revamp in inheritance tax rules to keep boosting capital markets. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A month-end rebalancing of benchmarks and profit-taking after the breakneck rally triggered the pullback, said Kim Namho, a fund manager at Timefolio Investment Management in Seoul. “Even so, consensus holds that Korean equities remain undervalued, with ample upside after this pause.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Yuanta Securities said MSCI’s rebalancing scheduled for Friday would trigger weight adjustments in funds such as the US-listed iShares MSCI South Korea ETF after Samsung Electronics’ weight exceeded the 25 per cent cap set by regulators. Samsung shares have surged 80 per cent so far this year.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Retail participation is also accelerating, suggesting further upside potential. Investor deposits at the nation’s brokerages – cash available for stock purchases – rose to a new all-time high of 119.5 trillion won, according to Korea Financial Investment Association data. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“There will be opportunities in South Korea amidst any extended sell-off, and we’ll be there as long-term investors,” said Vikas Pershad, an Asian equities portfolio manager at M&amp;G Investments.

The company paid the government RM32 billion in dividends last year.

Petronas reported a 2.2 per cent increase in carbon emissions in 2025 to 56.95 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, attributed mainly to the transfer of operations for two production sharing contracts.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The firm also reported a 72 per cent reduction in methane emissions, exceeding its target of 50 per cent.

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[MILAN] The year that Inter Milan last won the Champions League, in the 2009/10 season, Bodo/Glimt finished sixth in the second division of Norway’s football league.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The gulf in the respective sizes and international reputations of these two clubs is wide.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But Inter, one of the most storied clubs ever to exist – 20-time Serie A champions and three-time European champions – were beaten on Tuesday (Feb 24) in the knockout playoffs of the Champions League, and beaten easily, by “a team from a small town up north”, as Bodo/Glimt’s head coach Kjetil Knutsen put it after the match.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Even that is an understatement: Bodo is so far north that it is just above the Arctic Circle, home to a population of just more than 40,000, all of whom could have fit comfortably inside Inter’s San Siro stadium.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This was not just a plucky upstart taking down a faded giant: Inter is 10 points clear at the top of Serie A and has reached the Champions League final in two of the past three seasons.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It also was not a fluke, or a mugging that Bodo did not deserve. The team hammered Inter in the first leg of the matchup in Norway and kept it at arm’s length in the second. Despite producing less possession (71 per cent to 29 per cent) and fewer shots (30 to seven) in Milan, Bodo never looked in real danger.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This is Bodo’s first season in the Champions League, having come through the qualifiers to reach the league phase, but it also looked likely to go out rather quietly at that stage: After six of its eight games, it stood at 32nd in the standings, having not recorded a win. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It had to beat Manchester City and then Atletico Madrid to stand a chance of even reaching these playoffs, which it somehow managed, but surely the Norwegian team would not be able to pull off another upset? As it turns out, it very much could.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Can you believe it?” Knutsen said after the game, his eyes wide with wonder at what his team had achieved. “I can’t actually believe it. The players were amazing. I’m so proud.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It is also worth pointing out that Bodo is playing in its offseason: The Norwegian league finished in November, and while the end of the domestic season coincided with the team’s revival in Europe, and it has not lost since, it goes against conventional wisdom that a team can succeed without the rhythm of regular football  matches.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“It sounds not true,” said Jens Petter Hauge, the winger who started at Bodo but then left for Inter’s rivals AC Milan in 2020. He returned to Bodo in 2024. “What we have done, I’m so proud of the group. We’re all in this together, and we believe so much in this project.”</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Effective strategy</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Bodo’s success has not come because of some wealthy benefactor. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This is more organic, broadly explained by Knutsen’s adherence to high-intensity, high-energy football and a recruitment strategy that not only finds players who fit that approach, but also identifies those with raw talent and an X-factor – one single outstanding quality that everyone else might have overlooked because the player might be raw and unpolished.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This strategy has worked in recent years, when the team was merely bloodying the noses of the big boys in European football’s two lesser competitions, the Europa League and the Conference League, and it is still working at the highest level, and with some gusto.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Is this win over Inter the biggest upset in the history of the Champions League knockout stages? </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It could well be. Other nominations might include Dynamo Kyiv beating Real Madrid in 1999; Deportivo La Coruna producing an astonishing comeback to beat Milan in 2003-04; or maybe Monaco beating Manchester City in 2016-17. Bodo’s achievement is different from all of those.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It is certainly one of the more extraordinary runs of form the Champions League has ever seen. It is also, as the data firm Opta pointed out, the first time since 1972 that a team from outside the top five European leagues – England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France – has won four consecutive games against teams from those nations in the Champions League or its predecessor, the European Cup. That team in 1972 was Ajax Amsterdam, which went on to win the whole thing.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This is not the first time Bodo/Glimt has made an Italian giant look small: In 2021, it hammered Jose Mourinho’s Roma 6-1 in the Europa Conference League. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Up next for the Norwegian club is either Sporting Lisbon or Manchester City. You would not bet on it being their last miracle, either. NYTIMES</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[LONDON] An AI productivity boom, if it materialises, may help buy major economies more time to clean up their strained public finances, economists say, although it won’t do the heavy lifting.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The stakes could not be higher. Debt is above 100 per cent of output across most rich economies and set to rise given ageing population costs, interest bills and pressure to spend more on defence and climate change.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">US policymakers are already optimistic on AI-driven growth and economists say the technology has the potential to shake the world out of a post-2008 productivity slump by boosting workers’ efficiency and freeing them to focus on more productive tasks.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Higher economic growth would make government spending and debt loads potentially more manageable and help fend off scrutiny from bond vigilantes.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">To sketch the impact on public finances if AI does boost labour productivity over the long term, the OECD and three high- profile economists shared early estimates with Reuters.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Filiz Unsal, the OECD’s deputy director of economic policy and research, said an AI productivity surge, were it to increase employment, would lower debt across OECD countries, from the US to Germany and Japan, by 10 percentage points from the roughly 150 per cent of output the organisation expects in 2036.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">That would still be a sharp rise from 110 per cent currently.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Much will depend on whether job creation eventually outweighs any job losses from automation, as well as whether firms pass on higher profits by raising wages and how governments manage their overall spending.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In the US, two of the other economists projected debt rising more slowly to roughly 120 per cent over the next decade from around 100 per cent of output now in their best-case scenarios. One saw little change.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Productivity is like magic... It helps the fiscal dynamics dramatically,” said Idanna Appio, one of the economists, who was previously at the New York Federal Reserve and is now a fund manager at First Eagle Investment Management.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“But our fiscal problems are well beyond what productivity can fix,” Appio said.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Demographics to limit AI impact</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For now, ratings agency S&amp;P assumes no major public finance impact by the end of the decade.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The one (path) that the (US) administration is hoping for would be you get saved by the bell,” said Mark Patrick, head of macro and country risk at Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, but added: that isn’t “something we can set our clocks by.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The economists did not provide estimates for other countries. However, AI could boost productivity in Britain in line with the US, but by half as much in Italy and Japan due to lower adoption rates and smaller sectors that could benefit from AI, OECD research has found.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Ultimately, fiscal dynamics will determine how much AI-driven productivity can counterbalance rising debt. Demographics is the biggest challenge.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The root of the debt issue is with ageing demographics and the entitlements that are tied to that,” said Kevin Khang, who heads global economic research at Vanguard, the world’s second- largest asset manager.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Addressing it “requires getting the fiscal house in order and (AI is) just buying us the time,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Khang sees a scenario where AI boosts US growth to average 3 per cent through 2040 as most likely. The Fed sees potential growth around 2 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He estimates higher growth and tax revenues would slow US debt growth to around 120 per cent of output by the late 2030s. That’s much lower than the 180 per cent he foresees – higher than others – if AI disappoints, growth slows and market pressure raises borrowing costs.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Bond investors have been quick to punish governments for fiscal largesse ever since bond yields rose sharply after the pandemic across rich economies.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Appio said declining US immigration added to the demographic challenge.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The labour shock offsets any (AI) productivity growth,” she said, but added she would be much more worried without AI.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Uncertainty around tax, spending</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Economy-wide productivity gains should raise revenues. But if AI reduces employment or competition, and profits and capital – often taxed less than labour – see most benefit, revenues could disappoint.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On the spending side, public sector efficiency gains could help costs, but the risk is spending rising alongside growth.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">That’s why Kent Smetters, director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model analysis group, expects a tiny impact on US debt in a decade.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Even if growth is higher than he currently expects, that would still have little impact on curbing social security, which makes up a fifth of federal spending, because claims are indexed to average wages, Smetters said. Other labour costs the government covers would also rise if productivity raises private sector wages, he added.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“It’s very important to see whether wages are going to increase,” the OECD’s Unsal said, adding that wage growth was more likely if AI doesn’t increase employment.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">There are of course debt costs, which will depend on whether productivity raises real interest rates, a debate already emerging at the Fed, and how long growth outpaces any rise, economists said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Clearly, they don’t have crystal balls. A shock could quickly upend this debate.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A recession could mean “the AI boom may not come quick enough before the market gets nervous about the fiscal trajectory,” said Barclays’ global head of economics research Christian Keller.
