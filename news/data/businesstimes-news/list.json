The speed of this pivot was breathtaking. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The sceptics changed their arguments with the terrified fervour of late converts. They did not change their underlying conclusions. The conclusion always came first. The evidence was always completely negotiable. Fear simply found a new vocabulary. \n\nThe extreme optimists are equally guilty of intellectual fraud. They dip aggressively into historical archives for psychological comfort. They point blindly to the invention of the mechanical loom. They cite the widespread adoption of the car. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">They even weaponise the invention of flash-frozen food. They dress blind hope in the respectable garments of historical analysis. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Neither side can paint a credible road map of the coming decades. Both sides plunder the past for convenient anecdotes. History is stripped of its complex context to serve modern dogmas. We are using dead centuries to comfort our living fears.\n\nWhat both camps share is a stubborn refusal to accept reality. We are standing in a genuinely unrecognisable era. A fourth economic sector – beyond agriculture, industry and services – is rising vertically. Its workers are machines.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Historical precedents offer zero intellectual protection. Outsourcing physical labour to machines was easy for our egos. Outsourcing cognition is a direct assault on human pride. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Forecasting the trajectory of machine intelligence with historical analogies is fundamentally absurd. It is like predicting the arc of a modern cricket match by analysing a forgotten sport played in 18th-century Rajasthan. The rules are entirely alien. The fundamental players are no longer exclusively human. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The realisation that our history books are utterly useless will take years to accept. The future has no precedent, but the opportunists already have a script.\n\nMachines themselves are helping us build the most fanatical scenarios imaginable, engineered not for accuracy but for virality, calibrated to stoke the basest emotions of hope and dread in equal measure. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Some of these visions will be proven right. Most will not. It will not matter. By the time any verdict arrives, there will be exponentially more to process, more to fear, more to celebrate, more to argue about. \n\nFor now, the arrow of history points towards a few cold truths. AI will not be useless. It will not suddenly plateau on some invisible scaling law. It will not go unused by the masses. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This reveals exactly how the technology will infiltrate every future argument. It will be used as a blank canvas for human insecurity. It will be weaponised for political ends, financial positioning and bitter personal agendas. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">We are seeing only the first skirmishes of a permanent war of interpretation. People will take aggressive stances on algorithms simply to secure their own relevance. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">History will be dragged from its grave to serve preformed conclusions. It will be shouted loudly across every platform. Volume is the only compensation for the total absence of evidence.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But the true crisis is not societal. The true crisis is fiercely intimate. Most of us wear two fundamentally incompatible masks. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Economists hide this trauma behind sterile terminology. They speak casually of producer utility. They speak academically of consumer utility. The reality is simpler and far more brutal. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In different domains of our lives, we sit on completely different sides of the AI divide. We sit on opposite sides of our own lives. And, we switch sides constantly. Sometimes within the same hour. We are haunted by our own hypocrisy.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Imagine waking up drowning in profound gratitude. An AI perfectly diagnoses a loved one. It spots the invisible anomaly. It actively saves a human life – never mind the career of the displaced radiologist. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nightfall brings a radically different reality. A child returns home with an expensive engineering degree to discover that the job market has shifted beneath them. Fury rapidly replaces the morning gratitude. We are desperate to quarantine the magic from the massacre.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Then, before bed, the portfolio notification arrives. The AI infrastructure company posted record earnings. The retirement account is up. Three emotional states. None of them is dishonest. They inhabit one body. They occur on the exact same day. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A child in a remote village finally receives a world-class education. An algorithm tailors every lesson to her specific mind. It is a beautiful triumph of accessibility. It is also a quiet tragedy. That same child will never secure the offshore service job her older sibling cherished. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Our wallets celebrate the very efficiency that breaks our hearts. The ladder that lifted hundreds of millions into the middle class is being pulled up while a different, unfamiliar ladder is being lowered. Nobody knows if the new one reaches the same floors.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Every convenience comes twinned with a threat. Every gain in one role is shadowed by a loss in another. It is the modern condition of trying to reason with a moody, two-faced Gemini hovering in the OpenAI clouds, never quite knowing if today’s X factor will be benevolence or foreclosure. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The bribe of convenience is simply too sweet to refuse. We willingly fund the exact forces we deeply fear.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">These internal divisions are not temporary. They are permanent features of the new economy.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">We will beg to separate the warmth of the fire from its devastating burn. The separation is impossible. We harbour a personal AI left and a personal AI right. Our political stance shifts dynamically with our daily convenience. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The trauma crosses generations seamlessly. Parents who cheat death via medical algorithms raise children who starve for economic relevance. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nobody designed it this way. It is simply what happens when a force this large moves this fast through a species this complicated.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><strong>The writer is chief executive officer of Singapore-based, global innovation investment company, GenInnov</strong>\n<strong>This is an edited excerpt of an article published on </strong><em><strong>https://www.geninnov.ai/blog</strong></em></p></div>",

They are based on the chief valuer’s assessment of land values and take into account recent land sales. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The LBC framework has also been refined to provide solar operators with greater transparency and certainty, said Tong. Since Sep 1, 2025, solar deployments have been classified under utility use, allowing charges to be calculated using the table of rates instead of spot valuations. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Authorities have moved up the start of the valuation process for cases requiring a spot assessment. The change was in response to feedback on longer timelines for such cases, and could cut project timelines by up to six months, said Tong. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">SLA will continue to review and update its core processes to reduce processing times and administrative burden for developers, landowners and the broader real estate sector, Tong added. </p></div>",

Coupang’s New York-listed shares closed up 1.9 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On an earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Gaurav Anand said active customers in its product commerce segment rose 8 per cent from a year earlier to 24.6 million in the fourth quarter, though they fell from 24.7 million in the previous quarter, which appeared to be related to the data breach.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We are seeing stabilisation since the end of the fourth quarter, with a large number of customers reactivating their accounts and improving trends in customer growth,” Anand said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He added that constant-currency growth in its product commerce segment likely reached its lowest level in January, at about 4 per cent, before showing signs of improvement in February. For the first quarter, Coupang expects consolidated constant-currency revenue growth of 5 to 10 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Anand said that growth and profitability would remain muted over the next few months, reflecting the lingering fallout from the data breach, though the impact should gradually diminish over the course of the year.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Data breach downfall</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The company has said that the breach exposed users’ names, phone numbers, and shipping addresses, although payment details or login credentials were not compromised. Coupang said it would “take all necessary steps to prevent further harm and continue strengthening safeguards to prevent a recurrence”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Harold Rogers, the interim head of Coupang’s South Korean business, said the company has not detected a misuse of customer data attributable to the incident and has found no evidence to date of “any secondary harm”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Rogers added that the breach stemmed from a targeted attack carried out by a former employee who leveraged inside knowledge of Coupang’s systems, citing the findings of a cybersecurity firm’s investigation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, South Korea’s Science Ministry said this month that the breach stemmed from management failures at Coupang rather than a sophisticated cyberattack.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Since the incident, its rivals have jumped in to lure shoppers away from the platform.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It also faces headwinds from a proposed regulatory change that could increase competition in ultra-fast overnight deliveries, which have been a cornerstone of its market dominance.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Separately, earlier on Thursday, South Korea’s antitrust regulator fined Coupang 2.2 billion won (S$1.9 million) for pressuring suppliers to cut prices and shoulder additional costs to meet profit margins, as well as for delaying payments to vendors. The fine is unrelated to the data breach. REUTERS</p></div>",

This will give them confidence in pursuing real estate as a major and long-term career path, said Redas.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Speaking at the association’s annual Spring Festival lunch on Friday (Feb 27), Redas president Tan Swee Yiow said around 40 organisations – from public agencies and developers, to financial institutions, trade associations and consultants – have already expressed interest to participate in the programme. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">These include the Building and Construction Authority,<!-- --> <!-- --> City Developments Limited<!-- --> <!-- -->,<!-- --> <!-- --> DBS<!-- --> <!-- -->, <!-- --> <!-- -->Frasers Property<!-- --> <!-- -->, <!-- --> <!-- -->GuocoLand<!-- --> <!-- --> and <!-- --> <!-- -->Keppel<!-- --> <!-- -->.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Over 50 internship opportunities have been committed to date, Tan said. Roles offered cover asset management, commercial leasing, fintech, project development and more. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“This sends a strong signal that the industry is united and committed about investing in future talent,” said Tan. “We hope more organisations can join us in the months ahead… We also welcome other institutes of higher learning to roll out similar programmes.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The move comes amid declining enrolment in real estate studies. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In a letter to Redas members dated Feb 9, Tan and his predecessor Chia Ngiang Hong noted that the real estate major has been in direct competition with other business disciplines for student interest since being folded into the NUS Business School. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This has raised concerns about the real estate programme’s long-term sustainability, as well as the pipeline of formally trained graduates for the sector. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The issue is pressing as students are set to select their majors in May, they said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“While we recognise that individual organisations may already have their own talent programmes, we hope that by consolidating the opportunities across the industry, Redas can present a clearer, more coordinated signal,” said the two.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“This effort will help students better appreciate the scale, diversity and long-term career pathways within the real estate sector.” </p></div>",

            "title": "‘A geostrategic tectonic plate rupture’: Dr Balakrishnan says agency, partnerships are key amid shifting world order",
            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[SINGAPORE] Singapore’s only option in the evolving world order is to continue to determine its national interests and exercise agency to chart its own path, said Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan on Friday (Feb 27). “This is not just a small tremor. This is geostrategic tectonic plate rupture.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We thrived as a ‘global metropolis’ in an age of globalisation,” he said during his ministry’s Committee of Supply debate in Parliament. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But anti-globalisation sentiments have now not only manifested in domestic policy but undermined support for the international order, he added.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Rules and consensus no longer drive international relations, he warned. This is a more dangerous world for small countries such as Singapore, which have no “strategic heft” to buffer against turbulence – but it has agency, resilience and resources.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We have never been naive,” said Dr Balakrishnan. “There is a deep vein of realism in the way we view the world and the way we operate.”</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Prioritising Singapore</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The city-state must objectively assess its national interests, he said. These are: to safeguard its sovereignty, independence and national unity; to secure access to essential supplies and freedom of navigation; to strengthen its role as a global hub; and to support a rules-based multilateral approach wherever possible.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As Singapore faces more strategic dilemmas and difficult choices, it must retain its “ability to say ‘no’”, said Dr Balakrishnan, the loss of which would result in a loss of relevance and independence.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He highlighted examples of Singapore’s ability to disagree with its partners, speaking out when Russia invaded Ukraine, when the US implemented tariffs that violated the Most Favoured Nation principle, and during the Israel-Gaza conflict.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“These positions we have taken and explicitky stated over the last few years have not been universally welcomed, and even domestically, have elicted active debate” Dr Balakrishnan said. “(But this) aligns with furthering our national interests. Articulating these positions is part of exercising agency.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He laid out five priorities for the ministry.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">First, to engage all great powers constructively and give them a stake in the stability and prosperity of the region. This balance of power gives small states such as Singapore room to manoeuvre, he said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Second, to buttress a wider network of middle-power partnerships for greater stability. Third, to strengthen a stable and integrated Asean, which has “great potential”. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Fourth, to create greater synergy between Singapore and its immediate neighbours. Fifth, to reinforce a rules-based international architecture despite the current headwinds.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Strengthening partnerships</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On Singapore’s relationship with major powers, Dr Balakrishnan noted the significance of its partnerships with both the US and China. It wants to work with both countries “where our interests coincide”, he said, noting that all countries must find “creative ways” to do so.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He updated that the government is still assessing the US ’ invitation to formally join the Board of Peace.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Singapore will also strengthen its partnerships with middle powers and regional blocs, the minister said. It upgraded its partnerships with Australia, France, India, New Zealand and Vietnam in 2025, and established a partnership with South Korea. It also signed the EU-Singapore Digital Trade Agreement.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">To deepen relations with more like-minded partners, the ministry is expanding its global footprint in Africa and Latin America, establishing new missions in Mexico and Ethiopia to support this.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Amid these partnerships, Asean remains the cornerstone of Singapore’s foreign policy, “and a salient platform from which we engage the wider world”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With Singapore assuming chairmanship of the bloc in 2027, during its 60th anniversary, Dr Balakrishnan said it will use its role to pursue deeper integration, promote external partnerships, and keep Asean open and committed to peace, stability and cooperation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the bloc to remain relevant, it must become more cohesive, united and credible, through deeper regional integration, Dr Balakrishnan said. This is why it is pushing hard on key initiatives – such as the Asean Power Grid and Asean Digital Economy Framework Agreement – that bind its economies closer together.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He also emphasised the importance of giving major powers a stake in the region’s stability and prosperity, and ensuring Asean stays the partner of choice.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The more countries invest in Asean’s collective progress, the more stable Asean will be,” he said, noting that the balance of power and interest allows more room to manouevre than single-power dominance.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The bedrock of Asean cohesion is strong neighbourly relationships, Dr Balakrishnan continued.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With Indonesia, Singapore is exploring projects in energy, food security, education and healthcare, discussing cross-border electricity trade, carbon capture and storage, and establishing a Sustainable Industrial Zone across the Bintan-Batam-Karimun corridor. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With Malaysia, Singapore is deepening economic and people-to-people ties with East Malaysia through the establishment of consulates in Sabah and Sarawak, and managing complex outstanding bilateral issues.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Maintaining multilateralism</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Despite the challenges of building consensus in a fractured world, Dr Balakrishnan said that Singapore remains committed to the rules-based multilateral system, which provides “the architecture of norms, standards and institutions that protect the global commons and give all small states a say”. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We must continue to do our best to build overlapping, flexible circles of plurilateral partnerships with like-minded countries,” he said, highlighting the Joint Statement Initiative on E-commerce Agreement as one example, which began with Singapore, Australia, and Japan and now has 72 co-sponsors.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Recognising that Singaporeans will have different views on foreign policy issues, Dr Balakrishnan said that they do not need to agree on foreign policy stances, but must agree that these are matters “to be discussed and decided by Singaporeans alone”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While foreign actors will try to push their narratives and deepen internal divisions, Singapore – with its diverse population that is vulnerable to becoming polarised and fractured – must guard against this, he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">We do not expect a stable new equilibrium to take shape in 2026, or frankly, even the next couple of years” warned Dr Balakrishnan. But he added that, conpared to when Singapoe unexpectedly became indepenedent, the country is in a far better position, in terms of tools and resources.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It has three prerequisites for success, he said: domestic unity, where it inoculates itself from foreign influence; economic relevance, where its value as a hub is accentuated by the more fractious world; and its ability to defend itself, through National Service and steady investment.</p></div>",
