Singaporeans are speculating in COEs,” Nielsen had joked.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, the secondary market for EVs is currently struggling to digest the influx of vehicles, upending the traditional financial math for buyers. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Ng Lee Kwang, managing director of new and used car dealer Octagon Motors, noted that used petrol cars typically sell in six weeks to three months, but that his network suggests dealers are having to budget up to six months to move a used EV.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Hesitance over battery technology becoming outdated means that some dealers now refuse to absorb inventory risk, and opt to take used EVs only on consignment. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This uncertainty is exacerbated by new market entrants’ aggressive pricing strategies, which can wipe out a car’s resale value overnight.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For some high-net-worth buyers, the lower entry prices of mass-market EVs have turned them into novelty purchases for which steep depreciation is simply an afterthought.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Ng noted that some wealthy individuals in his circle are buying affordable EV models like the BYD Sealion “just for fun” or to “try it out” – all while keeping their luxury petrol sports cars at home. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Insulated by their wealth, these buyers are largely unbothered by volatile EV resale values or the slashed Parf rebates, he added.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Not only that, the end of a 10-year COE cycle brings steep hidden costs. Ng said that specialised disposal companies now charge between S$2,000 and S$3,000 just to scrap an old high-voltage battery. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With the Parf rebate now slashed, owners can no longer rely on a robust government payout to cushion these “end-of-life” expenses for their vehicles.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Even day-to-day operating savings are increasingly heavily scrutinised. Some drivers hail the lower cost of electricity relative to petrol, but others are finding the ledger balanced out by punitive administrative fees. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">N Meenakshi Sundaram, a procurement manager,  recently switched from a diesel BMW to an electric BYD Atto 3, and is finding that the operational savings are entirely offset by higher annual EV road taxes and insurance premiums.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“If you think about the road tax and everything, it’s cut to square,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Soh Ming, Singapore managing director of Chinese EV maker Dongfeng, countered that the used EV market’s current volatility reflects “rapid model turnover rather than a structural weakness in EV residual values”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Because EVs rely more on upfront green rebates than back-end Parf rebates, their depreciation curves are less affected by the Budget 2026 cuts, narrowing the lifecycle cost gap against petrol cars, he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Still, he admitted that the loss of a guaranteed scrap value remains a psychological hurdle. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The transition will be more about changing how value is framed, from ‘what I get back at the end’ to ‘what I spend each month’,” he said. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Potential gridlock</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Beyond the financial friction, EV adoption faces a hard physical ceiling. The current battery-charging landscape dictates that the EV lifestyle is highly dependent on housing type. EV owners living in condominiums and HDB estates need to share charging stations; those living in landed property have the luxury of personal charging points in their own homes.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For private condominium resident Ashit Arora, who switched from a petrol Kia Cerato to a GAC Aion V electric crossover, the EV transition has been largely seamless. Residents in his estate, owning 20 to 30 EVs among them, share six chargers; they use an app to check on the availability of charging stations from the comfort of his living room. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A full charge costs him S$33, about 40 per cent less than a tank of petrol.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The reality is different for the majority of the market, however. As at last November, about 57 per cent of car-owning households were living in public HDB flats.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Sundaram, who lives in an HDB flat, said EV owners in three blocks of flats in his estate now share just three chargers – and slow ones at that.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“If more (EVs come in), then we will fight each other,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Such issues are compounded by the rapid electrification of commercial fleets and private-hire vehicles. Dongfeng’s Soh noted, however, that while these high-mileage drivers increase charger utilisation and friction in the short term, they also strengthen the commercial case for a faster rollout of charging infrastructure. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Ultimately, for mass-market buyers, “predictability matters more than the absolute number of chargers”, Soh said, calling reliable, overnight home-charging in HDB estates the “key unlock” for private ownership.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Last October, Acting Minister for Transport Jeffrey Siow disclosed that of the 25,000 EV charging points islandwide, more than 7,500 have been installed in about 85 per cent of HDB carparks. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We are also on track to achieve our earlier target of deploying 60,000 charging points by 2030,” he had said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, Octagon Motors’ Ng believes that the national power grid’s capacity to handle mass charging might be a concern.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He suggested that it could be structurally impossible to outfit three-quarters of all 6,800 HDB multi-storey carparks with EV chargers without overwhelming local substations – and that Singapore’s pure EV population may top out at 50 to 55 per cent, with hybrids making up the rest.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The government is already bracing itself for this pressure. Minister-in-charge of Energy and Science and Technology Tan See Leng said last October that Singapore is taking measures to <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/esg/singapore-future-proofing-its-grid-meet-higher-energy-demand-evs-data-centres\" target=\"_blank\">“future-proof” its power grid</a> as demand from EVs and data centres increases. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Consequently, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) is working with transport operator ComfortDelGro on a 13-month sandbox to automatically adjust EV charger energy consumption in response to real-time power system needs.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The EMA website also states that it is working with the Land Transport Authority to “study the long-term electrical infrastructure needs” for EV charging. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The energy regulator said that preliminary findings indicate that upgrades will be needed for the consumer intake substations at the local level, the distribution grid network, as well as power generation. These upgrades will be implemented over the “next two decades”.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Quality-of-life friction</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Charging limits compound daily consumer friction. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Dr Bimlesh Wadhwa, a professor at the National University of Singapore (NUS) who has owned a Hyundai Ioniq 5 EV for over two years, said that the straightforward petrol run has been replaced by a fractured tech ecosystem requiring multiple apps, a range of payment gateways and frustration over unstable Wi-Fi in underground carparks.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">To scale properly, she suggested that the charging infrastructure must reach “the vending machine level of usability” – to the point that a driver can simply tap a card, pay, and walk away.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Still, with EV chargers located closer to her NUS residence than petrol pumps, her experience of driving out to charge her car has not been too dissimilar from petrol runs with her previous car.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But such daily friction for others, combined with battery range anxiety, explains why automakers foresee a moderation in the EV sector. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Ritu Chandy, head of sales for BMW in the Asia-Pacific, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, told <em>The Business Times</em> in an earlier interview that she expects a potential plateau in EV sales, now that the initial wave of early adopters has bought in.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Pushing EV adoption past its current tipping point will thus likely require the broader support ecosystem to catch up to government mandates. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With a significant chunk of prospective buyers still hesitant, the next phase of Singapore’s green transition will no longer be driven by early adopters willing to overlook growing pains. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Instead, mass-market success will ultimately be dictated by the government’s ability to unlock neighbourhood charging for the public housing majority, and unfreeze an illiquid secondary asset market.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><strong>Additional reporting by Derryn Wong</strong></p></div>",

Our economy has recalibrated its course and is advancing steadily.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He projected that Hong Kong’s economy will grow by 2.5 to 3.5 per cent in 2026.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Gross domestic product rose by a surprisingly strong 3.5 per cent in 2025, in a third straight year of growth after the city’s stretch in the doldrums from social unrest and the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Between 2027 and 2030, it is expected to expand by an annual 3 per cent in real terms. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Economic sentiment in Hong Kong has improved markedly.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In 2025, home prices rose for the first time in four years, with banks now forecasting double-digit gains in property values for 2026.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The benchmark Hang Seng Index ended 2025 up a whopping 28 per cent, and has risen a further 4 per cent so far in 2026.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Initial public offerings (IPOs) have jumped, too, with the listing of more than 110 companies raising US$37 billion (S$47 billion) in 2025, and 100 more in the pipeline for 2026 so far.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Retail sales have also eked out gains for eight straight months, as the city welcomed 12 per cent more visitors in 2025, compared with the preceding year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">All these factors enabled Hong Kong to achieve an operating account surplus through its taxes collected. The capital account remains in deficit.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The operating account covers the government’s short-term expenses to keep it running, while the capital account is for long-term investments to drive the city’s development and growth.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The consolidated amount comes up to a HK$2.9 billion surplus, which also includes bond sale proceeds that the government will have to repay when the bonds come due.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Fiscal reserves will reach HK$657.2 billion by the end of March 2026.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Hong Kong’s economic growth and improved financial situation – another HK$22.1 billion surplus is expected in the 2026/2027 fiscal year – allow Chan greater flexibility to invest in the city’s future.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Among his key measures, some HK$30 billion will go towards accelerating artificial intelligence (AI) adoption and developing the Northern Metropolis border tech hub near Shenzhen.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The finance chief will lead a new committee to facilitate AI use across industries, with an initial focus in biotech and smart robot technology.

GfK’s headline confidence barometer has erased all the gains made since November, when Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves’ decision to refrain from raising broad-based taxes lifted the public mood.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Relief is now giving way to renewed unease, with unemployment at a five-year high and forecast to climb further. Neil Bellamy, consumer insights director at GfK, warned that “this is increasing concerns about job security, particularly given the backdrop of weak wage growth”. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Bank of England (BOE) policymakers are closely watching the consumer picture as they debate when, and whether, to cut interest rates again. Catherine Mann, one of the BOE’s most hawkish voices, recently said she’s examining whether it’s the fear of job losses, rather than price pressures, that is keeping households reluctant to spend.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Fewer households on balance thought now is the right time to make major purchases, while an index tracking their personal financial outlook fell the most in almost a year, GfK said. Far more expected the economy as a whole to get worse than improve over the next year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Unemployment worries are rising rapidly among young people in particular, GfK’s data showed, as the youngest workers are bearing the brunt of the UK’s jobs crisis. The number of 16 to 24-year-olds left out of work and education climbed to almost one million at the end of last year, data on Thursday showed.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“With fewer entry-level opportunities available, those on lower incomes are already feeling the strain, and this trend risks undermining the typically more optimistic outlook held by younger age groups,” Bellamy said.

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[TOKYO] A Tokyo inflation gauge eased to the slowest pace in more than a year as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s utility subsidies curbed household energy costs, posing a communication challenge for the Bank of Japan (BOJ) as it looks to proceed with interest rate hikes.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Consumer prices excluding fresh food rose 1.8 per cent in the capital from a year earlier in February, the smallest gain since October 2024, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs on Friday (Feb 27). That was a touch stronger than the median economist forecast of 1.7 per cent. The Tokyo CPI report is a leading indicator for national price trends.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The price gauge was widely expected to weaken for a third straight month as the impact of government steps to lower utility bills starts to impact data. A measure that also strips out energy to reflect the underlying strength of the inflation trend increased 2.5 per cent, staying above the BOJ’s 2 per cent target. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Friday’s data add to evidence that Japan’s price growth has entered a cooler phase largely owing to Takaichi’s anti-inflation steps and slowing growth in food costs. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While the BOJ will look past temporary factors in making policy decisions, the slower gains may complicate governor Kazuo Ueda’s task of justifying any further rate hikes. That’s especially true after the prime minister signalled her support for easy monetary policy with her first nominations for the central bank’s board earlier this week.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The yen was a fraction stronger after the price data, trading around 155.90 to the US dollar, after the slightly stronger-than-expected reading.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Energy prices dropped 9.2 per cent from a year earlier as the impact of the government’s three-month subsidy programme to lower electricity and gas bills took effect in January. The government estimates that the programme will save 7,300 yen (S$59.27) for an average household over the course of the quarter.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The BOJ has already said that inflation is likely to ease below its 2 per cent target in the first half of this year, mainly because of the utility subsidies and distortions caused by comparisons with a year ago, when food prices surged. Officials have emphasised that they are focusing on underlying inflation trends rather than temporary, one-off influences.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The elevated cost of food has become a critical subject in political debates after soaring living costs played a primary role in two major electoral setbacks for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) before Takaichi took the helm in October. Japanese households now devote a record portion of their spending to food, limiting the scope for discretionary outlays.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Takaichi’s leadership appeal, along with her commitment to quelling inflation, enabled her to lead the LDP to its most decisive triumph in history earlier this month.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The prime minister surprised some BOJ watchers earlier this week by nominating two professors with reflationist backgrounds to become new board members later this year in an apparent sign of her desire to see easy monetary conditions continue.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Friday’s data alone are not likely to shake the BOJ’s resolve to raise its benchmark rate when its economic outlook is realised. With the yen’s lingering weakness, traders see a roughly 69 per cent chance of a rate hike by April as at Friday, according to pricing in the overnight swaps index.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The BOJ delivers its next policy decision on Mar 19.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In other releases on Friday, factory output rose a weaker-than-expected 2.2 per cent in January from the previous month, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry reported. That compared with a consensus forecast for a 5.5 per cent gain. Output rose 2.3 per cent from a year earlier.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Retail sales gained 4.1 per cent in January compared with the previous month, coming in above expectations.

Still, the bid is likely to face antitrust scrutiny in Washington, foreign countries and US states, including California.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Richard Blumenthal have worried that approval of the deal could be tainted by political favouritism.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In its revised bid, Paramount raised the termination fee it would pay should the deal fail to gain regulatory approval to US$7 billion from US$5.8 billion.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Ellison Trust is committing US$45.7 billion in equity, up from US$43.6 billion previously, backed by Larry Ellison and including any additional funds needed to satisfy Paramount’s bank solvency requirements, the firm said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi and Apollo are providing US$57.5 billion in debt financing, increased from an earlier US$54 billion commitment.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Activist investor Ancora Holdings, which owns a small stake in Warner Bros, has also stepped up pressure on the HBO owner by saying the company did not adequately engage with Paramount.
