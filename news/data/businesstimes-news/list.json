They also need to use personal loans rather than mortgages and have to go through the company if they want to resell.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Alvarez, a prospective buyer who declined to give his first name, said Habitacion.com offered to help him get a personal 10-year loan from a regional bank at 6 per cent interest, twice the regular mortgage average, but in the end could not find any rooms in Madrid where he lives.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He also said the scheme, while a good option in general for young people with not enough savings, “loses all appeal if I can’t live with my partner.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Meanwhile, in London, developer Fairview has a “Buddy Up” scheme, offering to connect friends with a broker and solicitor and covering up to £2,000 (S$S$3,406) towards legal fees if they decide to buy property together in the capital or its surroundings.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Banks in Britain, France, Germany and Italy are also reviving low or zero-deposit mortgages that vanished after the 2008 financial crisis.

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">THE Trump administration is seeking to delay court proceedings over whether it must refund importers billions of dollars in tariffs recently struck down by the US Supreme Court, marking a contentious start to the next phase of the legal fight.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The government wants to wait as long as four months before reviving litigation before the US Court of International Trade on the refund question, according to a filing by the Justice Department late Friday. DOJ lawyers criticised lawyers for companies in one of the lead cases for pressing to reopen the legal wrangling as soon as possible.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Complexity in the future counsels appropriately careful process, not breakneck speed,” the government said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Justice Department appeared to acknowledge that there will be a refund process after its loss in the Supreme Court, warning that “the coming process will take time” and noting the example of an earlier mass refund situation that took years to play out.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But the government’s filing didn’t offer a full-throated assurance that the administration would commit to refunding all importers the full amount of tariffs they paid. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The DOJ lawyers wrote that a delay wouldn’t hurt companies because “monetary loss is a classic harm that can be remedied by payment of money with appropriate interest.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Last year, the government successfully argued for judges to allow the administration to continue collecting tariffs while the legal fight was pending, at one point telling the trade court that the plaintiffs “will assuredly receive payment on their refund with interest” if they won.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Importers had paid approximately US$170 billion in the contested duties by the time the justices ruled, according to Bloomberg Economics analysis.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Sara Albrecht, chairperson of Liberty Justice Center, which has represented companies in the case before the Supreme Court, said in a statement that “the government cannot have it both ways.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“It cannot argue there is no harm because refunds are available — and then delay when the time comes to return the money,” she said. “American businesses paid money the government had no authority to collect. That money does not belong to Washington. It belongs to the American people who earned it.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision on Feb 20 was silent on the refund question, meaning it will go back to the New York-based trade court to resolve. But that next phase is in limbo until the Supreme Court and US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit formally close out their proceedings, which hasn’t happened yet.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Over the past week, lawyers for companies seeking refunds have asked the Federal Circuit to swiftly take steps to finish its phase of the case and urged the trade court to move quickly to establish a schedule for the next round.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Justice Department, by contrast, wants the Federal Circuit to wait until the Supreme Court finalises its judgment, which can take up to 32 days. After that happens, the government is then arguing for another 90-day delay, saying that it would “allow the political branches an opportunity to consider options.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The administration accused the companies of pushing for a speedy schedule out of an “apparent desire to be the center of attention” in the future proceedings before the trade court.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The latest filing also referred to Trump’s move to impose new global tariffs under a different legal authority after the Supreme Court ruled, citing the fact that the levies declared unlawful by the Supreme Court “have been replaced by vigorous new tariffs.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The government didn’t elaborate on the relationship between the new duties and the question of whether businesses should be refunded for money they already paid.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Trump signalled the administration might contest refunds shortly after the Supreme Court announced its decision, telling reporters “I guess it has to get litigated.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In a social media post on Friday, he appeared to refer to potential refunds as an “undeserved ‘windfall’” and asked, “Is a Rehearing or Readjudication of this case possible???”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">More than 2,000 tariff lawsuits have been filed so far, nearly all of which were lodged in the trade court after the Supreme Court heard arguments in November. The trade court paused all of the cases until the Supreme Court ruled.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Only importers are eligible to seek refunds directly from customs authorities, but consumers recently joined the fray as well, filing a handful of proposed class actions this week to recoup the higher prices they paid as businesses passed on the cost of the levies.

But I am ready to answer them,” the former president said in his opening statement.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Garcia told reporters before the deposition began that Democrats “have real questions, questions that deserve serious answers from former President Clinton” but “what we do not want today is a sideshow.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Bill Clinton took several trips on Epstein’s private plane before Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to Florida state charges that included procurement of a minor to engage in prostitution. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Epstein also donated US$1,000 to Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign and US$20,000 to Hillary Clinton’s 2000 US Senate campaign. A charity controlled by Epstein contributed US$25,000 to the Clintons’ private foundation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In an interview with the BBC in mid-February, Hillary Clinton said her husband had flown on Epstein’s private jet “for his charitable work” and she didn’t recall ever meeting Epstein. She said she had met Maxwell “on a few occasions.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of recruiting girls for sexual abuse and participating in some of the assaults. She is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Bill Clinton has said that he parted ways with Epstein many years before the financier’s 2019 death in a New York jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Authorities ruled the death a suicide.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Clintons yielded to Republican demands to appear before a House committee investigating Epstein after GOP lawmakers threatened to hold them both in contempt of Congress if they didn’t testify.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Clintons said they’d offered to send sworn statements to the House committee as others who’d been subpoenaed to testify had done, but the Republican-led panel turned them down.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Democratic lawmakers said the panel should follow the precedent set with Clinton and subpoena Trump to testify under oath.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“President Trump was in the Epstein files almost more than anyone else besides Ghislaine Maxwell,” Garcia told reporters. “Answer our questions. This is not a hoax. He has not been exonerated.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that Trump had been “totally exonerated on anything relating to Epstein” and has “done more for Epstein’s victims than anyone before him.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Trump has denied any knowledge of Epstein’s criminal activities.

His visit to Corpus Christi placed him near several competitive US House of Representatives districts where Hispanic voters, an important constituency for Republicans nationally, could determine the outcome in November’s midterm elections.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Trump, wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat, spoke to several hundred supporters at a waterfront rally in front of a ship he said had carried oil from the United States’ “new friend and partner” Venezuela.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Trump boasted about his single-minded determination to increase production of fossil fuels blamed for climate change, saying his policies had led to lower petrol prices and helped boost economic growth. Gas prices are about 4 per cent lower since January last year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We’re witnessing a historic American energy boom like we’ve never seen,” Trump said. The trip followed a warning from a Texas Republican who said her recent loss in a state legislature race, despite Trump’s endorsement, was a “wake-up call” for the party.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Trump urged his supporters to vote. “We don’t want to lose the midterm.

But first, Republicans in the deeply conservative state of Texas must settle on who they want to represent them in November’s general election.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Public opinion polls show Senator John Cornyn, in office since 2002, trailing two challengers - Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and US Representative Wesley Hunt - in Texas’ most cutthroat contest.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Trump told reporters on Friday that he had “pretty much” decided who to support but would not share the name.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">During the rally, Trump revelled in the three-way competition. “It’s going to be an interesting one,” Trump said, taking time to shout out each candidate in attendance.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As he has done several times before, Trump also raised the prospect of seeking an unconstitutional third term as president.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><strong>Can forced restricting rescue Republicans?</strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">At the president’s urging last year, Texas Republicans launched a redistricting fight aimed at improving the party’s prospects in US House races. With the new map in effect, Republicans could gain up to five more seats across the state.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Hispanic voters in south Texas are key to the party’s electoral success, said Corpus Christi’s state Senator Adam Hinojosa, the first Republican to represent the Rio Grande Valley in the Texas Senate since 1874.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We need the job opportunities, we need to make sure that our families are taken care of, we need to be able to afford all of the groceries and things to have a decent lifestyle,” Hinojosa said in an interview ahead of the rally. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Trump has prioritised maximising US fossil fuel production by rolling back environmental regulations and streamlining permitting for energy projects. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Corpus Christi area is the top exporter of liquefied natural gas in the US.
