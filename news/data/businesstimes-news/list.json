We can’t stop thinking, “that’s a lot of papier-mache”. White, craggy lumps proliferating across the walls of an otherwise stunning Korean hanok – not so much plastered, but almost breeding. Is it a design statement, or cautionary tale of mildew left unchecked for generations?</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But you have to give it to DRIM. Its newest – and biggest – opening at Resorts World Sentosa is made for impact, competing with the likes of Harry Potter and a United Nations of theme park-worthy food concepts. Having exhausted the “mid-Joseon emperor’s backyard” aesthetic at its debut space in Mandarin Gallery, it’s moved into “go big or go home” territory.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Wonky cave metaphor aside, DRIM Gold spares no expense in turning Korean barbecue into performance art. It’s high-stakes hospitality the moment you step in – the reception coolly sorts out your reservation mix-up (we booked Mandarin Gallery by mistake) while hostess Ashley swiftly walks you through the menu and table set-up. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Meanwhile, a drill sergeant dressed in civilian clothing paces up and down with an eagle eye and a walkie-talkie, keeping everyone on their toes.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">There’s a lot to take in once you’re seated, thanks to its sheer size. Beyond the amorphous columns of faux limestone are barbecue stations in every configuration – from solo diners to rowdy K-drama club gatherings. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Thick timber pillars and rafters give it that old-world feel, but the vibe is more efficient banquet dining than endearing “anhyeong” folksiness. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Think of DRIM Gold as its Orchard Road sibling in overdrive – with an expanded menu that includes the newly-trending Korean beef (hanwoo) and pork, at prices inspired by the precious metal. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Hanwoo short rib is tagged at S$102 for 100 gm, for a minimum order of 200 gm. The cut of the day, striploin, costs slightly more, at S$110 per 100 gm. Feeling sadistic? Multiply that into kilogram pricing and marvel at the mark-up. If you buy the equivalent at retail price, it’s in the region of S$300 to S$350.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">There are “budget” alternatives – USDA prime short rib at S$58 per 100 gm, or wagyu oyster blade at S$68. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Pork is a bargain in comparison, with Jeju black pork averaging S$38 per 100 gm.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">There are hanwoo set menus at S$248 a head (for a minimum of two diners), but you lose out on variety. It’s best to pay for only what you want. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">That includes a crunchy water parsley pancake (S$34) – pretend you’re fulfilling your daily veggie quota even if it’s covered in a blanket of chewy-crisp fried batter. Dried shrimp takes this guilty pleasure up a notch.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Butter-grilled Jeju abalone (S$88) yields plump butter-grilled morsels with little tooth resistance, but not much character. The grated cheese on top is a pesky distraction. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The cold noodles (S$33) go down well – slippery, chewy, slicked with the vegetal perfume of perilla oil and tossed in a parade of condiments.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Service here is virtually Gold standard. Every table has an assigned grill expert, and ours is Darren, tasked to cook, entertain and take care of us. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In between carefully draping slices of marinated hanwoo short rib and striploin over controlled flames, he narrates the matching benefits of Maldon salt, wasabi, spicy fish roe, pickled garlic leaves and other assorted banchan. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Salt is the most neutral, but feel free to wrap, dip and munch in any way you like. Raw garlic slightly charred on the grill is a must, even if you don’t plan to meet any vampires later.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The marinated short rib is mildly sweet and not cloying, so you still taste the fine texture of the meat. The striploin is a better cut – with a cleaner beefiness and steak-like texture. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Quality-wise, hanwoo isn’t as fatty as Japanese wagyu and more tender than Australian wagyu. But the variety available in Singapore tastes entry-level, compared to what you can get in Seoul. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Still, if you can stomach the price, it’s a good fallback between trips. Jeju pork, in contrast, is better value. It’s superior to local pork and fresher than iberico, if still better at source.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">DRIM is only as good as its ingredients are. Add accessibility and good service, and you get an all-round, fuss-free – if slightly over-the-top – experience. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It aims for gold, but it’s not quite there yet.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><strong>Rating: 6.5</strong></p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[ZURICH] The president and CEO of the World Economic Forum (WEF), Borge Brende, said he was stepping down on Thursday (Feb 26), a few weeks after the forum launched an independent investigation into his relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Brende, who became president of the WEF in 2017, announced his decision in a statement following disclosures from the US Justice Department that showed the Norwegian had three business dinners with Epstein and had also communicated with the disgraced financier via email and text message.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“After careful consideration, I have decided to step down as President and CEO of the World Economic Forum. My time here, spanning 8½ years, has been profoundly rewarding,” Brende said. The statement made no mention of Epstein.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I am grateful for the incredible collaboration with my colleagues, partners, and constituents, and I believe now is the right moment for the Forum to continue its important work without distractions,” added Brende, a former Norwegian foreign minister.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Brende has said he was unaware of Epstein’s past and criminal activities before first meeting him in 2018, and that he regretted not having investigated him more thoroughly.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Brende’s decision to quit follows a series of revelations relating to Epstein, who in 2008 was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor. The revelations have roiled business and political elites, and even the British royal family.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Independent review</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In a separate statement, Andre Hoffmann and Larry Fink, co-chairs of the Geneva-based forum that organises the annual Davos summit, said the independent review conducted by outside counsel into Brende’s ties with Epstein had concluded.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The findings stated there were no additional concerns beyond what has been previously disclosed, it added.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The co-chairs said the WEF’s Alois Zwinggi will serve as interim president and CEO, and that the forum’s Board of Trustees will oversee the leadership transition, including a plan to drive a process to identify a permanent successor.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The US Justice Department has released more than three million pages of documents relating to Epstein, who died by suicide in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">His ties to a long list of business and political leaders, including US President Donald Trump, former President bill Clinton and Tesla CEO Elon Musk are under close scrutiny.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Overseas, the revelations have prompted criminal investigations of Britain’s Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former Duke of York, and other prominent figures.
