            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[LONDON] Vegetarian diets are linked with a lower risk of several cancers, including pancreatic, breast and prostate, according to a study that found no similar benefit – and even a higher chance of colon cancer – among vegans.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Researchers found people on vegetarian diets had a lower risk of five cancers compared with their meat-eating counterparts, though vegetarians had nearly double the risk of a cancer in the oesophagus called squamous cell carcinoma. The pioneering study, published on Friday (Feb 27) in the <em>British Journal of Cancer</em>, looked at pooled data from more than 1.8 million people across three continents.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The findings come at a time of renewed focus on diet after the US President Donald Trump’s administration updated US nutrition guidelines with an emphasis on animal-based protein. Concerns around the impact of ultra-processed foods, which the study did not look at, are also growing in the US and globally.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Though the study did not probe the cause of a higher or lower risk of certain cancers, researchers hypothesised that diets higher in fruit, vegetables, fibre and without processed meat could lower risks. The lack of meat is likely to be the reason for the different risk, according to Tim Key, emeritus professor of epidemiology at Oxford Population Health and co-investigator of the study.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Perhaps the biggest surprise was the finding for vegans. Red meat intake has long been associated with bowel cancer, yet vegans – who eat no meat or dairy – had a higher risk of this cancer in the study.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">That may have been because many of the meat eaters in the study only ate moderate amounts of processed meat, according to the researchers. There were also relatively few overall cases of colon cancer among the vegans.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Still, the researchers said dairy might hold the key. “We are postulating that it could be because vegans have no dairy intake,” said Yashvee Dunneram, first author of the study. “Their calcium intake are really low in this consortium.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The reduction in key vitamins and minerals might also be in play when it comes to the significantly higher risk among vegetarians of squamous cell carcinoma. “It may be related with a low intake of riboflavin,” said Aurora Perez Cornago, principal investigator of the study, while stressing that this was just a hypothesis. Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is found in foods such as beef liver, eggs, fortified cereals, and milk.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Vegetarians in the study did have a lower risk of pancreatic, breast, prostate, kidney and multiple myeloma. One possible factor is weight. The vegetarians in the study had a lower body mass index, and while the researchers adjusted for this in the results, they hypothesised that this weight difference could still be behind the lower risk of breast cancer, for example.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">People on pescatarian diets, meaning they eat seafood and dairy but do not eat meat, also showed a lower risk of colon, breast and kidney cancer in the study.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">One thing missing from the study was a comparison to a diet based on guidelines from the UK’s National Health Service, where meat and fish are consumed but only in moderation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">That provides important nutrients and may be the optimum diet for reducing the risk of diet-associated cancer, according to Jules Griffin, director of the Rowett Institute at the University of Aberdeen, who was not involved in the study.

That’s what we are going to find out.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In 2020, the Premier League boss first revealed that the league was looking into plans to sell content via a direct streaming platform in a move that could see lower subscription costs for fans. This would eliminate the middleman and allow the league to provide content straight to viewers, rather than via rights sales to TV broadcasters.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Premier League Plus model could be similar to the National Basketball Association’s (NBA) subscription service, which offers annual and monthly plans for fans here to watch matches on the official app. <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/english-premier-league-set-to-launch-direct-to-consumer-streaming-in-singapore?ref=top-stories\" target=\"_blank\">THE STRAITS TIMES</a></p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[BENGALURU] Dell said that it expects revenue from its key artificial intelligence (AI)-optimised servers business to double in fiscal year 2027 and promised to return more cash to shareholders, sending its shares surging 10 per cent in extended trading.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The company announced a 20 per cent hike in its cash dividend and an additional US$10 billion for its share repurchase programme. Big tech firms, such as Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, are expected to spend at least US$630 billion to build AI infrastructure this year, which would boost demand for server and data centre equipment from vendors such as Dell and rival Super Micro Computer.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">US trade regulations and surging memory chip costs due to the AI infrastructure buildout have forced companies such as Dell and HP to implement price increases, which are helping them offset cost pressures. Almost all servers have memory chips that hold data and instructions, keeping processors running at high speed, which is paramount for AI applications.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Initially, infrastructure clients experienced “sticker shock” but quickly grasped the supply constraints, shifting their focus to securing necessary components, which led large customers to aggressively acquire supply for their AI servers, traditional servers, and storage build-outs, Dell chief operating officer Jeff Clarke said on a post-earnings call.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The company raised server prices on Dec 10, while price changes for PCs occurred on Jan 6, Clarke said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Dell expects AI server revenue to grow 103 per cent to about US$50 billion in fiscal 2027.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The company said that it has more than 4,000 AI server customers, including Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI and CoreWeave.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Dell forecast annual revenue of US$138 billion to US$142 billion, above analysts’ average estimate of US$125.54 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. The memory chip squeeze is expected to dampen global demand for consumer electronics, including PCs, smartphones, and gaming consoles. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">HP said that it expected fiscal 2026 results to be at the low end of its prior forecasts, while China’s Lenovo warned about mounting pressures on PC shipments.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“By proactively addressing rising memory costs, and demonstrating early success reflected in both its fiscal first quarter results and full-year guidance, the company showed it is getting ahead of a challenge that continues to pressure peers,” said Hendi Susanto, a portfolio manager and research analyst at Gabelli Funds, which holds Dell shares.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Dell expects annual adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of US$12.90, above estimates of US$11.59.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In the first quarter, Dell expects revenue between US$34.7 billion and US$35.7 billion, above estimates of US$29.13 billion.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The first-quarter adjusted EPS forecast of US$2.90 exceeded estimates of US$2.37.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It reported record revenue of US$33.4 billion in the fourth quarter, beating estimates of US$31.73 billion. Its adjusted EPS of US$3.89 also exceeded the US$3.53 estimate.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Dell’s revenue from its infrastructure solutions group, which includes its storage, software, and server offerings, jumped 73 per cent to US$19.60 billion, while sales from the client solutions group, home to PCs, rose 14 per cent to US$13.49 billion.
