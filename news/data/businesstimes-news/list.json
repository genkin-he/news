That edged out wind generation, which rose 13 per cent to 1.13 million gigawatt-hours.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The rapid growth of renewables helped China meet its growing electricity consumption last year without the need to burn more coal at power plants, with thermal generation falling 0.7 per cent. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Even so, coal remains the dominant source of China’s power and the fuel’s share of total energy consumption fell only marginally in 2025 to 51.4 per cent. Total coal consumption was 0.1 per cent higher, likely reflecting the fuel’s use in the growing coal-to-chemicals sector.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China produced more electricity using solar last year than Japan’s entire grid, and panels now account for 11 per cent of the nation’s total generation, compared to less than 1 per cent a decade ago. That is the result of the huge supply chain Chinese companies have developed and the versatility of the technology, which is quick to deploy and has been adopted in a wide range of locations – from vast desert installations to small village rooftops.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Still, solar’s rise has not been without complications. Most equipment manufacturers are struggling with losses because of overcapacity and low prices, while the influx of so much electricity in daylight hours means major investment is now needed in power lines and energy storage facilities to ensure the electricity does not go to waste.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Wind technology tends to produce power for more hours of the day than solar, meaning it is only now being overtaken in terms of generation – even though panels have offered greater capacity in China for several years.

It was trading at around US$67,700 at 11 am in Singapore, after dropping as much as 3.8 per cent the previous day. Ether, the second-largest token, gained as much as 4.58 per cent to trade back above US$2,000.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Crypto markets, which trade 24/7, were rattled in the hours after the bombing began. Iran launched counterstrikes on multiple locations – including Israel, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain – and threatened more against US linked bases in Iraq. Yet digital assets started to recover throughout the day, with Bitcoin moving sharply higher after initial reports that Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was dead.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Traders generally don’t expect the Iran conflict to have major negative economic consequences, and demand for upside Bitcoin calls has clearly picked up in recent days,” said Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, adding that traders were positioning themselves for the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Cryptocurrencies had recovered roughly US$32 billion in market value by Sunday morning, after shedding about US$128 billion the previous day, according to data from CoinGecko.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Bitcoin is the only large liquid asset trading 24/7, so it absorbed all the selling pressure that would normally spread across equities, bonds, and commodities,” said Hayden Hughes, managing partner at Tokenize Capital. “The real price discovery happens Monday when US equity markets and Bitcoin ETFs reopen. With missiles hitting Dubai, Iranian retaliation across the Gulf, and Strait of Hormuz closure risk, this is not a contained event.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For Bitcoin, the weekend losses extend a months-long sell-off in crypto markets, beginning with the liquidation of some US$19 billion in leveraged positions in October. Bitcoin has fallen around 50 per cent from its all-time peak of over US$126,000 earlier that month, unable to latch on to rallies in gold and other safe-haven assets.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“As always, when critical events take place during the weekend, Bitcoin plays the role of pressure valve,” said Justin d’Anethan, head of research at Arctic Digital, noting that the initial impact on the token wasn’t as drastic as some might have expected.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“With a lot of the leverage already cleared out and exhausted sellers, there’s only so much impact macro events can have,” he added.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Meanwhile, with traditional venues closed, digital-asset investors turned to tokenized commodities on decentralised exchange Hyperliquid to position for geopolitical fallout.

Though Abel’s letter lacked Buffett’s writing flair, CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it might prove reassuring to investors.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“He needed to show a degree of continuity, that the Berkshire franchise would continue despite the change in leadership, and it would be business as usual,” she said. “In my opinion, he hit the mark.” The letter also signalled that Abel wouldn’t upend Buffett’s 60 years of work transforming Berkshire from a failing textile company into a more than US$1 trillion conglomerate that owns car insurer Geico, BNSF railroad and dozens of other insurance, manufacturing, energy and retail businesses. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“If there were any doubts about whether Greg was the right individual to take the reins, the letter should dispel them,” said Dan Hanson, who oversees more than US$6 billion as head of the quality equity team at Neuberger Berman.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Profit declines </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Berkshire also reported declining profit, after taking writedowns for its approximately 27 per cent stakes in both Kraft Heinz and oil company Occidental Petroleum. Fourth-quarter operating profit fell 30 per cent to US$10.2 billion as income from insurance operations such as Geico declined. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Net income fell 3 per cent to US$19.2 billion, reflecting a US$4.5 billion writedown for Occidental, despite gains from equity holdings led by Apple and American Express. For all of 2025, operating profit fell 6 per cent to US$44.49 billion, while net income fell 25 per cent to US$66.97 billion. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Buffett had long urged investors to ignore fluctuations in Berkshire’s net income, which reflect accounting rules for equity investments. Full-year revenue was essentially unchanged at US$371.44 billion, and Seifert said Abel “teed up an expectation that reinsurance and commercial insurance growth may be nonexistent” in 2026.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">One of Berkshire’s best-known businesses, Fruit of the Loom, shed 6,000 jobs last year as revenue fell, Berkshire said.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Wildfire-battered PacifiCorp utility ‘not a deep pocket’</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Abel said Berkshire’s culture and values will continue “in perpetuity,” and signalled no changes in its decentralised structure in which its dozens of businesses operate largely without interference from the top. He also signalled a willingness to stick around, suggesting that in 20 years he will have had “just a fraction of the tenure that Warren had.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Abel pledged to invest in durable, well-managed businesses that Berkshire understands and “avoid businesses that undermine the fabric of society or could jeopardise Berkshire’s reputation.” He did not elaborate, but Seifert said he could have been referring to artificial intelligence. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Abel acknowledged pressures on its PacifiCorp utility from litigation over Oregon and California wildfires that burned more than 500,000 acres in 2020. Many victims blame PacifiCorp, saying it failed to shut off power lines. The utility has reached more than US$2.2 billion of settlements, but faces US$50 billion of additional wildfire claims. Abel said Berkshire accepts responsibility when it causes wildfires, but will fight unjustified claims in court. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“PacifiCorp is not an insurer of last resort and should not be treated as a deep pocket,” Abel said. “Accountability, paired with principled opposition to unwarranted liability, is essential to preserving the regulatory compact that governs utilities.”</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Ted Weschler stays on </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Abel was more critical than Buffett of Berkshire businesses that could perform better. He said the performance gap between BNSF and industry-leading rivals is “too wide,” while “self-inflicted” difficulties at the Shaw flooring company hurt quality and service. “Each business is accountable to its CEO, who is expected to pursue operational excellence relentlessly and close performance gaps,” Abel said, referring to Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Hanson, the Neuberger Berman investment manager, said: “Those are fighting words.” Berkshire has not named a chief investment officer to replace Buffett, though Abel said responsibility for equity investments “ultimately resides with me as CEO.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Abel signalled that longtime portfolio manager Ted Weschler, who manages about 6 per cent of Berkshire’s equity investments, will continue playing a “broader role” assessing significant investment opportunities and supporting Berkshire in other ways.

The rally, which officials say is partly driven by US dollar-sales linked to gold, has weighed on exports and tourism, adding to headwinds for the economy.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We’ve seen online gold trading volumes ease slightly since the measures were floated earlier this year, but it’s still too soon to tell whether that’s having any impact on the currency,” Teerarat Jutavarakul, managing director at InterGold Gold Trade, said in an interview on Thursday. “After Mar 1, we’ll need a period of bigger price swings, like we saw in January, to really determine whether these rules are making a difference.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The rollout comes as earlier efforts to weaken gold’s grip on the baht appear to be losing traction. The 60-day correlation between the currency and the precious metal climbed to the highest level since September last month, after having fallen to a two-year low earlier. That renewed linkage has helped keep the baht trading near 31 per US dollar for much of this year – a level some analysts view as a threshold at which the Bank of Thailand may step up efforts to counter excessive strength.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Policymakers have repeatedly flagged that the baht’s gains have outpaced what economic fundamentals would suggest, fuelled in part by speculative and high-value gold transactions that spur US dollar selling and push the local currency higher. Such dynamics have reignited debate over the limits of traditional monetary tools in managing exchange-rate volatility.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In its latest statement on Wednesday, the Monetary Policy Committee said the baht’s appreciation has tightened financial conditions for exporters, particularly those facing intense price competition and thin profit margins. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The panel said it will closely monitor currency movements and transactions that exert significant pressure on the baht, including assessing the effectiveness and adequacy of regulatory measures already introduced for gold.

Any prolonged shutdown of its airports ripples far beyond the region, forcing airlines worldwide to reroute or cancel services.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The scale of these hubs today is just so enormous. You will have hundreds of thousands of people being stuck in wrong parts of the world without any certainty as to when they can move,” said UK-based aviation analyst John Strickland.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“It hits at so many levels. There is the immediate issue of what happens today and the ricochet effect of how long this persists,” Strickland added, noting that major Gulf airlines, like Emirates and Qatar Airways, are also among the world’s biggest cargo operators.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Dubai Airports suspended all flights at Dubai International and at Al Maktoum International until further notice, urging passengers not to travel.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Airspace could be closed for ‘some time’ </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The US and Israel launched their most ambitious attack on Iran in decades on Saturday, killing Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and prompting Iran to retaliate with missile and drone attacks, sharply raising the risk of a broader Middle East conflict.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Passengers and airlines can expect airspace to be shut for quite some time,” said Eric Schouten, head of aviation security advisory Dyami.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Airlines cancelled on Saturday about half of their flights to Qatar and Israel and about 28 per cent of their flights to Kuwait, after the US and Israel launched strikes on Iran, according to preliminary Cirium data. In total, about 24 per cent of flights to the Middle East were cancelled, the data showed.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The region has become more important for global aviation since the Russia-Ukraine war forced airlines to avoid both countries’ airspace.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Conflict zones add to operational risks, raising fears of accidental shoot-downs and lengthening routes, which increases fuel costs.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Passengers stranded across Europe</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Students travelling from Paris to Dubai said their college trip was abandoned. “We still have some students that went there earlier and they’re stuck in Dubai and we don’t know when they’ll be able to come back,” said Benjamin Gnatek.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">At Charles de Gaulle airport, Thai-bound traveller Roman Simon said his onward flight via Doha was cancelled. “Now, we’re trying to find a solution to still make our trip to Thailand,” he told Reuters.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">At Doha’s Hamad International Airport, gates were nearly empty as stranded passengers queued to make hotel arrangements, a Reuters witness said. As countries in the region closed their airspace, aircraft were forced to divert around Larnaca, Jeddah, Cairo and Riyadh. Flightradar24 briefly went down due to surging demand.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The European Union’s aviation regulator EASA on Saturday recommended its airlines stay out of the airspace affected by the ongoing military intervention.
