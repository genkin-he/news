But it’s still too early for us to know at this time.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With the tech industry racing to build out artificial intelligence capacity, demand for memory chips has outstripped supply, causing a spike in prices and prompting manufacturers to prioritise components for higher-margin data centre chips.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">That has constrained supply for consumer electronics such as smartphones and personal computers, as well as gaming consoles. Nvidia chips are widely used in PC gaming as well as in the Nintendo Switch console, while Sony’s PlayStation and Microsoft’s Xbox consoles use AMD hardware.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Forecasts for the console market have been bleak. According to projections from tech industry research firm TrendForce in December, the console market is expected to see a 4.4 per cent decline this year, compared with its earlier forecast of a 3.5 per cent drop.
