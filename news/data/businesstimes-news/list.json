The speed of this pivot was breathtaking. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The sceptics changed their arguments with the terrified fervour of late converts. They did not change their underlying conclusions. The conclusion always came first. The evidence was always completely negotiable. Fear simply found a new vocabulary. \n\nThe extreme optimists are equally guilty of intellectual fraud. They dip aggressively into historical archives for psychological comfort. They point blindly to the invention of the mechanical loom. They cite the widespread adoption of the car. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">They even weaponise the invention of flash-frozen food. They dress blind hope in the respectable garments of historical analysis. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Neither side can paint a credible road map of the coming decades. Both sides plunder the past for convenient anecdotes. History is stripped of its complex context to serve modern dogmas. We are using dead centuries to comfort our living fears.\n\nWhat both camps share is a stubborn refusal to accept reality. We are standing in a genuinely unrecognisable era. A fourth economic sector – beyond agriculture, industry and services – is rising vertically. Its workers are machines.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Historical precedents offer zero intellectual protection. Outsourcing physical labour to machines was easy for our egos. Outsourcing cognition is a direct assault on human pride. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Forecasting the trajectory of machine intelligence with historical analogies is fundamentally absurd. It is like predicting the arc of a modern cricket match by analysing a forgotten sport played in 18th-century Rajasthan. The rules are entirely alien. The fundamental players are no longer exclusively human. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The realisation that our history books are utterly useless will take years to accept. The future has no precedent, but the opportunists already have a script.\n\nMachines themselves are helping us build the most fanatical scenarios imaginable, engineered not for accuracy but for virality, calibrated to stoke the basest emotions of hope and dread in equal measure. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Some of these visions will be proven right. Most will not. It will not matter. By the time any verdict arrives, there will be exponentially more to process, more to fear, more to celebrate, more to argue about. \n\nFor now, the arrow of history points towards a few cold truths. AI will not be useless. It will not suddenly plateau on some invisible scaling law. It will not go unused by the masses. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This reveals exactly how the technology will infiltrate every future argument. It will be used as a blank canvas for human insecurity. It will be weaponised for political ends, financial positioning and bitter personal agendas. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">We are seeing only the first skirmishes of a permanent war of interpretation. People will take aggressive stances on algorithms simply to secure their own relevance. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">History will be dragged from its grave to serve preformed conclusions. It will be shouted loudly across every platform. Volume is the only compensation for the total absence of evidence.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But the true crisis is not societal. The true crisis is fiercely intimate. Most of us wear two fundamentally incompatible masks. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Economists hide this trauma behind sterile terminology. They speak casually of producer utility. They speak academically of consumer utility. The reality is simpler and far more brutal. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In different domains of our lives, we sit on completely different sides of the AI divide. We sit on opposite sides of our own lives. And, we switch sides constantly. Sometimes within the same hour. We are haunted by our own hypocrisy.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Imagine waking up drowning in profound gratitude. An AI perfectly diagnoses a loved one. It spots the invisible anomaly. It actively saves a human life – never mind the career of the displaced radiologist. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nightfall brings a radically different reality. A child returns home with an expensive engineering degree to discover that the job market has shifted beneath them. Fury rapidly replaces the morning gratitude. We are desperate to quarantine the magic from the massacre.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Then, before bed, the portfolio notification arrives. The AI infrastructure company posted record earnings. The retirement account is up. Three emotional states. None of them is dishonest. They inhabit one body. They occur on the exact same day. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A child in a remote village finally receives a world-class education. An algorithm tailors every lesson to her specific mind. It is a beautiful triumph of accessibility. It is also a quiet tragedy. That same child will never secure the offshore service job her older sibling cherished. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Our wallets celebrate the very efficiency that breaks our hearts. The ladder that lifted hundreds of millions into the middle class is being pulled up while a different, unfamiliar ladder is being lowered. Nobody knows if the new one reaches the same floors.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Every convenience comes twinned with a threat. Every gain in one role is shadowed by a loss in another. It is the modern condition of trying to reason with a moody, two-faced Gemini hovering in the OpenAI clouds, never quite knowing if today’s X factor will be benevolence or foreclosure. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The bribe of convenience is simply too sweet to refuse. We willingly fund the exact forces we deeply fear.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">These internal divisions are not temporary. They are permanent features of the new economy.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">We will beg to separate the warmth of the fire from its devastating burn. The separation is impossible. We harbour a personal AI left and a personal AI right. Our political stance shifts dynamically with our daily convenience. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The trauma crosses generations seamlessly. Parents who cheat death via medical algorithms raise children who starve for economic relevance. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nobody designed it this way. It is simply what happens when a force this large moves this fast through a species this complicated.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><strong>The writer is chief executive officer of Singapore-based, global innovation investment company, GenInnov</strong>\n<strong>This is an edited excerpt of an article published on </strong><em><strong>https://www.geninnov.ai/blog</strong></em></p></div>",

Analysts expect revenue to rise 12 per cent to 17.07 billion rupees, according to data compiled by LSEG.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The supply of luxury hotel rooms is limited at around 30,000 keys in the world’s most populous country, and a growing affluent base should help support occupancy and room rates, according to Bhatnagar.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Occupancy rose two percentage points to 71 per cent year-over-year in the December quarter, while revenue per available room climbed 20 per cent to 21,551 rupees.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Despite making its first overseas investment last year with the purchase of a 25 per cent stake in a luxury beachfront resort on Dubai’s Palm Jumeirah, Leela’s primary focus will remain on India, Bhatnagar said.

            "title": "New online tool launched for developers to estimate land betterment charges upfront for greater cost certainty",
            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[SINGAPORE] The government on Friday (Feb 27) launched an online tool that will give developers more clarity on project costing, with a land betterment charge (LBC) estimator to calculate charges for development proposals upfront. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The move is part of wider improvements to the LBC framework outlined by Minister for Law Edwin Tong at the Real Estate Developers’ Association of Singapore’s annual Spring Festival lunch.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The government recognises that streamlined processes and reduced regulatory burden are essential to maintaining Singapore’s competitiveness as a global business hub,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The LBC is a tax that developers must pay when they seek to enhance land use or build bigger projects on a site. It is a “key source of revenue that allows the government to invest in infrastructure which enables development”, Tong said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We understand that upfront certainty on the LBC amount is critical for business decisions,” he added. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The LBC regime was introduced in August 2022 to replace the previous Development Charge and Differential Premium systems run separately by the Urban Redevelopment Authority and Singapore Land Authority (SLA), respectively. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The new LBC Estimator will be integrated into SLA’s OneMap portal. It will automatically compute the estimated LBC from key inputs and allow for scenario testing under different development options. This will give developers “greater certainty” when working out their costs, Tong said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Rates are announced twice a year following a review by SLA, in consultation with the taxman’s chief valuer. They are based on the chief valuer’s assessment of land values and take into account recent land sales. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The LBC framework has also been refined to provide solar operators with greater transparency and certainty, said Tong. Since Sep 1, 2025, solar deployments have been classified under utility use, allowing charges to be calculated using the table of rates instead of spot valuations. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Authorities have moved up the start of the valuation process for cases requiring a spot assessment. The change was in response to feedback on longer timelines for such cases, and could cut project timelines by up to six months, said Tong. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">SLA will continue to review and update its core processes to reduce processing times and administrative burden for developers, landowners and the broader real estate sector, Tong added. </p></div>",
