CDL expects to announce the outcome of the review by June this year. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Key areas include rightsizing its portfolio and reviewing capital allocation priorities across geographies and asset classes, said Kwek, noting that formal targets will be provided once the review is completed. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Among assets under scrutiny is CDL’s UK development legacy portfolio, which comprises five properties with a total carrying value of about S$800 million as at end-December 2025, after two assets were sold over the last two years. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">UK development platform </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Acknowledging that the UK assets have “underperformed”, Kwek said the group is looking to “recycle this capital as quickly as possible” and hopes to do so by the end of the year. CDL entered into the UK before Kwek assumed the CEO role, and had to engage an external manager then as it had no presence in the UK. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Currently, CDL’s five properties in the platform are a carpark at 28 Pavilion Road, Knightsbridge, acquired in 2013; Stag Brewery at Mortlake, bought in 2015; office building Development House acquired in 2016; residential project Teddington Riverside bought in 2015; and the six-unit Chesham Street in Belgravia. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As at end-December 2025, 148 of the 224 units in Teddington Riverside remain unsold, and three of the six units at Chesham Street remain unsold. CDL is exploring options including bulk sales for Teddington Riverside, said Kwek. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For its China commercial properties, Kwek said the market remains challenging and the group will take a pragmatic approach, assessing each asset individually and even accepting “some haircuts on it”, where necessary, to unlock capital. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We have to continue to drive forward with our capital recycling – it is not a one-off exercise. Capital recycling is very much a part of our business as property developer and asset manager.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In 2025, CDL secured around S$2 billion in contracted divestments globally, outpacing around S$1.7 billion of acquisitions, which included three Singapore government land sales sites for about S$1.2 billion, and the Holiday Inn London - Kensington High Street hotel for 280 million pounds (about S$480.2 million). </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The contracted divestments included the sale of Quayside Isle @ Sentosa Cove for S$97.3 million, which was completed in February 2026. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">CDL on Friday posted a net profit of S$538.5 million for the second-half ended Dec 31, 2025, rising more four times from S$113.5 million in the year-ago period. This more than trebled the group’s full-year earnings to S$629.7 million, from S$201.3 million in FY2024. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Robust growth</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Bottom line growth was primarily driven by robust Singapore home sales and strong capital recycling gains, notably from the sale of a 50.1 per cent stake in the South Beach mixed-use development to Malaysian partner IOI Properties Group for S$834 million. The deal generated a gain of S$473.1 million. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As at Feb 25, 2026, CDL has sold 95 per cent of the 777-unit The Orie condo project in Toa Payoh. It also sold 87 per cent of the 706-unit Zyon Grand project, as well as 66 per cent of its 246-unit Newport Residences development. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Including executive condos, the group sold 1,657 units for FY2025, raking in total sales value of S$4.35 billion – marking the highest sales value in CDL’s history. In FY2024, the group sold 1,489 units with total sales value of S$2.97 billion. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">CDL said it is confident in the Singapore residential market for 2026, supported by stable demand in public and private housing. With moderating interest rates, buying interest is likely to remain resilient. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The group is preparing to launch its Lakeside Drive project in Q3 2026 – featuring five 17-storey residential towers with 570 units and commercial space on the first storey. CDL clinched the site in June 2025 at S$608 million or S$1,132.08 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr). </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It also plans to launch projects on the Woodlands Drive 17 and Senja Close EC sites in the first quarter of 2027. In August 2025, the residential heavyweight bid S$360.9 million or S$782 psf ppr for the Woodlands site, and S$252.9 million or S$771 psf ppr for the other plot. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On the commercial front, Kwek said the group has considered amalgamating Delfi with neighbouring Claymore Connect and Orchard Hotel to create a sizeable mixed-use development.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While CDL has taken some steps under the Strategic Development Incentive scheme, Kwek said the project will not start in the near term to avoid putting financial strain on the group. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Looking ahead, the group enters its next phase of growth with renewed vigour. As we embark on our value creation journey, we are well positioned to deliver sustainable growth and maximise returns for all shareholders,” said Kwek. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Shares of <!-- --> <!-- -->CDL<!-- --> <!-- --> ended Friday 4.9 per cent or S$0.46 higher at S$9.82, after the release of the results. </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[SINGAPORE] Tapas joint Carlitos opened in 2024 with a nondescript, walled-off section in the back that looked as if it might lead to a storeroom. A year later, the curtain was finally pulled back to reveal Gaudi Room, a small “hidden” bar.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For founders Antonio Miscellaneo and Carlos Montobbio, having a separate area for cocktails within Carlitos was always on the cards. “We actually designed the restaurant with space to build this bar from the opening,” says Miscellaneo.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He recounts customers at his other restaurant – La Bottega Enoteca, just a few doors down – asking him for “follow-up experiences” after dinner. “I had nowhere to send them anywhere nearby, but opening a bar on its own is <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/consumer-healthcare/prive-eggslut-fb-closures-2025\" target=\"_blank\">difficult to sustain</a>, so this was the best way.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The duo, however, decided to launch Carlitos before Gaudi Room so they could take more time to perfect the speakeasy’s look and feel.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Inspired by and named after Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi, the bar’s design features his signature organic shapes, including rounded pilasters that transition seamlessly into the walls, as well as custom-carved wood fittings and two long tables.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Explaining why they focused on Gaudi Room only after operations at Carlitos were “fairly stable”, Miscellaneo says: “We knew it would take longer, especially for the level of detail we wanted.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Emulating Gaudi’s “quirky” style added an extra layer of complexity, he adds: “It’s not just a room, tiles, a couple of pieces of furniture; we needed time.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Everything in the 23-seater space was chosen or even made by the founders, down to the ceramic tile mosaic tabletops and the matching upholstery on a bench that anchors a corner. In all, putting the bar together took around four months.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">A new experience</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With Gaudi Room being both Miscellaneo’s and Montobbio’s first cocktail bar, they faced a steep learning curve, particularly when it came to developing the menu. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Montobbio, who is also the chef-owner of Esquina in Chinatown, notes that mixology requires a high level of precision; after all, each drink is only so many ounces of liquid, which leaves little room for error.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“When we taste a cocktail, we may feel it needs a little sweetness; then we add two drops of sugar syrup, and the cocktail is completely changed,” he explains. “It’s not as forgiving as food.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">After working with a consultant on an initial draft for the menu, Miscellaneo and Montobbio set to work on fine-tuning things, infusing each drink with “Spanish and Latin touches”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Among the cocktails in the final line-up is the Margarita de La Vera – Montobbio’s favourite – which includes an infusion of smoked paprika sourced from the county in western Spain from which the drink gets its name.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Another of Montobbio’s top picks is the La Sagrada Paloma: a spicy, Asian-inspired iteration of the classic paloma that includes togarashi and a kimchi base, named for the still-unfinished Barcelona church that is perhaps the architect’s most famous creation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For Miscellaneo, meanwhile, bourbon-based The Smoking Architect was a fast favourite.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I drink cocktails very fast… I usually gulp them down, and in one second – gone,” he says with a laugh. “But with The Smoking Architect, I can pace it a little more; the drink develops and gets rounder as the ice melts.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Also on Gaudi Room’s menu is the Veneno de la Pasion, a Spanish riff on a porn star martini served with a sidecar of cava instead of the usual champagne. Then there’s the Gaudoni Negroni, which adds cassis and cacao to the traditional negroni for a bold, almost dessert-like concoction.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Miscellaneo and Montobbio intend to continually refresh the menu with their team, further refining existing drinks and introducing new ones to keep things interesting.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In line with the speakeasy theme, the duo has opted to let news of the bar spread mostly through word of mouth.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“If you come, a friend brings you over, you have a good time and the drinks are good… you will come back with another bunch of friends,” Montobbio concludes. “There’s no better marketing than that.”</p></div>",

It will be paid out on May 15, subject to shareholders approval.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The total dividend for the year, inclusive of the interim dividend of S$0.032, is S$0.07, compared with S$0.064 for FY2024.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For FY2025, revenue was 9.9 per cent higher at S$1.6 billion from S$1.4 billion previously, primarily driven by the opening of 12 new stores in FY2025 and six in FY2024 in Singapore, as well as the improved performance of existing stores.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The earnings for the full year increased by 8.7 per cent to S$149.5 million from S$137.5 million in FY2024.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As at end of 2025, Sheng Siong had a total of 87 stores in Singapore, and aims to open three to five new stores every year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Meanwhile, the tender results for another four stores from the Housing &amp; Development Board are pending, while another three tenders are open for bidding. The company noted it will close two stores at Elias Mall and Thomson Imperial Court by mid-2026 as their leases end; these outlets accounted for 2.8 per cent of revenue last year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Having opened 12 new stores and entering an agreement with JTC to establish a new distribution centre in FY2025, we remain confident in future expansion opportunities to deepen our presence across Singapore,” said Lim Hock Chee, CEO of Sheng Siong.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Sheng Siong noted that consumers in Singapore are expected to remain cautious in their spending amid concerns about the high cost of living, which bodes well for its house brands and promotional items. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It added that government support measures in Budget 2026, including various vouchers, are expected to sustain consumer spending momentum.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Progressive Wage Model requirements will increase labour costs over time and the implementation of the Beverage Container Return Scheme, along with sustainability-related initiatives and regulations will add complexity and costs. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The opening of the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System may influence consumer expending patterns.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Sheng Siong said that it would monitor developments and assess implications of the new cross-border transit system when it opens.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It added that it will “exercise prudence” in opening new stores in China, given the competitive landscape, and will focus on improving the performance of existing stores.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Shares of Sheng Siong closed up 0.4 per cent or S$0.01 to S$2.63 on Friday.</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[SINGAPORE] Shares of <!-- --> <!-- -->Yangzijiang Shipbuilding<!-- --> <!-- --> rallied on Friday (Feb 27) after the Chinese vesselmaker posted higher earnings for its second half. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The counter hit an record high in intraday trade and climbed as high as S$4.37 as at 11.20 am, up by 11.5 per cent or S$0.45 from Thursday’s closing price of S$3.92, with some 45.1 million shares changing hands. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This marks the highest price the stock has reached since it listed on the mainboard of the Singapore Exchange (SGX) in Apr 2007, data from ShareInvestor, Yahoo Finance and Google Finance shows. \n\nIt finished Friday 10.7 per cent or S$0.42 higher at S$4.34, as the top traded stock on the SGX by volume, with close to 70.5 million shares transacted.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On Wednesday, Yangzijiang Shipbuilding posted a 24.6 per cent rise in net profit to 4.5 billion yuan (S$827.4 million) for its second half ended Dec 31, from 3.6 billion yuan in the corresponding year-ago period. This brought its FY2025 earnings to 8.6 billion yuan, 30.2 per cent higher than the previous year’s 6.6 billion yuan. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Its revenue rose 15.8 per cent on the year to 15.6 billion yuan for the half-year, and climbed 7.4 per cent to 28.5 billion yuan for the full-year. The topline growth was fuelled by the progressive construction of vessels secured at higher newbuild prices. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">CGSI in a Friday report maintained its “add” call for Yangzijiang Shipbuilding, citing the group’s earnings growth – backed by a US$22.4 billion orderbook – and an attractive nine times forward price-to-earnings ratio.<strong> </strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The brokerage raised its target price for the counter from S$4.51 to S$4.95, a premium of 14.1 per cent above the stock’s Friday closing price.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">CGSI analyst Lim Siew Khee noted that the shipbuilder’s final dividend of S$0.20 per share for FY2025, an increase from S$0.12 per share in FY2024, implies a 50 per cent payout ratio which is a “positive surprise”. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Similarly, DBS said on Thursday that it would likely maintain its “buy” call on the counter, with its S$3.80 target price under review. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">DBS analyst Ho Pei Hwa noted that the stock’s FY2025 net profit beat consensus by 3 to 4 per cent, and that the roughly US$290 million worth of new orders secured by the group in December brings its full-year order wins to around US$2.5 billion. </p></div>",
