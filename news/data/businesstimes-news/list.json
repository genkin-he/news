This weighed down its second-half net profit.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But group president and chief executive officer Vincent Chong noted on Friday (Feb 27) at ST Engineering’s full-year results briefing that activity is picking up in 2026, with more orders secured and cost cuts under way as the company focuses on turning the business around.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Our priority remains supporting customers, executing the turnaround, and evaluating the strategic path forward for the satcom business,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Even as it evaluates “strategic actions” for the business, ST Engineering has implemented S$43 million in annualised cost savings for the satcom unit. It has more plans to bring these savings up to S$63 million.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For satcom, the group is targeting H1 revenue that is stronger year on year (yoy), following its dive in net profit for H2 FY2025.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The urban solutions and satcom segment sank into the red with a S$567.7 million loss in H2, reversing from earnings of S$31.1 million in the year-ago period.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, the segment’s H2 revenue rose 6 per cent yoy to S$1.1 billion, from S$1 billion the previous year. Urban solutions drove the improvement, which was partially offset by lower satcom contributions.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">ST Engineering reported a net profit of S$59.9 million for H2 FY2025, an 83.6 per cent decline from S$365.7 million in the previous corresponding period. Its operating profit for H2, however, stood at S$448 million, an increase of 22.5 per cent from S$365.7 million the year before.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The group’s revenue came in at S$6.4 billion for the half-year, up from S$5.8 billion in H2 FY2024.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Earnings per share for FY2025 stood at S$0.1484. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Growth driven by defence and aerospace</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As the group irons out its urban solutions and satcom business, its other two segments – commercial aerospace, and defence and public security – posted higher profits in FY2025.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">ST Engineering’s commercial aerospace profits for H2 rose to S$319 million, from S$210.5 million in the year-ago period. The segment’s revenue increased 23 per cent to S$2.6 billion, from S$2.2 billion the previous year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“This growth was contributed by stronger sales from engines, MRO (maintenance, repair and operations) and nacelles,” said Cedric Foo, group chief financial officer of ST Engineering.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The defence and public security segment reported S$551.4 million in H2 earnings, up from S$311.9 the previous year. Its revenue stood at S$2.7 billion, rising 5 per cent on the year from S$2.6 billion.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the full year, commercial aerospace accounted for 40 per cent of the group’s revenue, and defence and public security made up 43 per cent. The urban solutions and satcom segment contributed 16 per cent of the revenue.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Overall, ST Engineering’s revenue stood at S$12.3 billion for FY2025, up 9.5 per cent from S$11.3 billion in FY2024.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Full-year net profit fell 34.1 per cent yoy to S$462.8 million, from S$702.3 million. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nonetheless, the group’s fiscal outlook remains positive. It cited contract wins, a strong order book and a structural shift in global defence spending.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As at Dec 31, 2025, its order book stood at S$33.2 billion, of which S$9.9 billion is expected to be delivered this year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Our record order book is a clear leading indicator of revenue growth in the years ahead,” said Chong.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Mervyn Tan, group chief operating officer for technology and innovation, as well as president of defence and public security, said: “We continue to stick to our assessment that the increase that we see in the investment in defence for various countries (appears) to be a structural shift.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The group proposed a final dividend of S$0.06 per ordinary share and a special dividend of S$0.05 a share.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In total, the dividend for FY2025 is S$0.23 per ordinary share, translating to a dividend yield of 3.52 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Shares of <!-- --> <!-- -->ST Engineering<!-- --> <!-- --> ended Friday 0.5 per cent or S$0.05 lower at S$9.97, after the results were released.</p></div>",

There, it will “play a pivotal role in advancing the wind farm’s mission to deliver clean and reliable energy to 500,000 homes”, said the offshore and marine specialist on Friday (Feb 27). </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The vessel was central to an arbitration dispute between Seatrium and Maersk in late 2025, which occurred after Maersk attempted to terminate the contract inked with a Seatrium unit for the vessel’s construction.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Empire Wind was also implicated in attempts by US President Donald Trump to torpedo offshore wind farms last year, <em>The New York Times </em>reported. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A US federal agency in December 2025 issued stop-work orders to five major wind projects, including Empire Wind, citing national security concerns.

The project was around 98.9 per cent complete at the time.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Seatrium unit rejected the termination on Oct 12, 2025, and informed Phoenix II that the vessel would be delivered by Jan 30, 2026. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On Oct 21, 2025, Seatrium Energy International received a notice of arbitration from Phoenix II; in turn, it commenced arbitration against the Maersk affiliate on Nov 28, 2025. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On Dec 22, 2025, Seatrium announced that the dispute had been resolved as its unit and Phoenix II had agreed that the vessel would be delivered by Feb 28, 2026. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Maersk affiliate agreed to pay the balance of the contract price, a sum of US$360 million, upon the vessel’s delivery. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">William Gu, executive vice-president of Seatrium Energy (Marketing), noted that the vessel represents a “major step forward” for the global offshore wind sector.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We are proud to deliver this unique vessel to our partner, Maersk Offshore Wind, to advance the progress of the end customer’s wind farm development,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The vessel’s delivery on Thursday followed the completion of sea trial activities and final readiness evaluations.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Vessel features </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The vessel was built and custom-engineered by Seatrium for the purpose of installing some of the world’s largest offshore wind turbines. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It has a “feeder-based installation design (that) enhances operational efficiency”, as it is equipped with a “stabilising system” that can hold feeder vessels for the transfer of offshore wind components in high-sea states.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Seatrium said this feature “improves installation efficiency by extending the operational weather window”. This ensures the vessel “can carry out uninterrupted installations, improving operational efficiency and reducing total cost and time of installation”. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The group noted that the feeder-based installation solution design feature is compliant with the US Jones Act and “can also be deployed in other geographies”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Seatrium shares closed Friday 5.3 per cent or S$0.12 higher at S$2.40, after the news. </p></div>",
