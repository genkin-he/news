The selloff was driven by uncertainty over costs and disruption related to artificial intelligence, revived tariff uncertainties and simmering geopolitical tensions.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq logged their steepest monthly declines since March 2025, while the Dow eked out its tenth straight month of gains, its longest winning streak since the ten-month run that ended in January 2018.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“To wrap up the month of February, we were reminded there are still some cracks out there,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha, Nebraska. “Adding to the day’s weakness was the hotter inflation data, potentially pushing back on the idea of a dovish Fed later this year.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“It’s been a rough go in February, but corporate America is looking at over a 14 per cent gain in earnings in the fourth quarter,” Detrick added. “The reality is that earnings drive long-term stock gains and this was a very impressive earnings season.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Financial stocks slid following reports that Barclays, Jefferies, Wells Fargo and other banks face potential losses related to the collapse of UK mortgage provider Market Financial Solutions Ltd, amid broader concerns about lending standards. Wells Fargo, Jefferies and US-listed shares of Barclays dropped between 4.0 per cent and 9.3 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Tech shares also continued to weigh on the indexes as lingering fears related to AI dragged chips and software down 1.2 per cent and 1.5 per cent, respectively.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Defensive sectors such as consumer staples, healthcare and utilities were the session’s clear outperformers.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“This is a classic risk-off environment where the pure defensive areas are finding some strength while the market is turning its head on some of the more cyclical growth areas that are clearly lagging,” Detrick said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On the economics front, a hotter-than-expected Producer Price Index reading fortified expectations that the US Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut its key interest rate in the near term.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Financial markets are currently pricing in a 94.1 per cent probability that the central bank will leave the Fed funds target rate in the 3.50 per cent to 3.75 per cent range at its upcoming monetary policy meeting in March, according to CME ’s FedWatch tool.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 521.28 points, or 1.05 per cent, to 48,977.92, the S&amp;P 500 lost 29.98 points, or 0.43 per cent, to 6,878.88 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 210.17 points, or 0.92 per cent, to 22,668.21. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Of the 11 major sectors in the S&amp;P 500, healthcare and energy - with a boost from rising crude prices - led the gainers, while only financial and technology stocks suffered percentage losses. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nvidia slid 4.2 per cent, extending the previous session’s 5.5 per ent drop despite solid earnings, a sign of persistent unease over emergent AI technology. Zscaler plunged 12.2 per ent after the cloud security firm reported a wider net loss in the second quarter. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Netflix jumped 13.8 per cent as investors cheered its decision to exit the fight for Warner Bros Discovery, which dropped 2.2 per cent. Paramount Skydance, WBD’s likely buyer, soared by 20.8 per cent. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Block surged 16.8 per cent after the payments firm said it would axe nearly half its workforce, as part of its effort to embed AI across operations. Dell shot up 21.9 per cent after the PC maker said it expects revenue from its key AI-optimised servers business to double in fiscal year 2027 and promised to return more cash to shareholders.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.31-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. There were 564 new highs and 121 new lows on the NYSE.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On the Nasdaq, 1,594 stocks rose and 3,158 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.98-to-1 ratio.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The S&amp;P 500 posted 49 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 78 new highs and 127 new lows.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Volume on US exchanges was 20.85 billion shares, compared with the 20.19 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Should we sell now and ask questions later? Or should we discount, look through, or simply ignore? Should Asian markets – from Tokyo to Mumbai – treat geopolitical risks as transient noise to be filtered out, or as a material threat requiring active and urgent defensive repositioning? </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Inevitably (and unfortunately) there is no easy answer. Our region exhibits specific economic vulnerabilities and thus a unique set of transmission channels through which geopolitical risk flows across asset prices. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">These complexities require a more nuanced response than either pure complacency or panic selling. So in this Year of Geopolitics, I share the Lombard Odier framework which analyses and assesses geopolitical risk, and how to position (our Asia-tilted) portfolios accordingly. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Loud headlines, quiet markets</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">First, to look beyond emotion. Geopolitical events, while heavily covered in media, generate limited and short-lived stress in financial markets. Volatility tends to be episodic, with asset prices recovering within hours (as in the case of “Liberation Day” in 2025), days or weeks – unless fundamental economic channels are disrupted. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">At Lombard Odier, we believe markets are primarily macro-driven, responding to negative forces such as financial crises, recessions and pandemics rather than geopolitical shocks. This shifts investor focus from predicting the unpredictable – such as wars, elections and diplomatic breakdowns – towards assessing when such events threaten corporate profitability and economic stability.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Second, identify whether key economic transmission channels are disrupted. Markets respond meaningfully when critical technologies such as semiconductors are restricted, and/or when energy and commodity markets face sustained supply constraints; for example, if conflicts in the Strait of Hormuz or Suez Canal closed oil markets or interrupted supply chains. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Finally, assess whether a geopolitical event impairs companies’ ability to generate profits. Outside of recessions, corporate earnings tend to keep growing, and markets look through transient volatility if demand stays intact and cost structures remain undamaged. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Investors should ask a simple, disciplined question: Does this event alter revenue growth or margins in a sustained way? If the answer is no, then geopolitical risk belongs to short-term noise rather than longer-term strategic asset allocation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Following these three principles offers resilience when applied to portfolio construction.

China’s onshore crude inventories – including its strategic petroleum reserve – cover over 90 days of imports, a buffer that does not entirely eliminate vulnerability to (sustained) supply disruption. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The per-barrel price of Brent crude is higher by 18 per cent year to date, suggesting potentially compressed margins for energy-hungry Asian airlines, chemical producers and power utilities. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Yet historical examples suggest that unless physical supply is interrupted, price spikes prove temporary. The 2019 attacks on Saudi Aramco facilities and the 2021 Suez Canal blockage produced initial volatility followed by rapid normalisation as alternative sourcing, inventory draws and demand elasticity restored market balance. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Asian investors must distinguish between the substantial risk premium currently embedded in energy markets and the probability of actual supply curtailment that would transform premium into sustained economic damage. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Seek, discover, decide</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The challenge for Asian investors in this Year of Geopolitics is constructing portfolios that endure geopolitical volatility without – as ever – sacrificing performance. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The solution lies neither in blanket defensive positioning nor in naive “all-in” risk appetite, but in differentiation – identifying specific vulnerabilities and opportunities that regional complexities create. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For example, (enduring) US-China geopolitical tensions are giving rise to a new wave of sectoral opportunities.

The group attributed this primarily to fair-value losses from properties in China, South Korea and Australia.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The resources segment had a better showing in H2 FY2025, which the group said was mainly due to higher average tin prices and the ringgit’s appreciation against the Singapore dollar.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The hospitality segment’s performance weakened, however, “primarily due to ongoing refurbishment works in its Australia-owned hotel (and) the absence of contribution from a hotel disposed of in December 2024”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Straits Trading’s real estate business reported a greater loss in H2 FY2025. This came on the back of a S$102.3 million loss that stemmed from the group losing joint control over a joint venture. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The group explained that “the appointment of receivers and managers over (a) mortgaged property in December 2025” had led to the investment being derecognised as a joint venture.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Loss per share for H2 FY2025 stood at S$0.444, compared with S$0.028 for the corresponding period a year earlier.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Straits Trading’s board has proposed an interim dividend of S$0.08 a share payable on Jun 30, with the quantum unchanged from FY2024 and the option of payment in scrip available.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For FY2025, the group’s loss widened to S$249.1 million from S$7.2 million a year earlier. Revenue, meanwhile, was 10.4 per cent higher year on year at S$623.3 million.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The weaker full-year performance was again attributed to the loss of joint control over the joint venture and net fair-value losses on investment properties.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Straits Trading noted that the losses are “non-cash in nature and do not impact the group’s operating cash flow”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Chew Gek Khim, executive chairman of Straits Trading, said FY2025 “represents a watershed year” for the group, “marked by a disciplined reassessment of our portfolio and a continued focus on prudent capital recycling amid a challenging operating environment”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Straits Trading said it will “continue to adopt a prudent and disciplined approach to capital management”. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The group will remain focused on maintaining financial resilience, preserving liquidity and prioritising investments that generate long-term sustainable value for its stakeholders,” it added.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Shares of Straits Trading rose 1.2 per cent or S$0.02 to close at S$1.75 on Friday, before the news.</p></div>",
