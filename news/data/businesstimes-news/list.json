That’s deception.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Calls to curb excessive borrowing and plug loopholes have been growing louder.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Sengkang GRC MP He Ting Ru similarly raised the issue in Parliament, asking if the Government is working with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to curb in-house financing that circumvents loan-to-value limits in the auto industry.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In a Feb 4 written response, Siow said: “Buyers are strongly advised to obtain loans through regulated arrangements.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The Government is monitoring the situation and will tighten regulations to manage the abuse of such regulations if necessary.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The worries come as figures obtained by <em>The Straits Times</em> showed that households in Singapore had outstanding motor vehicle loans of around S$12.4 billion by the end of 2025 – a 12-year high.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Under MAS rules, financial institutions like banks must cap the loan amount given out at between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of the purchase price, depending on the vehicle’s open market value.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">To check if full loans are being offered by car dealers with little restriction, ST posed as a would-be buyer of vehicles to investigate the prevalence of such options.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Of the five new and used car dealers ST reached out to, only one advised caution and encouraged prudence.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The rest said they could offer 100 per cent loans, either through in-house financing or by inflating the selling price. None of the authorised dealers, which tap financial institutions for loans, contacted by ST offered such borrowing schemes.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Proof of income</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">ST visited three companies on Feb 10 to inquire about the purchase of a new small car.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Two dealers immediately confirmed what their ads said – that they would submit a loan application to their in-house financers or partners for a loan covering the full cost of the car, which amounted to around S$178,000 with certificate of entitlement.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">One dealer said that for a car of that value, the buyer would be looking at a 10-year loan of around S$2,000 in monthly instalments. Based on ST’s calculations, the total amount paid over the 10 years would be S$240,000.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Buyers would need to show proof of a monthly income of at least S$6,000.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The second dealer said a 100 per cent loan would be taken from the firm’s in-house financing unit.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The third dealer said that while it was possible to apply for a full loan for the car purchase, it would be more advisable to pay a 10 per cent down payment at least.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The dealer said this would be more financially prudent for someone earning a monthly income of around S$6,000.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, the dealer added that although it advised against it, it can use a long-held industry practice and inflate the price of the vehicle on paper when submitting the loan application to financial institutions or other loan providers.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“In the eyes of the finance companies, you are actually buying the car at a higher price, not the real price. So that they will loan you the original price amount,” said the dealer.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The buyer will still have to cover the goods and services tax incurred on the difference between the actual and inflated prices.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“(This is done) because we are generating an invoice, we are very law abiding... so we are very careful about compliance but we also try to fulfil our client’s needs,” the dealer added.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Another dealer said it offered the same inflated price scheme, but would absorb the additional GST due to an ongoing promotion.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A third scheme ST learnt about involved buyers claiming they are buying the vehicle to operate a private-hire car (PHC), in order to secure a 100 per cent loan.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">PHCs, which are meant for commercial use, are exempted from MAS’ car financing rules.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Aware of practices</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Experts said the authorities take a serious view of any attempt to circumvent motor-vehicle financing restrictions.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As for PHCs, ST understands that the Government is monitoring possible exploitation of the PHC exemption, where owners register private cars as private-hire cars with no intention of offering the service.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In a reply to ST, MAS sounded a note of caution over 100 per cent LTV loans, saying unregulated financing schemes carry higher risks, such as hidden charges and bigger losses for the borrowers if they default.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Its spokesperson added that the authority is also aware of the inflated-price practice used by some in the car industry.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“To counter mark-up practices, we expect FIs to conduct checks to assess if the purchase price is reasonable, such as by obtaining independent valuations.” The spokesperson noted that the vast majority of borrowing for motor vehicle loans are taken with financial institutions regulated by the central bank.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Other than MAS-regulated FIs, entities which are licensed or exempt moneylenders, or which offer financing in the form of hire-purchase arrangements, are also required to comply with the same motor-vehicle financing restrictions under the respective legislation or regulations,” the spokesperson said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Prof Charoenwong said MAS could require FIs to independently verify car purchase prices by cross-referencing with LTA registration data, market valuation databases, or a standardised price guide, rather than relying solely on dealer-submitted invoices.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Prof Charoenwong said some dealers know that the bank’s loan officer has limited ability or incentive to challenge the stated price, especially when the deal superficially complies with LTV requirements.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">So if the invoice says S$170,000, that is what gets processed, he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The brazenness – openly advertising 100 per cent financing and guaranteed approvals on social media – tells you exactly how dealers perceive the regulatory environment: they don’t fear consequences.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“That perception changes only when enforcement action actually materialises,” said Prof Charoenwong.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Authorised distributors contacted by ST said that they do not offer 100 per cent loans.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Singapore Vehicle Traders Association declined to comment when asked about the practice of dealers inflating their selling prices to get a higher loan amount for their customers.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Its spokesman said that being able to borrow more will make it easier to get a buyer.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Hire Purchase, Finance and Leasing Association of Singapore, an industry body which keeps a register of vehicles that are financed by its members, said that it does not monitor the business practices of its members. <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\"

That edged out wind generation, which rose 13 per cent to 1.13 million gigawatt-hours.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The rapid growth of renewables helped China meet its growing electricity consumption last year without the need to burn more coal at power plants, with thermal generation falling 0.7 per cent. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Even so, coal remains the dominant source of China’s power and the fuel’s share of total energy consumption fell only marginally in 2025 to 51.4 per cent. Total coal consumption was 0.1 per cent higher, likely reflecting the fuel’s use in the growing coal-to-chemicals sector.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China produced more electricity using solar last year than Japan’s entire grid, and panels now account for 11 per cent of the nation’s total generation, compared to less than 1 per cent a decade ago. That is the result of the huge supply chain Chinese companies have developed and the versatility of the technology, which is quick to deploy and has been adopted in a wide range of locations – from vast desert installations to small village rooftops.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Still, solar’s rise has not been without complications. Most equipment manufacturers are struggling with losses because of overcapacity and low prices, while the influx of so much electricity in daylight hours means major investment is now needed in power lines and energy storage facilities to ensure the electricity does not go to waste.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Wind technology tends to produce power for more hours of the day than solar, meaning it is only now being overtaken in terms of generation – even though panels have offered greater capacity in China for several years.

It was trading at around US$67,700 at 11 am in Singapore, after dropping as much as 3.8 per cent the previous day. Ether, the second-largest token, gained as much as 4.58 per cent to trade back above US$2,000.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Crypto markets, which trade 24/7, were rattled in the hours after the bombing began. Iran launched counterstrikes on multiple locations – including Israel, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain – and threatened more against US linked bases in Iraq. Yet digital assets started to recover throughout the day, with Bitcoin moving sharply higher after initial reports that Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was dead.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Traders generally don’t expect the Iran conflict to have major negative economic consequences, and demand for upside Bitcoin calls has clearly picked up in recent days,” said Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, adding that traders were positioning themselves for the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Cryptocurrencies had recovered roughly US$32 billion in market value by Sunday morning, after shedding about US$128 billion the previous day, according to data from CoinGecko.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Bitcoin is the only large liquid asset trading 24/7, so it absorbed all the selling pressure that would normally spread across equities, bonds, and commodities,” said Hayden Hughes, managing partner at Tokenize Capital. “The real price discovery happens Monday when US equity markets and Bitcoin ETFs reopen. With missiles hitting Dubai, Iranian retaliation across the Gulf, and Strait of Hormuz closure risk, this is not a contained event.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For Bitcoin, the weekend losses extend a months-long sell-off in crypto markets, beginning with the liquidation of some US$19 billion in leveraged positions in October. Bitcoin has fallen around 50 per cent from its all-time peak of over US$126,000 earlier that month, unable to latch on to rallies in gold and other safe-haven assets.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“As always, when critical events take place during the weekend, Bitcoin plays the role of pressure valve,” said Justin d’Anethan, head of research at Arctic Digital, noting that the initial impact on the token wasn’t as drastic as some might have expected.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“With a lot of the leverage already cleared out and exhausted sellers, there’s only so much impact macro events can have,” he added.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Meanwhile, with traditional venues closed, digital-asset investors turned to tokenized commodities on decentralised exchange Hyperliquid to position for geopolitical fallout.

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[NEW YORK] Berkshire Hathaway’s new chief executive Greg Abel moved to put his stamp on the conglomerate with his first annual letter to shareholders on Saturday (Feb 28), pledging to maintain its “fortress-like” balance sheet and uphold the values of his predecessor and mentor, Warren Buffett.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Abel, 63, said he would not rush to deploy Berkshire’s near-record US$373.3 billion cash stake, though he said it gave the company plenty of “dry powder” and that he had no plans to begin paying dividends, which Buffett also opposed. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Berkshire has not repurchased its own stock since the spring of 2024. “I recognize how you want us to succeed together, and to do so in the right way,” Abel wrote in an 18-page, single-spaced letter. “My role is to ensure our liquidity levels and capital deployment remain intentional and deliberate.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Abel also paid homage to Buffett, 95, who remains chairman and goes to Berkshire’s offices five days a week, calling him a “remarkable” CEO.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Warren Buffett is arguably the greatest investor of all time, with generations benefiting from his investment acumen,” Abel wrote. “To invest in Berkshire has long been a vote of trust in our founder – a trust that now rests with Berkshire.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Berkshire shares have significantly underperformed the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index since Buffett announced unexpectedly in May he was stepping aside as CEO. Though Abel’s letter lacked Buffett’s writing flair, CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it might prove reassuring to investors.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“He needed to show a degree of continuity, that the Berkshire franchise would continue despite the change in leadership, and it would be business as usual,” she said. “In my opinion, he hit the mark.” The letter also signalled that Abel wouldn’t upend Buffett’s 60 years of work transforming Berkshire from a failing textile company into a more than US$1 trillion conglomerate that owns car insurer Geico, BNSF railroad and dozens of other insurance, manufacturing, energy and retail businesses. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“If there were any doubts about whether Greg was the right individual to take the reins, the letter should dispel them,” said Dan Hanson, who oversees more than US$6 billion as head of the quality equity team at Neuberger Berman.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Profit declines </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Berkshire also reported declining profit, after taking writedowns for its approximately 27 per cent stakes in both Kraft Heinz and oil company Occidental Petroleum. Fourth-quarter operating profit fell 30 per cent to US$10.2 billion as income from insurance operations such as Geico declined. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Net income fell 3 per cent to US$19.2 billion, reflecting a US$4.5 billion writedown for Occidental, despite gains from equity holdings led by Apple and American Express. For all of 2025, operating profit fell 6 per cent to US$44.49 billion, while net income fell 25 per cent to US$66.97 billion. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Buffett had long urged investors to ignore fluctuations in Berkshire’s net income, which reflect accounting rules for equity investments. Full-year revenue was essentially unchanged at US$371.44 billion, and Seifert said Abel “teed up an expectation that reinsurance and commercial insurance growth may be nonexistent” in 2026.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">One of Berkshire’s best-known businesses, Fruit of the Loom, shed 6,000 jobs last year as revenue fell, Berkshire said.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Wildfire-battered PacifiCorp utility ‘not a deep pocket’</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Abel said Berkshire’s culture and values will continue “in perpetuity,” and signalled no changes in its decentralised structure in which its dozens of businesses operate largely without interference from the top. He also signalled a willingness to stick around, suggesting that in 20 years he will have had “just a fraction of the tenure that Warren had.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Abel pledged to invest in durable, well-managed businesses that Berkshire understands and “avoid businesses that undermine the fabric of society or could jeopardise Berkshire’s reputation.” He did not elaborate, but Seifert said he could have been referring to artificial intelligence. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Abel acknowledged pressures on its PacifiCorp utility from litigation over Oregon and California wildfires that burned more than 500,000 acres in 2020. Many victims blame PacifiCorp, saying it failed to shut off power lines. The utility has reached more than US$2.2 billion of settlements, but faces US$50 billion of additional wildfire claims. Abel said Berkshire accepts responsibility when it causes wildfires, but will fight unjustified claims in court. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“PacifiCorp is not an insurer of last resort and should not be treated as a deep pocket,” Abel said. “Accountability, paired with principled opposition to unwarranted liability, is essential to preserving the regulatory compact that governs utilities.”</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Ted Weschler stays on </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Abel was more critical than Buffett of Berkshire businesses that could perform better. He said the performance gap between BNSF and industry-leading rivals is “too wide,” while “self-inflicted” difficulties at the Shaw flooring company hurt quality and service. “Each business is accountable to its CEO, who is expected to pursue operational excellence relentlessly and close performance gaps,” Abel said, referring to Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Hanson, the Neuberger Berman investment manager, said: “Those are fighting words.” Berkshire has not named a chief investment officer to replace Buffett, though Abel said responsibility for equity investments “ultimately resides with me as CEO.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Abel signalled that longtime portfolio manager Ted Weschler, who manages about 6 per cent of Berkshire’s equity investments, will continue playing a “broader role” assessing significant investment opportunities and supporting Berkshire in other ways.

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[BANGKOK] Thailand will implement tough new rules governing retail gold-trading from Sunday (Mar 1), hoping to curb speculative activity that’s fuelled gains in the baht and weakened the nation’s competitiveness.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Individuals’ online, baht-denominated gold transactions will be subject to a daily limit of 50 million baht (S$2 million) per person, per platform, according to the Bank of Thailand’s website. The rules exempt US dollar-denominated trades, physical gold shop dealing and futures markets.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In addition, the central bank is requiring full, upfront electronic payments for any transactions. It is also banning nominee accounts and short selling, arguing the changes will boost transparency and market standards.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The move underscores growing concern within the central bank that large, baht-denominated gold trades have amplified the currency’s strength. The baht has gained about 9 per cent over the past year, making it the second-best performer among Asian currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The rally, which officials say is partly driven by US dollar-sales linked to gold, has weighed on exports and tourism, adding to headwinds for the economy.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We’ve seen online gold trading volumes ease slightly since the measures were floated earlier this year, but it’s still too soon to tell whether that’s having any impact on the currency,” Teerarat Jutavarakul, managing director at InterGold Gold Trade, said in an interview on Thursday. “After Mar 1, we’ll need a period of bigger price swings, like we saw in January, to really determine whether these rules are making a difference.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The rollout comes as earlier efforts to weaken gold’s grip on the baht appear to be losing traction. The 60-day correlation between the currency and the precious metal climbed to the highest level since September last month, after having fallen to a two-year low earlier. That renewed linkage has helped keep the baht trading near 31 per US dollar for much of this year – a level some analysts view as a threshold at which the Bank of Thailand may step up efforts to counter excessive strength.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Policymakers have repeatedly flagged that the baht’s gains have outpaced what economic fundamentals would suggest, fuelled in part by speculative and high-value gold transactions that spur US dollar selling and push the local currency higher. Such dynamics have reignited debate over the limits of traditional monetary tools in managing exchange-rate volatility.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In its latest statement on Wednesday, the Monetary Policy Committee said the baht’s appreciation has tightened financial conditions for exporters, particularly those facing intense price competition and thin profit margins. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The panel said it will closely monitor currency movements and transactions that exert significant pressure on the baht, including assessing the effectiveness and adequacy of regulatory measures already introduced for gold.
