It’s best to pay for only what you want. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">That includes a crunchy water parsley pancake (S$34) – pretend you’re fulfilling your daily veggie quota even if it’s covered in a blanket of chewy-crisp fried batter. Dried shrimp takes this guilty pleasure up a notch.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Butter-grilled Jeju abalone (S$88) yields plump butter-grilled morsels with little tooth resistance, but not much character. The grated cheese on top is a pesky distraction. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The cold noodles (S$33) go down well – slippery, chewy, slicked with the vegetal perfume of perilla oil and tossed in a parade of condiments.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Service here is virtually Gold standard. Every table has an assigned grill expert, and ours is Darren, tasked to cook, entertain and take care of us. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In between carefully draping slices of marinated hanwoo short rib and striploin over controlled flames, he narrates the matching benefits of Maldon salt, wasabi, spicy fish roe, pickled garlic leaves and other assorted banchan. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Salt is the most neutral, but feel free to wrap, dip and munch in any way you like. Raw garlic slightly charred on the grill is a must, even if you don’t plan to meet any vampires later.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The marinated short rib is mildly sweet and not cloying, so you still taste the fine texture of the meat. The striploin is a better cut – with a cleaner beefiness and steak-like texture. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Quality-wise, hanwoo isn’t as fatty as Japanese wagyu and more tender than Australian wagyu. But the variety available in Singapore tastes entry-level, compared to what you can get in Seoul. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Still, if you can stomach the price, it’s a good fallback between trips. Jeju pork, in contrast, is better value. It’s superior to local pork and fresher than iberico, if still better at source.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">DRIM is only as good as its ingredients are. Add accessibility and good service, and you get an all-round, fuss-free – if slightly over-the-top – experience. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It aims for gold, but it’s not quite there yet.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><strong>Rating: 6.5</strong></p></div>",

My time here, spanning 8½ years, has been profoundly rewarding,” Brende said. The statement made no mention of Epstein.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I am grateful for the incredible collaboration with my colleagues, partners, and constituents, and I believe now is the right moment for the Forum to continue its important work without distractions,” added Brende, a former Norwegian foreign minister.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Brende has said he was unaware of Epstein’s past and criminal activities before first meeting him in 2018, and that he regretted not having investigated him more thoroughly.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Brende’s decision to quit follows a series of revelations relating to Epstein, who in 2008 was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor. The revelations have roiled business and political elites, and even the British royal family.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Independent review</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In a separate statement, Andre Hoffmann and Larry Fink, co-chairs of the Geneva-based forum that organises the annual Davos summit, said the independent review conducted by outside counsel into Brende’s ties with Epstein had concluded.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The findings stated there were no additional concerns beyond what has been previously disclosed, it added.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The co-chairs said the WEF’s Alois Zwinggi will serve as interim president and CEO, and that the forum’s Board of Trustees will oversee the leadership transition, including a plan to drive a process to identify a permanent successor.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The US Justice Department has released more than three million pages of documents relating to Epstein, who died by suicide in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">His ties to a long list of business and political leaders, including US President Donald Trump, former President bill Clinton and Tesla CEO Elon Musk are under close scrutiny.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Overseas, the revelations have prompted criminal investigations of Britain’s Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former Duke of York, and other prominent figures.

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[SINGAPORE] Private-sector economists expect global artificial intelligence (AI)-related tailwinds to bolster the Republic’s manufacturing growth at least through the first half of 2026, following January’s 16.6 per cent year-on-year increase in factory output.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">January’s performance exceeded private-sector economists’ estimates. They had predicted a median 12.1 per cent expansion in a Bloomberg poll. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Excluding the volatile biomedical manufacturing cluster, industrial production surged 24.1 per cent year on year, compared with December’s revised 13.1 per cent increase.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Maybank economists Chua Hak Bin and Brian Lee expect manufacturing and export growth to remain “robust” for at least the first half of 2026, due to the sustained AI investment boom.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As they see it, President Donald Trump’s higher US tariff threats are unlikely to affect the AI boom and strong electronics demand. “The timeline for implementing his previously threatened 15 per cent tariffs is uncertain and may not materialise for all countries,” they said.<strong> </strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">They reiterated Maybank’s 2026 gross domestic product growth forecast of 3.6 per cent, which stands at the upper end of the Ministry of Trade and Industry’s official forecast range of 2 to 4 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Similarly, UOB associate economist Jester Koh expects AI-related tailwinds to sustain through H1 2026 at least, underpinned by an estimated 30 per cent increase in capital expenditure by major technology firms.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">OCBC chief economist Selena Ling noted that January’s factory output figures marked the largest surge since November 2025, but said this was due to a low base effect stemming from the Chinese New Year (CNY) holidays taking place in January last year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">She said February’s industrial production prints are likely to lean lower “towards 5 per cent” as a result of the CNY holidays falling in February this year. Still, she expects manufacturing momentum in Q1 2026 to stay resilient at 9.4 per cent year on year, while full-year manufacturing growth could come in at 3 per cent or even higher, depending on how long the AI boom lasts.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The latest prints come after Singapore’s manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) rose to 50.5 last month – its highest reading in 10 months – arriving on the back of sustained demand for AI related products. The electronics sector registered its eighth consecutive month of expansion.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A reading above 50 on the index indicates growth from the previous month.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Cluster performance</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">All clusters recorded growth in factory output in January, except general manufacturing and biomedical manufacturing.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The linchpin electronics sector rose 44 per cent for the month, more than doubling December’s 19.6 per cent increase. Growth was led by the segments of other electronic modules and components, as well as semiconductors, with the latter supported by strong AI-related demand.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Maybank’s Dr Chua and Lee pointed out that semiconductor exports remain exempt from US tariffs. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Many of Singapore’s trading partners are also facing lower tariff rates for the time being with the Supreme Court’s repeal of US President Donald Trump’s International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)-based reciprocal tariffs, they noted.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Therefore, they think Asian exporters could step up frontloading to the US to capitalise on the temporarily lower tariff rates, in anticipation of fresh country-specific or product-specific tariffs. This would in turn benefit Singapore’s manufacturing sector and exports.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Meanwhile, DBS senior economist Chua Han Teng noted that electronics firms remain optimistic about the near-term outlook, as indicated in the recent PMI and EDB’s business expectations survey.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Of the clusters, transport engineering was the next best-performing, growing 25.2 per cent year on year. This was driven by the aerospace segment, which saw higher production of aircraft parts and sustained maintenance, repair and overhaul jobs.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Next was precision engineering, with output jumping 13.2 per cent. The cluster recorded growth in the segments of precision modules and components, as well as machinery and systems.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The chemicals cluster edged up a marginal 2.3 per cent for the month. While the other chemicals and petroleum segments recorded gains, these were partially offset by declines in the petrochemicals segment – due to weak demand and plant shutdowns – and the specialties segment, such as industrial gases.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In contrast,<strong> </strong>biomedical manufacturing recorded the biggest decline at 33.1 per cent in January. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The pharmaceuticals segment contracted on lower production of biological products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, while the medical technology segment fell due to softer demand for medical devices. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">General manufacturing declined 2.6 per cent for the month, as gains in the miscellaneous industries and printing segments were offset by declines in the food, beverages and tobacco segment.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, factory output rose 5.3 per cent in January, in a turnaround from December’s 0.3 per cent decline. Excluding biomedical manufacturing, output rose 10.8 per cent on the month, reversing from the previous month’s 2.5 per cent decline. </p></div>",
