They had predicted a median 12.1 per cent expansion in a Bloomberg poll. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Excluding the volatile biomedical manufacturing cluster, industrial production surged 24.1 per cent year on year, compared with December’s revised 13.1 per cent increase.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Maybank economists Chua Hak Bin and Brian Lee expect manufacturing and export growth to remain “robust” for at least the first half of 2026, due to the sustained AI investment boom.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As they see it, President Donald Trump’s higher US tariff threats are unlikely to affect the AI boom and strong electronics demand.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The timeline for implementing his previously threatened 15 per cent tariffs is uncertain and may not materialise for all countries,” they said.<strong> </strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">They reiterated Maybank’s 2026 gross domestic product growth forecast of 3.6 per cent, which stands at the upper end of the Ministry of Trade and Industry’s official forecast range of 2 to 4 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Similarly, UOB associate economist Jester Koh expects AI-related tailwinds to sustain through H1 2026 at least, underpinned by an estimated 30 per cent increase in capital expenditure by major technology firms.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">OCBC chief economist Selena Ling noted that January’s factory output figures marked the largest surge since November 2025, but said this was due to a low base effect stemming from the Chinese New Year (CNY) holidays taking place in January last year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">She said February’s industrial production prints are likely to lean lower “towards 5 per cent” as a result of the CNY holidays falling in February this year. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Still, she expects manufacturing momentum in Q1 2026 to stay resilient at 9.4 per cent year on year, while full-year manufacturing growth could come in at 3 per cent or even higher, depending on how long the AI boom lasts.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The latest prints come after Singapore’s manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) rose to 50.5 last month – its highest reading in 10 months – arriving on the back of sustained demand for AI related products. The electronics sector registered its eighth consecutive month of expansion.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A reading above 50 on the index indicates growth from the previous month.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Cluster performance</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">All clusters recorded growth in factory output in January, except general manufacturing and biomedical manufacturing.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The linchpin electronics sector rose 44 per cent for the month, more than doubling December’s 19.6 per cent increase. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Growth was led by the segments of other electronic modules and components, as well as semiconductors, with the latter supported by strong AI-related demand.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Maybank’s Dr Chua and Lee pointed out that semiconductor exports remain exempt from US tariffs. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Many of Singapore’s trading partners are also facing lower tariff rates for the time being with the Supreme Court’s repeal of US President Donald Trump’s International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)-based reciprocal tariffs, they noted.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Therefore, they think Asian exporters could step up frontloading to the US to capitalise on the temporarily lower tariff rates, in anticipation of fresh country-specific or product-specific tariffs. This would in turn benefit Singapore’s manufacturing sector and exports.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Meanwhile, DBS senior economist Chua Han Teng noted that electronics firms remain optimistic about the near-term outlook, as indicated in the recent PMI and EDB’s business expectations survey.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Of the clusters, transport engineering was the next best-performing, growing 25.2 per cent year on year. This was driven by the aerospace segment, which saw higher production of aircraft parts and sustained maintenance, repair and overhaul jobs.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Next was precision engineering, with output jumping 13.2 per cent. The cluster recorded growth in the segments of precision modules and components, as well as machinery and systems.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The chemicals cluster edged up a marginal 2.3 per cent for the month. While the other chemicals and petroleum segments recorded gains, these were partially offset by declines in the petrochemicals segment – due to weak demand and plant shutdowns – and the specialties segment, such as industrial gases.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In contrast,<strong> </strong>biomedical manufacturing recorded the biggest decline at 33.1 per cent in January. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The pharmaceuticals segment contracted on lower production of biological products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, while the medical technology segment fell due to softer demand for medical devices. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">General manufacturing declined 2.6 per cent for the month, as gains in the miscellaneous industries and printing segments were offset by declines in the food, beverages and tobacco segment.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, factory output rose 5.3 per cent in January, in a turnaround from December’s 0.3 per cent decline. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Excluding biomedical manufacturing, output rose 10.8 per cent on the month, reversing from the previous month’s 2.5 per cent decline. </p></div>",

But the new festival director, Chong Tze Chien, offered an early preview that also includes <em>Lacrima</em>, an acclaimed three-hour drama set inside a Parisian fashion house, and <em>Strangely Familiar</em>, a cross-border dance work led by Singapore’s The Human Expression Dance Company.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The family oriented immersive production <em>The Lighthouse</em>, set across various spaces in The Arts House, has also been confirmed.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Commissioned by the National Arts Council and organised by Arts House Group, Sifa 2026 runs from May 15 to 30 and marks its 27th edition across a 49-year history. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For Chong, who helms the festival for the first time, the initial selection hints at a line-up that seeks to balance familiarity and discovery, accessibility and experimentation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Recognisable classics such as <em>Hamlet</em> (by Teatro La Plaza) and <em>Hedda Gabler</em> (by the National Theatre Company of Korea) offer clear entry points for traditional audiences, while <em>Lacrima</em> brings together theatre and high fashion in a monumental production that leans into visual spectacle and extended storytelling. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">At three hours, <em>Lacrima</em> – created by Franco-Vietnamese writer-director Caroline Guiela Nguyen – stands in deliberate contrast to the short-form viewing habits shaped by digital media.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Meanwhile, the dance work <em>Strangely Familiar</em> extends the festival’s regional reach through collaboration across four Asian territories – Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Macau – broadening both artistic exchange and potential audience appeal. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For families and younger viewers, <em>The Lighthouse</em> by Australia’s Patch Theatre offers an immersive, roving, Instagram-friendly experience – suggesting an effort to engage audiences who want more participatory shows.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">More titles will be announced in mid-March, but the early preview already outlines a festival attempting to strike a careful balance: international works alongside regional collaborations, established titles alongside new interpretations, and large-scale productions alongside more intimate, accessible experiences. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Tickets go on sale in mid-March.</p></div>",

            "title": "Nearly a million young Britons are not in jobs or education",
            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[LONDON] The number of young Britons left out of work and education climbed closer to one million, as the Labour government’s policies attract criticism for stoking youth unemployment.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Office for National Statistics said on Thursday (Feb 26) that 957,000 people aged 16 to 24 were classified as “NEET” – not in education, employment or training – in October to December last year, up from 946,000 in the previous quarter.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The report could fuel discontent with Prime Minister Keir Starmer, whose party promised to “abolish youth unemployment” and boost growth. Labour has lifted payroll taxes, a measure it said was necessary to fill a hole in the public finances left by the previous Conservative administration – but one that has arguably harmed jobs. Critics also point to sharp increases in the minimum wage and plans to strengthen protections for employees, discouraging firms from hiring. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Youth unemployment is more widespread in the UK than in the European Union for the first time. Around one in six 16-to-24 year-olds looking for a job do not have one, a rate of 16.1 per cent that is the highest since 2014.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The worsening jobs picture is pushing young people to the political fringes. Men in particular – who are more likely to be unemployed – are increasingly supporting Nigel Farage’s right-wing Reform UK. Labour has pointed to its programmes encouraging young people into training and apprenticeships, but is also losing support to the left-wing Green Party.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The overall increase in NEETS in the last quarter was driven by women. Female NEETS increased 13,000, while the number of men fell 2,000. BLOOMBERG</p></div>",
