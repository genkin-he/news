The company is seeking to list its shares on Mar 18. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The deal would provide a boost to Kuala Lumpur’s IPO market, which saw a 14 per cent decline in proceeds last year. The MSCI Malaysia Index has gained 6.8 per cent over the past year, compared with a 38 per cent gain in the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Sunway Healthcare will use the proceeds for capital expenditure related to expansion of existing hospitals, construction of a new hospital and the redemption of Islamic medium-term notes. The valuation of 16.7 billion ringgit would make Sunway Healthcare the second-largest listed health-care provider in Malaysia after IHH Healthcare Bhd.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Sunway Healthcare operates five private hospitals, as well as ambulatory care centres and supportive care facilities across Malaysia. It is looking to add as many as five more hospitals in the coming years, with three under construction.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The health-care listing will be Sunway’s third carveout to be listed in the Malaysian stock exchange, after its construction arm Sunway Construction Group Bhd and Sunway Real Estate Investment Trust. Founded by tycoon Jeffrey Cheah, the conglomerate operates in several industries and also owns universities, malls, quarries, and had also ventured into building data centres.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Cornerstone investors in the IPO include JPMorgan Asset Management, Eastspring Investments and RBC Global Asset Management, according to the deal terms.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Malayan Banking, AmInvestment Bank, UBS Group, HSBC Holdings and Jefferies Financial Group are among the banks arranging Sunway Healthcare’s IPO.

Muhamad Kerry Adrianto Riza, a beneficial owner of a fuel terminal leased by Pertamina, was jailed for 15 years for his involvement, less than the 18 years sought by prosecutors.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Riza is the son of businessman Mohammad Riza Chalid, who has been named a suspect in the case and who the police said is now at large.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The three men had each denied the charges against them and pleaded not guilty, local media reported during the trial.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Riza’s lawyer Patra Zen said on Friday that his client rejected the ruling and would appeal.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Outside the court on Friday, Firnandi said that he was disappointed by a verdict that he called a farce, and said he would discuss with his counsel about appealing.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Siahaan’s lawyer Luhut Pangaribuan said that he was saddened and disappointed by the verdict.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Pertamina did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
