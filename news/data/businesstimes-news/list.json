The placement was undertaken to strengthen liquidity and fund upfront working capital requirements for a newly secured US government contract, bridging the timing gap between project expenditures and reimbursement receipts to reduce execution risk.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The placement was conducted via an exempt offering to institutional and accredited investors, with no participation from directors or substantial shareholders.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Last week’s beachheads also illustrate how issuers are pairing shareholderbase initiatives with balance sheet funding and earnings delivery.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Valuemax </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Valuemax Group’s executive chairman Yeah Hiang Nam and his spouse Tan Hong Yee sold 34.8 million existing shares via a block trade at S$1.16 per share, representing a 6.5 per cent discount to the previous closing price. This reduces their total interest to 81.53 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The sale attracted strong participation from long-only institutional investors, and was handled by OCBC as placement agent. Following the transaction, the vendors still control about 81.5 per cent of the company and have committed to a 90-day moratorium on further share sales, signalling continued commitment. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The block trade was undertaken to diversify and institutionalise the shareholder base, improve free float and trading liquidity, and support potential index inclusion, with no dilution since no new shares were issued. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Long-only institutional investors that participated in the block trade included abrdn Asia, Amova Asset Management Asia, Avanda Investment Management and ICH Synergrowth Fund.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Valuemax Group is one of Singapore’s largest pawnbroking and jewellery retail chains, complemented by a substantial secured and unsecured money-lending business and gold trading operations across Singapore and Malaysia. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The group delivered record financial performance in FY2024 (ended Dec 31) and then again in FY2025 with profit after tax surpassing S$100 million for the first time at S$103.6 million. This was driven by strong growth across its pawnbroking, jewellery retail and money-lending businesses. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Reflecting on the improved earnings, the board proposed a total dividend of S$0.0388 per share, a 44.8 per cent increase year on year, alongside a strengthened balance sheet with net assets of S$611.8 million and a conservative 1.43 times debt-to-equity ratio.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The average daily turnover of the stock has grown from S$39,000 in 2024 to S$190,000 in 2025 to S$799,000 in Q1 2026 to Feb 25.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Despite more than S$17 million of net institutional outflows from Singapore-listed consumer cyclical stocks in January, Valuemax Group was one of three gold-linked financial retailers that bucked the trend, attracting a combined S$8.5 million of inflows.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">CapitaLand India Trust</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On Feb 24, Clint announced a fully underwritten private placement that subsequently raised about S$150 million through a private placement of 124.2 million new units at S$1.208 each, which was around 2.6 times covered, reflecting strong institutional demand. The issue price represented a modest discount to market volume weighted average price, balancing investor appeal with capital discipline.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On an illustrative historical pro forma basis, the trustee-manager expects the placement to be distribution per unt (DPU)-accretive by 5.1 per cent and to reduce gearing to 36.8 per cent after deployment of proceeds, while also potentially improving trading liquidity through a larger unitholder base.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For FY2025 (ended Dec 31), Clint’s DPU increased 15 per cent from FY 2024, to S$0.0787, while H2 FY2025 DPU rose 22 per cent to S$0.0390, supported by improved operating performance and higher interest income from forward purchase assets under development. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The valuations as at Dec 31 reported a 19 per cent year-on-year increase in Clint’s portfolio property value to 266.4 billion rupees (S$3.8 billion) on a like-for-like basis, excluding the divestments of CyberVale, Chennai and CyberPearl, Hyderabad.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The management said disciplined capital recycling, a visible development pipeline and balance sheet optimisation position the trust to support steady and resilient growth into FY 2026 and beyond.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Marco Polo Marine</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On Feb 24, Marco Polo Marine announced a proposed placement of up to 144.9 million new shares at S$0.145 apiece, raising up to about S$21 million in gross proceeds. With Maybank Securities as placement agent, the new shares represent about 3.9 per cent of existing issued share capital. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Net proceeds are intended to be used entirely for capex tied to business expansion, including but not limited to fleet expansion and renewal, and the placement also aims to broaden the shareholder base to potentially improve liquidity; it is offered to institutional and accredited investors and excludes directors and substantial shareholders.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Marco Polo Marine highlighted that the placement has a positive impact on net tangible assets (NTA) per share, as the new equity is being raised at a premium to existing net assets. With the S$0.145 placement price sitting well above the S$0.0636 NTA per share, the issuance lifts NTA per share to S$0.0664 cents on a pro forma basis. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As a result, the equity injection more than offsets dilution, lifting net tangible assets per share even as earnings are diluted, and strengthening the balance sheet ahead of planned fleet expansion. As at Sep 30, the group was already in a net cash position of S$9.3 million, providing balance-sheet flexibility even before the placement.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On Feb 16, Marco Polo Marine reported a strong start to its FY2026 (ended Dec 31), with Q1 FY2026 revenue rising 27 per cent, from Q1 FY2025, to S$32.8 million. This was primarily driven by a sharp expansion in its ship chartering operations following recent fleet additions. Gross profit for the quarter increased 32 per cent to S$14 million, with gross margin improving by two percentage points to 43 per cent. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The group noted that this reflected a more favourable revenue mix with a higher contribution from chartering, which carries structurally higher margins than shipyard activities. Moreover, the ship chartering segment drove Q1 FY2026 growth, with revenue rising 53 per cent year on year to S$23.2 million. This was supported by the deployment of the CSOV MP Wind Archer flagship and three additional crew transfer vessels, which lifted fleet utilisation to around 76 per cent from 71 per cent amid sustained offshore wind demand. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In February, the CSOV MP Wind Archer won the Offshore Energy Vessel of the Year Award 2026, at the Annual Offshore Support Journal Conference, Awards and Exhibition in London.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Marco Polo Marine also said that FY2026 will see a full-year contribution from the CSOV and three crew transfer vessels, compared with partial contributions in FY2025, supporting stronger topline and earnings momentum. The group also expects two new anchor handling tug supply vessels to join the fleet in 2026, expanding capacity and optionality across oil and gas, and offshore wind.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Marco Polo Marine’s pivot from shipbuilding and repair to ship chartering has more than doubled the latter’s contribution to the topline over the past decade. The Q1 FY2026 revenue mix of 71 per cent chartering and 29 per cent shipyard compared with less than 40 per cent and more than 60 per cent respectively in FY2016, underscoring the structural shift in the business. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Even so, the shipbuilding segment remains meaningful, anchored by an NT$4.68 billion (S$188 million) contract to build a 4,000 gross tonnage oceanographic research vessel for Taiwan’s National Academy of Marine Research. It is the largest shipbuilding project undertaken by the group to date.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On Feb 19, Maybank Research maintained its “buy” call on the stock with a S$0.20 target price, citing a multiyear growth phase from FY2026 to FY2030 driven by fleet expansion, offshore wind exposure and potential shipbuilding wins. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Maybank’s head of small-mid caps research, Jarick Seet, sees Q1 FY2026 as the start of a seasonal uptrend, with Q2 FY2026 expected to beat Q1 FY2026, and Q3 FY2026 likely the peak given seasonality and rising utilisation, before a typical softening in Q4. The average daily turnover of the stock has grown from S$467,000 in H1 2025 to S$3.2 million in H2 2025 to S$6.4 million in Q1 2026 to Feb 25. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><strong>The writer is the market strategist at SGX.

The result was better than the median analyst estimate of a 1 per cent year-on-year increase, with revenue returning to 81.3 per cent of the pre-pandemic level in 2019. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Macau ramped up entertainment offerings during the nine-day Chinese New Year break in mainland China – its largest source of visitors – staging float parades, drone and firework shows, markets and concerts.

Initial negotiations valued Sparrow Tech at US$50 million, contingent on the company obtaining a major payment institution licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) by March 2022.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As that condition was not met, the original deal fell apart, and Sparrow Tech gave one month’s notice to LinkChina to terminate their contract in May 2022.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Distressed sale</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">By then, Sparrow Tech’s position had deteriorated sharply in the wake of the crypto market crash beginning in late 2021.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The company also found itself with about US$17.1 million in crypto assets that were frozen by Vauld, a crypto lending platform that suspended all withdrawals in July 2022. With shareholders unwilling to inject fresh capital, Sparrow Tech faced a severe liquidity crunch.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It was under these circumstances that the company approached Amber Group again to revive deal talks. Also, by this point, MAS had in June 2022 granted Sparrow in-principle approval for the major payment institution licence.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A new share purchase agreement was signed in July 2022 and completed in November 2022 – less than three months after LinkChina’s contract had been terminated. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The final deal came in well below the original US$50 million valuation. The consideration was structured as US$16.9 million minus third-party indebtedness, plus two contingent payments linked to whatever could eventually be recovered from the frozen Vauld assets.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Disputed fees</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">When LinkChina learned of the completed transaction, it invoiced Sparrow Tech for US$1.6 million, based on a claimed enterprise value of US$54.8 million. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Sparrow Tech refused to pay, arguing that no fee was owed because Sparrow Tech and Amber Group had never expressly agreed on the enterprise value.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Senior Judge Lee rejected the argument, ruling that it could not have been the parties’ intention for the fee to depend on an explicit written agreement between buyer and seller on the enterprise value figure.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Instead, he said that the enterprise value was to be determined objectively from the financial terms of the share purchase agreement and the company’s accounts, by adding Sparrow Tech’s equity value and total debt and subtracting cash.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Senior Judge Lee argued that the purchase consideration under the share purchase agreement was the best measure of equity value, favouring it over theoretical valuation models. “No academic postulation can be better than that situation where parties put their money where their mouths are in an arm’s length transaction.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Working through the share purchase agreement components – US$16.9 million minus third-party indebtedness of US$21.6 million, plus confirmed Vauld recoveries of US$6.1 million and a maximum contingent payment of US$4 million – the court arrived at an equity value of US$5.4 million. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Adding total debt of US$21.6 million and subtracting cash of US$0.2 million, the enterprise value came to US$26.8 million, yielding a success fee of US$803,663.83. Interest was ordered at 5.33 per cent per annum from the date of the writ, along with costs.</p></div>",

These are things that Trump can legitimately point to as foreign policy accomplishments,” Prof Radd added.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Trump will go to Beijing strong</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The attack came at a delicate moment for US-China relations, with Trump due in Beijing on Mar 31 for a three-day visit to discuss tariffs, rare earths, AI chips and other nettlesome subjects.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The White House has not provided updates on the high-stakes summit, but analysts have wondered if the strikes would sharpen the great power rivalry even as it tests both sides’ realpolitik.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Former US diplomat David Meale, now with Eurasia Group, said the trip would proceed because Trump is “capable of managing the Iran situation while keeping focus on broader foreign policy goals”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Professor Dennis Wilder, a former White House Asia hand who now teaches at Georgetown University, went further. “Xi will respect Trump’s boldness. Trump will arrive in Beijing from a position of strength,” he told ST.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">From China’s perspective, though, the Iran strikes are an unwelcome distraction.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“With the critical Two Sessions next week, the Iran crisis is about the last thing China needs as it gets its house in order,” said Han Lin, the China managing director for The Asia Group, referring to annual meetings of China’s top advisory and legislative bodies that kick off on Mar 4 and Mar 5 respectively.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China has refrained from coming out in support of Iran, its strategic partner. Its Ministry of Foreign Affairs mainly called for an immediate cessation of military operations in a Feb 28 statement.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Lin said China might suggest to Iran via back channels that it should refrain from closing the Strait of Hormuz to avoid disruptions of oil shipments.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China stands to benefit from the unfolding situation by portraying itself as the chief defender of global stability while the US is trying to reorder the world by force. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Both powers are increasingly aware that every regional crisis is also a proxy test of their global rivalry,” Lin told ST.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It would not be in Beijing’s interest to see a regime collapse in Teheran that would be replaced by a Western-aligned government.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China is Iran’s largest oil customer, buying over 80 per cent of its crude in 2025, often at steep discounts. Iran is also a key node for China’s Belt and Road Initiative, providing land and sea corridors across the Middle East.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The two nations signed a 25-year strategic agreement in 2021 and China is reportedly supplying air defence systems, anti-ship and ballistic missile components that support Iran’s own missile and drone capabilities.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But Prof Wilder dismissed the ties as non-consequential.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Iran is a marriage of convenience, not a strategic ally to China. Beijing is the ultimate realist,” he said.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Slowdown in arms shipments to Asia</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For some US allies and partners in the Asia-Pacific, the attack on Iran could mean a slowdown in US arms shipments.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Despite the Trump administration’s insistence that the Americas and Indo-Pacific are their top regional priorities, we are once again seeing military action in the Middle East,” said Dr Zack Cooper, an expert on US policy in Asia at the American Enterprise Institute.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“This will use up stocks of some critical munitions and once again distract the US government from the focus on Asia favoured by many experts and officials,” he told ST.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Analysts estimate the US has already burned through a significant share of air- and missile-defence interceptors like the Patriot and THAAD systems and faces supply chain bottlenecks and workforce gaps in ramping up production.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">’You don’t fire this many surface-to-air missiles in the Middle East and Ukraine without straining a very small production capacity,” said Prof Wilder, the former White House official.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Asia would still get attention from the Trump administration, he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“But it delays such things as arms transfers to Taiwan and Japan under existing contracts,” he added. <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/iran-attack-a-major-triumph-for-trump-strengthening-his-hand-ahead-of-china-visit\" target=\"_blank\">THE STRAITS TIMES</a></p></div>",

That’s deception.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Calls to curb excessive borrowing and plug loopholes have been growing louder.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Sengkang GRC MP He Ting Ru similarly raised the issue in Parliament, asking if the Government is working with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to curb in-house financing that circumvents loan-to-value limits in the auto industry.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In a Feb 4 written response, Siow said: “Buyers are strongly advised to obtain loans through regulated arrangements.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The Government is monitoring the situation and will tighten regulations to manage the abuse of such regulations if necessary.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The worries come as figures obtained by <em>The Straits Times</em> showed that households in Singapore had outstanding motor vehicle loans of around S$12.4 billion by the end of 2025 – a 12-year high.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Under MAS rules, financial institutions like banks must cap the loan amount given out at between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of the purchase price, depending on the vehicle’s open market value.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">To check if full loans are being offered by car dealers with little restriction, ST posed as a would-be buyer of vehicles to investigate the prevalence of such options.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Of the five new and used car dealers ST reached out to, only one advised caution and encouraged prudence.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The rest said they could offer 100 per cent loans, either through in-house financing or by inflating the selling price. None of the authorised dealers, which tap financial institutions for loans, contacted by ST offered such borrowing schemes.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Proof of income</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">ST visited three companies on Feb 10 to inquire about the purchase of a new small car.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Two dealers immediately confirmed what their ads said – that they would submit a loan application to their in-house financers or partners for a loan covering the full cost of the car, which amounted to around S$178,000 with certificate of entitlement.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">One dealer said that for a car of that value, the buyer would be looking at a 10-year loan of around S$2,000 in monthly instalments. Based on ST’s calculations, the total amount paid over the 10 years would be S$240,000.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Buyers would need to show proof of a monthly income of at least S$6,000.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The second dealer said a 100 per cent loan would be taken from the firm’s in-house financing unit.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The third dealer said that while it was possible to apply for a full loan for the car purchase, it would be more advisable to pay a 10 per cent down payment at least.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The dealer said this would be more financially prudent for someone earning a monthly income of around S$6,000.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, the dealer added that although it advised against it, it can use a long-held industry practice and inflate the price of the vehicle on paper when submitting the loan application to financial institutions or other loan providers.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“In the eyes of the finance companies, you are actually buying the car at a higher price, not the real price. So that they will loan you the original price amount,” said the dealer.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The buyer will still have to cover the goods and services tax incurred on the difference between the actual and inflated prices.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“(This is done) because we are generating an invoice, we are very law abiding... so we are very careful about compliance but we also try to fulfil our client’s needs,” the dealer added.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Another dealer said it offered the same inflated price scheme, but would absorb the additional GST due to an ongoing promotion.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A third scheme ST learnt about involved buyers claiming they are buying the vehicle to operate a private-hire car (PHC), in order to secure a 100 per cent loan.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">PHCs, which are meant for commercial use, are exempted from MAS’ car financing rules.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Aware of practices</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Experts said the authorities take a serious view of any attempt to circumvent motor-vehicle financing restrictions.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As for PHCs, ST understands that the Government is monitoring possible exploitation of the PHC exemption, where owners register private cars as private-hire cars with no intention of offering the service.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In a reply to ST, MAS sounded a note of caution over 100 per cent LTV loans, saying unregulated financing schemes carry higher risks, such as hidden charges and bigger losses for the borrowers if they default.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Its spokesperson added that the authority is also aware of the inflated-price practice used by some in the car industry.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“To counter mark-up practices, we expect FIs to conduct checks to assess if the purchase price is reasonable, such as by obtaining independent valuations.” The spokesperson noted that the vast majority of borrowing for motor vehicle loans are taken with financial institutions regulated by the central bank.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Other than MAS-regulated FIs, entities which are licensed or exempt moneylenders, or which offer financing in the form of hire-purchase arrangements, are also required to comply with the same motor-vehicle financing restrictions under the respective legislation or regulations,” the spokesperson said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Prof Charoenwong said MAS could require FIs to independently verify car purchase prices by cross-referencing with LTA registration data, market valuation databases, or a standardised price guide, rather than relying solely on dealer-submitted invoices.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Prof Charoenwong said some dealers know that the bank’s loan officer has limited ability or incentive to challenge the stated price, especially when the deal superficially complies with LTV requirements.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">So if the invoice says S$170,000, that is what gets processed, he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The brazenness – openly advertising 100 per cent financing and guaranteed approvals on social media – tells you exactly how dealers perceive the regulatory environment: they don’t fear consequences.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“That perception changes only when enforcement action actually materialises,” said Prof Charoenwong.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Authorised distributors contacted by ST said that they do not offer 100 per cent loans.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Singapore Vehicle Traders Association declined to comment when asked about the practice of dealers inflating their selling prices to get a higher loan amount for their customers.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Its spokesman said that being able to borrow more will make it easier to get a buyer.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Hire Purchase, Finance and Leasing Association of Singapore, an industry body which keeps a register of vehicles that are financed by its members, said that it does not monitor the business practices of its members. <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\"

That edged out wind generation, which rose 13 per cent to 1.13 million gigawatt-hours.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The rapid growth of renewables helped China meet its growing electricity consumption last year without the need to burn more coal at power plants, with thermal generation falling 0.7 per cent. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Even so, coal remains the dominant source of China’s power and the fuel’s share of total energy consumption fell only marginally in 2025 to 51.4 per cent. Total coal consumption was 0.1 per cent higher, likely reflecting the fuel’s use in the growing coal-to-chemicals sector.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China produced more electricity using solar last year than Japan’s entire grid, and panels now account for 11 per cent of the nation’s total generation, compared to less than 1 per cent a decade ago. That is the result of the huge supply chain Chinese companies have developed and the versatility of the technology, which is quick to deploy and has been adopted in a wide range of locations – from vast desert installations to small village rooftops.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Still, solar’s rise has not been without complications. Most equipment manufacturers are struggling with losses because of overcapacity and low prices, while the influx of so much electricity in daylight hours means major investment is now needed in power lines and energy storage facilities to ensure the electricity does not go to waste.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Wind technology tends to produce power for more hours of the day than solar, meaning it is only now being overtaken in terms of generation – even though panels have offered greater capacity in China for several years.

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[MUMBAI] Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rebounded sharply in early Asia trading on Sunday (Mar 1) after Iran confirmed that the country’s supreme leader had been killed during a military campaign by the US and Israel.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The original cryptocurrency rose as much as 2.21 per cent to US$68,196 following the news. It was trading at around US$67,700 at 11 am in Singapore, after dropping as much as 3.8 per cent the previous day. Ether, the second-largest token, gained as much as 4.58 per cent to trade back above US$2,000.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Crypto markets, which trade 24/7, were rattled in the hours after the bombing began. Iran launched counterstrikes on multiple locations – including Israel, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain – and threatened more against US linked bases in Iraq. Yet digital assets started to recover throughout the day, with Bitcoin moving sharply higher after initial reports that Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was dead.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Traders generally don’t expect the Iran conflict to have major negative economic consequences, and demand for upside Bitcoin calls has clearly picked up in recent days,” said Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, adding that traders were positioning themselves for the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Cryptocurrencies had recovered roughly US$32 billion in market value by Sunday morning, after shedding about US$128 billion the previous day, according to data from CoinGecko.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Bitcoin is the only large liquid asset trading 24/7, so it absorbed all the selling pressure that would normally spread across equities, bonds, and commodities,” said Hayden Hughes, managing partner at Tokenize Capital. “The real price discovery happens Monday when US equity markets and Bitcoin ETFs reopen. With missiles hitting Dubai, Iranian retaliation across the Gulf, and Strait of Hormuz closure risk, this is not a contained event.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For Bitcoin, the weekend losses extend a months-long sell-off in crypto markets, beginning with the liquidation of some US$19 billion in leveraged positions in October. Bitcoin has fallen around 50 per cent from its all-time peak of over US$126,000 earlier that month, unable to latch on to rallies in gold and other safe-haven assets.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“As always, when critical events take place during the weekend, Bitcoin plays the role of pressure valve,” said Justin d’Anethan, head of research at Arctic Digital, noting that the initial impact on the token wasn’t as drastic as some might have expected.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“With a lot of the leverage already cleared out and exhausted sellers, there’s only so much impact macro events can have,” he added.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Meanwhile, with traditional venues closed, digital-asset investors turned to tokenized commodities on decentralised exchange Hyperliquid to position for geopolitical fallout. Prices for contracts tied to oil, gold and silver jumped on the platform.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The reaction also materialised through a sharp increase in selling pressure on Bitcoin derivatives, where within a single hour on Saturday morning, sell volume surged by approximately US$1.8 billion, according to an analysis published by CryptoQuant.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“This type of imbalance reflects clear seller dominance and rising short-term risk aversion,” wrote crypto analyst Sylvain Olive. “Flows are driven more by emotion and risk management than by structural dynamic, requiring a cautious approach.” BLOOMBERG</p></div>",

Satellite images from tanker trackers showed vessels backed up next to big ports, such as Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates, and not moving through Hormuz.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Multiple vessels in the area have received VHF transmission from Iran’s Revolutionary Guards that “no ship is allowed to pass the Strait of Hormuz”, an official with the EU naval mission Aspides told Reuters.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The British Navy said Iran’s orders were not legally binding and advised vessels to transit with caution.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Vessel traffic through the Strait of Hormuz has not completely stopped but disruptions are building rapidly, shipbroker Poten &amp; Partners said in a note to clients.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The tanker association Intertanko said the US Navy had warned against navigation in the area – the whole of the Gulf, Gulf of Oman, North Arabian Sea, and the Strait of Hormuz – saying it could not guarantee the safety of shipping.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Greece’s shipping ministry advised vessels on Saturday to avoid the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz, according to an advisory seen by Reuters.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Some 20 per cent of global oil, including from producers Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Kuwait and Iran, passes through Hormuz along with large volumes of LNG from Qatar.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Fourteen LNG tankers have shown signs of slowing down, U-turning or stopping in or around the Strait, said Laura Page from consultancy Kpler,adding that the number would likely rise, posing risks to Qatari LNG exports.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">German container-shipping group Hapag-Lloyd said it is suspending all vessel transit through the Strait of Hormuz until further notice. Services calling on ports in the Gulf may experience delays, rerouting or schedule adjustments, the company said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Denmark’s Maersk said in an undated update on its website that it was coordinating with security partners on all operations in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden but cargo acceptance in the Middle East remained open.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">French shipping group CMA CGM said it had told its vessels inside or headed for the Gulf to proceed to shelter after the US and Israel attacked Iran.
