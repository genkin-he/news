All 118 sectors saw increases ranging from around 2 to 9 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">LBC rates for commercial use have gone up by 0.5 per cent on average.

JLL’s analysis showed that the S$1,330 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr) top bid for the Bedok Rise GLS site in November 2025 was about 36 per cent above the implied land value based on the Sep 1, 2025, LBC rate for non-landed residential use in the sector.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Also in November, a GLS tender for a site next to Newton MRT interchange station fetched a top bid of nearly S$1,820 psf ppr. This was 16 per cent above the implied land value based on the Sep 1, 2025, LBC rate for non-landed residential use in that location, which is in Sector 37, where the LBC rate is being raised by 10.2 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Huttons Asia chief executive officer Mark Yip noted that the 4.1 per cent rise on average for non-landed residential use LBC rates is the biggest increase since September 2022. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He added: “The strong take-up at private residential project launches in 2025 renewed the need among developers to replenish their land banks. As well, reduced borrowing costs for developers boosted their ability to pay more for GLS sites amid the increased competition.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On industrial LBC rates being raised across all 118 sectors by about 2 to 9 per cent, Wong Shanting, research head for Singapore at Newmark, noted: “This broad-based uplift reflects an active industrial market, underpinned by several high-value transactions that have driven land costs higher.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">An example would be 680 Upper Thomson Road, which was sold in October 2025 for about S$665 psf ppr. Based on JLL’s analysis, this was a 190 per cent premium to the land value implied by the Sep 1, 2025, industrial LBC rate for the area, which is in Sector 107; the LBC rate for the sector has been raised by 9.3 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Summing up, Dr Chua of JLL said: “The refreshed LBC rates should not have any significant drag on the market trend or dampen developers’ and investors’ longer-term confidence in the underlying property market.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, CBRE’s research head for Singapore and South-east Asia Tricia Song pointed out: “The increase in residential LBC rates could further increase acquisition costs for developers, and dampen an already-weak collective sale market.”</p></div>",

My attempts towards a sensible solution have not been reciprocated,” he said on Friday.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Wilson, one of the biggest independent shareholders of Lululemon with a 4.27 per cent stake, also said the board rejected his proposal to create a committee focused on brand, product and creative oversight.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Lululemon did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Wilson’s campaign comes as the company’s shares have lost nearly half of their value over the past 12 months, with the brand struggling to retain younger and affluent shoppers amid intense competition from fast-growing rivals such as Alo Yoga and Vuori.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Lululemon is also operating without a permanent CEO after Calvin McDonald’s departure in December, and is facing pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management, which has built a stake of more than US$1  billion in the retailer.
