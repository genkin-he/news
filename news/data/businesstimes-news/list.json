A rapid adoption of artificial intelligence is also adding another layer of caution, economists said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The number of people receiving unemployment benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, dropped 31,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.833 million during the week ended February 14, the claims report showed. The so-called continuing claims covered the period during which the government surveyed households for February’s unemployment rate.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The jobless rate eased to 4.3 per cent in January from 4.4 per cent in December. While the labour market is regaining its footing, consumers remain anxious about their employment prospects.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A survey from the Conference Board this week showed the share of consumers who viewed jobs as “hard to get” increased to a five-year high in February, though households also believed the availability of jobs had improved.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The median duration of unemployment is near four-year highs, and job opportunities remain scarce for young college graduates, labour market data shows.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Jobless recent college graduates do not show in the claims data because they have limited or no work history, making them ineligible to file for unemployment benefits.

Among others, these impairments were linked to assets held for sale and losses on the disposal of intangible assets.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The company said the outlook for ICG “remains positive”, citing more than 20,000 peer-reviewed publications and 780 clinical trials – completed or ongoing – that demonstrate the dye’s efficacy and clinical utility. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It added that clinical adoption is growing, with regulatory approvals of Verdye – an injectable form of ICG – expanding to 40 countries, compared with 35 in 2024. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For FY2026, UltraGreen.ai has guided for US$170 million to US$190 million in revenue.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“This outlook is driven by underlying business expansion, the full-year impact of pricing initiatives implemented in FY2025, and further penetration into new markets,” said Ravinder Sajwan, the company’s chief executive officer and executive director.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Shares of <!-- --> <!-- -->UltraGreen.ai<!-- --> <!-- --> finished Thursday 5.6 per cent or US$0.10 lower at US$1.69.</p></div>",
