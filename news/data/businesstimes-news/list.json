Earnings for FY2025 also benefited from a one-off performance fee from a partial disposal of the purpose built.student accommodation portfolio under Wee Hur PBSA Master Trust.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This was partially offset by lower contributions from share of profits from a joint venture following the disposal.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">During the year, the group completed the disposal of properties under the Wee Hur PBSA Master Trust (Fund I) for A$1.6 billion (S$1.3 billion). The disposal allowed it to realise a significant part of its investment in the fund and reallocate capital to other investments, the group said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The group remarked that it is “well-positioned to accelerate the growth of its business”, supported by a stable fund management revenue stream and an experienced management team.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Singapore property development segment was a major revenue contributor for the period. The segment’s revenue rose 83 per cent to S$82.9 million, amid progressive recognition of revenue from the Bartley Vue project, which reached 84.9 per cent completion and has been sold out.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Looking ahead, the company intends to capitalise on sustained demand for residential projects in Singapore and the Australian purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA) sector.

This marked a turnaround from a net loss of S$535,000 in the corresponding period the year before. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This came despite a 3.8 per cent decline in H2 revenue to S$53.1 million, down from S$55.2 million in the year-ago period. The return to profitability for the half-year was buoyed by stronger margins, as gross profit surged 34.3 per cent to S$8.7 million.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Earnings per share for the half-year stood at S$0.0127, compared to a loss per share of S$0.0055 previously.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the full year, however, the group’s net profit plunged 76.2 per cent to S$484,000, from S$2.04 million in FY2024. Full-year revenue fell 6.2 per cent to S$102 million, from S$108.7 million. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The top-line decline was mainly due to lower sales across its car sales, financing, and rental segments, though this was partially offset by higher revenue in its automobile after-sales segment. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Car sales revenue, the group’s largest contributor, fell 7.4 per cent to S$80.9 million, driven by a sharp decline in dealer floor stock sales and a slight drop in pre-owned car sales.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The sharp drop in full-year earnings was heavily weighed down by a 29.1 per cent jump in administrative expenses to S$11.1 million.
