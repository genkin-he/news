The 99-year-leasehold property, completed in 1998, is directly connected to The Centrepoint via a link-bridge.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Frasers Property owns almost all - about 96 per cent - of The Centrepoint’s front block, which houses 151 retail units on a freehold plot.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Before the collective sale, the group owned part of the rear block, which contains 66 apartments and 66 retail units on an L-shaped plot with around 52 years left on its 99-year lease. It reportedly held all the retail strata units and eight apartments, adding up to about 52 per cent of the strata area and about 85 per cent of the share value in the rear block. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The selling price of<strong> </strong>S$391.9 million values the rear block site at a land rate of S$2,577 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr), after including a land betterment charge of S$260 million to top up the plot’s lease to a fresh 99 years, and build up the site to its maximum gross plot ratio of 5.6. Currently, the 44,700 sq ft plot has a development baseline of 171,482 sq ft, equivalent to a plot ratio of 3.83. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Soon Su Lin, chief executive officer of Frasers Property Singapore, said: “We are pleased to strengthen our ownership of The Centrepoint. This gives us greater flexibility to unlock the site’s long-term potential, including assessing broader rejuvenation plans for the area.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Centrepoint was developed by Frasers Property when it was the property division of Cold Storage. It has occupancy rate of about 98 per cent as at Sep 30, 2025. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The mall opened in 1983 and became home to Robinsons, an iconic anchor tenant until the department store moved out in 2014 after 31 years. Another department store, Metro, moved in but closed in 2019, by which time other longtime tenants including Times Bookshop and Marks &amp; Spencer had also moved out. Anchor tenants today include French sports retailer Decathlon, coworking operator Justco, electronics store Harvey Norman and a Fairprice Finest supermarket.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The site is zoned Commercial, with a height control of up to 10 storeys. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Under the URA’s Strategic Development Incentive (SDI) Scheme, the developer may take advantage of incentives offered in terms of bonus gross floor area, more intensive land use and/or building height. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The SDI scheme aims to nudge renewal and redevelopment of ageing buildings in core areas, and offers incentives to asset owners combining at least two adjacent sites in a way that can have a strong transformational impact on the area. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">At The Centrepoint, the 66 residential units include one to three-bedroom units, sized between 732 sq ft and 3,003 sq ft.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nearby, an expression of interest exercise for <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/property/cuppage-terrace-next-centrepoint-sale-s250-million-valuation\" target=\"_blank\">Cuppage Terrace</a> closed on Feb 12.

The bill has moved more slowly in the Senate amid disagreements, as lawmakers seek to address what they view as gaps in the Genius Act, signed by US President Donald Trump in July. The measure was the first to set a federal framework for issuing stablecoins.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A key sticking point is whether crypto trading platforms such as Coinbase Global should be allowed to pay users rewards for holding stablecoins, a type of token designed to track the value of the US dollar. Banks argue that letting firms effectively pay yield on clients’ stablecoin holdings could draw money away from lower-yielding deposits and pose risks to financial stability.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Coinbase chief executive officer Brian Armstrong in January, withdrew his support for the draft legislation. Coinbase, other crypto firms and trade groups and the banking industry have since held several meetings at the White House to discuss a compromise. Last week, Armstrong said there is a “path forward”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Bitcoin surged on expectations of a more crypto-friendly second Trump administration, reaching a record above US$126,000 last October. A sharp sell-off followed, leaving digital assets under pressure and investors more cautious. Any sustained rebound would offer relief after cryptocurrencies were pummelled late last year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Crypto winters don’t end in excitement; they end in apathy,” said Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management. “The one-day big up moves are thrilling, but no one expects Bitcoin to run straight back to US$100,000. Bitcoin is in the process of bottoming. The process will take a while and will be messy. There could be lower lows.” BLOOMBERG</p></div>",

At the same time, the company has invested heavily in AI tools to run more efficiently, including building its own tool called Goose. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The reduction in force, which was announced in a shareholder letter on Thursday (Feb 26), comes after rolling job eliminations that have often been tied to annual performance reviews. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We are taking bold and decisive action here, but we are doing it from a position of strength,” Amrita Ahuja, chief financial officer, said. “We are doing it in a way that we believe positions us to move even faster for our customers.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">After the announcement, Block’s stock jumped as much as 22 per cent in extended trading. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The move by Block is the latest indication of the havoc that new AI tools are wreaking on the economy and financial markets. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In the shareholder letter, the company highlighted strong financial performance over 2025, including gross profit growth that more than doubled from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Dorsey, the company’s co-founder, touted how the company has reignited the growth of users of its peer-to-peer payments app Cash App, scaled its lending products and accelerated Square gross payment volume.
