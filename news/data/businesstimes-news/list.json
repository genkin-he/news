Asian buyers – which take roughly a quarter of their LNG from Qatar, the world’s second-largest exporter – have been calling suppliers to check if alternative cargoes are available, said traders. Egypt, meanwhile, is trying to bring forward shipments, after supplier Israel shuttered some fields.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Any naval activity in the Straits of Homuz will be particularly bullish, as will any developments with Qatari LNG production,” said Tom Marzec-Manser, director of Europe LNG and gas at Wood Mackenzie.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 created unprecedented turmoil in the international gas trade, cutting Moscow off from its largest export market, fueling volatility and triggering a record spike in prices in Europe and elsewhere.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Asia is particularly vulnerable to similar ripple effects from the Middle East’s worsening crisis. More than four-fifths of Qatar’s LNG was delivered to Asian buyers last year, with China the biggest purchaser, taking almost a third of its imports from the country. India is the second-largest importer.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Shipments to Asia – and the Europe – must pass through the Strait of Hormuz. So far, at least 11 LNG tankers going to or from Qatar have paused voyages to avoid the waterway, indicated ship-tracking data. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Smaller exporter the United Arab Emirates (UAE) also sends its LNG exports through the Strait.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“There is no replacement,” Anne-Sophie Corbeau, a researcher at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, said in a post on LinkedIn.  “Will prices spike more in Asia or in Europe? Europe is less exposed, but has low storage levels. It also depends on how much is diverted to Asia.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Qatar exported 82.2 million tons of LNG in 2025. One of the production units at Qatar’s Ras Laffan complex was undergoing planned maintenance as at last week, said the traders, which will contribute to lower flows. They asked not to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nippon Yusen, a major Japanese LNG shipowner and manager, has instructed its affiliated ships to avoid the area around the Strait of Hormuz, said a company spokesperson. Mitsui OSK Lines, another large Japanese LNG shipowner, has instructed vessels to wait in safe waters, while Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha confirmed it had ordered vessels in the Persian Gulf to stand by.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">If the conflict drags on and shipping disruptions continue, risks will grow rapidly for LNG output, which requires steady exports to move fuel through the facility – or risk forcing output cuts.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Chinese importers are among those making last-minute calls this weekend to weigh up alternative supplies if Iranian efforts to curb shipping are sustained, traders said, though QatarEnergy has not delayed any shipments to its buyers. QatarEnergy did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside usual business hours.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Traders in India, Japan and elsewhere are also bracing for higher prices, reversing over a year of relatively subdued rates at a time of ample new supply. And it is not just spot prices – long-term LNG contracts are usually linked to crude benchmarks, so an increase in Brent oil will also make gas more expensive for Asian consumers.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“If tensions in the Middle East intensify or become prolonged, restrictions on tanker navigation and other factors could affect supply to Japan,” Jera, Japan’s largest LNG buyer, said in a statement. “We will continue to make every effort to secure flexible fuel procurement”, leveraging the capabilities of its trading arm.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Another potential pressure point will be Turkey, which imports pipeline gas from Iran. Like Egypt, the country may be forced to buy more LNG if key flows are curtailed as a result of the ongoing conflict, adding more upward pressure to prices for super-chilled seaborne gas shipments.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Iran exports gas to Turkey via a 9.6 billion cubic metres per year contract, even though actual volumes delivered have recently dipped below those quantities, indicated Columbia’s CGEP. Supplies from Teheran made up less than 15 per cent of the country’s gas imports in 2024, said data from the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. BLOOMBERG</p></div>",
