            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Dan Morehead, founder and managing partner of Pantera Capital, believes now is an excellent time to invest in cryptocurrency for those with a multi-year investment horizon.</p>\n<p>In an interview with CNBC, Morehead pointed out that crypto is currently trading at a 50% discount to its long-term trend, placing it at its seventh percentile value against an eight-year trend average—meaning 93% of the time historically, crypto has been priced higher than it is today.</p>\n<p>Morehead highlighted what he sees as a compelling relative value opportunity between crypto and artificial intelligence stocks. “We track an index of the top 10 AI companies, and they’re trading about 20% over their long-term trend, and crypto’s trading at a 50% discount to its long-term trend,” he explained. “So as a kind of relative value investor, I think crypto is very cheap relative to AI at this point.”</p>\n<p>The former CFO and head of macro trading at Tiger Management noted that Bitcoin follows a predictable four-year cycle tied to its halving events, when the number of new bitcoins issued gets cut in half. He pointed to Pantera’s accurate forecast from several years ago that predicted Bitcoin would hit $117,482 on a specific date in August 2025. “It did that day,” Morehead confirmed, though he acknowledged the subsequent pullback was also expected.</p>\n<p>Regarding how far Bitcoin could fall, Morehead observed that the severity of downturns has been decreasing with each cycle. “The first cycle… it was 87%, then it was 80%, then 74% loss. Now it’s at 50,” he said, suggesting the current correction’s floor is likely around $50,000 to $60,000. “But again, if you have a multiyear time frame, these are great prices.”</p>\n<p>Morehead also expressed caution about traditional markets, noting that the Federal Reserve “has flooded so much liquidity in the markets” and that “everything is pretty rich.” He specifically mentioned that bonds are trading 50 basis points below their fifty-year average on real rates, while the Nasdaq appears “fully valued” to him.</p>\n<p>Beyond Bitcoin, Morehead emphasized the importance of portfolio diversification within crypto, noting that Pantera maintains a large position in Solana despite its recent decline. He also highlighted real-world blockchain applications, citing the example of $20 billion in mortgages already placed on blockchain technology, which is reducing spreads between borrowers and lenders by over 100 basis points.</p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

He also noted, \"On a non-GAAP basis, we generated $2.6 million of net income, marking our third consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability.\"</li>\n<li>PAR secured a decade-long partnership with Papa Johns for 3,200 sites, with Singh indicating further expansion opportunities: \"We anticipate increasing our partnership with Papa Johns in the future with both expansion to select international markets and continued expansion within our platform.\"</li>\n<li>Singh announced new AI products, including Coach AI and PAR Drive AI, stating, \"Our first AI product, Coach AI is now being utilized by nearly 1,000 stores with roughly 1,000 active users,\" and described significant enhancements with \"prescriptive operator recommendations.\"</li>\n<li>CFO Bryan Menar stated, \"We closed out 2025 with our most successful quarter in recent history. From our strong bookings, incremental ARR of $17 million and down through to our $7 million adjusted EBITDA.\"</li>\n<li>Menar reported, \"Subscription Services continue to fuel our organic growth and represented 63% of total Q4 revenue. The growth from higher-margin revenue streams resulted in a consolidated non-GAAP gross margin of $61 million, an increase of $8 million or 16%, compared to Q4 prior year.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Singh indicated, \"We expect ARR to continue to grow in the mid-teens. And similar to last year, the net growth will be more muted in the first half of the year versus the second half.\"</li>\n<li>He outlined plans to \"eliminate roughly $15 million annualized OpEx through AI-driven automation and the natural synergies of operating at our scale by the end of Q1.\"</li>\n<li>Singh said, \"You should expect for us to deploy parts of our operational expense savings into AI platform production.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>PAR reported total revenues of $120 million for Q4 2025, an increase of 14% compared to the same period in 2024, with subscription service revenue growth of 18%.</li>\n<li>Net loss from continuing operations for Q4 was $21 million, or $0.51 loss per share.

Non-GAAP subscription service margin for Q4 was 65.8%, and excluding a fixed product contract, reached 71%.</li>\n<li>Operating expenses excluding non-GAAP adjustments were $54 million, up 15% year-over-year, driven mainly by increased R&amp;D investment.</li>\n<li>As of year-end, cash and cash equivalents stood at $80 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>George Sutton, Craig-Hallum: Asked about Singh's confidence and the acceleration of enterprise AI deals. Singh responded, \"My excitement is really in the AI investments and the AI excitement from our customers... AI is an operational imperative for them.\"</li>\n<li>Mayank Tandon, Needham: Asked about restaurant market conditions and ARR guidance. Singh responded, \"This is a complicated environment for restaurants... we think it's a perfect environment to sell, and we think it's even a more perfect environment to use AI.\"</li>\n<li>Stephen Sheldon, William Blair: Queried about customer willingness to make software changes and R&amp;D investments. Singh said, \"It's a great environment right now to be in our category... the pipeline created from the large enterprise, but the medium enterprise... are moving as well.\"</li>\n<li>Jeremy Sahler, Jefferies: Asked about ARPU at Papa Johns and ARR growth mix. Singh said, \"It's market pricing for us... As far as future opportunities, we sort of see 2 direct potential opportunities... upselling the brand on other products... and international expansion.\"</li>\n<li>Andrew Harte, BTIG: Inquired about share buyback and growth visibility. Singh said, \"We want to have the optionality to return capital to our investors in every which way possible... the majority of our plan for the year is pretty much there.\"</li>\n<li>Charles Nabhan, Stephens: Asked about supply chain impacts. Singh stated, \"We're not seeing any impact yet on the revenue side... But we are seeing on the cost side, where our margins were mid-20s, I think we expect margins will be 20%, 21%.\"</li>\n<li>Maxwell Michaelis, Lake Street: Asked about investment in the Bridg acquisition and M&amp;A priorities. Singh replied, \"Of course, we're going to invest in it, but... it is not going to be a cash burn within Bridg... M&amp;A is lower on the priority list given where our stock price is.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts expressed cautious optimism, focusing on AI adoption, growth visibility, and profitability, but pressed for clarity around guidance and supply chain impacts.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone in prepared remarks and Q&amp;A, repeatedly emphasizing their AI strategy and operational resilience. Singh stated, \"We have never felt more confident about our positioning and the opportunity set in front of us.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, the tone remained optimistic, but current commentary placed increased emphasis on AI-driven transformation and upcoming cost efficiencies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance language shifted to emphasize mid-teens ARR growth and OpEx reductions through AI automation, compared to a prior focus on growth momentum and backlog.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus moved further toward AI-native product development and multiproduct deals, with new wins in pizza and entertainment verticals.</li>\n<li>Management's tone remained confident, while analysts continued to probe for concrete evidence of AI's impact and profitability improvements.</li>\n<li>Key metrics showed steady revenue growth, higher ARR, and ongoing margin expansion, with additional detail on cost pressures and mitigation strategies this quarter.</li>\n<li>Analysts remained focused on ARR growth, margin trajectory, and the impact of AI investment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Singh highlighted ongoing cost pressures: \"We saw significant cost pressures on key components, including solid-state drives, memory and processors... tightening availability and creating elevated pricing across the broader compute supply chain.\"</li>\n<li>Management is pursuing mitigation through \"supplier diversification, product flexibility and the pricing discipline to ensure we can continue supporting customers.\"</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about supply chain impacts on hardware margins and the sustainability of growth amid broader market challenges.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>PAR Technology closed 2025 with record bookings, robust ARR growth, and its third consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability, fueled by strong momentum in AI-driven product innovation and multiproduct deals.
