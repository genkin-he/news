            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (DV) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Mark Zagorski opened the call by highlighting a \"strong 38% adjusted EBITDA margin and 8% year-over-year growth in revenue,\" noting that revenue came in below expectations due to late-quarter retail campaign pullbacks from agency-related changes. He emphasized \"exceptional strength across multiple sectors in the fourth quarter, including health care and technology\" and pointed out \"no new deactivations among our Top 100 customers in Q4 and usage across social and streaming TV continues to scale.\"</li>\n<li>Zagorski stated, \"Social activation accelerated meaningfully growing at approximately 60% year-over-year in Q4 and starting 2026 at an even stronger year-over-year growth rate.\" He also reported \"Authentic AdVantage on YouTube is entering the year with $8 million of expected ACV\" and that CTV measurement impression volumes were \"up 22% for the quarter.\"</li>\n<li>He elaborated on product innovation, explaining, \"Our product innovation in 2025 harnessed the power of AI to expand TAM, improved solution efficacy and drove stronger margins and also helped deliver solid results that will set the stage for future growth.\"</li>\n<li>Zagorski discussed share repurchases: \"As of today, we have $300 million authorized for share repurchases, the largest amount in DV's history, which we plan to actively deploy in 2026 at increased levels versus prior years.\"</li>\n<li>CFO Nicola Allais reported, \"For the fourth quarter, revenue was $206 million, representing 8% year-over-year growth. For the full year, revenue was $748 million, representing 14% year-over-year growth despite variability driven by the retail sector in the second half.\"</li>\n<li>Allais noted, \"In the fourth quarter, activation revenue increased 6% year-over-year and measurement revenue increased 8% year-over-year, both driven primarily by Social.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Allais guided, \"For the first quarter, we expect revenue to range between $177 million and $183 million, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 9% at the midpoint and adjusted EBITDA to range between $48 million and $52 million.\"</li>\n<li>For full year 2026, \"we expect revenue to range between $810 million and $826 million, representing an 8% to 10% year-over-year increase.\"</li>\n<li>Allais described the growth drivers: \"Incremental growth in 2026 off the base will be driven by 3 product-led growth engines: first, adoption and scale deployment of the recently launched solutions across Social and Streaming TV; second, incremental revenue growth from existing enterprise clients scaling across our product offering; and third, continued new customer acquisition driven by DV's differentiated MAP product vision.\"</li>\n<li>She added, \"We expect adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 34%\" for 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Allais stated, \"In the fourth quarter, total advertiser revenue, which includes activation and measurement grew 7% year-over-year driven by 8% growth in volume or MTM, partially offset by a 3% decline in price or MTF.\"</li>\n<li>\"Fourth quarter activation revenue grew 6%, with ABS representing 52% of activation revenue in the quarter.\"</li>\n<li>\"Measurement revenue grew 8% year-over-year, with Social measurement revenue increasing 11% and representing 49% of measurement revenue and international revenue increasing 5% and representing 29% of measurement revenue.\"</li>\n<li>\"For the full year, we achieved a net revenue retention rate of 109%, and gross revenue retention remained above 95% for the fifth consecutive year.\"</li>\n<li>Free cash flow was reported as \"approximately $173 million, representing a conversion rate of approximately 70%, up from 61% in 2024.\"</li>\n<li>\"We ended 2025 with approximately 162 million shares outstanding, approximately $260 million in cash and no long-term debt.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Matthew Swanson, RBC Capital Markets, asked about the AI revolution and product cycle. CEO Zagorski responded, \"We're early first inning. Like we're just scratching the surface right now, which makes it so exciting. As we noted, we see AI as nothing but a huge opportunity for DV.\"</li>\n<li>Swanson also inquired about bundling strategy (MAP). Zagorski answered, \"It's been a really solid response to our first integrated product, which is Authentic AdVantage. That's for YouTube that is bundling together prebid social filtering plus post-bid measurement plus optimization on YouTube. That helped drive Social Activation to 60% growth year-over-year.\"</li>\n<li>Matthew Condon, Citizens JMP Securities, asked about Q4 spend pullbacks and Q1 confidence. CFO Allais explained, \"What happened at the end of the quarter is related to the retail vertical...additional pullback from specific customers that were going through agency changes. That was not something that we had anticipated when we had given the Q4 guidance.\"</li>\n<li>Condon also asked about accelerating social activation. Zagorski replied, \"There's always a testing process...as it gets more accurate, as it gets to be a more effective arbiter of eliminating waste and finding challenges on those platforms, it's easier uptake for us.\"</li>\n<li>Alexander Vegliante, Goldman Sachs, inquired about investments. Zagorski replied, \"We're actually looking to stabilize or decrease [headcount] over time. The efficiencies that we're getting out of AI tools have been exceptional.\"</li>\n<li>Brian Pitz, BMO, asked about CPG recovery. Allais stated, \"CPG did well. As you'll recall, we had one client at the beginning of the year, suspending its service with us. But the category did well because we acquired clients in 2024 that scaled into 2025.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts displayed a slightly positive tone, frequently referencing excitement about AI opportunities, product bundling strategies, and the pace of adoption in social and CTV, while probing on retail softness and growth levers.</li>\n<li>Management’s sentiment was confident during prepared remarks: \"We have confidence in the performance of our business and our priorities are clear: deepen adoption of core products with core customers, accelerate the growth of our solutions for Social, Streaming TV and AI, and drive industry-leading margins by leveraging the power of AI.\" During Q&amp;A, management maintained a constructive tone but acknowledged challenges in retail and pricing.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, overall sentiment remained optimistic but with a greater emphasis on diversification and efficiency gains from AI.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The company maintained strong EBITDA margin performance, with Q4 at 38% and a full-year margin guidance increase to 34% for 2026 versus 33% in previous guidance.</li>\n<li>Social activation ramped up, with growth accelerating from 20% in Q3 to 60% in Q4, and CTV measurement volumes growth of 22% in Q4 versus 30% in Q3.</li>\n<li>Retail sector softness persisted but was more pronounced in Q4, as opposed to the broader but less acute pressure described in Q3.</li>\n<li>Management’s tone shifted to stress diversification across sectors and products, while analysts maintained focus on product adoption and potential for upside from new solutions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited \"further pullbacks of a customer campaign spend late in the quarter, primarily due to agency-related changes\" as an unexpected headwind.</li>\n<li>Persisting retail softness and pricing pressure continue to impact results, reflected in a 3% decline in MTF.</li>\n<li>The company expects \"volumes to remain the primary driver of growth in 2026\" while monitoring sector diversification to offset retail volatility.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised questions about the speed of product adoption, retail sector headwinds, and the impact of pricing dynamics.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>DoubleVerify’s Q4 2025 results highlighted strong margins, robust product innovation across social, streaming TV, and AI, and efficient capital allocation. Management projects 8%–10% revenue growth for 2026, supported by a diversified product portfolio and continued sectoral expansion beyond retail. The company remains focused on accelerating adoption of new solutions, driving operational efficiencies through AI, and actively deploying its increased share repurchase authorization to enhance shareholder value.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/dv/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Willdan Group, Inc. (WLDN) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Michael Bieber, CEO, stated that \"We closed 2025 with record financial performance and strong momentum across our business. For 2025, both contract and net revenue grew greater than 20%, led by our energy work. Adjusted EBITDA grew 40%, and yearly margins expanded to above our 20% target for the first time in 2025.\" He highlighted $71 million of free cash flow and a net cash position, attributing organic net revenue growth of 17% largely to expansion with existing customers. Bieber emphasized that \"electric load growth has returned to the United States after about 15 years of stagnation\" and that AI and data centers are driving electricity demand at unprecedented levels.</li>\n<li>Bieber explained that the company is seeing strong demand from utilities, state and local governments, and commercial customers, with commercial clients—especially data centers—now accounting for 11% of revenue and described as \"the most fertile business environment we serve.\" He also pointed to a robust acquisition pipeline entering 2026.</li>\n<li>Creighton Early, CFO, stated, \"For the fourth quarter of 2025, contract revenue increased 21% to $174 million, and net revenue grew 13% to $89.5 million for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA also increased 13% compared to the prior year, totaling $20 million for the quarter, and adjusted earnings per share more than doubled to $1.57, which is $1.23 on a GAAP basis, aided by exceptional tax deductions from energy efficiency incentives under Section 179D.\" Early also noted, \"We ended the year with $66 million of unrestricted cash and a net positive cash position of $17 million, the first time since 2017 and effectively 0 leverage compared to the 0.3x EBITDA at the end of 2024.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Early stated, \"We expect net revenue in the range of $390 million to $405 million, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $85 million to $90 million and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share. These targets assume a full year effective tax benefit of approximately 10% and 15.8 million diluted shares outstanding. These numbers exclude any future acquisitions, though we expect to make acquisitions during the year, and our guidance will be updated accordingly.\"</li>\n<li>Bieber added, \"We have a particularly robust acquisition pipeline entering 2026 that will better enable us to serve customers in the future.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Willdan reported contract revenue of $174 million and net revenue of $89.5 million for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $20 million, and adjusted EPS was $1.57, with GAAP EPS of $1.23. For the full year, contract revenue reached $682 million, net revenue was $365 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $79.5 million. Net income more than doubled to $52.6 million, or $3.49 per diluted share GAAP, and adjusted EPS increased to $4.89. Gross profit increased 26.1% to $256 million, with gross margin expanding to 37.5% from 35.8% the prior year. Free cash flow for the year was $71 million.</li>\n<li>Early stated, \"We generated $80 million in cash flow from operations as continued improvements in working capital levels supplemented the strong earnings and $71 million in free cash flow or $4.69 per share in 2025.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Craig Irwin, ROTH Capital Partners: \"Your EPS guide of $4.50 to $4.70 is fantastic, but it is below the $4.93 last year... Can you maybe walk us through what your assumptions are for 179D in 2026...?\" Creighton Early: \"The 179D is set to expire at the end of June for this year. So that inability to carry that through to the end of the year means that we can only take advantage of that through projects that are started within the first 6 months of 2026, so that's the single biggest factor there.\"</li>\n<li>Irwin: \"When I look at this, I know your markets are helping in a big way, but... are there operating improvements that might be improving the fundamental profitability...?\" Michael Bieber: \"...over the last 5 years, is that we've moved up the value scale and are able to charge more for the work that we do... As we've grown the company, corporate costs are not growing at nearly the rate of the top line. So we think that's going to continue, and it's reflected in our guidance.\"</li>\n<li>Tim Moore, Clear Street LLC: \"Did you mention that you thought data centers could double in 2026 for revenue?\" Bieber: \"We were talking specifically about the APG acquisition that does that type of substation design and construction management for those data centers, and we are expecting that to more than double for us this year.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed on the sustainability of EPS growth, tax assumptions, and the trajectory of data center and utility demand, showing a neutral-to-slightly-positive tone as they acknowledged positive execution but probed on future risks and drivers.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone in both prepared remarks and responses, emphasizing continued margin expansion, strategic positioning, and a robust acquisition pipeline, though they acknowledged headwinds from tax incentives expiring.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, analysts' tone shifted slightly to a more cautious approach, focusing on guidance and the impact of expiring tax benefits, while management remained consistently confident but offered more granular explanations for future guidance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance for 2026 net revenue ($390M–$405M) and adjusted EPS ($4.50–$4.70) reflects a modest increase in revenue targets but a lower EPS projection, primarily due to the non-renewal of the 179D tax deduction after June 2026. The previous quarter's call raised 2025 guidance for net revenue to $360M–$365M and adjusted EPS to $4.10–$4.20.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus continues to shift toward commercial customers, particularly data centers, with management highlighting more than doubling of APG’s contribution in 2026 and a deliberate push to expand commercial sector capabilities.</li>\n<li>Analysts’ questions in both quarters revolved around growth sustainability, resource management, and execution risk, but the current quarter included more pointed questions about tax effects and margin durability.</li>\n<li>Management’s tone remained confident, but with increased emphasis on explaining the impacts of tax changes and acquisition strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The primary risk cited was the expiration of the 179D tax deduction at the end of June 2026, which will reduce some tax benefits for the remainder of the year.</li>\n<li>Management noted project mix changes, with fewer qualifying buildings in new contracts compared to prior periods, affecting the eligibility for tax incentives.</li>\n<li>Analyst concerns centered on the sustainability of EPS growth and margin improvement in light of these tax changes and the ability to maintain momentum in the commercial sector.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Willdan’s management underscored record financial performance in 2025, marked by double-digit revenue and profit growth, margin expansion, and strong cash flow. The company's 2026 outlook projects continued top-line growth and margin strength, supported by a growing backlog, increased activity in the commercial sector—especially data centers—and a robust acquisition pipeline. While EPS guidance is lower due to expiring tax incentives, management emphasized durable demand, scalable operations, and a strategic focus on higher-value work and commercial diversification as key drivers for sustained performance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/wldn/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
