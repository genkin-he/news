EPS of about $1.74 was below the consensus mark of $1.87, due in part to higher interest expenses and taxes. For 2026, Flutter (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FLUT\" title=\"Flutter Entertainment plc\">FLUT</a>) guided to about $18.4B of revenue at the midpoint vs. $19.1B consensus and roughly $3.0B of adjusted EBITDA.</p>\n<p>Notably, Flutter (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FLUT\" title=\"Flutter Entertainment plc\">FLUT</a>) management said a slowdown in betting handle was due in part to an unfavorable “recycling” issue in which persistent bookmaker-friendly sports results hurt customer activity and betting volume. Improved competition and elevated promotional activity across the industry were also factors as prediction market activity in the U.S. exploded during the quarter.</p>\n<p><span>In media interviews, Flutter (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FLUT\" title=\"Flutter Entertainment plc\">FLUT</a>) CEO Peter Jackson said the company thinks prediction markets could lead to more state legalization of sports betting. Of course, the big three of Texas, California, and Florida are at the top of the wish list. He also said the company has found no evidence that prediction markets are currently cannibalizing the sportsbook business.</span></p>\n<p>CBRE Equity Research analyst John DeCree and his team downgraded Flutter (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FLUT\" title=\"Flutter Entertainment plc\">FLUT</a>) to a Hold rating from Buy after taking in the results. The firm's price target of $145 assumes a 13X multiple on Flutter's U.S. business and an 8X multiple on its international business. \"This significant revision reflects a confluence of headwinds mounting over the past few months,\" updated DeCree. \"While we view the 4Q25 results and FY26 outlook as a clearing event, we are still moving to the sidelines until the dust settles. Investors will need time to reset expectations and re-underwrite the business. After such a sharp selloff, we don’t see a large enough catalyst on the horizon to reverse the momentum in the near term,\" he added.</p>\n<p>Shares of Flutter Entertainment (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FLUT\" title=\"Flutter Entertainment plc\">FLUT</a>) were down 13.0% in premarket trading to a 52-week low of $107.31. DraftKings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DKNG\" title=\"DraftKings Inc.\">DKNG</a>) slipped 1.8% during the early session.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
