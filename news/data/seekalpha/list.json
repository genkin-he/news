            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Fox Factory Holding Corp. (FOXF) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Michael Dennison stated the company is executing a comprehensive plan focused on improving profitability, shifting its guidance approach to lead with adjusted EBITDA. Dennison explained, “We have a comprehensive plan. We're executing against it, and we want to make sure you leave with a clear understanding of the building blocks and how they translate into meaningful improved margins.”</li>\n<li>Dennison highlighted the completion of Phase 1 of the profit optimization plan, delivering $25 million in savings through footprint optimization and supply chain improvements. He announced the start of Phase 2, which centers on business line rationalization, supply chain productivity, and significant reductions in operating expenses, targeting approximately $50 million of incremental savings in fiscal 2026.</li>\n<li>The CEO revealed the company is exiting non-accretive businesses, including the Phoenix, Arizona operations (Shock Therapy, Upfit UTV, Geiser), to improve margins and simplify the business model. “We are aggressively evaluating all noncore businesses and all product lines across the entire FOX portfolio and we'll pursue appropriate action where the return profile does not meet our expectations.”</li>\n<li>Dennison announced a reduction in CapEx spending, targeting approximately 2% of revenue in 2026, and the formation of a Board Transformation Committee to advise on further margin improvement opportunities.</li>\n<li>Regarding leadership, Dennison has assumed responsibility for AAG to drive critical actions as Dennis Schemm focuses on broader cost transformation as CFO.</li>\n<li>CFO Dennis Schemm stated, “Total consolidated net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 were $361.1 million, an increase of 2.3% versus the same quarter last year. Gross margin was 28.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 28.9% in the fourth quarter last year, with the decrease primarily driven by shifts in our product line mix and impact of tariffs.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The company introduced full year 2026 guidance reflecting a decline in top line expectation due to divestitures, product line rationalization, and a slightly down market while targeting meaningful margin expansion.</li>\n<li>Schemm outlined, “We expect full year 2026 net sales in the range of $1.328 billion to $1.416 billion, which at the midpoint represents a year-over-year decline of approximately 6.5% and is largely a combination of the divestitures, product line rationalization and a slightly down market that we mentioned. We are guiding to adjusted EBITDA in the range of $174 million to $203 million, which represents a margin of 13.7% at the midpoint or approximately 200 basis points of improvement relative to full year 2025.”</li>\n<li>First quarter 2026 net sales are expected in the range of $343 million to $369 million, with adjusted EBITDA of $27 million to $34 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjusted net income, normalizing for a $295.2 million noncash goodwill impairment, was $8.3 million or $0.20 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA was $35 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.7%.</li>\n<li>The company paid down $13 million of debt in the fourth quarter and $33 million for the year, bringing fiscal year-end debt to $673.5 million.</li>\n<li>CapEx was noted to have been over 3% of revenue but is projected to drop to about 2% in 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Peter McGoldrick, Stifel: Asked about the impact of divestitures on the organic business. Schemm responded that removing Geiser, Upfit UTV, and Shock Therapy will result in “a couple hundred basis points of improvement” in AAG margins and confirmed Marzocchi is not included in current divestiture plans.</li>\n<li>Anna Glaessgen, B. Riley Securities: Inquired about the rationale for divesting the Phoenix business. Dennison explained, “While they're great businesses, they are hard to own in our portfolio because of the draw on capital, the draw on SG&amp;A and the dilution in the margin for that time frame.”</li>\n<li>Glaessgen also asked for 2026 market expectations. Schemm clarified, “We are going to scale down the business through thoughtful divestitures and product line rationalization. That will be the bulk of that decrease of about 6.5% at the midpoint.”</li>\n<li>Scott Stember, ROTH Capital Partners: Asked about tariffs. Schemm stated, “In 2025 was $50 million of gross tariff impact. We were able to offset $25 million...going forward into 2026, we're estimating an additional $30 million of gross tariff impact, and we expect to mitigate about 50% of that.”</li>\n<li>Stember asked about leverage. Schemm said, “We are at 3.74 versus a covenant ratio of 4.5.”</li>\n<li>Craig Kennison, Baird: Asked about pursuing tariff refunds and divestiture proceeds. Dennison confirmed, “We will do everything possible to get a refund for sure” and proceeds will go to “debt reduction.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed for clarity on divestiture impacts, margin drivers, and tariff headwinds, reflecting a slightly negative to neutral tone. Questions focused on the rationale for business exits, the durability of cost savings, and market expectations.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and proactive tone, emphasizing execution and control. Dennison stated, “We're not simply managing through a cycle. We're fundamentally repositioning this company to deliver greater operating leverage.”</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management displayed increased urgency and detail regarding cost actions and margin improvement, with less emphasis on growth stories and more on restructuring.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The current quarter featured a significant strategic shift, with active divestitures and a focus on profitability versus the previous quarter’s emphasis on innovation and customer engagement.</li>\n<li>Guidance language changed from cautious optimism to explicit margin expansion targets and cost reduction commitments.</li>\n<li>Key metrics such as adjusted EBITDA margin are now central to the outlook, while top-line growth takes a secondary role.</li>\n<li>Analyst attention shifted from product launches and OEM partnerships to the implications of cost actions, divestitures, and tariff mitigation.</li>\n<li>Management’s tone moved from highlighting growth and operational improvements to a more urgent, action-oriented stance on profitability and portfolio optimization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited ongoing tariff impacts, projecting a $15 million net headwind in the first half of 2026 after mitigation efforts.</li>\n<li>Temporary aluminum supply disruptions impacted Q4 revenue by approximately $8 million, though these challenges are described as short term.</li>\n<li>The company faces ongoing margin pressures from tariffs, supply chain issues, and the complexities of business rationalization.</li>\n<li>Analysts questioned the sustainability of margin improvement and the risk of further divestitures affecting core business stability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Fox Factory is undertaking aggressive portfolio rationalization, cost-cutting, and margin expansion, targeting $50 million in cost reductions for 2026 and a 200 basis point increase in adjusted EBITDA margin. While the company expects a top-line decline due to divestitures and continued macro headwinds, management asserts these moves will provide a stronger foundation for future growth and improved leverage. The near-term focus is on profitability and operational efficiency, with leadership and the Board aligned on executing targeted actions and further evaluating noncore businesses.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/foxf/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: VTEX (VTEX) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Co-CEO Geraldo do Carmo Thomaz acknowledged that \"our recent growth has been below our long-term ambition,\" attributing this mainly to macro challenges in Brazil and Argentina, a more promotional marketplace environment, and longer enterprise decision cycles amid the evolving AI landscape.</li>\n<li>Thomaz emphasized the company's strategy is anchored in four growth levers: global expansion, B2B, retail media, and AI, stating, \"our focus now is disciplined execution.\" He highlighted that in Q4, these levers accounted for about 15% of subscription revenue and contributed nearly half of subscription revenue growth, with global markets delivering 22% subscription revenue growth in 2025.</li>\n<li>The company reported notable client wins and expansions, including Atacado Vila Nova, Lofty Style, Luz da Lua, and TCL in Brazil, as well as Mercacentro in Colombia and Whirlpool launching KitchenAid in Canada.</li>\n<li>CFO Ricardo Sodre stated, \"2025 demonstrated the resilience of our business model and the strengthen of our unit economics,\" with continued efficiency gains and record profitability despite a slower growth environment.</li>\n<li>Sodre also noted, \"we are announcing a new $50 million 12-month share repurchase program for Class A shares.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management targets Q1 2026 subscription revenue to grow at a mid-single-digit percentage rate on an FX-neutral year-over-year basis.</li>\n<li>For the full year 2026, VTEX is targeting subscription revenue to grow at a mid- to high single-digit percentage rate on an FX-neutral basis, with gross profit expected to grow at a high single-digit to low teens percentage rate. Non-GAAP income from operations is targeted in the low 20s percentage margin, and free cash flow in the low 20s percentage margin.</li>\n<li>Sodre explained, \"Assuming FX rates remain broadly consistent with January 2026 averages, the FX-neutral growth guidance outlined above would translate into higher reported USD subscription revenue growth, adding approximately 8.4 percentage points in the first quarter and 4.5 percentage points in the full year 2026.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>GMV reached $6.3 billion in Q4 2025, representing 17.2% year-over-year growth in U.S. dollars and 10.0% in FX-neutral terms.</li>\n<li>Subscription revenue for Q4 was $66.7 million, a 12.2% increase year-over-year in U.S. dollars and 5.4% in FX-neutral terms.</li>\n<li>Subscription gross profit was $54.6 million, with a subscription gross margin of 81.8%, up from 78.8% the prior year. Total gross margin reached 79.6%.</li>\n<li>Operating expenses totaled $38 million, with income from operations of $16.2 million and an operating margin of 23.8%.</li>\n<li>Free cash flow for the quarter was $11.1 million. The company cited a $2 million severance cost due to a sales and marketing reorganization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Unknown Analyst, JPMorgan: Asked if there is a turning point on elongated sales cycles and about the source of gross margin gains. Mariano Gomide de Faria responded, \"what we were seeing is not a deterioration in competitiveness, but a clear elongation of sales cycle... The primary driver is what we call the AI wait-and-see effect.\" Sodre clarified, \"we gained roughly 3 percentage points in subscription gross margin this quarter... this is basically all AI-driven.\"</li>\n<li>Lucca Brendim, BofA Securities: Inquired about AI risks and capital allocation. Thomaz described AI as a \"structural shift comparable to the move to the cloud,\" emphasizing VTEX’s role as the \"mission-critical orchestration layer of AI-driven commerce.\" Sodre said, \"We prioritize long-term value creation while maintaining the flexibility to navigate a dynamic macro environment.\"</li>\n<li>Rafael Oliveira, UBS: Asked about drivers for revenue growth reacceleration and the B2B pipeline. Thomaz stated, \"Q4 of 2025 subscription revenue growth of 5.4% FX-neutral reflect a cyclical slowdown... our structural foundations have never been stronger.\" On B2B, Mariano added, \"roughly half of our deals in the U.S. and EMEA are now B2B related.\"</li>\n<li>Madison Schrage, KeyBanc: Asked about global expansion priorities and AI in discoverability. Mariano explained, \"recently, precisely in December, we changed a lot of our regional approaches\" to a \"functional-oriented org chart,\" moving away from region-based management.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns around elongated sales cycles, AI’s impact, macro headwinds, and the company's ability to reaccelerate growth, with a tone that was probing but not overtly negative.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a measured and confident tone in prepared remarks and Q&amp;A, consistently highlighting discipline and strategic execution. Thomaz used phrases like \"we are well-positioned competitively\" and \"we believe we have the right tools.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, analyst tone remained focused on macro headwinds and AI’s role, while management showed increased emphasis on execution and R&amp;D investment for AI transformation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The guidance for Q1 and FY 2026 is consistent with the previous quarter’s focus on mid- to high single-digit FX-neutral subscription revenue growth and profitability, but now includes more explicit targets for gross profit and margin.</li>\n<li>There is a greater emphasis on AI as both a product differentiator and operational efficiency driver, with a reported 3 percentage point gross margin gain attributed to AI in the current quarter.</li>\n<li>Management’s tone reveals stronger confidence in the sustainability of profitability, with a new $50 million share repurchase program as a signal of capital discipline.</li>\n<li>Analysts’ questions continued to revolve around macro challenges, sales cycles, AI adoption, and B2B pipeline, with little change in fundamental concerns.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management identified macroeconomic challenges in Brazil and Argentina, elongated enterprise sales cycles due to \"AI wait-and-see effect,\" and a more promotional marketplace environment as key risks.</li>\n<li>The company noted that 60% of revenue is from take rates on customer GMV, making net revenue retention sensitive to same-store sales growth, which saw a decline due to softer consumer spending.</li>\n<li>Management is mitigating these risks through sales and marketing reorganization, increased R&amp;D for AI products, and ongoing operational discipline.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>VTEX’s leadership emphasized a disciplined approach to execution, underscored by resilient profitability and a clear focus on leveraging AI, B2B, retail media, and global expansion to drive future growth. Management reiterated that, while macro headwinds remain, the company’s operational improvements, AI-driven margin gains, and targeted capital allocation—highlighted by a new share repurchase program—position VTEX to gradually reaccelerate growth and deepen its strategic relevance for enterprise customers in the coming quarters.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/vtex/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: SoundHound AI, Inc. (SOUN) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Keyvan Mohajer, Co-Founder, CEO, President &amp; Director, reported, “2025 was a record year for SoundHound, nearly doubling our revenue year-over-year. We also had a record fourth quarter. Revenue was up 59%, while all key profit metrics improved.” He highlighted that SoundHound signed over 100 customer deals in Q4, including major agreements with a Japanese automotive OEM for its AI assistant, a multiyear deal with a leading U.S. telecommunications company, and a global contract with a top athletic shoes and apparel brand. Mohajer emphasized SoundHound’s Agentic platform as “the only solution that is ready to be deployed across a multitude of vertical use cases and a huge and growing range of touch points,” allowing clients to build an agent once and deploy it anywhere.</li>\n<li>Notable wins in Q4 spanned automotive, restaurants, retail, health care, insurance, government, and education, including new partnerships and renewals across regions. Mohajer stated, “We are seeing great traction because our technology is delivering real-world results.” He cited specific customer outcomes such as a large health care network’s AI agent handling more than a third of all patient appointment scheduling and a telecommunications customer achieving a 20% reduction in labor costs for billing disputes.</li>\n<li>Nitesh Sharan, Chief Financial Officer, said, “Q4 was our strongest quarter with $55.1 million in revenue, up 59% and improvements across all profit measures. For the full year, we delivered $169 million in revenue, up 99% versus the prior year.” He noted, “Our monthly active users continue to expand rapidly with Q4 growth in excess of 50% year-on-year. More notably, their query activity or usage continues to accelerate with Q4 audio queries up roughly 75% from the prior year.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sharan shared, “For 2026, we expect our revenue to be in a range of $225 million to $260 million. As in prior years, there will be a ramp in revenue through the year given the nature of our customer base, underlying seasonality, and expected large deal timing, both for renewals and new deals.” He reiterated the company’s commitment to profitable growth and noted, “We remain committed to delivering accelerated growth while being mindful of the journey to profitability.”</li>\n<li>Sharan also stated, “Our long-term expectation is that we can operate this business at scale with 70% plus gross margins and 30% plus EBIT margins.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Q4 revenue was $55.1 million, up 59% year-over-year, with enterprise AI, restaurants, and automotive verticals highlighted as growth drivers. For the full year, revenue reached $169 million, nearly doubling from the prior year.</li>\n<li>Sharan reported, “Our GAAP gross margin was 48% and adjusted for noncash amortization of purchase intangibles and employee stock compensation, our non-GAAP gross margin was 61%.” Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $7.4 million, an improvement of 56% year-over-year. GAAP net income was $40.1 million and GAAP net earnings per share of $0.10, positively impacted by a change in fair value of contingent liabilities. Non-GAAP net loss was $7.3 million and non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.02.</li>\n<li>The balance sheet showed cash and equivalents at quarter end of $248 million with no debt.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Scott Buck, H.C. Wainwright &amp; Co.: Asked about deployment and customer service capacity constraints. Mohajer answered, “We are definitely doing a lot… advances in AI… allow us to deploy faster, go live faster, develop faster. And we are able to keep up with the demand with fewer people and less resources. So demand is going up and what we need to do… is actually going down.”</li>\n<li>Buck followed up on renewals and upselling. Mohajer said, “These renewals are actually an upsell moment because we bring them the Agentic solution… it's basically the renewal with a price increase and sometimes with a bigger volume commitment.”</li>\n<li>Brian Schwartz, Oppenheimer: Inquired about the durability of enterprise AI with LLM competition. Mohajer responded that automation is disrupting traditional software and services but is a tailwind for SoundHound, enabling faster and higher quality delivery. Schwartz asked about investment profile; Sharan said, “We are now shifting from… heavy investment… to this era of breakeven… every incremental dollar point, that should go into fueling growth, but we need to be mindful that we're going to do it efficiently.”</li>\n<li>Vijay Devar (for Mike Latimore, Northland): Queried about Amelia customers on Agentic AI version 7.3 and revenue impact. Sharan said, “We assume that we kind of are on a pathway to get the majority -- vast majority, I think, over 75% migrated over by the middle of this year.” Mohajer added, “Just a pure higher containment rate is expected to increase our revenue. Many of our deals, we get paid when we successfully avoid a caller to go to a human.”</li>\n<li>James Fish, Piper Sandler: Asked how Amelia wins new CX customers over competitors. Mohajer highlighted SoundHound’s deep technology, data, and multi-industry partnerships, stating, “By choosing SoundHound, they are more guaranteed to get the best as soon as it becomes available, no matter where it comes from.” Fish also asked about M&amp;A in guidance and stock-based comp; Sharan replied, “No, our guidance does not contemplate M&amp;A that we haven't done… Our outlook reflects the base of business, the pipeline of deals… we will… update an outlook, we will certainly do that like we have in the past.” On stock comp, Sharan said equity is broadly distributed, and dilution is a consideration, but expects normalization as the company scales.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts focused on deployment capacity, durability against LLM competition, upsell dynamics, customer migration, pricing, and M&amp;A strategy. Their tone was inquisitive and occasionally skeptical, especially around competitive threats and cost structure.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and assertive stance, often emphasizing efficiency, technological leadership, and market traction. During Q&amp;A, responses remained detailed and direct, with statements like, “We are able to keep up with the demand with fewer people and less resources.”</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both management and analysts’ tone is slightly more confident, with management highlighting record performance and an improved path to profitability while analysts probed for risks but acknowledged strong results.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance for 2026 revenue increased to $225 million–$260 million, compared to the previous year’s range and a strong Q4 performance. The company reiterated the transition to a breakeven phase, highlighting operational efficiencies and cost discipline.</li>\n<li>Management’s tone is more optimistic, citing record customer wins and diversified revenue sources. Analysts’ focus shifted from concerns about automotive softness and integration of acquisitions to exploring expansion capacity and competitive differentiation.</li>\n<li>Gross margin and profitability metrics improved sequentially. The company reported stronger customer diversification and no single customer contributing more than 10% of revenue.</li>\n<li>Strategic priorities remain on Agentic AI, voice commerce, and continued expansion across industries and regions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management acknowledged resource allocation across expanding verticals but cited AI advances as a mitigating factor for scaling efficiently.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised questions about capacity, pricing, competitive threats from large LLM providers, and stock-based compensation dilution.</li>\n<li>Mohajer and Sharan described mitigation strategies, including upselling existing customers, leveraging proprietary technology, focusing on outcome-based pricing, and maintaining a disciplined approach to M&amp;A.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>SoundHound closed 2025 with record revenue growth and a strong pipeline, driven by broad adoption of its Agentic AI platform and deeper expansion into key verticals. The company projects 2026 revenue between $225 million and $260 million and expects operational efficiencies and customer migration to advanced AI solutions to further fuel growth. Management underscored its commitment to profitability, innovation, and delivering outcome-based value to customers, positioning SoundHound for continued momentum in the evolving AI landscape.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/soun/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
