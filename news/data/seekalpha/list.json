We are strategically increasing headcount to support growth while generating solid utilization and strong rate realization, reflecting our differentiation in the marketplace,” commented Richard Schlenker, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “As we close out 2025, we are maintaining our revenue guidance and raising our margin guidance for the full year. Looking ahead, our conviction in Exponent’s long-term growth trajectory remains steadfast, as reflected in the Board of Directors’ recent approval to increase our share repurchase authorization.”</p>\n<p>Exponent is returning to a 13-week fiscal fourth quarter in 2025, which poses a headwind for comparisons since Q4 of fiscal 2024 benefited from a 14th week.

Exponent is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these enduring and powerful trends, driving long-term growth and value creation for our stakeholders,” concluded Dr. Corrigan.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</body></html>",
