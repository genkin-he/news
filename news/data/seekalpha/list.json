That followed the stock's 44% plunge on Wednesday, sparked by a strategy and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510095-fiserv-shakes-up-leadership-board-after-big-q3-earnings-miss-stock-plunges-30\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"eadership revamp and slashed guidance\">leadership revamp and slashed guidance</a> for Q4 2025.</p>\n<p>Bloomberg News, citing people familiar with the matter, reported on Thursday that those small business customers were looking for cheaper alternatives, such as Toast (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TOST\" title=\"Toast, Inc.\">TOST</a>) or Block's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XYZ\" title=\"Block, Inc.\">XYZ</a>) Square systems, to handle their point-of-sale payments.</p>\n<p>What's more, former CEO Frank Bisignano based a good part of his guidance for the company's future growth on Clover outperforming rivals, the article <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-30/fiserv-s-30-billion-wipeout-came-after-client-revolt-over-fees\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"said.\">said.</a></p>\n<p>Once Mike Lyons succeeded Bisignano as CEO, he launched his own in-depth analysis of the company's merchant and banking businesses. As a result, Fiserv (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FI\" title=\"Fiserv, Inc.\">FI</a>) reset expectations when it released Q3 earnings and unveiled its One Fiserv initiative to refocus on the client. Part of that plan means rolling back fees it introduced in last year's Q4 because they're <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834633-fiserv-inc-fi-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\" title=' \"no longer consistent '> \"no longer consistent </a>with our business strategy,\" Lyons said during the company's earnings call.</p>\n<p>In other words, the company has shifted to the long game instead of making a quick buck to juice the current quarter's results. \"We have made the decision to deprioritize these short-term revenue and expense initiatives, which, of course, has some near-term impact on our growth and profitability,\" the CEO said.</p>\n<p>Bisignano, though, doesn't think the goals he set were too high, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with his thinking.</p>\n<p>The new strategy means \"the revenue base is likely to be smaller, and the expense base will be bigger as Fiserv spends to address underinvestment in recent years,\" Goldman Sachs Will Nance wrote in a note to clients.</p>\n<p>Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette had sensed dissatisfaction with Clover's small and medium business (\"SMB\") customers in its survey from April but didn't give it sufficient weight at the time. \"Our SMB Survey from April clearly indicated that the Fiserv SMB customers were very unhappy with those price increases,\" with Clover solution having among the lowest satisfaction ratings from surveyed customers, he wrote in a note to clients. That \"translated into very high expected rates of switching vs. the rest of the peer group.\"</p>\n<p>The strategy and management overhaul announced on Wednesday also damaged investor trust, according to analysts.  At least three shops<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511340-fiserv-downgraded-at-morgan-stanley-goldman-sachs-to-hold-equivalent\" target=\"_blank\" title=\" have downgraded Fiserv \"> have downgraded Fiserv </a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FI\" title=\"Fiserv, Inc.\">FI</a>) to Hold-equivalent ratings from Buy. \"Management highlighted how FI has been over-earning with short-term revenue targets and deferred investments,\" said BTIG analyst Andrew Harte. \"We expect that detail to result in a long road ahead for rebuilding investor trust/confidence.\"</p>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Distribution Solutions Group (DSGR) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>CEO John King highlighted, \"Our third quarter results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business model, even as inflation, tariffs and higher interest rates continue to challenge parts of the U.S. economy.\" King stated the organization is actively driving initiatives for long-term profitability and growth, not waiting for market tailwinds. The company delivered 10.7% revenue growth, supported by strong organic sales and contributions from 2024 acquisitions, with average daily sales up 6%. He noted, \"This represents the fourth quarter in a row that we've realized an organic sales increase and puts our year-to-date organic sales increase at 4% over 2024.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>King reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.40 for the third quarter, an 8.1% increase year-over-year, and over $20 million in share buybacks during the first nine months of 2025. Operating cash flow exceeded $38 million for the quarter, and EBITDA reached $48.5 million. EBITDA margins were 9.4%, affected by product and customer mix as well as ongoing investments, but King expects margin improvement in future quarters.</p></li>\n<li><p>The CEO detailed strategic progress at TestEquity, citing the appointment of Barry Litwin, a new go-to-market strategy, leadership restructuring, and targeted investments in digital and e-commerce capabilities. He emphasized Gexpro Services' record quarter, organic revenue expansion of 11.4%, and growing customer interest, especially amid tariff-driven demand for domestic manufacturing.</p></li>\n<li><p>For Lawson, King acknowledged, \"Although we are not satisfied with our total sales performance for Lawson this quarter, we know that economic pressures have negatively influenced many of our customers this year.\" However, he cited positive momentum in sales force transformation, expanded CRM adoption, and growth in the 24/7 web platform.</p></li>\n<li><p>CFO Ronald Knutson stated, \"DSG's consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $518 million, a 10.7% increase. The $49.9 million increase was driven by a combination of strong organic daily sales increase of 6% and $23.3 million in revenue from our 2024 acquisitions.\" Knutson also reported, \"Adjusted EBITDA dollars were essentially flat versus the second quarter and 30 basis points lower, primarily due to product and customer mix shifts, strategic investments in the business and higher employee-related costs.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>King described a \"cautious outlook given tougher year-over-year comparisons\" for Q4 but noted, \"Business activity remains steady, and I remain confident in our leadership teams and their ability to execute on their respective value-driving initiatives.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>In the Q&amp;A, Knutson explained, \"We're not seeing any dramatic shifts, although as the third quarter developed, September was our strongest month within the quarter as well.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>DSG reported consolidated revenue of $518 million for Q3 2025. Adjusted EBITDA was $48.5 million, representing 9.4% of sales. Net income per diluted share (GAAP) was $0.14. Non-GAAP adjusted EPS was $0.40, up 8.1% year-over-year and up from $0.35 in Q2.</p></li>\n<li><p>Cash flow from operations was $38.4 million for the quarter. The company repurchased approximately 670,000 shares year-to-date, positively impacting EPS. Total liquidity at quarter-end was $335 million, and debt leverage stood at 3.5x.</p></li>\n<li><p>Segment highlights included: Lawson Q3 sales of $121.5 million and adjusted EBITDA of $14 million (11.5% of sales); Canadian segment sales of $60 million, with $5.8 million adjusted EBITDA (9.6% of sales); Gexpro Services revenue of $130.5 million and record adjusted EBITDA of $17.8 million (13.6% of sales); TestEquity sales of $206.5 million, adjusted EBITDA of $12.4 million (6% of sales).</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Thomas Moll, Stephens: Asked for clarification on Q4 outlook and organic pacing in October. Knutson responded that October's average daily sales are tempered due to more selling days but noted, \"We're not seeing any dramatic shifts...September was our strongest month within the quarter as well.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Moll inquired about consolidated EBITDA margin guidance versus the 9.4% just reported. Knutson indicated, \"...about 30 bps of that are investments that we're making into the -- that we continue to make into the organization... probably 80 bps of that more towards... timing or nonrecurring type of items.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Moll asked about Gexpro's growth durability. King said, \"Gexpro has got a pretty broad base of wallet share and new customer wins that it's continuing to enjoy... it feels very good, and it feels resilient.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Moll asked for an update on Lawson sales force initiatives. King acknowledged ongoing transformation, noting metrics are improving but onboarding of new sellers is slower than expected.</p></li>\n<li><p>Kenneth Newman, KeyBanc: Asked about tariff-based pricing benefits. King said, \"This quarter was -- had strong volume growth, not just revenue growth. And so that was for the first time across all of our verticals, we enjoyed volume growth again.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Newman followed up on labor-related margin headwinds at Lawson and TestEquity. King cited deliberate SG&amp;A investments to drive future growth.</p></li>\n<li><p>Kevin Steinke, Barrington: Asked about Canada branch margin sustainability. Knutson replied, \"Bolt continues to perform really well in that 13%, 14% margin rate... we should be above 10%. Again, we -- it's -- we're well on our way. We're not where we want to be yet.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Analysts expressed cautious optimism, frequently probing about margin sustainability and the pace of transformation, but did not display overt skepticism or negativity.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management maintained a confident and constructive tone in prepared remarks, shifting to detailed explanations and some acknowledgment of challenges in Q&amp;A, particularly regarding pace of sales force productivity and mix-driven margin pressures.</p></li>\n<li><p>Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone remained confident but with increased emphasis on near-term caution and operational headwinds, while analysts retained a neutral to slightly positive stance.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The company achieved higher revenue growth (10.7% in Q3 vs. 14.3% in Q2), though organic growth improved (6% in Q3 vs. 3.3% in Q2). Adjusted EBITDA margin was slightly lower in Q3 (9.4% vs. 9.7% in Q2), attributed to mix and investment costs.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management language shifted from highlighting sequential margin improvements in Q2 to more focus on ongoing investments and mix-driven headwinds in Q3.</p></li>\n<li><p>Analysts in both quarters focused on margin sustainability, transformation progress, and segment-specific drivers, but Q3 saw more questions about timing and pace of improvements.</p></li>\n<li><p>Strategic focus in Q3 included deeper investment in e-commerce, sales force, and integration initiatives, with continued emphasis on acquisition-driven growth and margin expansion.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Management cited inflation, tariffs, and higher interest rates as ongoing macroeconomic challenges.</p></li>\n<li><p>Investments in sales force expansion, leadership, and digital capabilities may introduce short-term margin pressure.</p></li>\n<li><p>Customer and product mix shifts continue to impact margins, particularly in TestEquity and Lawson.</p></li>\n<li><p>Analysts flagged the pace of sales force productivity improvements and mix-driven margin volatility as key concerns.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Management reiterated its confidence in the company’s ability to drive long-term value through disciplined execution of strategic initiatives, continued organic growth, and targeted investments in capabilities and acquisitions. The company remains focused on improving profitability, operational efficiency, and market positioning despite macroeconomic headwinds and anticipates margin expansion as recent and ongoing investments begin to yield returns.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/dsgr/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

Bevis stated, \"We've had no cancellations of any of these new wins, just some pushouts.\" He highlighted foundational wins in defense and medical, each potentially contributing over $5 million annually and noted the company is at \"the bottom of the bathtub curve for our served markets and customers.\"</li>\n<li>The company is actively pursuing strategic M&amp;A, evaluating multiple acquisition targets to accelerate growth and scale, while formally initiating refinancing discussions for its preferred equity. Bevis explained, \"We're getting ready to embark upon that now...any acquisition we do of any size at all requires a refinancing discussion.\"</li>\n<li>Quarterly sales were reported at $104 million, with growth in power solutions and aerospace, defense, and electronics offset by headwinds in mobile solutions and automotive rationalization.

Forecasted contribution is approximately $26 million for 2025 and an estimated $40 million at full run-rate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Robert Brown, Lake Street Capital: Asked about data center demand in power solutions and gross margin targets. Bevis responded that data center needs are driving grid demand, despite federal funding delays, and cited gold prices as a variable affecting margins.</li>\n<li>John Franzreb, Sidoti: Inquired about revenue forecast adjustments and facility rationalization impact. Bevis said rationalization will be a 2026 event with no 2025 sales impact. On capacity utilization, French indicated significant available capacity, with power at about 60% utilization and mobile varying by facility.</li>\n<li>Franzreb also asked about M&amp;A versus preferred elimination. Bevis stressed both are priorities, with no single path chosen and external advisory support being assembled.</li>\n<li>Michael Crawford, B. Riley: Queried about China operations and free cash flow expectations. Bevis described the China JV as successful, with $130 million in sales and over $30 million in EBITDA. Looking ahead, Bevis expects free cash flow to strengthen in 2026, targeting around $10 million absent the CARES refund.</li>\n<li>Barry Haimes, Sage Asset: Asked about 2026 expectations. Bevis described regional automotive growth variations and highlighted that foundational wins in medical and defense will support segment growth, with commercial vehicle improvement anticipated in the second half.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts maintained a constructive but cautious tone, focusing on segment performance, capital allocation, and execution of growth and cost initiatives. Questions sought clarity on guidance, margin drivers, and capacity, reflecting a neutral to slightly positive sentiment.</li>\n<li>Management's tone was confident in prepared remarks, frequently referencing progress and strategic wins. In Q&amp;A, responses became more detailed and occasionally cautious, especially when addressing sector headwinds and macro uncertainty. Bevis acknowledged, \"We're not at liberty to discuss the plant,\" and \"We're not sitting on a big pile of cash,\" indicating some defensiveness.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management maintained a similar level of confidence, but with heightened attention to mix shifts and external headwinds. Analysts' tone remained consistently inquisitive, with continued focus on execution and risk management.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The company reduced its sales outlook due to automotive softness but increased defense expectations. Portfolio mix shifts were highlighted as a mitigating factor for margins.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus has shifted further toward M&amp;A and refinancing activities, with management reporting meaningful progress in pipeline development and organization.</li>\n<li>Analysts continued to focus on margin expansion, capital structure optimization, and the ramp-up of new business, similar to the previous quarter.</li>\n<li>Adjusted EBITDA margins and free cash flow both improved sequentially, while leadership reiterated long-term margin targets and confidence in transformation programs.</li>\n<li>Management's tone in both quarters reflected ongoing confidence, but the current quarter showed increased transparency about macro risks and operational adjustments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited softness in the North American automotive market, volatility in electrical infrastructure funding, high inflation in precious metals, and commercial vehicle industry recalibration as ongoing headwinds.</li>\n<li>Mitigation efforts include cost reductions, working capital improvements, focused new business development, and continued rationalization of underperforming assets.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about the pace of M&amp;A, timing of facility rationalizations, and the impact of federal funding delays.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>NN, Inc. management underscored that while market headwinds and sector volatility persist, the company is driving margin and cash flow improvements through operational restructuring, disciplined cost management, and an aggressive new business acquisition program. With foundational wins in key growth sectors, ongoing strategic M&amp;A and refinancing initiatives, and a robust pipeline of program launches expected to deliver up to $40 million in new run-rate revenues, leadership maintains a positive outlook for sustainable value creation through 2026 and beyond.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/nnbr/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (MRK) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Robert Davis stated that \"We continue to make meaningful progress in using the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world,\" highlighting approximately 80 Phase III trials across diverse therapeutic areas and investments behind more than 20 launch opportunities. Davis noted the completion of the strategic acquisition of Verona Pharma and described it as providing \"another important growth driver with multibillion-dollar commercial potential into the next decade.\"</li>\n<li>Davis emphasized, \"We're making strong progress across the business, and I remain confident in our ability to further broaden our impact to patients and deliver long-term growth and value for shareholders.\" He also referenced ongoing engagement with the U.S. administration regarding healthcare policy and announced a \"broader plan that will result in the investment of more than $70 billion in expanded domestic manufacturing and R&amp;D.\"</li>\n<li>CFO Caroline Litchfield reported, \"Total company revenues were $17.3 billion, an increase of 4% or 3% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.\" Litchfield added, \"We delivered solid performance in the quarter, with growth driven by continued strength in Oncology and Animal Health as well as increasing contributions from our many new product launches.\" She confirmed EPS of $2.58 for the quarter and highlighted a gross margin of 81.9%, an increase of 1.4 percentage points.</li>\n<li>Litchfield provided guidance for 2025: \"We expect full year revenue to be between $64.5 billion and $65 billion,\" with EPS guidance of $8.93 to $8.98 and a gross margin assumption of approximately 82%.</li>\n<li>Executive VP Dean Li highlighted clinical and regulatory milestones, including FDA approval for KEYTRUDA QLEX and positive top line results from the CORALreef Lipids trial for enlicitide. He underscored the expansion of the immunology pipeline and described OHTUVAYRE, acquired through Verona, as a \"first-in-class dual phosphodiesterase 3 and 4 inhibitor for the maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Litchfield stated, \"We expect full year revenue to be between $64.5 billion and $65 billion,\" and EPS guidance of $8.93 to $8.98, noting the range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange and a benefit from the restructured agreement for Koselugo. The guidance now incorporates the Verona Pharma acquisition and the restructured Koselugo agreement. She added, \"As we look to 2026, we expect an acceleration in underlying operating expense growth driven by investments in both R&amp;D and SG&amp;A to fuel our pipeline and new launches, including more than $0.5 billion of investment to maximize the potential of OHTUVAYRE.\"</li>\n<li>Management maintained its commitment to its dividend and continued pace of share repurchases, expecting approximately $5 billion for the full year.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Revenues for the third quarter were $17.3 billion. Oncology sales, led by KEYTRUDA, increased 8% to $8.1 billion, with growth from both metastatic and earlier-stage cancers. WELIREG sales rose 41% to $196 million. GARDASIL sales were $1.7 billion, down 25%, with U.S. growth offset by declines in Japan and China. CAPVAXIVE sales reached $244 million, and ENFLONSIA recorded $79 million in initial sales. WINREVAIR saw global sales of $360 million, with a noted timing impact from distributor purchases. Animal Health sales increased 7%. Gross margin was reported at 81.9%, and operating expenses were $6.6 billion, including $300 million in business development charges.</li>\n<li>Litchfield highlighted, \"Our current guidance midpoint of $8.96 reflects a benefit from the restructured agreement for Koselugo of $0.09, partially offset by an estimated negative impact related to the acquisition of Verona of $0.04.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Asad Haider, Goldman Sachs: Asked about business development priorities and potential for transformative deals. Davis responded that Merck seeks opportunities aligned with key therapeutic areas, focusing on deals in the $1 billion to $15 billion range but is open to larger transactions if science and value align. \"Our focus will be on bringing in pipeline assets, not on those types of deals.\"</li>\n<li>Geoffrey Meacham, Citigroup: Inquired about expanding development of TL1A immunology. Li explained the move into rheumatology and dermatology, emphasizing the importance of Phase III trials in Crohn's and SSc-ILD.</li>\n<li>Akash Tewari, Jefferies: Queried about the solid tumor strategy and the relative excitement for TROP2 vs. PD-1 VEGF. Li said Merck is \"extremely excited about the TROP2, the sac-TMT,\" and is eager to see results in broader settings.</li>\n<li>Evan Seigerman, BMO: Sought updates on ENFLONSIA's U.S. launch. Davis noted a later launch into the season but stated, \"We feel good about where we are with ENFLONSIA\" and expect increasing impact into 2026. Litchfield added, \"Feedback from customers has been very good.\"</li>\n<li>Daina Graybosch, Leerink: Asked about KEYTRUDA's early-stage sales. Davis reported more than half of KEYTRUDA's growth is from earlier-stage indications, exceeding 25% of total sales.</li>\n<li>Chris Schott, JPMorgan: Sought updates on MFN policy. Davis said, \"We are in continuing discussions with the administration\" and is \"very optimistic that we're going to have a constructive outcome.\"</li>\n<li>Carter Gould, Cantor: Inquired about WELIREG and overall survival data. Li stressed the importance of OS and expressed eagerness for future results.</li>\n<li>Terence Flynn, Morgan Stanley: Asked about 2026 top line expectations. Litchfield projected solid growth fueled by new launches and acknowledged headwinds from loss of exclusivity and IRA price setting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts focused on business development, pipeline progress, and policy risks, with a neutral to slightly positive tone, probing for strategic clarity and competitive positioning.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and optimistic outlook in both prepared remarks and Q&amp;A, using phrases like \"we remain highly focused\" and \"I remain confident.\" During Q&amp;A, management continued to project confidence, though occasionally more cautious or measured when addressing policy and pricing questions.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, the tone is steady, with continued emphasis on pipeline strength and new launches. Analysts' tone remains inquisitive but balanced, while management sustains a theme of constructive optimism.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance for full-year revenue and EPS was reaffirmed, now including Verona Pharma and Koselugo impacts, with minor adjustments for FX and acquisition effects. In Q2, Verona Pharma was an announced but pending acquisition, now completed and integrated into guidance.</li>\n<li>Oncology growth remains a key driver, with continued strong performance for KEYTRUDA and WELIREG. New product launches (WINREVAIR, CAPVAXIVE, ENFLONSIA) are contributing more meaningfully, and OHTUVAYRE is now incorporated following the Verona acquisition.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus has shifted to executing and integrating recent deals, further broadening the pipeline and investing in manufacturing.</li>\n<li>Analysts have maintained focus on product launches, business development, and policy headwinds. Management’s confidence in pipeline execution and future growth remains consistent with the prior quarter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management noted potential headwinds from U.S. healthcare policy, price pressures, and loss of exclusivity for key products such as DIFICID, BRIDION, and JANUVIA. Litchfield stated, \"We do expect some headwind from price in our ex-U.S. markets.\"</li>\n<li>The potential impact of government reforms and pricing changes was raised by both management and analysts, with ongoing discussions highlighted but no concrete resolutions yet.</li>\n<li>Competition in both human and animal health segments, as well as in vaccines (e.g., VAXNEUVANCE in Japan), was specifically mentioned.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Management underscores the transformation underway at Merck, with growing contributions from a diversified portfolio, ongoing strategic acquisitions like Verona Pharma, and a robust pipeline of over 80 Phase III trials. The company stresses its ability to drive long-term growth and value for shareholders by investing in innovation, executing new product launches, and maintaining strategic discipline in business development. The outlook remains confident, backed by strong third-quarter results, expanding manufacturing investments, and clear guidance for the year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/mrk/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",
