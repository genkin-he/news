            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Oil States International (OIS) Q3 2025  </p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Cindy Taylor, President, CEO &amp; Executive Director, highlighted that \"in a quarter marked by lower crude oil prices, uncertainty about the oil macro and fluctuating U.S. trade policies U.S. shale-driven activity slowed further, while offshore and international markets demonstrated resilience, benefiting from long-cycle project investments.\" She noted the company finished within its guided EBITDA range, with offshore and international markets providing 75% of revenues—an increase both sequentially and year-over-year. </li>\n<li>Taylor stated, \"Our offshore manufactured products segment continued to deliver strong performance. Revenues increased 2% sequentially, while adjusted segment EBITDA rose 6% due to product and service mix. Backlog increased to $399 million, again, allowing us to achieve our price level since June 2015.\" Robust bookings of $145 million drove a quarterly book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x, supported by strong military orders.</li>\n<li>Taylor shared that \"during the third quarter, we grew our cash flow from operations to $31 million, an increase of 105% sequentially, and we generated $23 million of free cash flow.\" She emphasized ongoing deleveraging efforts, including paying off convertible senior notes maturing in April 2026 and continued share repurchases.</li>\n<li>Lloyd Hajdik, Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer, reported, \"During the third quarter, we generated revenues of $165 million and adjusted consolidated EBITDA of $21 million. Net income totaled $2 million or $0.03 per share which included facility exits, severance and other charges totaling $4 million, the majority of which related to our U.S. land restructuring efforts. Our adjusted net income totaled $5 million or $0.08 per share after excluding these charges.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Taylor projected, \"based on what we know today, our fourth quarter consolidated revenue should increase 8% to 13% sequentially, and our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA is expected to range from $21 million to $22 million. Our cash flows from operations were very strong in the third quarter and are expected to improve in the fourth quarter bringing the annual amount to $100 million plus.\"</li>\n<li>She emphasized the company’s focus on building backlog with strong margins, investing in innovation, reducing debt, and returning cash to stockholders. </li>\n<li>Management did not provide a direct comparison to analysts’ estimates.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hajdik detailed, \"Our Offshore/Manufacturers Products segment generated revenues of $109 million and adjusted segment EBITDA of $22 million in the third quarter. Adjusted segment EBITDA margin was 21% in the third quarter. In our Completion and Production Services segment, we generated revenues of $28 million and adjusted segment EBITDA of $8 million in the third quarter. We achieved an adjusted segment EBITDA margin of 29%.\" </li>\n<li>The Downhole Technologies segment delivered revenues of $29 million and an adjusted segment EBITDA loss of $1 million. Hajdik attributed the loss to \"higher costs due to tariffs and lower international activity levels.\"</li>\n<li>The company reported repurchasing $4 million of common stock and $6 million of convertible senior notes in the quarter. As of September 30, Oil States maintained a solid cash-on-hand position with no borrowings under its revolving credit facility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>James Rollyson, Raymond James: Asked about the offshore backlog, margin profile, tariff impact, and timing for backlog roll-off. Taylor responded that \"what you're hearing from offshore exposed companies is that we've had a good year, but throughout the year with lower crude prices, some of the optimism for spending has shifted to the right a bit...our company-specific looks good, but maybe not quite as robust thought coming into the year with crude prices at $60.\" She described the tariff impact as \"material increases in gun steel cost,\" particularly affecting the Downhole Technologies segment, and expects tariffs to be passed on to customers in the coming months.</li>\n<li>Rollyson follow-up: Asked if negative EBITDA in Downhole Technologies was entirely due to tariffs. Taylor confirmed, adding that weak plug demand also contributed, and expects improvement \"early next year\" as inventory drawdowns conclude and tariff costs are passed through.</li>\n<li>Stephen Gengaro, Stifel: Inquired about the impact of cost cuts in U.S. land business and margin trajectory. Taylor indicated most transition effects should be resolved by year-end, with expectations for \"high 20s to low 30s EBITDA margins\" going forward, compared to mid-teens previously.</li>\n<li>Gengaro follow-up: Asked if revenue impact from portfolio high-grading is mostly realized. Taylor said \"the majority\" has occurred.</li>\n<li>Gengaro: Asked about backlog realization. Taylor explained the military awards have elongated realization timelines, but expects future awards to rebalance backlog conversion toward historical norms.</li>\n<li>Unknown Analyst, Daniel Energy Partners: Asked if the offshore shift is structural or cyclical. Taylor described it as \"more of a secular trend,\" citing offshore's longer-lived reserves and technology differentiation. Additional discussion covered offshore product drivers, including FlexJoint technology and MPD systems, with Taylor noting, \"it's working well, getting strong customer acceptance.\"</li>\n<li>The analyst also questioned U.S. land strategy. Taylor emphasized selectivity, stating, \"we're being -- not getting out of land. We're just being very selective about the ones we pursue long term.\"</li>\n<li>Rollyson returned to confirm full-year cash flow guidance. Taylor reiterated, \"it will be $100 million plus for the year.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts were focused on offshore resilience, tariff impacts, Downhole Technologies margins, backlog conversion, and U.S. land restructuring, with a neutral-to-slightly positive tone but pressing on timing and cost impacts.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and proactive tone, emphasizing strong cash flow, backlog, and strategic execution. During Q&amp;A, Taylor acknowledged challenges but provided detailed explanations and reaffirmed guidance, using phrases such as \"we are confident when we say\" and \"we believe we are focused on the right end markets.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both management and analysts showed slightly increased optimism on offshore and backlog themes, but also heightened concern about tariffs and the timing of margin improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance shifted from maintaining previous full-year EBITDA targets to forecasting specific Q4 sequential growth of 8%–13% in revenue and EBITDA of $21 million to $22 million.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus continued its move toward offshore and international markets, with offshore revenue mix rising from 72% in Q2 to 75% in Q3.</li>\n<li>Analysts remained focused on backlog, margin expansion, and restructuring, but introduced more questions about tariff impacts.</li>\n<li>Management’s tone shifted to more detailed discussion of tariff risks and mitigation, while reiterating confidence in backlog-driven growth and cash flow generation.</li>\n<li>Key metrics such as backlog, offshore bookings, and cash flow from operations showed progress quarter over quarter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management identified material increases in gun steel tariffs, particularly impacting Downhole Technologies, with Taylor stating, “if you go back 2 or 3 years, that tariff rate was 25%. So these are material increases in gun steel cost.”</li>\n<li>U.S. land activity remains subdued, with further restructuring expected to be completed by year-end to improve margins and free cash flow.</li>\n<li>The company is exploring alternative supply sources and possible international assembly to mitigate tariff impacts.</li>\n<li>Analysts expressed concern over timing for margin improvement in Downhole Technologies and the ability to maintain lean operations without cutting too deeply in U.S. land business.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Oil States International’s third quarter performance reflected the benefits of its strategic shift toward offshore and international markets, driving a decade-high backlog and strong cash flow from operations. Management expects continued revenue and EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter, with a full-year cash flow from operations target of $100 million plus, and remains committed to operational optimization, innovation, and disciplined capital allocation. The company faces headwinds from elevated tariffs and U.S. land market softness, but ongoing restructuring and backlog strength are positioned to support enhanced margins and shareholder returns into 2026.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ois/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",
