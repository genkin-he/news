He noted, \"excluding identified items, net income is up $145 million, primarily due to strong operational performance.\"</li>\n<li>Upstream earnings were $728 million, up $64 million sequentially due to higher volumes and realizations.

The Chemical business generated $21 million in earnings, consistent with the prior quarter.</li>\n<li>Cash flows from operating activities were $1.798 billion.

Whelan and Lyons provided detailed, thorough responses, reinforcing a steady and optimistic outlook.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both analyst and management sentiment remains stable, with analysts continuing to focus on operational execution and capital returns, and management sustaining a confident tone.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The current quarter saw a major announcement of restructuring plans targeting $150 million in annual expense reductions by 2028 and a significant workforce transformation. In contrast, the previous quarter emphasized operational execution and project milestones, such as the Strathcona renewable diesel facility start-up.</li>\n<li>Kearl and Cold Lake continued to set production records, with further cost declines at Kearl noted this quarter. Downstream utilization improved sharply from 87% to 98% as major turnaround activity concluded.</li>\n<li>Analysts shifted questions from project execution and capital allocation last quarter to a deeper focus on the impact and execution of the announced restructuring, as well as sustainability of operational gains.</li>\n<li>Management's confidence in guidance and growth initiatives was steady, with a more explicit focus this quarter on the benefits and execution of restructuring.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited a recent softening in crude prices but emphasized the resilience of the integrated business model.</li>\n<li>The restructuring includes a reduction in employee roles by the end of 2027, which could present transition challenges.</li>\n<li>A noncash impairment charge was recorded due to the Calgary campus sale, though the transaction includes a leaseback arrangement.</li>\n<li>Analysts questioned the transition process and potential impacts of workforce reductions, seeking clarity on timing and operational continuity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Imperial Oil's third quarter results featured record upstream production, strong cash flow, and robust shareholder returns. The company announced a sweeping restructuring plan targeting $150 million in annual expense reductions by 2028, including a significant workforce transformation and sale of office assets. Management expressed confidence in meeting or exceeding its medium-term growth and expense targets, underpinned by operational momentum at Kearl and Cold Lake, and a resilient downstream business. Looking ahead, Imperial Oil remains focused on completing its accelerated share buyback by year-end and issuing its 2026 outlook in mid-December, while leveraging technology and global scale to drive future growth and efficiency.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/imo:ca/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

He explained these transactions will add over 5% to current annualized cash rent, expand partnerships with two existing tenants, and advance tribal gaming initiatives. </li>\n<li>Carlino highlighted more than $3 billion of announced transaction activity in the pipeline and confirmed the company executed on $363 million of forward equity in the quarter at an average price of $48. He noted that funding all future commitments solely with debt would keep leverage at approximately 5.1x, at the low end of their 5 to 5.5 range, and stated, \"it’s unlikely we’ll be tapping the equity market in this current pathetic range.\"</li>\n<li>On the Bally’s relationship, Carlino said, \"Since we last spoke, a lot has transpired with Bally's, all of which has been very positive from our perspective.\" He discussed Bally’s progress in Chicago, liquidity improvements, and potential New York license value.</li>\n<li>CFO Desiree Burke reported, \"For the third quarter of 2025, our total income from real estate exceeded the third quarter of 2024 by over $12 million.\" She attributed growth to increases in cash rent from acquisitions and funding, including the Bally’s Kansas City and Shreveport acquisition, Chicago land lease, and other development loans. Burke added, \"operating expenses decreased $53.5 million, mainly resulting from noncash adjustments in the provision for credit losses due to a less pessimistic forward-looking economic forecast as compared to the prior quarter.\"</li>\n<li>Burke announced an increase in GLPI’s full year 2025 AFFO guidance to a range of $3.86 to $3.88 per diluted share and OP units.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The company raised its full year 2025 AFFO guidance to $3.86 to $3.88 per diluted share and OP units, up from the previous $3.85 to $3.87 range.</li>\n<li>Burke stated this guidance does not include the impact of future transactions but incorporates anticipated funding of $150 million for the M Resort tower expected next month and about $280 million for development projects in Q4, including $125 million funded for Chicago in October.</li>\n<li>She emphasized, \"Given our current balance sheet position, the several year runway to fund our development projects and our annual free cash flow over that time frame, we have optionality to fund our future accretive commitments.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Burke reported that third quarter income from real estate grew by more than $12 million year-over-year, primarily driven by $20 million in increased cash rent from acquisitions and development activities.</li>\n<li>Operating expenses decreased by $53.5 million, attributed to noncash adjustments in the provision for credit losses, and redemption of $975 million in 2026 bonds, replaced by $1.3 billion in new bonds, raising over $680 million in capital.</li>\n<li>The leverage ratio was reported at 4.4x, below target and historical levels.</li>\n<li>The company sold 7.6 million shares under a forward sale agreement at $47.87 per share, raising $363.3 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Haendel St. Juste, Mizuho Securities: Asked about comfort with rising leverage as capital is deployed. Burke replied, \"If I funded everything I have out there in the pipeline with debt... we only get to 5.1x levered... So I'd be very comfortable at that range.\"</li>\n<li>Richard Hightower, Barclays: Inquired about changes in Q4 development funding and the impact of Chicago. Burke explained, \"We've reduced our Chicago development funding by about $25 million and pushed that into 2026... it's really just a timing adjustment.\"</li>\n<li>Barry Jonas, Truist: Asked about the pipeline for tribal deals. Steven Ladany responded that inbound interest is increasing and the company is focused on educating the market about GLPI’s capital structures for tribal gaming.</li>\n<li>William John Kilichowski, Wells Fargo: Questioned GLPI’s appetite for New York City casino participation. Brandon Moore said, \"the appetite for New York is strong... if we can participate in a prudent way in those projects, we'll certainly seek to do that,\" but noted it's early to decide the level of commitment.</li>\n<li>Greg McGinniss, Scotiabank: Asked about rent coverage at Live! Virginia. Burke confirmed expectations for 2:1 rent coverage.</li>\n<li>Ronald Kamdem, Morgan Stanley: Asked about the pace of Chicago construction. Ladany stated, \"There are 3 cranes now working on the projects, steel's getting erected.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts showed a neutral to slightly positive tone, focusing on leverage, liquidity, development timing, and regional gaming trends. Questions repeatedly sought clarification on funding, project timelines, and risk management.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and upbeat tone during prepared remarks, frequently using terms like \"very pleased,\" \"very strong ROI framework,\" and \"tremendous potential.\" During Q&amp;A, management’s tone remained measured and confident, with direct responses, e.g., \"I'd be very comfortable at that range\" and \"we see tremendous potential and opportunity.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone is more confident, especially regarding funding flexibility and successful execution of transactions. Analysts’ tone shifted from concerns over Bally’s credit and development risk to questions about tactical adjustments and pipeline opportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance for full year 2025 AFFO was increased by $0.01, and the company reported the addition of $875 million in new accretive deals at a 9.3% blended cap rate.</li>\n<li>The pipeline of over $3 billion in transaction activity is now highlighted, with management emphasizing the ability to fund commitments with debt while maintaining leverage at the lower end of the target range.</li>\n<li>Analysts in Q3 focused more on strategic deployment of capital, timing of development funding, and tribal gaming opportunities, while the previous quarter included more questions on parent guarantees and Bally’s credit profile.</li>\n<li>Management’s confidence has increased, with greater transparency on funding plans, development progress, and willingness to utilize debt.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management discussed the timing adjustment for Chicago development funding, reducing near-term outlay by $25 million.</li>\n<li>The extension of the option and call right to acquire Bally's Twin River Lincoln was described as a \"win-win accommodation\" to allow market conditions to clarify.</li>\n<li>Analysts asked about financing costs amid volatile treasury rates and return hurdles for tribal deals with less protection, with management noting consistent spreads and a focus on coverage ratios.</li>\n<li>Management reiterated that regional gaming trends remain strong and coverage ratios are solid.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>GLPI’s third quarter saw the completion of multiple accretive deals and a notable increase in its development pipeline, driving an upward revision to full year 2025 AFFO guidance. Management emphasized ample funding flexibility, a robust balance sheet, and strong rent coverage across its leases. The company highlighted substantial progress on key development projects, particularly in Chicago, and continues to see expanding opportunities in tribal and regional gaming. Management’s confidence in both current operations and future commitments was reinforced throughout the call.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/glpi/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Alerus Financial Corporation (ALRS) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Katie Lorenson, President, CEO &amp; Director, stated that results for the quarter were \"consistent with expectations\" and emphasized ongoing execution of the long-term strategy, highlighting \"transformation across our commercial wealth bank\" and positioning for \"sustainable value-driven growth.\" She pointed to Alerus' \"diversified business model, which drives nearly double the average fee income compared to other banks\" and flagged resilience across cycles, especially from Retirement and Wealth businesses.</li>\n<li>Lorenson detailed progress in client relationship deepening and reach expansion, noting \"robust organic growth in both our commercial and private banking segments.\" She cited the Wealth Management platform upgrade and the continued national leadership in Retirement and Benefits.</li>\n<li>The company continued to \"derisk the balance sheet,\" referencing the sale of higher-risk hospitality loans and a large recovery that brought the year-to-date charge-off ratio to 8 basis points. Lorenson said, \"Nonperforming assets to total assets were 1.13%, an increase of 15 basis points from the prior quarter,\" driven by one commercial relationship and a large multifamily loan.</li>\n<li>Lorenson outlined the strategic addition of industry veterans, divestiture of non-core business lines, and acquisitions in key markets. She explained, \"We have courageously transitioned the majority of our commercial making team in our growth markets over the last several years with specialized industry veterans.\"</li>\n<li>She further announced, \"We remain bullish on our retirement business of which we are the 25th largest in the country\" and highlighted plans to \"double the wealth advisers, mostly in our growth markets over the next several years.\"</li>\n<li>Lorenson concluded, \"Our focus going forward is to keep growing organically by deepening client relationships and expanding in growth markets, leverage technology, data and AI to drive efficiency and deliver differentiated client experiences.\"</li>\n<li>Alan Villalon, Executive VP &amp; CFO, reported, \"On a reported basis, net interest income increased 0.2% over the prior quarter, while fee income decreased 7.3%.\" He highlighted, \"In the third quarter, net interest income continued to reach new highs at $43.1 million, and our reported net interest margin remained stable at 3.50%.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Villalon stated, \"For loans, we expect the year to end with over $4.1 billion. For 2026, we expect to continue to grow at a mid-single-digit growth rate. Total deposits should be around $4.3 billion at year-end.\"</li>\n<li>He added, \"Net interest margin for 2025 is now to be expected higher and end around 3.35% to 3.4% on a full year basis. For 2026, we're expecting our net interest margin to be around 3.35% to 3.45%.\"</li>\n<li>Villalon provided that \"noninterest income for the year to end around $115 million in total,\" excluding the $2.1 million gain on sale of loans, and for 2026, \"we expect noninterest income to grow in the mid-single digits.\"</li>\n<li>Adjusted pre-provision net revenue is expected to end the year \"around $85 million to $86 million,\" with low to mid-single-digit growth targeted for 2026.</li>\n<li>Adjusted ROA guidance is \"greater than 1.15%\" for 2025 and \"to exceed 1.10% for the year\" in 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Net interest income reached $43.1 million; fee income represented over 40% of revenues. Net interest margin was reported at 3.50%. Loan growth was 1.4% over the previous quarter, led by multifamily real estate, C&amp;I, and residential real estate.</li>\n<li>Retirement business revenue increased to $16.5 million, a 2.9% sequential rise, with assets under administration and management up 3.7%. HSA deposits rose to over $202 million.</li>\n<li>Wealth Management revenue declined to $6.6 million, but assets under management increased 4.3%.</li>\n<li>Noninterest expense increased 4.3%, primarily due to higher incentive costs and technology investments. Tangible common equity ratio improved to 8.24%.</li>\n<li>Nonperforming assets rose to 1.13% of total assets, impacted by a specific commercial relationship and a large multifamily loan.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Jeff Rulis, D.A. Davidson &amp; Co.: Asked about the lack of provision this quarter and future provisioning. Karin Taylor, Executive VP &amp; COO: Explained, \"The lack of provision this quarter was driven primarily by the recovery as well as a decrease in the requirement for pooled loans. In terms of provisioning going forward, that will be driven primarily by loan growth macroeconomic factors.\"</li>\n<li>Rulis: Queried on loan growth upside with lower rates. James Collins, Executive VP and Chief Banking &amp; Revenue Officer: Said that with lower rates, loan growth could approach \"9% to 10%.\"</li>\n<li>Brendan Nosal, Hovde Group: Asked about margin outlook and drivers. Villalon: Cited \"really good spreads on loans, and we're also seeing good spreads on deposits\" as margin drivers.</li>\n<li>Nathan Race, Piper Sandler: Sought drivers in wealth and retirement segments. Lorenson: Pointed to \"great success in recruiting and retaining exceptional advisers\" and that technology upgrades are expected to support adviser growth.</li>\n<li>Damon Del Monte, KBW: Asked about expense outlook and technology costs. Villalon: Indicated technology expense may see a slight uptick due to contract escalators.</li>\n<li>David Long, Raymond James: Inquired about deposit growth and asset mix. Villalon: Expressed interest in reallocating from low-yield securities to higher-yield loans.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts maintained a neutral to slightly positive tone, focusing on clarity around guidance, margin, loan growth, and expense trends. Questions were constructive and pressed for specifics but did not signal skepticism or negativity.</li>\n<li>Management's tone in prepared remarks was confident and strategic. During Q&amp;A, management responses were detailed and direct, with an emphasis on ongoing improvements and risk management.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both management and analysts showed a steadier and more constructive tone, with less focus on risk mitigation and more discussion on growth and margin drivers. Lorenson stated, \"We are confident in our strategy and the opportunities ahead.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance for loan growth remains at mid-single digits, with upside to higher growth if rates decline. Margin guidance improved, with net interest margin now expected higher for the full year. Noninterest income guidance was refined to exclude one-time gains.</li>\n<li>Focus shifted toward leveraging technology and AI, as well as recruiting in core growth markets. Management noted completion of team transitions and emphasis on operational efficiency.</li>\n<li>Analysts in the current quarter were more focused on growth levers and expense control, whereas last quarter's questions probed risk exposure and nonperforming assets.</li>\n<li>Key credit metrics, such as nonperforming assets, rose slightly, but management reiterated these were concentrated exposures and not indicative of broader issues.</li>\n<li>Management’s confidence in strategic positioning and future prospects was more pronounced, highlighting readiness for future M&amp;A and organic growth.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited an increase in nonperforming assets to 1.13%, with concentration in two large relationships (equipment lessor and multifamily loan).</li>\n<li>Ongoing work was flagged to \"push out credits that just are core to our focus or that we don't have full relationships with and are not in our asset class priorities.\"</li>\n<li>Analysts asked about the sustainability of fee income growth, expense trends, and further need for provisioning, reflecting continued monitoring of credit quality and cost management.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Alerus Financial Corporation emphasized its diversified business model and resilience across cycles in the third quarter, reporting stable net interest income and progress on strategic initiatives in technology and talent. Management provided clear guidance for mid-single-digit loan growth and improving net interest margins into 2026, while maintaining a disciplined approach to risk and capital. With ongoing efforts to deepen client relationships, leverage new technology, and expand in growth markets, Alerus aims to deliver sustainable top-tier performance for clients and shareholders in the coming year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/alrs/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

(TUSK) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Mark Layton, CFO &amp; Company Secretary, noted \"Mammoth delivered another quarter of steady execution as we advance our transformation plan, simplifying the company and realigning the portfolio toward higher return businesses.\" Layton highlighted that the Drilling segment's revenue more than tripled sequentially, with gross margin reaching its highest level in the segment's history, driven by horizontal drilling in the Permian Basin. </li>\n<li>Layton reported third quarter revenue of $14.8 million, a decrease from $16.4 million in Q2, attributing the decline to the divestiture of the Piranha assets and continued underperformance in the Sand segment. Net loss from continuing operations was $12.1 million or $0.25 per diluted share. Layton stated, \"While these results are not where we want them to be, they reinforce why we're taking decisive actions to fix structural issues, strengthen the portfolio and build a healthier business.\"</li>\n<li>Mammoth delivered positive free cash flow from operations, aided by monetization of underutilized assets. The company sold its Piranha assets in the Sand segment and invested in new aviation assets within the rentals business. Layton emphasized, \"We have now deployed approximately $40 million year-to-date to grow and diversify our aviation portfolio.\"</li>\n<li>Layton reiterated a selective approach to M&amp;A, stating decisions are guided by \"building a company centered on sustainable returns rather than scale for its own sake.\"</li>\n<li>Bernard Lancaster, COO &amp; Principal Executive Officer, stated, \"Operationally, our teams executed well across our businesses in what was a challenging quarter.\" Lancaster highlighted the Drilling segment's record gross margins, strong customer demand in aviation rentals, and margin expansion in Accommodations. He noted, \"We expect to build on this momentum in Q4 and into 2026 as activity and customer engagement remains strong in the areas where we operate.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Layton signaled that Q4 will reflect continued portfolio transition, but stated, \"we expect improved cash generation and margin recovery in 2026 as our transformation initiatives take hold.\"</li>\n<li>The company expects to redeploy two aircraft at higher lease rates next quarter and anticipates Sand to return to positive gross margin in 2026 following divestitures and operational improvements. Layton also referenced ongoing cost discipline and a focus on long-term contracts in aviation rentals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue for Q3 was $14.8 million, down from $16.4 million in Q2 and $17.1 million in the prior year, primarily due to the Piranha asset sale and Sand segment underperformance. Net loss from continuing operations was $12.1 million or ($0.25) per diluted share, which included a noncash charge of $2.4 million related to Piranha. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a loss of $4.4 million.</li>\n<li>Segment results: Rentals revenue was $2.8 million, down 11% sequentially but up 24% year-over-year. Infrastructure revenue was $4.8 million, down 13% sequentially. Sand revenue was $2.7 million, down 49% from Q2. Accommodations revenue was $2.3 million, up 29% sequentially. Drilling revenue was $2.3 million, a 207% sequential increase.</li>\n<li>SG&amp;A expenses were $5.2 million for Q3, with normalized run rate cut in half compared to last year, excluding $1 million of Puerto Rico-related legal expenses. Year-to-date, approximately $40 million has been deployed to expand the aviation portfolio.</li>\n<li>At quarter end, Mammoth held $110.9 million in unrestricted cash and $153.4 million in total liquidity. Subsequent to quarter end, $19.8 million in restricted cash was released back to the company.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Colby Sasso, Daniel Energy Partners, asked about visibility for sand volumes in 2026 and basins served. Layton responded that primary logistics advantages are \"into Western Canada, into the Montney and then into the Northeast, so into the Utica, Marcellus,\" and expects an increase in volumes in 2026 compared to Q3.</li>\n<li>Doug Garber, Westport Alpha, inquired about the balance sheet and cash inflows from asset sales. Layton confirmed approximately $5 million in drilling assets and $10 million remaining in escrow from a T&amp;D transaction, with expectations of release in April 2026.</li>\n<li>Garber also probed on PREPA receivables and tax liabilities. Layton noted $20 million in accounts receivable due upon PREPA's bankruptcy exit and described the tax liability as gross, pending negotiations with Puerto Rico's tax department.</li>\n<li>Garber questioned the Sand business drag on free cash flow and railcar costs. Layton explained Q3 included a $550,000 onetime charge for railcar returns and that monthly railcar costs were reduced by about $30,000 to $120,000, with further reductions possible in 2026. Lancaster added the fleet count was reduced by about 30%.</li>\n<li>Garber asked about sand pricing. Layton indicated pricing was \"a little below $20 during the quarter,\" with continued demand for 40-70 mesh sand at that range.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts focused on liquidity, asset sales, operational drag in the Sand segment, and future volume expectations, with a neutral to slightly negative tone, asking for clarity on cash flows, liabilities, and cost reductions.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a disciplined and constructive tone in both prepared remarks and Q&amp;A, emphasizing financial resilience, operational improvements, and a deliberate transformation plan.</li>\n<li>Compared to Q2, analyst tone remained focused on liquidity and asset deployment, while management's tone remained confident but more focused on cost controls and returning segments to positive margins.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance language shifted to emphasize improved cash generation and margin recovery in 2026, compared to Q2's focus on asset sales and initial transformation steps.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus advanced from executing portfolio transactions in Q2 to optimizing operations and cost structure in Q3.</li>\n<li>Analysts continued to press for clarity on asset monetization and balance sheet strength, while management maintained a message of operational discipline and selectivity in capital allocation.</li>\n<li>Key financial metrics showed sequential declines in revenue and Sand segment performance, but Drilling and Accommodations segments demonstrated improvement.</li>\n<li>Management's confidence remained steady, with greater emphasis on cost reduction and sustainable returns.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited continued underperformance in the Sand segment and weather-related headwinds in Canada as ongoing challenges.</li>\n<li>Operational execution issues in Infrastructure led to management changes and tighter project oversight.</li>\n<li>The company faces legal expenses related to Puerto Rico, with ongoing negotiations impacting tax liabilities.</li>\n<li>Analysts highlighted concerns about cash flow drag from Sand, the timing of asset sales, receivable collection, and pricing environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Management underscored that the third quarter marked steady progress in transforming Mammoth Energy Services, with key steps including asset divestitures, portfolio realignment, and disciplined reinvestment in high-return segments such as Drilling and Aviation rentals. While headline results remain pressured by underperformance in Sand and Infrastructure, the company points to enhanced liquidity, cost reductions, and targeted investments as the foundation for margin recovery and improved cash generation in 2026. The leadership team remains confident that ongoing operational execution and prudent capital deployment will position Mammoth for long-term value creation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/tusk/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",
