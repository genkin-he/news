Arkansas mandates that any third-party mobile sportsbook deal must give at least 51% of net sports betting revenue to the in-state casino partner.</p>\n<p>The addition of Arkansas expands the access of DraftKings Sportsbook to more than 2 million adult residents in the state, increasing coverage of the product to 53% of the U.S. population. Arkansas will be the 30th U.S. state, in addition to Washington, D.C., Ontario, Canada, and Puerto Rico, where DraftKings operates regulated sports betting.</p>\n<p>Shares of DraftKings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DKNG\" title=\"DraftKings Inc.\">DKNG</a>) were down 2.6% in premarket trading.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">A number of high-profile retailers have returned to Chicago's Magnificent Mile, and leasing activity is clearly picking up, although the corridor still has vacancy rates well above the pre-COVID levels. Vacancy, which peaked at around roughly 34% in 2023, has since fallen into the low- to high-20s percentage range depending on the specific stretch of Michigan Avenue, signaling meaningful backfilling of space.</p>\n<p>Analysts project retail leasing volume on Michigan Avenue could roughly double in 2026, with more than 100,000 square feet of absorption expected, suggesting that the rebound is moving into a more active phase as the deals signed in 2024–2025 begin to open.</p>\n<p>New and returning tenants include fashion and specialty retailers such as Mango, Uniqlo, Aritzia, Alo Yoga, Intimissimi, and The North Face, which are opening or relocating flagship-style stores along the avenue and helping to restore some of its historic appeal as a national and international brand corridor. Meanwhile, Gap (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GAP\" title=\"The Gap, Inc.\">GAP</a>) is in advanced talks to lease about 8,325 square feet on Michigan Avenue. Larger multi-story boxes that were particularly difficult to lease after the pandemic and crime issues are increasingly being taken by experiential users, including a Harry Potter-themed interactive store/exhibit and other immersive or technology-driven attractions aimed at tourists and families.</p>\n<p>Analysts think if the recovery extends, the Magnificent Mile's vacancy could move into the mid-teens by around 2027–2028 and potentially below 10% by 2030, implying a long but improving trajectory rather than a sharp snapback.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
