            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Natural Resource Partners L.P. (NRP) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>President &amp; COO Craig Nunez stated that \"NRP generated $46 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter and $169 million of free cash flow in the full year 2025.\" He emphasized ongoing challenges, noting, \"All three of our key commodities, metallurgical coal, thermal coal and soda ash continued to struggle with sales prices that are near or below our estimates of operator's marginal cost of production.\" Nunez addressed the ongoing downturn in the soda ash market, stating, \"We believe 2026 will be worse\" and described the current environment as \"the worst bear market in its 60-plus-year history.\" He revealed a $39 million investment in the Sisecam Wyoming joint venture to support its capital structure and reduce bank debt, which will delay the anticipated increase in unitholder distributions from August to a subsequent quarter.</li>\n<li>Chief Financial Officer Christopher Zolas reported, \"In the fourth quarter of 2025, NRP generated $31 million of net income, $45 million of operating cash flow and $46 million of free cash flow.\" Zolas highlighted that \"our Mineral Rights segment generated $40 million of net income, $49 million of operating cash flow and $50 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter.\" He pointed out that segment declines were due to weaker metallurgical coal markets and that soda ash segment income and cash flow also fell from the prior year. Zolas confirmed, \"We used the free cash flow generated from our business segments in 2025 to repay $109 million of debt. Even including the impact of our planned $39 million capital investment into Sisecam Wyoming, we remain on track to accomplish our deleveraging goal this year.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Nunez indicated that the timing for a substantial increase in unitholder distributions has shifted: \"The $39 million investment in Sisecam Wyoming is one such event and will push the distribution increase we had expected to occur in August back to a subsequent quarter.\"</li>\n<li>He reiterated, \"The longer the bear market continues for all three of our key commodities, the greater the likelihood something happens that pushes that timing back. But right now, that's what the timing looks like.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>NRP reported $31 million of net income, $45 million of operating cash flow, and $46 million of free cash flow for Q4 2025. Full-year figures were $136 million of net income, $166 million of operating cash flow, and $169 million of free cash flow.</li>\n<li>The Mineral Rights segment posted $40 million of net income and $49 million of operating cash flow for Q4, with full-year figures at $166 million and $182 million, respectively.</li>\n<li>Soda ash segment net income decreased $3 million for the quarter and $15 million for the year compared to the prior periods, with operating and free cash flow both down $11 million for the quarter and $31 million for the year.</li>\n<li>The Corporate and Financing segment improved by $3 million in Q4 and $9 million for the full year in net income due to debt reduction, with interest costs also down.</li>\n<li>NRP paid a Q4 distribution of $0.75 per common unit, matching the Q3 payout, and announced a special distribution of $0.12 per common unit to help cover unitholder tax liabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>David Spier, Nitor Capital Management: Asked if the soda ash JV is debt-free after the contribution and about further capital contributions. President &amp; COO Nunez replied, \"The JV is not debt free. The JV has $50-plus million of debt remaining after the contribution.\" He added, \"We do not have that. That's not our plan right now... If things get worse, there could be situations where we would elect to put more capital into the soda ash venture.\"</li>\n<li>Spier asked whether the $39 million investment was required or elected. Nunez responded, \"It was our election.\"</li>\n<li>Phillip Cramer, BATS Wireless: Inquired about the timing of a substantial distribution increase. Nunez answered, \"No, not in May... The timing would say it's probably in November.\"</li>\n<li>Alberto Vadia, Fruit Tree Capital: Asked about not bidding at a recent mineral rights auction. Nunez explained, \"Auctions are typically not places where you come away with attractive opportunities and for mineral type assets. So you're not likely to see us participate in auctions... we are still on our path to delever and our goal is to essentially pay off all of our debt and then focus primarily on returning capital to unitholders.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts maintained a probing but neutral tone, seeking clarification on capital allocation, the soda ash JV, and distribution timing. There was no evident skepticism, but questions targeted uncertainty and risk management.</li>\n<li>Management's tone was measured and cautious, particularly regarding market conditions and future distributions. Nunez acknowledged misjudging the \"extent, the depth and the duration of the downturn now that we're in it,\" and repeatedly stressed discipline and the potential for further delays if market weakness persists.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone has shifted from cautious optimism to increased caution, with more explicit warnings about the duration and severity of commodity market downturns.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance on distribution increases shifted: previously targeted for August, now delayed to a subsequent quarter due to the Sisecam Wyoming investment.</li>\n<li>Management focus remains on deleveraging, but with heightened attention to capital preservation amid extended commodity bear markets.</li>\n<li>Analyst questions have shifted from operational and capital allocation details to direct concerns about the sustainability of investments and the likelihood of further capital injections.</li>\n<li>Key metrics for free cash flow and segment performance have declined compared to prior periods, and management language reflects greater concern for ongoing market headwinds.</li>\n<li>The previous quarter's tone was conservatively optimistic about eventual distribution increases; the current quarter is more reserved, with explicit caveats tied to market uncertainty.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited persistent low prices for metallurgical coal, thermal coal, and soda ash, with no near-term catalysts for recovery.</li>\n<li>The soda ash market is expected to deteriorate further in 2026, with international prices below cost for most producers.</li>\n<li>There is risk of further capital contributions to the soda ash JV if market conditions worsen, though none are currently planned.</li>\n<li>Lack of new leasing activity for carbon sequestration and slow progress on geothermal, solar, and lithium initiatives were acknowledged.</li>\n<li>Analyst concerns focused on the risk of additional required investments and delays in increasing distributions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Management underscored that despite challenging market conditions and a worsening outlook for key commodities, Natural Resource Partners L.P. remains focused on generating free cash flow and reducing debt. The special $39 million capital commitment to the Sisecam Wyoming joint venture will delay the anticipated distribution increase until at least November, and management emphasized that further delays are possible if commodity bear markets persist. The company continues to prioritize deleveraging and capital discipline, with a cautious approach to new investments and acquisitions until markets stabilize.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/nrp/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Delek US Holdings, Inc. (DK) Q4 2025 </p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Avigal Soreq, President and CEO, highlighted 2025 as a transformational year, stating that \"we have made progress on all fronts, including improving the free cash flow profile of the company and increasing the economic separation between DK and DKL.\" Soreq announced that Delek reported an adjusted EPS of $0.44 and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $226 million for Q4 2025, excluding SRE, and raised the enterprise optimization plan (EOP) target to at least $200 million on an annual run rate basis. </li>\n<li>Soreq detailed that DKL achieved a record year with approximately $536 million in adjusted EBITDA and set 2026 EBITDA guidance for DKL at $520 million to $560 million. He emphasized DKL’s progress in sour gas solutions and third-party EBITDA expected to exceed 80% in 2026. \"Achieving this level of economic separation has been cornerstone of our sum-of-the-parts strategy,\" Soreq said. </li>\n<li>Soreq reported a successful turnaround at Big Spring refinery, stating, \"The focus of this turnaround is to further enhance reliability and operational flexibility, positioning the refinery for improved cost structure and margin capture.\" He also noted the EOP's growing impact, estimating a $50 million contribution to Q4 2025 P&amp;L and increasing the annual EOP improvement expectation to at least $200 million.</li>\n<li>Soreq described the monetization of 2023 and 2024 RINs, rapid use of proceeds to reduce the inventory intermediation agreement, and projected a $40 million annual improvement in free cash flow from this restructuring. He reaffirmed a commitment to shareholder returns, referencing $15 million in dividends and $20 million in share buybacks during the quarter.</li>\n<li>Mark Hobbs, Executive VP &amp; CFO, stated, \"For the fourth quarter, Delek had net income of $78 million or $1.26 per share. Adjusted net income was $143 million or $2.31 per share, and adjusted EBITDA was approximately $375 million.\"</li>\n<li>Hobbs highlighted that logistics delivered approximately $142 million in adjusted EBITDA and that cash flow from operations, adjusted for working capital and SREs, was $119 million, an improvement of $211 million from the prior year.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Soreq communicated that EOP-related cash flow improvement expectations have been raised to at least $200 million annually. DKL's 2026 EBITDA guidance was announced in the range of $520 million to $560 million. Soreq also noted, \"we expect DKL third-party EBITDA to exceed 80%.\"</li>\n<li>Hobbs provided Q1 2026 throughput guidance: Tyler at 70,000–74,000 barrels per day, El Dorado at 66,000–71,000 barrels per day, Big Spring at 22,000–28,000 barrels per day due to the planned turnaround, and Krotz Springs at 82,000–86,000 barrels per day. System throughput target is 240,000–259,000 barrels per day.</li>\n<li>Operating expense for Q1 2026 is expected to be $210 million to $220 million, G&amp;A at $47 million to $52 million, D&amp;A between $100 million and $110 million, and net interest expense between $75 million and $85 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Delek reported adjusted net income of $143 million or $2.31 per share and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $375 million for Q4 2025. Excluding SREs, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS were $226 million and $0.44 per share, respectively.</li>\n<li>The refining segment's adjusted EBITDA declined by $91 million from the previous quarter, driven primarily by seasonality. Supply and marketing contributed $23 million to Q4, with $35 million from wholesale marketing. Asphalt posted a loss of $4.2 million. Logistics delivered $142 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter.</li>\n<li>Cash flow provided by operations was $503 million, including a $26 million net inflow from changes in working capital. Financing activities included $380 million in paydown of the inventory intermediation agreement, $20 million in share repurchases, $15 million in dividends, and $22 million in DKL distribution payments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Douglas George Blyth Leggate, Wolfe Research: Asked about cash inflow and recognition for SREs already awarded, and risks for '25 through '28 RINs. Soreq responded that SRE is \"a huge, huge topic\" impacting many refineries and remains critical. Hobbs added that $360 million was monetized from prior year SREs, used to pay down $380 million under the IIA, reducing annual interest expense by at least $40 million. Bhardwaj noted additional monetization is expected in the first half of 2026.</li>\n<li>Paul Cheng, Scotiabank: Inquired about DKL consolidation timeline and Big Spring refinery turnaround initiatives. Soreq stated the goal is full value reflection in share and unit price, noted reduction in DK's DKL ownership to around 60%, and described multiple strategic options. On Big Spring, Soreq emphasized a focus on reliability, crude slate optimization, and product mix; no major new capital projects are included in the current turnaround.</li>\n<li>Alexa Petrick, Goldman Sachs: Asked about drivers of raised cash flow guidance and capital allocation priorities. Soreq described EOP as a \"lifestyle\" across the company and stated, \"we are not stopping here\" regarding future EOP improvements. On capital allocation, Soreq reiterated a disciplined approach, maintaining dividends, balancing buybacks and the balance sheet.</li>\n<li>Jason Gabelman, TD Cowen: Queried supply and marketing line volatility and DKL transaction details. Soreq and Bhardwaj explained seasonal and structural drivers, with some volatility expected but core business improvements ongoing. Wright noted recent DKL transactions further economic separation, but EBITDA impact is not material.</li>\n<li>Ryan Todd, Piper Sandler: Asked about sustainability of margin capture. Soreq identified safe operations, strong commercial activity, and EOP as key, with post-turnaround improvements at Tyler and KSR. Bhardwaj added EOP-driven product and yield enhancements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts focused on structural cash flow improvements, SRE recognition, and capital allocation, probing for sustainability and upside. The tone was generally positive, with some pressing for clarity on one-time versus repeatable gains and strategic separation.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and upbeat tone in prepared remarks, using phrases such as \"very excited\" and \"proud of the progress,\" but became more detailed and occasionally defensive in response to probing on SREs and cash flow sustainability. Soreq described EOP as \"a lifestyle\" and Hobbs highlighted the magnitude of recent cash flow improvements.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone remained confident, with increased emphasis on operational culture and strategic execution. Analysts continued to probe for clarity on repeatable performance, with a slightly more granular focus on segment-specific drivers and separation plans.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>EOP target increased from at least $180 million in Q3 to at least $200 million in Q4, reflecting ongoing internal improvements.</li>\n<li>DKL full-year EBITDA guidance rose from $500–$520 million in Q3 to $520–$560 million for 2026 in Q4, underlining expectations for continued logistics growth.</li>\n<li>Throughput guidance for Q1 2026 was provided in more detail due to the planned Big Spring turnaround, while the previous quarter highlighted seasonal trends.</li>\n<li>Management’s confidence in monetizing SRE-related RINs accelerated, with faster-than-expected cash realization in Q4 compared to the projected 6-9 months in Q3.</li>\n<li>Analysts maintained focus on SRE sustainability, segment cash flow drivers, and capital allocation, with increased attention to economic separation initiatives in the current quarter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Soreq acknowledged ongoing efforts to secure full value for 2019–2022 RINs, referencing \"invalid relief\" and the uncertain outcome of pending SRE petitions.</li>\n<li>Management recognized seasonality as a primary driver of refining segment EBITDA decline and noted expected volatility in supply and marketing contributions.</li>\n<li>Legislative and regulatory risks regarding SREs were discussed, with management expressing belief in continued policy support but acknowledging that EPA decisions are outside company control.</li>\n<li>Potential volatility in third-party EBITDA at DKL and market-driven factors, such as pipeline developments, were cited as areas to monitor.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Management emphasized that 2025 represented a pivotal year for Delek, marked by record DKL performance, accelerated monetization of SRE-related RINs, and a further increase in enterprise optimization plan targets. The company highlighted ongoing operational improvements, disciplined capital allocation, and the strategic advancement of DK and DKL economic separation as key contributors to future value creation. Management’s focus remains on driving sustainable free cash flow, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and executing on growth and efficiency initiatives into 2026.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/dk/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

Full-year Digital revenue was $469 million, with operating income at $54 million.</li>\n<li>The company recorded a $193 million noncash impairment charge in the Digital segment and an additional $12 million noncash tax charge, bringing the total to $205 million.</li>\n<li>Free cash flow for 2025 was $83 million, capital expenditures were $38 million, and net debt at year end was $825 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>George Sutton, Craig-Hallum, asked about near 100% AI adoption and ongoing work with customers. Tuchman responded that the focus is on enabling clients with AI across all operational functions, targeting \"100% by year-end, which means that at minimum, our clients are taking advantage of all of the internal tools that we utilize.\"</li>\n<li>Margaret Nolan, William Blair, asked about revenue mix shift between project-based and recurring revenue. Tuchman explained the digital business aims for \"on average a 50% recurring revenue, and we're currently achieving that, maybe even a bit more.\"</li>\n<li>Yu Lee, Guggenheim Securities, questioned the offshore mix shift and its impact on onshore revenue. Tuchman clarified, \"the majority of the revenue that we have onshore, legally, we don't have the ability or the client doesn't have the ability to move offshore under the current regulations.\"</li>\n<li>Lee also asked about clients pushing for AI efficiency savings. Tuchman replied, \"that's actually not even -- that's not -- that's -- so far, we're not actually encountering that.\"</li>\n<li>Vincent Colicchio, Barrington Research, asked about benefiting from consolidation. Tuchman responded, \"we think that's going to, over time, accelerate as clients realize that the concept of having 10 vendors makes very little sense.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts’ tone was inquisitive with a focus on AI adoption, revenue mix, and operational shifts, expressing skepticism in areas such as offshore mix and revenue headwinds.</li>\n<li>Management spoke with confidence during prepared remarks, especially on profitability and AI strategy, but responses during Q&amp;A occasionally included clarifying language and lengthy explanations, such as \"I'm sorry, I thought I answered that…\" and \"I know I sound like a broken record on this, but it's really important for people to understand this.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, analysts’ tone remained probing, while management’s confidence appeared more assertive, particularly regarding AI adoption and strategic direction.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance language shifted from maintaining to targeting improvement in adjusted EBITDA, margin, and operating income for 2026, while acknowledging revenue decline.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus moved more distinctly toward AI-enabled solutions, offshore delivery, and high-margin engagements.</li>\n<li>Analysts continued to press on the specifics of AI adoption, recurring revenue, and cost structure, but questions around the impact of AI on profitability and the practical pace of transformation were more pronounced.</li>\n<li>Key metrics such as free cash flow and profitability improved compared to the prior quarter, while revenue guidance was repositioned to highlight margin over top-line growth.</li>\n<li>Management’s tone became more forward-looking, articulating the path to near-total AI enablement and explicit margin expansion goals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited a \"decline in our market capitalization\" and industry \"AI overhang casting a shadow over valuations for CX, IT and SaaS-based business services companies.\"</li>\n<li>A $205 million noncash impairment in the Digital segment was noted as a consequence of market shifts away from legacy recurring managed service offerings.</li>\n<li>The company acknowledged near-term revenue headwinds due to \"rationalization of certain clients and lines of businesses that are underperforming\" and an \"8.4%\" Digital segment revenue decline driven by lower product resale.</li>\n<li>Management is prioritizing profitability and margin over top-line growth, with continued deleveraging efforts and investments in high-value, complex client engagements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>TTEC’s management reported a year of financial commitments met and margin improvement, highlighted by a shift toward AI-enabled solutions and a focus on higher-value, complex client engagements. While 2026 revenue is expected to decline, the company targets adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion. Management emphasized that noncash impairment charges do not affect operational strategy, and reaffirmed the company’s focus on profitability, cash flow, and strategic transformation in response to evolving market dynamics and AI-driven opportunities.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ttec/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
