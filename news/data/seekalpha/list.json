The strength of our brands and the quality of our teams position us to compound value for all our stakeholders for many years to come,\" CEO Josh Kobza said in a statement on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Over the coming years, QSR plans to become a 99% franchised business and set a goal of ~1,800 net new restaurants per year by 2028, driven by increased Firehouse Subs, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes in the U.S. and Canada, with Firehouse Subs expected to contribute half of that growth.</p>\n<p>In China, QSR expects to open 300-400 new restaurants per year by 2028 and 1,100 internationally, excluding China, with top growth markets in India, Mexico, France, Japan, and the UK.</p>\n<p>The company also reaffirmed its algorithm of 3%+ comparable sales and 5%+ net restaurant growth, both of which will continue to support an average of 8%+ organic adjusted operating income growth through 2028.</p>\n<p>Restaurant Brands (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QSR\" title=\"Restaurant Brands International Inc.\">QSR</a>) is actively working to refranchise the Burger King US company restaurant portfolio to a base of 300-500 home market restaurants and place Popeyes China and Firehouse Brazil with long-term local partners, both of which are expected to be completed by the end of 2027. </p>\n<p>Finally, QSR will resume share repurchases with ~$500M expected in 2026, increasing over time once it achieves investment-grade status. Additionally, QSR is committed to growing its dividend to a 60% payout ratio over the long term. To that end, QSR recently <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4551127-restaurant-brands-raises-dividend-by-48-to-065\" target=\"_blank\" title=\" announced \">announced </a>that it would pay an increased dividend of $0.65 per share on April 2 to shareholders of record as of March 19.</p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
