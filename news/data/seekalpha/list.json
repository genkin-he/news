Additionally, Automotive and IoT are both expected to grow Y/Y. The company guided FY27 NG gross margin to remain in its long-term range of 59-62%. We now model FY27 revenue growth of +12.6% Y/Y and NG GM of 59.8%.

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Dan Morehead, founder and managing partner of Pantera Capital, believes now is an excellent time to invest in cryptocurrency for those with a multi-year investment horizon.</p>\n<p>In an interview with CNBC, Morehead pointed out that crypto is currently trading at a 50% discount to its long-term trend, placing it at its seventh percentile value against an eight-year trend average—meaning 93% of the time historically, crypto has been priced higher than it is today.</p>\n<p>Morehead highlighted what he sees as a compelling relative value opportunity between crypto and artificial intelligence stocks. “We track an index of the top 10 AI companies, and they’re trading about 20% over their long-term trend, and crypto’s trading at a 50% discount to its long-term trend,” he explained. “So as a kind of relative value investor, I think crypto is very cheap relative to AI at this point.”</p>\n<p>The former CFO and head of macro trading at Tiger Management noted that Bitcoin follows a predictable four-year cycle tied to its halving events, when the number of new bitcoins issued gets cut in half. He pointed to Pantera’s accurate forecast from several years ago that predicted Bitcoin would hit $117,482 on a specific date in August 2025. “It did that day,” Morehead confirmed, though he acknowledged the subsequent pullback was also expected.</p>\n<p>Regarding how far Bitcoin could fall, Morehead observed that the severity of downturns has been decreasing with each cycle. “The first cycle… it was 87%, then it was 80%, then 74% loss. Now it’s at 50,” he said, suggesting the current correction’s floor is likely around $50,000 to $60,000. “But again, if you have a multiyear time frame, these are great prices.”</p>\n<p>Morehead also expressed caution about traditional markets, noting that the Federal Reserve “has flooded so much liquidity in the markets” and that “everything is pretty rich.” He specifically mentioned that bonds are trading 50 basis points below their fifty-year average on real rates, while the Nasdaq appears “fully valued” to him.</p>\n<p>Beyond Bitcoin, Morehead emphasized the importance of portfolio diversification within crypto, noting that Pantera maintains a large position in Solana despite its recent decline. He also highlighted real-world blockchain applications, citing the example of $20 billion in mortgages already placed on blockchain technology, which is reducing spreads between borrowers and lenders by over 100 basis points.</p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
