            "description": "<html><body><p>Shares of SPS Commerce (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPSC\" title=\"SPS Commerce, Inc.\">SPSC</a></span>) tumbled about 30% premarket on Friday after the company's third quarter revenue, fourth quarter guidance, and initial outlook for 2026 came in below estimates, according to analysts.</p>\n<p>Stifel downgraded the shares of SPS — which provides cloud-based supply chain management solutions — to Hold from Buy and cut the price target on the stock to $80 from $150.</p>\n<p>\"We are downgrading shares of SPSC to Hold (TP to $80) as macro headwinds and spend scrutiny in the retail ecosystem introduce near/mid-term uncertainty around top-line performance. The company's 3Q revenue, 4Q guide, and initial outlook for 2026 came in below consensus, with management pointing to delayed Relationship Management campaigns with retailers, continued supplier challenges and spend scrutiny, and unforeseen seasonality in the newer Revenue Recovery space weighing on the near-term growth outlook,\" said analysts led by J. Parker Lane.</p>\n<p>The analysts added that the company's long-time Executive Vice president and Chief Revenue Officer Dan Juckniess is retiring at the end of the year, with Eduardo Rosini (former Sage, Intuit, and Microsoft) joining as executive vice president and chief commercial officer on Dec. 1.</p>\n<p>\"While we remain believers in the company's competitive positioning and the size of the addressable opportunity, we believe signs of stabilization/improvement in the end-market are needed for investors to gain confidence in the growth outlook,\" said Lane and his team.</p>\n<p>Cantor downgraded SPS's stock to Neutral from Overweight and reduced the price target to $80 from $135.</p>\n<p>\"SPSC reported mixed-to-negative 3Q results with Recurring revenue missing consensus (Visible Alpha) on myriad headwinds; profitability made up some of the shortfall, but ultimately FCF missed as well,\" said analysts led by Matthew VanVliet. \"Additionally, mgmt provided weaker 4Q guidance than was implied in the FY25 guide post-2Q, and its initial 2026 growth outlook also missed Street expectations.\"</p>\n<p>The analysts noted that this has led them to reduce their outlook and adjust their near-term thesis, which results in them downgrading the shares and cutting the price target.</p>\n<p>VanVliet and his team added that the headwinds experienced in the third quarter will persist into the fourth quarter. The new fourth quarter revenue guidance of $192.7M to $194.7M (+13% to 14% versus Street at 17%) is about $6M below the prior implied guidance.</p>\n<p>The analysts said that the initial 2026 growth outlook of 7% to 8% also underwhelmed (versus Street at about 9%) and is being negatively impacted by all the headwinds impacting the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>\"We have reservations on whether this outlook is conservative enough given the macro backdrop and apparent list of headwinds that are mostly out of the company's control. To that end, we remain cautious in the speed with which the company will be able to reaccelerate growth in the near term. Positively, despite the lower growth expected in 2026, management continues to expect to expand EBITDA margins by 200 bps,\" said VanVliet and his team.</p>\n</body></html>",

Dec-Q will be the best quarter ever both in terms of total sales but also in terms of iPhone sales. Looking deeper at the installed base, Apple believes that not only the upgrades are happening at a faster rate, but the number of customers upgrading is also rising. This is coupled with an increase in brand new customers just entering the Apple ecosystem.”</p>\n<p>Malik reiterated his Buy rating and upped his price target to $315 from $245 after the results.</p>\n<p>KeyBanc Captial Markets analyst Brandon Nispel described Apple's results as “solid” and said the guidance was “notable,” given that there will be double-digit growth in the iPhone and overall revenue.</p>\n<p>However, given the recent move in the stock, Nispel said he expects Apple shares to “take a rest.” Nispel has a Sector-Weight rating on Apple. </p>\n<p>Needham analyst Laura Martin, who has a Hold rating on Apple, said the strong guidance “underscores AAPL's moat,” but wondered whether the recent demand for the iPhone 17 is sustainable. </p>\n<p>“We remain on the sidelines for AAPL owing to its expensive relative valuation, increasing fundamental growth headwinds, and rising competitive threats,” Martin wrote in a note to clients. “We believe that AAPL shares won't work until there is an iPhone replacement cycle.”</p>\n<p>Several other firms also raised their price targets on Apple after the results, including Melius, while Jefferies upgraded the stock.</p>\n</body></html>",
