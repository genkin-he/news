            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: American Healthcare REIT (AHR) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Jeffrey Hanson, Chairman and Interim CEO &amp; Interim President, began by addressing the leadership transition, stating \"I stepped into the role of Interim CEO, while Danny is on a medical leave of absence. I'm pleased to share that he's at home recovering well and is in good spirits... He intends to return in the relative near term, but it's too early to have timing visibility at this point.\" Hanson emphasized \"This is a seamless continuation of the strategy and execution you've grown to expect from this team... There's no change in strategy. Our investment in capital allocation strategy, risk management framework, balance sheet posture and long-term value orientation remain unchanged.\"</li>\n<li>Gabriel Willhite, Chief Operating Officer, highlighted \"the fourth quarter capped off another exceptional year of outsized NOI growth for AHR. We delivered total portfolio same-store NOI growth of 11.8% in the fourth quarter and 14.2% for the full year 2025.\" Willhite credited the operating portfolio, especially the Trilogy and SHOP segments, for this performance, noting \"same-store occupancy reached 90.6% in Q4, up 275 basis points year-over-year.\"</li>\n<li>Stefan K. Oh, Chief Investment Officer, reported \"We closed on over $950 million of new investments across our Trilogy and SHOP segments... The majority of our acquisition volume this year was within SHOP, where we added newer assets in attractive submarkets... our SHOP segment as the second largest within our diversified portfolio in terms of cash NOI.\"</li>\n<li>Brian Peay, Chief Financial Officer, stated \"We reported normalized funds from operations attributable to common stockholders, or NFFO of $0.46 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2025 and $1.72 per diluted share for all of 2025. That represents 22% year-over-year NFFO per share growth in 2025 as compared to 2024.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Brian Peay outlined 2026 guidance, stating \"we issued 2026 NFFO guidance of $1.99 to $2.05 per diluted share. This implies another year of double-digit NFFO per share growth and only includes the previously consummated 2026 acquisitions that Stefan mentioned earlier of $117.5 million.\" Peay provided total portfolio same-store NOI growth guidance for 2026 \"between 7% and 11%. That range is comprised of the following segment level same-store NOI growth ranges: 8% to 12% growth in Trilogy, 15% to 19% growth in SHOP, 0% to 2% growth in Outpatient Medical and a range of 2% to 3% growth in our Triple-Net Leased Properties segment.\"</li>\n<li>Management indicated no change in strategy or risk posture from prior quarters.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Peay reported \"normalized funds from operations attributable to common stockholders, or NFFO of $0.46 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2025 and $1.72 per diluted share for all of 2025.\"</li>\n<li>Willhite highlighted \"total portfolio same-store NOI growth of 11.8% in the fourth quarter and 14.2% for the full year 2025.\"</li>\n<li>Trilogy segment delivered \"same-store NOI increased 14% in the fourth quarter and 18.4% for the full year. Same-store occupancy reached 90.6% in Q4, up 275 basis points year-over-year.\"</li>\n<li>SHOP segment \"same-store NOI increased 24.6% in Q4 and 25.2% for 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.\"</li>\n<li>The company improved debt to EBITDA by nearly a full turn in 2025 and ended the year with a 3.4x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Wesley Golladay, Baird, asked about the acquisition environment. Stefan K. Oh responded that the company continues to focus on higher acuity SHOP assets, noting \"for the most part, we're sticking with the higher acuity asset class.\"</li>\n<li>Ronald Kamdem, Morgan Stanley, inquired about SHOP guidance and occupancy. Peay stated \"the more occupied our buildings get, the more pricing power we have. And at 90.6%... we have more and more pricing power.\"</li>\n<li>Kamdem also asked about Trilogy occupancy and mix shift. Willhite explained \"the key thing with Q mix is going to be shifting to the higher payer sources... more people in Medicare setting and Medicare Advantage settings helps and fewer in the Medicaid setting helps.\"</li>\n<li>Austin Wurschmidt, KeyBanc, pressed on Trilogy's NOI growth outlook. Willhite responded \"we've got upside potential that's disproportionate to downside risk... If that trend holds true, then I think you can expect some upside in our occupancy assumptions.\"</li>\n<li>Michael Carroll, RBC, asked about the rollout of the revenue management platform. Willhite said it is \"still too early for us to release the results from it\" but highlighted the collaborative approach with operators.</li>\n<li>Michael Stroyeck, Green Street, asked about seasonality impact on SHOP occupancy. Willhite noted \"through early 2026, we're seeing much less of a flu impact... occupancy is not deeply impacted at least through February.\"</li>\n<li>Stroyeck inquired on triple-net portfolio hospital coverage. Peay said the volatility is due to operational shifts but emphasized the strength of the tenant's commitment and lease guarantee.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts' questions centered on acquisition strategy, occupancy trends, and operational leverage, with a generally positive but probing tone, especially regarding growth sustainability and competitive positioning.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and steady tone, emphasizing continuity, strong operating results, and a robust acquisition pipeline. Hanson stated \"This is a seamless continuation of the strategy and execution you've grown to expect from this team,\" and Peay expressed \"We are entering 2026 from a position of strength.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, sentiment from both analysts and management remains confident, with slightly more focus on the impact of leadership transition and sustainability of growth.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance for 2026 NFFO per diluted share increased to $1.99 to $2.05, compared to previous 2025 guidance of $1.69 to $1.72.</li>\n<li>Total portfolio same-store NOI growth guidance for 2026 set at 7% to 11%, lower than the full year 2025 result of 14.2%.</li>\n<li>SHOP and Trilogy segments continue to be highlighted as key growth drivers, with segment-level guidance reflecting expectations for continued, though moderating, growth.</li>\n<li>Management tone in both quarters emphasized confidence and strategic consistency, but the current quarter provided more detail on leadership continuity due to the CEO’s medical leave.</li>\n<li>Analysts’ focus shifted slightly toward sustainability of high growth rates and implementation of technology-driven revenue management across the portfolio.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management acknowledged the CEO’s medical leave but reassured stakeholders about leadership stability and continuity.</li>\n<li>Willhite discussed seasonality risks, noting flu season had less impact so far in early 2026 but indicated continued monitoring.</li>\n<li>Peay addressed volatility in the triple-net portfolio's hospital coverage, referencing operational changes but emphasizing strong tenant commitment.</li>\n<li>Analysts probed on acquisition timing and competitive dynamics, particularly regarding cap rate compression and asset quality.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>American Healthcare REIT emphasized that its leadership transition has not altered strategic direction or operational focus. The company reported another year of double-digit NFFO growth, driven by strong performance in the Trilogy and SHOP segments, disciplined acquisitions, and a robust pipeline. Guidance for 2026 targets continued growth, supported by high occupancy rates, expanding revenue management initiatives, and an active investment program. Management underscored a position of strength entering the new year, with stable leverage metrics and a clear focus on long-term value creation for shareholders.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ahr/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">President Trump demanded on Friday that U.S. government agencies cut their existing ties with generative artificial intelligence company Anthropic (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANTHRO\" title=\"Anthropic\">ANTHRO</a>) amid a dispute over how its AI models are used. </p>\n<p>“The Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic have made a DISASTROUS MISTAKE trying to STRONG-ARM the Department of War, and force them to obey their Terms of Service instead of our Constitution,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “Their selfishness is putting AMERICAN LIVES at risk, our Troops in danger, and our National Security in JEOPARDY. Therefore, I am directing EVERY Federal Agency in the United States Government to IMMEDIATELY CEASE all use of Anthropic’s technology. We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again! There will be a Six Month phase out period for Agencies like the Department of War who are using Anthropic’s products, at various levels. Anthropic better get their act together, and be helpful during this phase out period, or I will use the Full Power of the Presidency to make them comply, with major civil and criminal consequences to follow.”</p>\n<p>Anthropic on Thursday said that the company “cannot in good conscience” allow the Department of Defense to use its models in all lawful use cases without limitation, adding that the agency’s threats do not change its position.</p>\n<p>“It is the Department’s prerogative to select contractors most aligned with their vision,” CEO Dario Amodei wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-department-of-war\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"statement\">statement</a>. “But given the substantial value that Anthropic’s technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider.”</p>\n<p><span>“Partially autonomous weapons, like those used today in Ukraine, are vital to the defense of democracy. Even </span><em>fully<span> </span></em><span>autonomous weapons (those that take humans out of the loop entirely and automate selecting and engaging targets) may prove critical for our national defense. But today, frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough to power fully autonomous weapons. We will not knowingly provide a product that puts America’s warfighters and civilians at risk,” Amodei added. </span></p>\n<p>The<span> AI </span>startup had been engaged in tense negotiations with the Pentagon lately, and it said Thursday that those discussions were still ongoing. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had threatened to label Anthropic a “supply chain risk” or to invoke the Defense Production Act to force the company to comply with its demands.</p>\n<p><span>Hegseth</span><span> </span>met with <span>Amodei</span><span> </span>at the<span> </span><span>Pentagon</span><span> </span>on Tuesday and gave<span> </span><span>Anthropic</span><span> </span>until Friday evening to accept his agency’s terms. According to a senior Pentagon official, the<span> </span><span>U.S. Department of Defense</span><span> </span>delivered its “last and final offer” to Anthropic on Wednesday night, CNBC reported.</p>\n<p>Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said Thursday that the DoD had “no interest” in using Anthropic’s models for fully autonomous weapons or to conduct mass surveillance of Americans, which he noted is illegal. He emphasized that the agency wants the company to agree to allow its models to be used for “all lawful purposes.”</p>\n<p>“This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk,” Parnell wrote in<span> </span><a href=\"https://x.com/SeanParnellASW/status/2027072228777734474?s=20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a post<span> </span></a>on X on Thursday. “We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”</p>\n<p data-end=\"213\" data-start=\"0\"><span>Anthropic </span>signed a $200M contract with the<span> </span><span>United States Department of Defense</span><span> </span>in July, becoming the first lab to deploy its models in mission workflows on classified networks. Rivals<span> </span><span>OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>)</span>,<span> </span><span>Google</span><span> </span>(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a></span>) (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a></span>), and <span>xAI</span><span> </span>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/X.AI\" title=\"xAI\">X.AI</a>) also received DoD awards worth up to $200M last year.</p>\n<div><div data-module=\"mps-slot\" id=\"MidResponsive-1\"></div></div>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: MidCap Financial Investment Corporation (MFIC) (mfic) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Tanner Powell reported net investment income per share of $0.39 and a GAAP net loss per share of $0.14 for the quarter, noting that the loss included $0.04 of onetime financing-related expenses. He stated that \"NAV per share was $14.18 at the end of December, down 3.3% compared to the prior quarter,\" attributing the decline to investments from 2022 and earlier. Powell emphasized the company’s focus on first lien positions, low software exposure, and cautious use of PIK, adding that recent paydowns from Merx and the full repayment of a nonaccrual position highlighted MFIC’s ability to \"maximize recoveries on challenged credits.\"</li>\n<li>Powell announced the repurchase of approximately 1.1 million shares at an average discount of 18%, costing $12.9 million and generating $0.03 per share of NAV accretion. He further revealed that the Board authorized a new $100 million stock repurchase plan, stating, \"we expect to utilize aggressively in combination with a 10b5-1 trading plan to capitalize on what we believe is a compelling opportunity for our stockholders.\"</li>\n<li>The Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share, with Powell explaining, \"we have reassessed the long-term earnings power of the company, and the Board has concluded that it was prudent to adjust the dividend at this time.\"</li>\n<li>President Ted McNulty detailed $141 million in new commitments with a weighted average spread of 497 basis points and net fundings for the quarter of $25 million. He also highlighted the portfolio's diversification across 247 companies and 46 industries, with direct origination representing 96% of the portfolio.</li>\n<li>CFO Kenneth Seifert reported, \"Total investment income for the December quarter was approximately $78.4 million, a decline of $4.2 million or 5.1% from the prior quarter. This reduction was largely driven by lower interest income resulting from decreased base rates, new nonaccrual positions and continued asset spread compression.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul><li>Management expects to fully utilize the $107.9 million in current stock repurchase authorization by late May if current discount and trading volumes persist. Powell indicated confidence in maintaining the new $0.31 dividend, citing expected repayments, especially from Merx, and recent capital structure initiatives to reduce the cost of capital as factors that \"cushion the dividend.\"</li></ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul><li>Net investment income per share was $0.39, and GAAP net loss per share was $0.14, or $0.10 excluding onetime financing costs. NAV per share declined to $14.18. Total investment income decreased to $78.4 million due to lower base rates, new nonaccruals, and spread compression. Net expenses fell to $42.4 million, driven by the absence of incentive fees and lower interest expense. The portfolio had a net loss of $45.3 million, with negative performance contributions from LendingPoint, Renovo, Amplity, Bird Rides, New Era, and Banner Solutions. Positive contributions included Merx and Compass Health. The cost of debt declined to 5.95% from 6.37% in the prior quarter.</li></ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Richard Shane, JPMorgan: Asked about the persistence of stock discounts and whether more aggressive strategies to unlock value were under consideration. Powell replied, \"we'll continue to consider everything with an eye towards just sort of making sure that like the shareholders get the full value that we feel like they're entitled to in whatever form we can get it to them.\"</li>\n<li>Kenneth Lee, RBC: Questioned the discretionary nature of the new $100 million repurchase and dividend sustainability. Powell confirmed repurchase flexibility and use of a 10b5-1 plan. On the dividend, Powell stated, \"when we looked at the earnings power and we looked at the models, $0.31 was appropriate and achievable,\" citing progress with Merx and reduced capital costs as supporting factors.</li>\n<li>Robert Dodd, Raymond James: Sought insight into MFIC’s below-average software leverage and portfolio construction. Executive Chairman Howard Widra explained the focus on companies with more embedded performance consistency and fewer aggressive growth strategies, while Powell highlighted that \"90% has financial covenants\" in the software book.</li>\n<li>Casey Alexander, Compass Point: Asked about the commonality among underperforming credits. Widra characterized them as \"longer-dated credits that have -- many of which have had been on watch list,\" with Powell adding these credits often have \"idiosyncratic issues... sometimes compounded by some of those pockets of stress and in particular, some self-induced such as acquisition strategies...\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed management on stock repurchase strategy, dividend sustainability, and portfolio risk, reflecting a slightly skeptical but constructive tone.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a measured confidence in prepared remarks, but showed more caution on dividend outlook and persistent market discounts during Q&amp;A, using phrases such as \"we'll continue to consider everything\" and \"when we looked at the earnings power...$0.31 was appropriate and achievable.\" Compared to last quarter, there was an increase in defensive language and acknowledgment of external pressures.</li>\n<li>The overall tone was more cautious than the previous quarter, with management more openly addressing risks and the sustainability of shareholder returns.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Dividend reduced from $0.38 to $0.31 per share, attributed to lower base rates and spread compression. NAV per share fell further, and net investment income per share increased slightly from $0.38 to $0.39, but GAAP earnings swung from a $0.29 profit to a $0.14 loss.</li>\n<li>Stock repurchase activity intensified, with a new $100 million plan announced, compared to a more passive approach last quarter.</li>\n<li>Portfolio yield and spread compressed, and the cost of debt declined following refinancing efforts.</li>\n<li>Analysts shifted focus from M&amp;A opportunities and portfolio leverage last quarter to more pointed questions on share buybacks, dividend policy, and software risk exposure.</li>\n<li>Management’s tone shifted from highlighting resilience and opportunity to more directly addressing challenges in earnings power and persistent market discounts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Persistent market discounts to NAV and the challenge of unlocking shareholder value were flagged by both analysts and management.</li>\n<li>Lower base rates and spread compression continue to pressure earnings power and dividend coverage.</li>\n<li>Portfolio risk is exemplified by legacy investments from earlier vintages, with management noting \"idiosyncratic issues\" and self-induced challenges, particularly relating to acquisition strategies.</li>\n<li>The software portfolio’s modest leverage and high covenant quality were presented as mitigants to sector-specific risk, but management acknowledged selectivity and market caution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>MFIC management emphasized a proactive approach to addressing persistent market discounts through an aggressive $100 million stock repurchase plan, while recalibrating the dividend to $0.31 per share in response to reduced earnings power from lower base rates and spread compression. The company’s portfolio remains primarily first lien with limited software exposure and robust covenant quality, but legacy investments continue to weigh on NAV. Management underscored ongoing efforts to maximize recoveries, reduce capital costs, and assure shareholders that all strategies to unlock value are under consideration in a challenging market environment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/mfic/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
