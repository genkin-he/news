            "description": "<html><body><p>Investors should look beyond U.S. markets (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SP500</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COMP:IND\" title=\"NASDAQ Composite Index\">COMP:IND</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJI\" title=\"Dow Jones Industrial Average Index\">DJI</a>) for significant growth opportunities in the coming years, according to Mary Ann Bartels, chief investment strategist at Sanctuary Wealth.</p>\n<p>In an interview with CNBC, Bartels emphasized her firm’s strategic focus on international exposure, stating investors should look into non-U.S. markets including emerging markets, and add exposure there.</p>\n<p>The weakening of the dollar (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DXY\" title=\"US Dollar Index\">DXY</a>) has provided an additional boost to international investment returns, though Bartels predicts potential dollar strengthening ahead.</p>\n<p>“I think you can get a substantial rally in the dollar (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DXY\" title=\"US Dollar Index\">DXY</a>) and a weakening in the euro,” she said, suggesting currency dynamics will play an important role in investment strategies moving forward.</p>\n<p>Bartels painted an optimistic picture for global equity markets, particularly highlighting opportunities outside the U.S. “When we’re looking at Europe (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VGK\" title=\"Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF\">VGK</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IEV\" title=\"iShares Europe ETF\">IEV</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IEUR\" title=\"iShares Core MSCI Europe ETF\">IEUR</a>), when we’re

ETF\">EEMA</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAXJ\" title=\"iShares MSCI All Country Asia ex Japan ETF\">AAXJ</a>), you’re just entering a new secular bull market,” she explained, distinguishing these regions from the more mature market cycle in the U.S.</p>\n<p>The strategist expressed extraordinary confidence in global market performance over the medium term.</p>\n<p>“I think the runway for equity performance, out for the next five years plus, is quite extraordinary,” Bartels said, suggesting markets have not fully accounted for the earnings potential that will emerge on a global scale beyond just the U.S.</p>\n<p>Technology and AI remain central to Bartels’s investment thesis, with semiconductors (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMH\" title=\"VanEck Semiconductor ETF\">SMH</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SOXX\" title=\"iShares Semiconductor ETF\">SOXX</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XSD\" title=\"SPDR® S&amp;P Semiconductor ETF\">XSD</a>) driving global economic transformation.</p>\n<p>“AI is the new transformation and build out on a global scale that we really haven’t seen since the U.S. built out its railroads or had the invention of the steam engine,” she said, emphasizing that this trend will continue to drive markets “going into the end of the decade.”</p>\n<p>More Emerging Market ETFs: (<a

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Standex International Corporation (SXI) Q1 2026</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>David Dunbar, Chairman, President &amp; CEO, opened by stating that \"our first quarter performance provided a strong start to the fiscal year, positioning us well to exceed our previously provided guidance of greater than $100 million of incremental sales in fiscal year 2026, which includes organic growth in our core businesses as well as the full year impact of acquisitions.\" He highlighted new product sales growth of more than 35% to approximately $14.5 million and sales in fast-growth markets reaching approximately $62 million, representing 30% of total sales. Orders of approximately $226 million marked the highest quarterly intake ever. Dunbar announced, \"we are raising our fiscal year 2026 sales outlook. Barring unforeseen economics, global trade or tariffs-related disruptions we now expect revenue to grow by over $110 million, $10 million more than we communicated last quarter.\" He also detailed the renaming of Amran/Narayan as Standex Electronics Grid and noted that operations have started in Croatia and Mexico.</li>\n<li>CFO Ademir Sarcevic reported, \"total revenue increased approximately 27.6% year-on-year to $217.4 million... adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points year-on-year to 19.1%.\" Sarcevic added, \"adjusted earnings per share increased 8.2% year-on-year to $1.99. Net cash provided by operating activities was $16.8 million... Capital expenditures were $6.4 million... we generated fiscal first quarter free cash flow of $10.4 million.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul><li>Management raised the fiscal 2026 sales outlook, expecting revenue to grow by over $110 million, citing strong momentum from new product sales and fast-growth market expansion, particularly Standex Electronics Grid. The company expects new product sales to contribute approximately 300 basis points of incremental sales growth and plans to launch more than 15 new products in fiscal 2026. Sales from fast-growth markets are now expected to grow over 45% year-on-year and exceed $270 million. Dunbar stated, \"on a year-on-year basis, in fiscal second quarter 2026, we expect significantly higher revenue driven by mid-single-digit organic growth and contributions from recent acquisitions and similar adjusted operating margin due to higher growth investments and less favorable product mix.\"</li></ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul><li>Standex reported consolidated revenue of $217.4 million, an increase of 27.6% year-on-year, with a 26.6% benefit from recent acquisitions. Adjusted operating income increased 43.3%, and adjusted earnings per share rose 8.2% to $1.99. Free cash flow was $10.4 million, and the net leverage ratio improved to 2.4x. Electronics segment revenue was $110.6 million, up 42.2% year-on-year, with an adjusted operating margin of 28.8%. Engineering Technologies revenue increased 45.6% to $29.9 million, while Scientific revenue increased 9.9% to $19.5 million. Engraving revenue rose 7.4% to $35.8 million, and Specialty Solutions revenue was $21.7 million. The company declared a $0.34 per share dividend, a 6.3% year-on-year increase.</li></ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Christopher Moore, CJS Securities, Inc.: Asked about further optimization and focus areas. Dunbar responded that the \"greatest value creation will come from realizing the potential of the organic growth initiatives... that momentum will get us there.\"</li>\n<li>Moore: Sought details on standout new products. Dunbar highlighted electronics products for relays and test applications, and Scientific’s ultra-low temperature freezer.</li>\n<li>Moore: Inquired about Amran/Narayan growth sustainability. Dunbar stated, \"we are not seeing a slowdown in growth... the end market remains strong, driven by electrification, modernization of grid and continued spend in data centers.\"</li>\n<li>Ross Sparenblek, William Blair: Focused on Electronics momentum and legacy business order growth. Dunbar noted strong bookings in defense and test and measurement, with strength across geographies and product lines. Sarcevic confirmed, \"book-to-bill for all of those businesses has been over 1.\"</li>\n<li>Sparenblek: Asked about margin expectations and cost savings. Sarcevic explained margin improvement will be offset by growth investments, but \"there should be some natural lift there.\"</li>\n<li>Michael Shlisky, D.A. Davidson: Asked about Electronics branding. Dunbar described the rebranding to Grid, Edge, and Detect for business clarity and expansion.</li>\n<li>Shlisky: Queried on government impact. Dunbar saw no recent rapid changes but acknowledged NIH funding cuts affecting Scientific.</li>\n<li>Gary Prestopino, Barrington Research: Asked about fast-growth drivers and new product overlap. Dunbar clarified about half of fast-growth sales relate to data centers and grid, and new products will increasingly target fast-growth markets.</li>\n<li>Matt Koranda, ROTH Capital Partners: Inquired about Amran/Narayan book-to-bill and portfolio simplification. Dunbar and Sarcevic indicated book-to-bill above 1 and that simplification actions are ongoing, with financial flexibility building for future acquisitions.</li>\n<li>Sparenblek (follow-up): Questioned Engraving margin potential. Sarcevic stated, \"that 20% margin number... is within reach, and we feel very confident that when the market comes back with some strength that we'll be able to surpass the 20% as well.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed on growth sustainability, margin realization, new product impact, and portfolio optimization, with a neutral to slightly positive tone, probing for future upside and execution risks.</li>\n<li>Management’s tone was confident and optimistic during prepared remarks and Q&amp;A, emphasizing strong order momentum, successful integration, and growth investments. Dunbar stated, \"we see no slowdown right now,\" and Sarcevic highlighted, \"the momentum continues.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to last quarter, the sentiment remains confident, with management providing more specific upward revisions to guidance and continued positive outlook on growth drivers, while analysts continue to probe sustainability and operational execution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul><li>Guidance for fiscal 2026 sales was raised from over $100 million to over $110 million in incremental growth, reflecting increased confidence from new product and fast-growth market momentum. Sales in fast-growth markets and new product launches are both revised upward, with fast-growth sales now expected to exceed $270 million, compared to $265 million previously. Management’s tone remains confident, building on prior quarter’s record performance, while analysts’ focus remains on validating the sustainability of growth and margin expansion. The strategic focus on new products and grid technologies continues, but with greater emphasis on geographic expansion and operational execution. Margin expectations are tempered by increased investment and product mix, compared to the prior quarter’s focus on margin expansion.</li></ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul><li>Management cited potential risks from unforeseen economic, global trade or tariffs-related disruptions. Scientific remains impacted by NIH funding cuts, with management not expecting recovery in that segment. Tariff and sourcing risks are being managed through alternative sourcing and pricing strategies. Analysts continued to raise questions about sustainability of growth, capacity utilization, and the impact of funding and macroeconomic factors.</li></ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Standex International Corporation began fiscal 2026 with accelerating momentum from new product launches and robust growth in fast-growth markets, particularly within its renamed Standex Electronics Grid business. Management raised its full-year sales outlook to more than $110 million in incremental revenue, driven by continued integration of acquisitions, capacity expansions in Croatia and Mexico, and record order intake. The company remains focused on executing its organic growth initiatives, investing in product innovation, and optimizing its business portfolio while closely monitoring macroeconomic and funding risks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/sxi/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Ingersoll Rand (IR) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Vicente Reynal, Chairman, CEO &amp; President, opened with, \"In a dynamic macro environment, we continue to deliver durable growth driven by disciplined execution and the strength of IRX. Year-to-date, organic orders are up 2% with a book-to-bill of 1.04x.\" He highlighted a robust M&amp;A pipeline, noting, \"Year-to-date, we have executed with both pace and precision, closing 14 transactions with 9 additional transactions under LOI.\" Reynal emphasized the acquisition of Dave Barry Plastics as a complementary addition to the Life Science platform.</li>\n<li>Vikram Kini, Senior VP &amp; CFO, stated, \"Orders showed continued strength in the third quarter, up 8% year-over-year or up 2% organically with a book-to-bill of 0.99x.\" Kini added, \"The company delivered third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $545 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.9%.\" He also noted cost optimization measures and a share repurchase of $193 million in Q3.</li>\n<li>Reynal announced, \"We're very excited to announce a game-changing leap in our innovation journey...our META Contact Cool Compressor...offers unmatched best-in-class efficiency.\" He also affirmed the company's commitment to long-term adjusted EBITDA margin targets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The company maintained full year guidance for total revenue and organic volume growth but reduced the midpoint of adjusted EBITDA guidance to $2.075 billion, citing \"the effect of incremental Section 232 tariffs and other tariff increases announced in August\" as well as delayed price realization due to backlog growth.</li>\n<li>Adjusted EPS guidance was lowered to $3.28 from $3.40. Reynal stated, \"Our revised view of 2025 incorporates a prudent view of Q4 based on both the timing of tariffs and price realization.\"</li>\n<li>The company expects both segments' adjusted EBITDA margin percentage to be \"approximately flat on a sequential basis compared to the third quarter.\"</li>\n<li>Guidance does not reflect potential tariff reductions announced the day prior to the call.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 was $545 million with a margin of 27.9%.</li>\n<li>Adjusted earnings per share was $0.86 for the quarter, up 2% year-over-year and up 11% on a 2-year stack.</li>\n<li>Free cash flow for Q3 was $326 million, described as \"approximately flat year-over-year on a year-to-date basis.\"</li>\n<li>Leverage increased to 1.8x, attributed to capital deployment including $249 million in M&amp;A and $193 million in share repurchases in Q3.</li>\n<li>PST segment delivered adjusted EBITDA of $128 million with a margin of 30.8%, showing sequential and year-over-year improvement.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Michael Halloran, Baird: Asked about end market momentum and regional trends. Reynal responded, \"Q3...was positive across all regions, except basically the vacuum and blower business in Europe...the trend continues to improve.\"</li>\n<li>Julian Mitchell, Barclays: Inquired about muted incremental EBITDA margins and 2026 outlook. Kini answered, \"The biggest driver is just the impact of tariffs...gross margins have effectively been flat across the board.\"</li>\n<li>Jeffrey Sprague, Vertical Research: Asked for the gross tariff headwind. Kini replied, \"In our last call, we said approximately $80 million in year. What we'll say here is that, that number is slightly in excess of $100 million at this point in time.\"</li>\n<li>Andrew Kaplowitz, Citi: Queried about clean energy as a vertical. Reynal noted, \"Some of the tough comps on clean energy are kind of gone...clean energy...continues to be a good end market.\"</li>\n<li>Nicole DeBlase, Deutsche Bank: Asked about cost actions. Kini confirmed, \"We have taken actions. I would call them somewhat normal course in the context of prudent cost measures...largely headcount oriented as opposed to footprint.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts frequently pressed on the impact of tariffs, margin progression, and backlog dynamics, with a slightly negative to neutral tone, seeking clarity on headwinds and pricing realization.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a neutral to slightly positive tone in prepared remarks, emphasizing resilience and strong execution, but demonstrated more caution and defensiveness during Q&amp;A, especially regarding tariffs and margin outlook. Kini used phrases such as \"we feel quite comfortable that with the pricing and the operational mitigation actions...we have those covered.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, analyst skepticism increased around guidance reductions and tariff impacts. Management demonstrated less confidence in outlook, shifting from optimism to a more prudent tone.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance shifted from an increase in adjusted EPS in Q2 ($3.40 midpoint) to a reduction in Q3 ($3.28 midpoint), primarily due to tariff-related margin dilution and delayed price realization.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus continued on bolt-on M&amp;A, with the pace of dealmaking accelerating (14 transactions closed YTD in Q3 vs. 11 YTD in Q2).</li>\n<li>Analysts in both quarters focused on tariffs, M&amp;A execution, and margin trajectory, but concerns intensified in Q3 as management explicitly acknowledged larger tariff headwinds ($100 million+ vs. $80 million in Q2).</li>\n<li>Management's tone became more cautious, emphasizing temporary headwinds and cost controls, compared with a more optimistic and growth-focused approach last quarter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Tariff-related margin headwinds were a central challenge, with management stating, \"the effect of incremental Section 232 tariffs and other tariff increases announced in August\" as a key factor in reduced guidance.</li>\n<li>Delayed pricing realization due to growing backlog was cited as contributing to near-term margin pressure.</li>\n<li>Analysts questioned the sustainability of margin expansion, the timing of price-cost equilibrium, and the effectiveness of cost actions.</li>\n<li>Management discussed ongoing cost optimization, headcount actions, and operational tariff mitigation as strategies to address risks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Management highlighted disciplined execution and a robust M&amp;A engine as drivers of durable growth, while acknowledging that increased tariffs and timing of price realization have pressured near-term margins and led to a reduction in full-year EPS guidance. The company remains focused on delivering long-term margin targets, leveraging innovation, and maintaining agility in a dynamic market environment, emphasizing confidence in its strategy and the resilience of its business model despite macro headwinds.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ir/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

Stansbury explained, \"business mix continues to improve, which means the rate of decline continues to improve... the big driver... is the modernization and simplification efforts.\"</li>\n<li>Frank Louthan, Raymond James: Probed revenue impacts from ecosystem partnerships. Johnson said, \"the connected ecosystem is a part of the storyboard of how we have confidence in getting to $500 million to $600 million incremental revenue exiting '28.\"</li>\n<li>Gregory Williams, TD Cowen: Asked about equity issuance and the AI phase timeline.

Johnson stated, \"we will demote the old-school analog version of that service and prioritize it in terms of engineering resources, marketing resource, sales resource and operations resource.\"</li>\n<li>Michael Funk, BofA: Asked about Lumen's departure from traditional telecom models. Stansbury explained, \"traditional telecom was a battlefield of every single services requiring its own infrastructure layer... That's not what we're doing... we're monetizing what is the most modern, the most high capacity, the fastest network by adding a digital layer in an ecosystem layer.\"</li>\n<li>Jonathan Atkin, RBC: Explored off-net NaaS capabilities and M&amp;A.

Management underscored balance sheet improvements and a disciplined approach to digital transformation, including major ecosystem partnerships and scalable NaaS adoption.

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Silvercrest Asset Management Group Inc. (SAMG) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Richard Hough, CEO, President &amp; Chairman, reported that discretionary assets under management (AUM) increased $687 million during the third quarter, attributing the growth primarily to beneficial equity markets. New client account flows were highlighted, with $46.4 million added in organic new client accounts during the quarter and $564 million year-to-date through Q3. Hough stated, “Discretionary AUM now stands at $24.3 billion, which is a 3% sequential quarterly increase and an increase of 8% year-over-year.” He further noted, “Total AUM at the end of the third quarter did hit a new high for the firm at $37.6 billion.”</p></li>\n<li><p>Hough emphasized, “Silvercrest has embarked on significant strategic investments to promote growth opportunities,” with a focus on intellectual capital and headcount, which has led to substantially lower earnings and adjusted EBITDA in the near-term.</p></li>\n<li><p>He announced an ongoing $25 million buyback program, stating, “As of the end of the third quarter of 2025, we have repurchased approximately $16 million worth of shares.” He also referenced a dividend of $0.21 per share set to be paid in December and plans to distribute equity incentives to professionals in the near future.</p></li>\n<li><p>CFO Scott Gerard reported, “Revenue for the quarter was $31.3 million and reported consolidated net income for the quarter was $1.1 million.” Gerard added, “Expenses for the quarter increased year-over-year by $4 million or 15.4%, primarily driven by increased compensation and benefits expense and general and administrative expenses.”</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Hough indicated that, “Assuming supportive markets and continued business development, we hope discretionary AUM will exceed all-time highs in the coming quarters.” He also described a plan to adjust nondiscretionary AUM reporting in 2026 to provide clearer business metrics.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management expects the compensation ratio to remain elevated for the foreseeable future due to ongoing investments in personnel and global marketing.</p></li>\n<li><p>The firm’s pipeline remains “robust, in particular with regards to our new global value equity strategy.” Hough highlighted, “We could see even some reasonable allocations in the fourth quarter or first quarter coming up here… which would obviously cover about 6 months.”</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Gerard reported, “Revenue for the quarter increased $0.9 million or 2.9% year-over-year.” Compensation and benefits expense rose $3.1 million or 16.8% year-over-year, influenced by both merit-based increases and new hires, and an increase in the accrual for bonuses.</p></li>\n<li><p>General and administrative expenses climbed $0.9 million or approximately 11.9% year-over-year, attributed to professional fees, occupancy, and recruiting costs.</p></li>\n<li><p>Reported net income attributable to Class A shareholders for the quarter was $0.6 million or $0.07 per basic and diluted Class A share. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.5 million or 14.5% of revenue for the quarter. Adjusted net income was $2.4 million or $0.19 per adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share.</p></li>\n<li><p>As of September 30, total assets stood at $157.6 million, with cash and cash equivalents at $36.1 million. No borrowings were reported, and total Class A stockholders’ equity was $58.9 million. The company repurchased $4.6 million worth of Class A shares during the quarter.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Christopher Marinac, Janney Montgomery Scott: “Do we think about this as maybe an 18-, 24-month time frame? Or is it any way to kind of give visibility on that?” Hough responded that the bulk of investments have been recent and that, “you’re looking at a longer time horizon of 18 to 24 months,” but also expects shorter-term flows in the next 6 to 12 months from the global value equity strategy.</p></li>\n<li><p>Marinac: “Are any of those [professional fees] temporary? Or will you have new professional fees to kind of cover in future periods?” Gerard replied, “Some of them are temporary, especially related to some of our global initiatives.”</p></li>\n<li><p>Marinac: “Does the EBITDA margin get recast because it’s now going to be a different company with a different broader focus?” Hough answered, “You look out further and it gets back to where it was barring any other new investments.”</p></li>\n<li><p>Sandy Mehta, Evaluate Research: “Can you just give us a little bit more color on what you’re seeing from a marketing perspective, the pipeline and what clients are saying or consultants are saying, what do you see out there on Global?” Hough described the pipeline as “very large” in international and global areas and noted, “our new centralized institutional marketing team and process has been highly engaged both with very significant sovereign pools of capital.”</p></li>\n<li><p>Mehta: “Is most of the hiring done at this point of the senior people that you were hiring? Is that pace of incremental hires? Is that going to slow down?” Hough responded that most hiring for new equity strategy and institutional team is complete but further hires are expected for Europe, Asia, and domestically.</p></li>\n<li><p>Mehta: “Where are you in terms of OCIO assets, currently?” Hough reported, “OCIO is almost $2.2 billion and has a very strong pipeline.”</p></li>\n<li><p>Mehta: “Do you disclose what price you bought the stock?” Hough stated, “We don’t disclose it. I will say that it has been, from our thinking, a very, very favorable price.”</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Analysts’ tone was generally neutral to slightly positive, focusing on the timing of returns from investments, the sustainability of professional fees, and the scale of hiring. Follow-up questions probed operating leverage and the trajectory of margins but did not express skepticism or overt concern.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management maintained a confident tone, emphasizing the potential payoff from recent investments: “The potential is very large. And I’m quite confident that it is going to pay off and that we will be able to report meaningful progress soon.” Hough acknowledged the longer time horizon but was optimistic about near-term flows and future profitability.</p></li>\n<li><p>Compared to the previous quarter, the current call reflected continued confidence in strategic initiatives, with management reiterating optimism about organic growth while acknowledging ongoing expense pressures and a longer investment payback period.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Guidance continues to anticipate future record AUM levels, with management expecting discretionary AUM to exceed all-time highs in coming quarters, similar to the positive outlook last quarter.</p></li>\n<li><p>Strategic focus remains on organic growth through international expansion, global value equity strategies, and headcount investments. The firm has moved from announcing new strategic hires to discussing the absorption and expected payoff of those investments.</p></li>\n<li><p>Analysts’ questions shifted slightly from pipeline measurement and the pace of buybacks (Q2) to the timing of investment returns, margin recovery, and hiring trajectory (Q3), reflecting growing interest in when strategic investments will convert to earnings growth.</p></li>\n<li><p>Key metrics reflect moderate sequential growth in AUM and revenue, but a noticeable decline in net income and EBITDA margin due to higher compensation and G&amp;A expenses.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management’s confidence level is steady, with ongoing emphasis on the size and quality of the pipeline and the robustness of international initiatives.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Management highlighted elevated compensation and G&amp;A expenses as ongoing challenges, tied to strategic hires and global expansion.</p></li>\n<li><p>Analysts inquired about the possibility of continued high professional fees and whether the pace of hiring would slow, indicating concern about expense management relative to revenue realization.</p></li>\n<li><p>Hough acknowledged that the timeline for investment returns is variable, with most hiring complete for current initiatives but further additions expected internationally and domestically.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Silvercrest Asset Management Group continues to invest heavily in its global and institutional capabilities, with discretionary AUM and total AUM both reaching new highs. Management is confident that recent investments in talent and international expansion will result in accelerated organic growth over the next 18 to 24 months, with a robust pipeline supporting future revenue. Expense pressures are expected to remain elevated in the near term, but the firm anticipates a return to higher margins as new business flows materialize. Investors should watch for updates on realized flows from global strategies and continued progress in international markets as key drivers for future earnings and AUM growth.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/samg/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",
