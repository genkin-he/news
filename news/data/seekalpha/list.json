Vacancy, which peaked at around roughly 34% in 2023, has since fallen into the low- to high-20s percentage range depending on the specific stretch of Michigan Avenue, signaling meaningful backfilling of space.</p>\n<p>Analysts project retail leasing volume on Michigan Avenue could roughly double in 2026, with more than 100,000 square feet of absorption expected, suggesting that the rebound is moving into a more active phase as the deals signed in 2024–2025 begin to open.</p>\n<p>New and returning tenants include fashion and specialty retailers such as Mango, Uniqlo, Aritzia, Alo Yoga, Intimissimi, and The North Face, which are opening or relocating flagship-style stores along the avenue and helping to restore some of its historic appeal as a national and international brand corridor. Meanwhile, Gap (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GAP\" title=\"The Gap, Inc.\">GAP</a>) is in advanced talks to lease about 8,325 square feet on Michigan Avenue. Larger multi-story boxes that were particularly difficult to lease after the pandemic and crime issues are increasingly being taken by experiential users, including a Harry Potter-themed interactive store/exhibit and other immersive or technology-driven attractions aimed at tourists and families.</p>\n<p>Analysts think if the recovery extends, the Magnificent Mile's vacancy could move into the mid-teens by around 2027–2028 and potentially below 10% by 2030, implying a long but improving trajectory rather than a sharp snapback.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
