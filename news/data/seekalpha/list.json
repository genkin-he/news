It also noted that shareholder returns in terms of buyback are likely to decline going forward due to the investments for connectivity and platforms division, ramping NBA costs, and Versant spinoff.</p>\n<p>KeyBanc pointed out that Comcast's broadband penetration rate has fallen for 14 consecutive quarters, and hence they need to see signs of stabilization before becoming more constructive on the company.</p>\n<p>\"Competitive concerns in broadband are likely to continue for the foreseeable future as telecom providers ramp fiber and FWA offerings over the next several years, where it's uncertain if and when Comcast will return to broadband subscriber growth,\" the research firm said in its analysis dated October 30.</p>\n<p>\"While CMCSA is inexpensive ... we think it's clearly trading there for a reason, as competitive concerns are elevated and investment is needed to hopefully return CMCSA to competitive positioning,\" KeyBanc said.</p>\n<p>The research firm currently does not have a price target for CMCSA.</p>\n</body></html>",

Management noted early signs of recovery in polyolefins demand, with U.S. polyethylene volumes rebounding after two sluggish years and European volumes climbing roughly 3% year-to-date.</p>\n<p>For the third quarter, the company reported a net loss of $890 million, or $2.77 a share, compared with a profit of $573 million a year earlier. Results included about $1.2 billion in non-cash asset impairments and restructuring charges, mostly tied to its European operations. LyondellBasell (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LYB\" title=\"LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\">LYB</a>) said ongoing regulatory pressures in Europe have prompted it and other producers to streamline operations and trim costs.</p>\n<p>As part of a broader portfolio overhaul, the company has secured approval to sell four European assets and plans short maintenance shutdowns at plants in Germany and Texas to align with market conditions.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, management warned that typical seasonal softness and higher feedstock prices could compress margins in the fourth quarter. Still, the company expects recent capacity reductions in China, Japan, South Korea and Europe to help restore global supply balance.</p>\n<p>On an adjusted basis, earnings were $1.01 a share, topping the analyst consensus of $0.80 compiled by S&amp;P Global Intelligence.</p>\n</body></html>",
