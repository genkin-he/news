These defining milestones reinforce our confidence in our growth trajectory and our market leadership position.” <span> </span></p>\n<p>The results also reflect the company’s use of AI to assist in identifying the highest value supply opportunities and for more accurate valuation estimates. This provides consignors with a more realistic expectation of earnings and strengthens the company’s position as a “trusted advisor.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the company transitioned buyers into sellers more effectively.</p>\n<p>“By turning buyers into sellers, we're acquiring supply more cost effectively while deepening the loyalty of our community. We accelerated new buyer growth in Q4, and we believe it's a positive catalyst for future supply,” Levesque said on the company’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4876029-the-realreal-inc-real-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"earnings call.\">earnings call.</a></p>\n<p>Despite efforts by luxury brands to limit what can and cannot be sold on resellers’ websites and strict limitations how these brands can be advertised, The RealReal (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/REAL\" title=\"The RealReal, Inc.\">REAL</a>) generated 18% more sales in the<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558232-the-realreal-non-gaap-eps-of-0_06-beats-by-0_02-revenue-of-194_05m-beats-by-3_33m\" target=\"_blank\" title=\" final quarter of the year, \"> final quarter of the year, </a> as GMV increased 22%, contributing to a profit of $0.06 per share from a loss of $0.01 in the same quarter last year. This was 2 cents better than anticipated and demonstrates the appeal of second-hand – and more affordable — luxury items. <span>  </span></p>\n<p>Stripping out depreciation, amortization, interest expenses and taxes, The RealReal (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/REAL\" title=\"The RealReal, Inc.\">REAL</a>) earned a profit of $22M, doubling from a year earlier and resulting in a margin of 11.3% versus 6.7% in the same quarter last year.</p>\n<p>For the current quarter, the company expects sales to be between $185M and $189M versus $188.7M estimates, and expects revenue of $765M and $780M for the year compared to $768.5M estimates.</p>\n<p>For Q1, GMV is seen between $585M and $600M and adjusted EBITDA of $11M to $13M. This compares to $490M and $4.1M in the same quarter last year, respectively.</p>\n<p>For FY26, GMV is expected to be within a range of $2.39B and $2.45B and adjusted EBITDA between $57M and $65M, both of which are seen increasing from $2.13B and $42M in FY25, respectively.</p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

During Q4 2025, it reported a net change in unrealized losses of $31.9M and a net change in realized losses at $16.8M. That led to a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of -$12.7M vs. $24.1M in Q3.</p>\n<p>During Q4, the BDC put investments in Bird Rides, Banner Solutions, and Renovo on non-accrual status, meaning it no longer expects to collect interest on them. However, non-accrual investments as a percentage of MidCap's total portfolio declined to 2.6% in Q4 2025 from 3.1% in Q3.</p>\n<p>The company's net asset value ((NAV)) per share at Dec. 31, 2025, fell 3.3% to $14.18 from $14.66 as of Sept. 30, 2025, mostly driven by a \"handful of investments predominantly from 2022 and earlier vintages.\"</p>\n<p>With the pressure on some parts of the software sector, MidCap (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MFIC\" title=\"MidCap Financial Investment Corporation\">MFIC</a>) decided to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558577-midcap-financial-investment-dividend-declines-by-184-to-031\" target=\"_blank\" title=\" cut its quarterly dividend \"> cut its quarterly dividend </a>by 18% to $0.31 per share</p>\n<p>\"<span>In light of changes in base rates and other factors, we have re-assessed the long-term earnings power of the company, and the Board has concluded that it was prudent to adjust the dividend at this time,\" said CEO Tanner Powell. </span></p>\n<p><span>With the evolving market conditions, MidCap shifted to stock buybacks to boost its NAV. \"During the fourth quarter, the market presented us with what we viewed as an attractive opportunity to repurchase MFIC stock at a significant discount to NAV, generating approximately three cents per share of NAV accretion for stockholders,\" Powell said. \"At these trading levels, we continue to believe allocating capital toward stock repurchases is more accretive than deploying capital into new investments.\" </span></p>\n<p><span>MidCap Financial (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MFIC\" title=\"MidCap Financial Investment Corporation\">MFIC</a>) announced a plan to buy back up to $100M of its stock in addition to the $7.9M of capacity that remains under its existing stock repurchase authorization.</span></p>\n<p><span>MidCap President and Chief Investment Officer Ted McNulty pointed out that its exposure to software, at 11.4% of MFIC's portfolio at fair value, is “meaningfully lower” than the broader BDC industry. \"We have constructed a portfolio that we believe is relatively resilient to AI-related risks, with an emphasis on businesses that have long-standing, entrenched customer relationships,\" he said.</span><span></span></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
