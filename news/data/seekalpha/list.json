            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Rithm Capital (RITM) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Michael Nierenberg, Chairman, President &amp; CEO, opened the call highlighting strong performance across all business lines, stating \"Our company had a great quarter with all of our business lines performing extremely well. Our market-leading business lines that enabled us to get here, Newrez, our mortgage company... Genesis, our construction lender... and our investment portfolio and team all had a really good quarter.\"</li>\n<li>The company reported the acquisition of Crestline, a credit manager with $18-$20 billion in AUM, and Paramount, a large office REIT with properties in New York and San Francisco. Nierenberg emphasized, \"We will not be raising equity in the capital markets to fund these acquisitions. We will fund these acquisitions with a combination of balance sheet and third-party LPs and partners.\"</li>\n<li>Nierenberg described Crestline as bringing new direct lending, NAV lending, credit products, and an insurance and reinsurance business, stating \"So now we're in the insurance business.\"</li>\n<li>The CEO signaled a focus on performance and product breadth: \"Our mantra of performance first will enable us to grow our platforms. We are not, to be clear, in an AUM race. More importantly, what we want to do is lead with results.\"</li>\n<li>Regarding the Paramount acquisition, Nierenberg noted, \"Acquiring assets for a little under $600 per foot versus replacement cost of $2,500 to $3,000 a foot gets us really excited... In New York, this portfolio is north of 90% leased. And in San Francisco, it's in the low 70s, creating a huge opportunity for us to grow NOI.\"</li>\n<li>Nicola Santoro, CFO, stated, \"At the end of the quarter, we ended with cash and cash equivalents on balance sheet of $1.6 billion... The expectation is at close, we will have approximately $1 billion of financing available to us. bringing us down to $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents post both the Crestline and Paramount transactions.\"</li>\n<li>Baron Silverstein, President, reported, \"Our third quarter '25 pretax income, excluding mark-to-market, was approximately $295 million, which is up 7% quarter-over-quarter and 20% year-over-year and delivered a 20% ROE for the quarter, continuing our steady performance.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The CEO indicated sustained focus on results and platform growth: \"Our mission is still the same, put up solid results quarter after quarter, be able to offer more products to our LPs and partners and take advantage of opportunistic situations to generate outsized returns and grow the company.\"</li>\n<li>The company expects to close its first evergreen ABF fund in Q4 on a leading wealth management platform.</li>\n<li>Nierenberg described optimism for the Paramount acquisition, noting demand trends: \"We're seeing some of the highest leasing activity that we've seen, and this goes back to the pre-COVID days.\"</li>\n<li>The company anticipates closing Crestline by December 1 and Paramount by mid-December, subject to shareholder approval.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Rithm generated approximately $300 million in earnings, producing an 18% ROE for the quarter.</li>\n<li>Earnings available for distribution were $0.54 per diluted share, marking the 24th consecutive quarter where EAD exceeded dividends paid.</li>\n<li>GAAP net income totaled $193.7 million or $0.35 per diluted share; return on equity was 11%.</li>\n<li>Book value at quarter end stood at $12.83, totaling $7.1 billion.</li>\n<li>Cash and liquidity on the balance sheet was reported at $2.2 billion.</li>\n<li>Genesis Capital originated $1.2 billion in loans, representing a 60% year-over-year increase.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Crispin Love, Piper Sandler: Asked about divergence in share price and strategic actions. Nierenberg responded, \"We're not raising equity around this transaction for these assets... We need to drive more, quite frankly, more FRE through our pipes to get revalued.\"</li>\n<li>Love queried on third-party capital for Paramount. Nierenberg replied, \"We can raise all that money prior to close depending upon how much economics do we want to give away beforehand... The money is there.\"</li>\n<li>Bose George, KBW: Inquired about the impact of Ginnie Mae streamline refis on margins. Silverstein responded, \"They are definitely cheaper to produce... They're also highly competitive as well, but they're cheaper to produce.\"</li>\n<li>George also questioned RPT growth options. Nierenberg answered, \"We're looking at direct lending options and things like that. To the extent that we don't, at some point, we'll likely tender for the shares and just clean up the vehicle.\"</li>\n<li>Eric Hagen, BTIG: Asked if third-party capital for Paramount would be used to pay down financing lines. Nierenberg: \"Once we do close, to the extent that we do draw down, we'll pay that off once we raise the money.\"</li>\n<li>Hagen queried about underwriting risks. Nierenberg stated, \"We're underwriting first, and we don't just go out and buy pools of assets unless... we have the ability to hopefully control an outcome.\"</li>\n<li>Jason Weaver, JonesTrading: Asked about ABF fund size and duration. Nierenberg indicated, \"The size is likely going to be upwards of [ $500 million ] and then the average duration... in the kind of the 3-year area.\"</li>\n<li>Weaver asked about dividend policy. Nierenberg replied, \"We're not going to raise our dividend... there's no desire to increase the dividend at this point.\"</li>\n<li>Trevor Cranston, Citizens JMP: Inquired about share buybacks. Nierenberg said, \"We're not going to be doing share buybacks here. I think the question around a potential IPO of the mortgage company is always something that we wrestle with.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts focused on valuation gaps, capital allocation, and strategic options, often pressing for more concrete timelines and clarification on plans, reflecting a neutral to slightly negative tone.</li>\n<li>Management maintained confidence during prepared remarks, but responses in Q&amp;A were occasionally defensive, particularly when discussing share price and capital allocation, as shown in phrases like \"We're not going to raise equity around this transaction\" and \"there's no desire to increase the dividend at this point.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone became more assertive in explaining capital deployment and acquisition funding, while analysts remained concerned about valuation and growth execution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The current quarter was marked by the announcement of two significant acquisitions (Crestline and Paramount), compared to a previous focus on organic growth and smaller scale M&amp;A.</li>\n<li>Financial results showed continued EAD coverage of dividends and stable per-share metrics, with a slight increase in book value and liquidity compared to the prior quarter.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus shifted from primarily asset management and origination growth to platform expansion through acquisition, including entry into the insurance business.</li>\n<li>Analysts in both quarters remained focused on valuation realization and strategic transactions, but current questions placed more emphasis on the implications of M&amp;A and capital structure.</li>\n<li>Management's confidence in acquisitions and capital allocation was more pronounced this quarter, highlighted by repeated assurances that no equity would be raised for new deals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management noted concerns about market valuation, emphasizing the need to grow asset management fee-related earnings to achieve revaluation.</li>\n<li>Underwriting standards were highlighted as a risk area, with Nierenberg referencing recent industry fraud cases and stressing internal controls: \"Underwriting first.\"</li>\n<li>Analysts questioned the sustainability of dividend coverage, capital allocation discipline, and the ability to raise third-party capital for large acquisitions.</li>\n<li>The integration of acquired entities, especially the insurance business via Crestline, was identified as a challenge, though management expressed confidence in execution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Management underscored a transformative quarter with the acquisitions of Crestline and Paramount, expanding Rithm Capital's platform beyond $100 billion in investable assets. Emphasis remains on delivering consistent results, expanding product offerings for LPs, and generating outsized returns, while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation without raising equity. Integration of new business lines and realization of cross-platform synergies are expected to drive future value for shareholders and partners.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ritm/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",
