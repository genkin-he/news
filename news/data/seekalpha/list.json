            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Willdan Group, Inc. (WLDN) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Michael Bieber, CEO, stated that \"We closed 2025 with record financial performance and strong momentum across our business. For 2025, both contract and net revenue grew greater than 20%, led by our energy work. Adjusted EBITDA grew 40%, and yearly margins expanded to above our 20% target for the first time in 2025.\" He highlighted $71 million of free cash flow and a net cash position, attributing organic net revenue growth of 17% largely to expansion with existing customers. Bieber emphasized that \"electric load growth has returned to the United States after about 15 years of stagnation\" and that AI and data centers are driving electricity demand at unprecedented levels.</li>\n<li>Bieber explained that the company is seeing strong demand from utilities, state and local governments, and commercial customers, with commercial clients—especially data centers—now accounting for 11% of revenue and described as \"the most fertile business environment we serve.\" He also pointed to a robust acquisition pipeline entering 2026.</li>\n<li>Creighton Early, CFO, stated, \"For the fourth quarter of 2025, contract revenue increased 21% to $174 million, and net revenue grew 13% to $89.5 million for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA also increased 13% compared to the prior year, totaling $20 million for the quarter, and adjusted earnings per share more than doubled to $1.57, which is $1.23 on a GAAP basis, aided by exceptional tax deductions from energy efficiency incentives under Section 179D.\" Early also noted, \"We ended the year with $66 million of unrestricted cash and a net positive cash position of $17 million, the first time since 2017 and effectively 0 leverage compared to the 0.3x EBITDA at the end of 2024.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Early stated, \"We expect net revenue in the range of $390 million to $405 million, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $85 million to $90 million and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share. These targets assume a full year effective tax benefit of approximately 10% and 15.8 million diluted shares outstanding. These numbers exclude any future acquisitions, though we expect to make acquisitions during the year, and our guidance will be updated accordingly.\"</li>\n<li>Bieber added, \"We have a particularly robust acquisition pipeline entering 2026 that will better enable us to serve customers in the future.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Willdan reported contract revenue of $174 million and net revenue of $89.5 million for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $20 million, and adjusted EPS was $1.57, with GAAP EPS of $1.23. For the full year, contract revenue reached $682 million, net revenue was $365 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $79.5 million. Net income more than doubled to $52.6 million, or $3.49 per diluted share GAAP, and adjusted EPS increased to $4.89. Gross profit increased 26.1% to $256 million, with gross margin expanding to 37.5% from 35.8% the prior year. Free cash flow for the year was $71 million.</li>\n<li>Early stated, \"We generated $80 million in cash flow from operations as continued improvements in working capital levels supplemented the strong earnings and $71 million in free cash flow or $4.69 per share in 2025.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Craig Irwin, ROTH Capital Partners: \"Your EPS guide of $4.50 to $4.70 is fantastic, but it is below the $4.93 last year... Can you maybe walk us through what your assumptions are for 179D in 2026...?\" Creighton Early: \"The 179D is set to expire at the end of June for this year. So that inability to carry that through to the end of the year means that we can only take advantage of that through projects that are started within the first 6 months of 2026, so that's the single biggest factor there.\"</li>\n<li>Irwin: \"When I look at this, I know your markets are helping in a big way, but... are there operating improvements that might be improving the fundamental profitability...?\" Michael Bieber: \"...over the last 5 years, is that we've moved up the value scale and are able to charge more for the work that we do... As we've grown the company, corporate costs are not growing at nearly the rate of the top line. So we think that's going to continue, and it's reflected in our guidance.\"</li>\n<li>Tim Moore, Clear Street LLC: \"Did you mention that you thought data centers could double in 2026 for revenue?\" Bieber: \"We were talking specifically about the APG acquisition that does that type of substation design and construction management for those data centers, and we are expecting that to more than double for us this year.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed on the sustainability of EPS growth, tax assumptions, and the trajectory of data center and utility demand, showing a neutral-to-slightly-positive tone as they acknowledged positive execution but probed on future risks and drivers.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone in both prepared remarks and responses, emphasizing continued margin expansion, strategic positioning, and a robust acquisition pipeline, though they acknowledged headwinds from tax incentives expiring.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, analysts' tone shifted slightly to a more cautious approach, focusing on guidance and the impact of expiring tax benefits, while management remained consistently confident but offered more granular explanations for future guidance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance for 2026 net revenue ($390M–$405M) and adjusted EPS ($4.50–$4.70) reflects a modest increase in revenue targets but a lower EPS projection, primarily due to the non-renewal of the 179D tax deduction after June 2026. The previous quarter's call raised 2025 guidance for net revenue to $360M–$365M and adjusted EPS to $4.10–$4.20.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus continues to shift toward commercial customers, particularly data centers, with management highlighting more than doubling of APG’s contribution in 2026 and a deliberate push to expand commercial sector capabilities.</li>\n<li>Analysts’ questions in both quarters revolved around growth sustainability, resource management, and execution risk, but the current quarter included more pointed questions about tax effects and margin durability.</li>\n<li>Management’s tone remained confident, but with increased emphasis on explaining the impacts of tax changes and acquisition strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The primary risk cited was the expiration of the 179D tax deduction at the end of June 2026, which will reduce some tax benefits for the remainder of the year.</li>\n<li>Management noted project mix changes, with fewer qualifying buildings in new contracts compared to prior periods, affecting the eligibility for tax incentives.</li>\n<li>Analyst concerns centered on the sustainability of EPS growth and margin improvement in light of these tax changes and the ability to maintain momentum in the commercial sector.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Willdan’s management underscored record financial performance in 2025, marked by double-digit revenue and profit growth, margin expansion, and strong cash flow. The company's 2026 outlook projects continued top-line growth and margin strength, supported by a growing backlog, increased activity in the commercial sector—especially data centers—and a robust acquisition pipeline. While EPS guidance is lower due to expiring tax incentives, management emphasized durable demand, scalable operations, and a strategic focus on higher-value work and commercial diversification as key drivers for sustained performance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/wldn/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Starz Entertainment Corp. (STRZ) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Jeffrey Hirsch, President and CEO, stated that \"2025 was a very successful year, one in which we exceeded all of our financial guidance. It's a feat we're especially proud of amidst the pressures you see happening across the industry.\" He highlighted ending the year at an all-time high of 12.7 million OTT subscribers, representing a 7.6% year-over-year increase, and noted the addition of 370,000 OTT subscribers in the fourth quarter alone. Hirsch emphasized that Starz exceeded its $200 million adjusted OIBDA outlook by 2%, delivering $204 million, and finished the year with leverage at 2.9x versus a 3.1x guide.</li>\n<li>Hirsch reported that original programming such as Spartacus and Power Book IV: Force Season 3 fueled subscriber growth, with Power Book IV achieving a 57% increase in in-season viewership. He also detailed a slate of anticipated 2026 originals, including the conclusion of Outlander, Power Book III: Raising Kanan, Fightland, Blood of My Blood, and the return of P-Valley.</li>\n<li>The company restructured its Canadian business into a licensing revenue stream and completed production on Fightland, now with Sky as a co-commission partner. Hirsch announced, \"we will not be disclosing subscribers starting with the March 2026 quarter\" and will focus on OTT revenue growth, profitability, and deleveraging.</li>\n<li>Hirsch added that Starz is \"uniquely positioned to capitalize on potential M&amp;A opportunities\" due to its tech stack and digital conversion record.</li>\n<li>Scott MacDonald, Chief Financial Officer, stated, \"Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $56 million, up over 100% sequentially due to lower programming amortization, lower advertising marketing and higher revenue.\" MacDonald noted net debt of $589 million, total gross debt of $625 million, and cash of $36 million at quarter end.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hirsch reported, \"Our outlook for 2026 is strong. We expect OTT revenue to grow. We expect to deliver low single-digit percentage adjusted OIBDA growth versus 2025. We anticipate generating between $80 million to $120 million of positive unlevered free cash flow, converting the business to positive equity free cash flow. And we expect to end the year at approximately 2.7x leverage.\"</li>\n<li>MacDonald indicated that the improvement in cash flow is expected to come from \"lower cash content spend in 2026 versus 2025, which drives a closer alignment of cash content spend with the programming amortization expense reflected on our income statement.\"</li>\n<li>The company confirmed a strategic shift away from reporting quarterly subscriber counts, emphasizing revenue, cash flow, and margin expansion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>MacDonald reported, \"Total revenue in the quarter was $323 million, up 60 basis points on a sequential basis.\" The revenue increase was primarily driven by content licensing revenue from the restructured Canadian business.</li>\n<li>Adjusted OIBDA for the full year reached $204 million, surpassing the $200 million outlook, and leverage at year-end stood at 2.9x.</li>\n<li>The company ended the quarter with $589 million in net debt, $625 million in gross debt, and $36 million in cash, with no borrowings outstanding on its $150 million revolving credit facility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Brent Penter, Raymond James: Asked about drivers behind the 2026 margin target and revenue trajectory. Hirsch responded, \"You'll see a slight improvement in '26, but the lion's share of the improvement really comes in '27 and '28 when you start to see the Starz originals really become a lion's share of our programming slate.\"</li>\n<li>Penter also inquired about M&amp;A constraints. Hirsch explained that, \"any kind of deal that we do, we'd have to stick within that kind of leverage constraint to keep it around. We don't really want to operate in a business that's 4x, 5x, 6x levered.\"</li>\n<li>Thomas Yeh, Morgan Stanley: Sought insight on OTT subscriber retention. Hirsch indicated that a combination of a strong slate and longer-term annual offers is \"really lead[ing] us to push churn down over the next 12 to 18 months.\"</li>\n<li>Yeh asked about distribution partnerships. Alison Hoffman, President of STARZ Networks, stated, \"The bundles that we have in place are expanding our TAM... They're revenue accretive and then also ultimately are driving better retention for the business.\"</li>\n<li>David Joyce, Seaport Research Partners: Probed about OIBDA and free cash flow cadence. MacDonald replied, \"From a P&amp;L cadence, you'll see very consistent over the year, especially in the first 3 quarters. The fourth quarter in '26 will be a more positive quarter.\"</li>\n<li>Vikram Kesavabhotla, Baird: Asked about the Sky partnership and international content demand. Hirsch responded, \"the slate that we've designed, we've obviously designed it with international revenue in mind.\"</li>\n<li>Douglas Wardlaw, JPMorgan: Asked about the balance between spin-offs and new originals. Hoffman explained, \"what you'll see is you'll see us using these reliable franchises to launch new IP and establish new IPs with audiences.\"</li>\n<li>Matthew Harrigan, Benchmark: Inquired about AI and post-Lionsgate development. Hirsch stated, \"AI is a -- it's going to be a very powerful tool to enhance the business... but I think the business is really grown on the success of the uniqueness of our originals.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts expressed constructive, but probing interest in free cash flow, M&amp;A strategy, and international growth, occasionally pressing for greater detail on margin improvement and capital allocation priorities.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and forward-looking tone, repeatedly emphasizing strong guidance, cash flow improvements, and strategic discipline. Hirsch stated, \"We expect to deliver low single-digit percentage adjusted OIBDA growth versus 2025,\" and MacDonald described cash flow improvement as \"a significant improvement over the year.\"</li>\n<li>Compared with the previous quarter, management's tone was more assertive about the company's positioning, while analysts continued to focus on operational execution and long-term value.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance language shifted from affirming prior targets to outlining specific financial and operational milestones for 2026, including the move away from reporting subscriber counts.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus moved further toward owned content, international licensing, and bundling partnerships.</li>\n<li>Analysts in both quarters sought clarity on margin expansion and M&amp;A, but recent questions highlighted capital allocation as leverage approaches the 2.5x target.</li>\n<li>Key metrics showed sequential revenue and OIBDA growth and a reduction in leverage from 3.4x to 2.9x.</li>\n<li>Management's tone was more confident, underscoring the business's transformation and cash flow trajectory.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited ongoing declines in traditional linear customers and the impact of seasonal promotions on revenue.</li>\n<li>The transition from linear to digital continues to present operational and subscriber churn risks.</li>\n<li>The company acknowledged that content spend alignment and cash flow normalization are still in progress, especially in early 2026.</li>\n<li>Hirsch indicated that any M&amp;A activity would be managed conservatively to avoid over-leveraging the business.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Starz closed 2025 with all-time high OTT subscribers, exceeded its adjusted OIBDA outlook, and achieved sequential revenue growth, propelled by original programming and a restructured Canadian business. Looking ahead, the company targets $80 million to $120 million in unlevered free cash flow, low-single-digit OIBDA growth, and a further reduction in leverage to 2.7x by the end of 2026, all while shifting focus to revenue and cash flow rather than subscriber counts. Management points to continued content investment, international expansion, and disciplined capital allocation as drivers for future growth and profitability.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/strz/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
