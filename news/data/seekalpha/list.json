There was also a shift in production to meet higher electrolyte demand for Eos.</li>\n<li>The global calcium chloride business achieved record revenue and adjusted EBITDA, with the Tech Grade product for chip manufacturing growing 144% year-over-year.</li>\n<li>Murphy outlined significant milestones, including completion of Phase 1 construction at the Evergreen bromine plant, a new strategic partnership with Magrathea for magnesium production, and renewed focus on lithium extraction due to increasing prices.</li>\n<li>The company received a patent for its TETRA oasis desalination solution and noted a shift in customer plans from 25,000 to 100,000+ barrel per day desalination plants, particularly for data center cooling in West Texas.</li>\n<li>Argentina operations are expected to double revenue in 2026 over 2025, driven by new contracts and SandStorm technology.</li>\n<li>Murphy announced the retirement of CFO Elijio Serrano and the transition to Matt Sanderson as CFO, ensuring continuity in financial leadership.</li>\n<li>CFO Elijio Serrano stated, \"Cash flow from the base business in the fourth quarter was very solid at $21.8 million. For the year, free cash flow from the base business was $83 million.\"</li>\n<li>Serrano also shared, \"We ended the year with cash on hand of $73 million, double where we started the year at. Net debt is $109 million, down from $143 million at the end of '24.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Murphy projected incremental revenue growth in 2026, mainly from increased electrolyte business and major contract awards in Argentina, with expectations that Argentina revenue will double.</li>\n<li>On Completion Fluids, Murphy noted, \"2026 activity is forecasted to be higher in drilling, including more exploration with less completion activity. As a result, we do not expect the Gulf of America to reach the same record levels as in 2025.\"</li>\n<li>Guidance for Completion Fluids &amp; Products' adjusted EBITDA margins is 25% to 30% for 2026, citing increased costs from third-party bromine supplies until the new plant is operational.</li>\n<li>Water &amp; Flowback Services adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to improve from 12% in 2025 to the mid-teens in 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Completion Fluids &amp; Products revenue for Q4 was $83.7 million, up 22% year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA margins at 28.2%.</li>\n<li>Water &amp; Flowback Services revenue was $63 million, flat sequentially, while Argentina activity increased.</li>\n<li>Corporate and other expenses were $11.3 million, including higher variable compensation due to the record performance.</li>\n<li>Consolidated TETRA free cash flow, including Arkansas investments, was $33 million for 2025.</li>\n<li>Days sales outstanding improved from 71 at the end of 2024 to 62 at the end of 2025.</li>\n<li>Tax loss carryforward stands at approximately $84 million, which can offset up to $300 million of taxable income in the U.S.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stephen Gengaro, Stifel, asked about deepwater market evolution and margin progression. Murphy responded that 2025 was a record year, but \"we are seeing a cycle into more drilling phase and less completion phase\" for 2026, with a reversal expected in 2027.</li>\n<li>On margin drivers, Murphy stated, \"Our pricing power is pretty strong in the Completion Fluids. We are the innovation leaders, and we get -- we think we get a premium for that.\"</li>\n<li>Gengaro queried bromine supply split; Serrano responded, \"We've indicated that approximately 75% of our historical needs have been met under our long-term agreement, and we've been doing open market purchases for the rest of it.\"</li>\n<li>Martin Malloy, Johnson Rice, asked about timing for desalination contracts. Murphy explained, \"We're hopeful that one of these data center desalination projects will materialize in the first half of this year...it does hopefully set us up for a first revenue of a large facility sometime in 2027.\"</li>\n<li>On accelerating the bromine plant, Murphy said, \"We're not slowing the pace of this project by any means to try to pace it with cash flow funding. We are moving as quickly as we can.\"</li>\n<li>Robert Brooks, Northland, sought clarity on modularity of desalination plants. Murphy explained economies of scale favor a single larger facility.</li>\n<li>Brooks also asked about U.S. Water &amp; Flowback outperformance; Murphy indicated SandStorm technology and Argentina growth would drive margin improvement.</li>\n<li>Jonathan Tanwanteng, CJS, asked about third-party bromine supply. Murphy clarified, \"There's no issue with the long-term contract...we are definitely securing third-party supply well above now the long-term contract.\"</li>\n<li>On potential supply shortfalls, Murphy said, \"We have secured -- contractually secured well what we need for 2026.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed for clarity on margin sustainability, timing of contract wins, and supply chain security, showing a neutral to slightly positive tone while probing for downside risks.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone in prepared remarks, using phrases like \"we are very well positioned\" and \"we feel very well positioned to benefit from the multiyear deepwater activity recovery.\"</li>\n<li>In the Q&amp;A, management continued to show confidence but acknowledged near-term margin pressures and cost increases, especially for bromine. Murphy often reaffirmed guidance ranges and strategic direction.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, sentiment remains optimistic but slightly more cautious regarding margin and supply chain headwinds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The company reiterated its One TETRA 2030 strategy, but now projects reaching 75 million pounds of bromine plant capacity by 2029, up from the 48 million pound estimate in the prior definitive feasibility study.</li>\n<li>There is a notable shift in desalination plant customer interest, moving from 25,000 to 100,000+ barrel per day facilities.</li>\n<li>The previous quarter highlighted ongoing cost controls and achieving record revenue/EBITDA despite a lower rig count, while the current quarter focuses more on execution and supply chain, especially with bromine and electrolyte growth.</li>\n<li>Management's tone is steady, but there is more emphasis on securing supply and bridging costs until new capacity comes online.</li>\n<li>Analysts continue to focus on margin sustainability and contract timing, but with heightened attention to supply constraints and project execution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited higher short-term costs for third-party bromine supply until the new Arkansas plant is operational.</li>\n<li>Margin pressure in Completion Fluids &amp; Products is expected until 2028.</li>\n<li>Potential delays in large desalination projects due to engineering and multi-party coordination.</li>\n<li>The company acknowledged the need to secure additional bromine supply in the open market through 2027.</li>\n<li>Management noted competitive pricing in U.S. Water &amp; Flowback but expects technology and international growth to offset.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>TETRA Technologies delivered record revenue and EBITDA in 2025, driven by Gulf of America completion fluids, West Memphis plant output, and global calcium chloride growth, while achieving major milestones in bromine plant construction and desalination technology. The company anticipates incremental revenue growth in 2026, led by electrolyte and Argentina contracts, but projects a moderation in Gulf of America completion activity. Margin pressures from higher bromine input costs are expected until the Arkansas plant is operational, with the company confident in its strategic direction and well-positioned to benefit from multi-year market trends as it advances toward 2030 objectives.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/tti/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Tutor Perini Corporation (TPC) Q4 2025 </p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Gary Smalley stated that \"Tutor Perini had a tremendous year in 2025, perhaps our best year ever. Our results were highlighted by a record $5.5 billion of revenue, a return to strong profitability that produced $4.29 of adjusted earnings per share, a fourth consecutive year of record operating cash flow with $748 million of cash that shattered last year's record.\" </li>\n<li>Smalley emphasized a \"sustained focus on cash, the return to profitability and providing ambitious yet reasonable earnings goals, all with the goal of significantly increasing short- and long-term shareholder value.\" He reported delivery on these priorities, citing \"unprecedented share price performance and record returns for our shareholders.\"</li>\n<li>The company ended 2025 with a backlog of $20.6 billion, up 10% year-over-year, driven by $7.4 billion in new awards and contract adjustments, including mega projects such as the Midtown bus terminal replacement in New York and the UCSF Benioff New Children's Hospital in California.</li>\n<li>Smalley highlighted that the Civil segment generated more than $2.8 billion in revenue, its highest ever, and noted that the Specialty Contractors segment returned to profitability ahead of expectations in the second half of 2025.</li>\n<li>The Board of Directors authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share and a $200 million share repurchase program, with another $0.06 dividend declared.</li>\n<li>CFO Ryan Soroka stated, \"we generated a new record operating cash flow of $748 million for the year, up 49% compared to the previous record of $504 million for 2024.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Smalley expressed that, \"we anticipate double-digit revenue growth and strong earnings in 2026 with even higher earnings expected in 2027, by which time newer large projects should be in the construction phase. For 2026, we expect adjusted EPS in the range of $4.90 to $5.30.\"</li>\n<li>Management expects continued strong operating cash generation in 2026 and beyond, driven mainly by project execution activities and anticipated resolution of remaining legacy disputes.</li>\n<li>The company expects \"a modest backlog reduction in the near term, followed by resumed backlog growth as we capture our share of major new projects.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Soroka reported, \"Revenue for 2025 was $5.5 billion, up 28% with the robust growth primarily due to the increased project execution activities on certain large newer civil and building segment projects in the Northeast, Hawaii and Guam.\"</li>\n<li>Civil segment revenue was $2.8 billion, up 34%, with operating income for the segment nearly tripling to $391 million from $138 million in 2024. Segment operating margin of 13.7% was within the expected range.</li>\n<li>Building segment operating income was $58 million, a reversal from a $24 million loss in 2024, with the margin improving to 3.1%.</li>\n<li>Specialty Contractors segment posted a slight operating loss of $7 million for 2025, a significant improvement from a $103 million loss in 2024. The segment returned to profitability in the second half.</li>\n<li>Net income attributable to Tutor Perini for 2025 was $80 million or $1.51 of GAAP EPS compared to a net loss of $164 million in 2024. Adjusted net income was $229 million or $4.29 per share, compared to an adjusted net loss of $124 million, or $(2.37) per share, in 2024.</li>\n<li>The company ended the year with cash and cash equivalents exceeding total debt by $327 million, compared to a $79 million net debt position at the end of 2024.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Steven Fisher, UBS: Asked about backlog coverage and seasonality in Q1. Smalley responded, \"first of all, we've got great visibility into the to the results for 2026 and really beyond. There's not much that has to happen for us to hit the numbers that we've represented... Q1 is usually light for us. It's typically the way it goes. It will be the same this year.\"</li>\n<li>Fisher also asked about expected lumpiness in backlog. Smalley indicated, \"our plan shows us a little north of where we are currently... it could be lumpier than it has been over the last couple of years where every quarter, we seem like we're hitting a new record. But the pipeline is rich.\"</li>\n<li>Alexander Rygiel, Texas Capital: Asked about improved contract terms. Smalley explained, \"Now what we've been able to do with the limited competition is to work with our customers... to drive better payment terms, better terms with respect to no damages for delay... I think what you'll see is less disputes as we go forward.\"</li>\n<li>Adam Thalhimer, Thompson, Davis: Asked about the negative impact to Civil in Q4 from a Canadian project. Smalley said, \"In Q4, I think it was $42 million, as I recall. And that's a consolidated joint venture.\"</li>\n<li>Liam Burke, B. Riley: Asked about resource constraints for larger projects. Soroka responded, \"we certainly haven't seen any of the constraints on resources... the majority of our labor is sourced from the union halls.\"</li>\n<li>Michael Dudas, Vertical Research: Asked about margin expectations for mega projects. Smalley stated, \"margin will only build over time, and that's probably with all segments as these 9 -- the big 9, as we'll say, continue to move into full production.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts expressed positive sentiment, congratulating management repeatedly and showing interest in guidance visibility, margin improvement, and backlog quality. Questions sought clarification but did not indicate skepticism or negativity.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone both in prepared remarks and responses. Smalley repeatedly emphasized visibility, strength of backlog, and margin improvements, and used phrases such as \"we feel good\" and \"we are confident.\"</li>\n<li>Both analysts and management displayed a similar or even more positive sentiment than in the previous quarter, with less focus on risk or caution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance for 2026 adjusted EPS was raised to $4.90 to $5.30, up from a 2025 range of $4 to $4.20.</li>\n<li>Backlog decreased slightly to $20.6 billion from a prior record of $21.6 billion, with management introducing the expectation of near-term lumpiness as opposed to consistent quarterly increases.</li>\n<li>Civil segment continued to drive growth, but Building and Specialty Contractors segments also improved, with the latter returning to profitability in the second half.</li>\n<li>Management's tone evolved to emphasize greater confidence and reduced focus on dispute resolutions, compared to the previous quarter's slightly more cautious outlook.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management noted the possibility of a \"lower-than-anticipated success rate for future project pursuits, the potential for project delays, slower ramp-ups for our newer projects and any unexpected settlements and/or adverse legal decisions associated with the resolution of disputes.\"</li>\n<li>Smalley highlighted contingency reserves for \"unknown or unexpected outcomes and developments in 2026.\"</li>\n<li>Analysts asked about resource constraints and legacy disputes, but management expressed confidence in mitigation strategies and ongoing progress in dispute resolution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Tutor Perini's management emphasized that 2025 marked a record year for revenue, earnings, and cash flow, with robust backlog providing strong visibility into sustained double-digit revenue growth and higher earnings for 2026 and beyond. Improvements in contract terms, reduced litigation risk, and margin expansion across all segments were highlighted as key drivers of performance, while contingency planning and a healthy balance sheet underpin continued confidence in the company's guidance and strategic direction.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/tpc/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "title": "Ecovyst outlines $860M–$940M 2026 sales target as company strengthens balance sheet and pursues growth through mining and capital allocation",
            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Ecovyst Inc. (ECVT) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Kurt Bitting stated the company was “very pleased with our fourth quarter results and the execution of our strategic objectives.” He emphasized that “strong sales volume for virgin sulfuric acid and favorable contractual pricing for regeneration services contributed to a solid quarter,” leading to full year 2025 adjusted EBITDA above guidance despite unplanned and extended customer downtime.</li>\n<li>Bitting announced the completion of the divestiture of the Advanced Materials and Catalysts segment earlier than expected for $556 million, with $465 million of net proceeds used to pay down the term loan, resulting in a net debt leverage ratio of 1.2x at year end. He described this as having “transformed the company, initiating a new focus to drive progress by delivering reliable sulfur solutions for clean fuels and critical materials.”</li>\n<li>The company acquired the Waggaman sulfuric acid assets for approximately $40 million and repurchased just under $50 million of common stock in 2025. Bitting said, “We enter 2026 with a strong balance sheet and significant liquidity that we believe positions us well to continue our capital allocation priorities directed at growth, both organic and inorganic, and the continued return of capital to our stockholders.”</li>\n<li>CFO Michael Feehan highlighted, “We closed out the year with a solid financial performance in the fourth quarter, delivering full year adjusted EBITDA of $172 million ahead of our previously provided guidance.” He reported $78 million of free cash flow and noted, “With the proceeds from the sale of the AM&amp;C business, we paid down $465 million of our term loan, resulting in a 1.2x net leverage ratio, leaving $265 million of available liquidity.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management expects 2026 to include “higher sales volume for both virgin sulfuric acid, driven by higher projected mining demand, and higher volume for regeneration sulfuric acid as we expect less customer downtime compared to 2025.”</li>\n<li>Feehan projected full year 2026 sales to be in the range of $860 million to $940 million, with full year adjusted EBITDA expected to fall in the range of $175 million to $195 million.</li>\n<li>The company anticipates higher turnaround costs by approximately $8 million in 2026 and expects capital expenditures will be $20 million higher, resulting in a range of $80 million to $90 million.</li>\n<li>Adjusted free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $35 million to $55 million, and interest expense is anticipated to be $18 million to $22 million in 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fourth quarter sales were $199 million, up $51 million or 34%. Excluding a $28 million impact of higher sulfur costs passed through in price, sales were up 15%.</li>\n<li>Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $51 million, up 8% from the prior year. Feehan attributed this to a “favorable volume and price impact at a sales level, partially offset by higher planned fixed manufacturing costs, including incremental costs of the acquired Waggaman assets.”</li>\n<li>The adjusted EBITDA margin decreased by 630 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, mainly due to the pass-through effect of higher sulfur costs accounting for approximately 500 basis points of the decrease.</li>\n<li>Free cash flow for the year was $78 million, supporting share repurchases totaling $47 million for 2025.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>John McNulty, BMO Capital Markets: Asked about Waggaman asset capacity and future growth. Bitting responded, “The Waggaman sulfuric acid assets that we added last year, of course, added roughly around 10% of volume to the overall network... it’s a force multiplier really with our Gulf Coast network.”</li>\n<li>McNulty, BMO Capital Markets: Inquired about regeneration contract pricing lift for 2026. Feehan replied, “It’s going to be a similar lift... every year, the contractual agreements that we have start to roll off. It’s usually between 15% and 20% a year... it does provide a benefit.”</li>\n<li>Patrick Cunningham, Citigroup: Sought specifics on industrial application weakness. Bitting explained, “It’s just a general sense of caution in that space. For us, our biggest one is... nylon... we expect to be roughly on par with where we were in 2025.”</li>\n<li>Aleksey Yefremov, KeyBanc: Asked if expansion is tied to customer contracts or anticipated growth. Bitting said, “We’re confident that the demand will be there. And we feel it’s appropriate for us to add this additional capacity and logistics capacity to meet that growing demand long-term.”</li>\n<li>David Begleiter, Deutsche Bank: Asked about guidance range drivers. Bitting noted, “Upper end it’s going to be the virgin acid and if there’s some positivity in things like pricing or spot volumes... on the low end... that largely would be driven by things like unplanned customer outages... or a macroeconomic event.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed for clarity on capacity growth, contract repricing, market conditions, and capital allocation, with a neutral to slightly positive tone, showing interest in strategic direction but expressing caution on industrial demand.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and proactive tone, emphasizing resilience, balance sheet strength, and flexibility. Feehan stated, “We believe that we have significant flexibility as we look to fund our growth initiatives.”</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone shifted from cautious optimism to increased confidence, supported by the completed divestiture and strengthened balance sheet. Analysts’ tone remained steady, with consistent focus on execution and demand trends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance language shifted from high-level commentary last quarter to explicit ranges for sales and adjusted EBITDA for 2026.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus moved from anticipated portfolio transformation to execution, with the divestiture completed and proceeds deployed.</li>\n<li>Analysts continued to focus on capital allocation, demand drivers, and customer contract stability, now probing for more granular guidance and growth metrics.</li>\n<li>Key metrics such as net debt leverage improved from below 1.5x to 1.2x, and free cash flow met or exceeded prior ranges.</li>\n<li>Management’s confidence increased, highlighting the company’s ability to pursue both organic and inorganic growth, while analysts maintained a measured approach, probing for risks and upside scenarios.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management remained cautious about “the near-term outlook for the nylon applications and some of the industrial applications,” with expectations for nylon-related sales to be flat year-over-year.</li>\n<li>Macro factors and unplanned customer outages were noted as potential risks that could “translate into softer demand in some areas.”</li>\n<li>Feehan highlighted that sulfur costs are expected to be “up significantly this year,” but noted these are passed through with no material impact on adjusted EBITDA.</li>\n<li>Analysts questioned whether investments at Waggaman were complete, to which Bitting replied there were “additional investments necessary in the near future.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Ecovyst’s management emphasized the company’s successful transformation following the divestiture of the Advanced Materials and Catalysts segment, with a strengthened balance sheet, explicit 2026 guidance, and targeted investments in mining-related growth and logistics. Management expects higher volumes and stable pricing in key segments, while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation and shareholder returns. Risks remain in select industrial end markets and from potential customer outages, but the company’s liquidity and network enhancements position it to pursue further growth and value creation for shareholders in 2026 and beyond.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ecvt/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
