He added, \"We completed the sale of our PGIM Taiwan business to focus resources on higher growth opportunities.\"</li>\n<li>A leadership change was announced in Japan, with Brad Hearn appointed as CEO to \"drive our growth strategy in Japan,\" following the accelerated succession plan.

Frias explained the VA runoff impact and said, \"our private credit portfolio is largely private placements with strong covenants and other downside protections.\"</li>\n<li>Thomas Gallagher, Evercore ISI, asked about the 150% ESR target in Japan. Frias clarified, \"it is the level that we would hold after a market stress occurs...in normal times, we would hold higher levels.\"</li>\n<li>Jamminder Bhullar, JPMorgan, questioned claims trends in Disability and RILA competition.

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Tradeweb Markets Inc. (TW) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>CEO William Hult highlighted strong performance with quarterly revenues surpassing $500 million for the third consecutive quarter, stating \"Year-to-date revenues as of the third quarter are up 21% or 17% organically, putting us on track for another year of double-digit revenue growth.\" He emphasized resilient growth despite historically low volatility, tight credit spreads, and muted equity volatility.</p></li>\n<li><p>Hult underscored the expanding international business, noting \"Our international revenues continue to scale higher delivering 25% year-over-year growth as our strategic initiatives in EM and APAC continue to pay off.\" He also reported margin expansion, with \"adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 54 basis points relative to the third quarter of 2024.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Product highlights included rates achieving its second highest revenue quarter driven by organic growth in swaps and global government bonds, and record revenues in mortgages. Credit growth was led by munis, European credit, and emerging market credit. ICD revenues increased 7% quarter-over-quarter as balances rebounded. Equities revenues rose 17% year-over-year, while digital asset initiatives contributed to over 50% growth in other revenues. Hult announced, \"We have reached an agreement in principle to renew the LSEG market data agreement... for an additional 3 years... this agreement will not only generate significant more revenue for Tradeweb, which Sara will touch on later, but it also maintains flexibility to grow our proprietary data business.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>CFO Sara Furber stated, \"this quarter, we saw revenues of $509 million that were up 13% year-over-year on a reported basis and 11% on a constant currency basis given the weakening dollar.\" She attributed strong variable and total trading revenue growth to higher international client activity and product expansion. Furber also reported a $15 million realized gain from the sale of Canton Coins and year-to-date adjusted EBITDA margin of 54.2%.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Management tightened adjusted expense guidance to $1 billion to $1.025 billion for 2025, expecting continued investment in technology, infrastructure, AI, and data. Furber said, \"We continue to expect our 2025 adjusted EBITDA margin to exceed 2024 levels although expansion will be more modest than last year as we support our current and future organic growth.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>For Q4, technology and communications expenses are forecasted to rise sequentially, with double-digit growth projected through 2026. Professional fees and G&amp;A are expected to increase seasonally, including a $4 million FX loss. Occupancy expenses will rise by $1.5 million due to the new headquarters move and higher data center costs.</p></li>\n<li><p>Hult reported, \"Overall, revenue growth is trending approximately 9% higher relative to October 2024,\" and international business posted nearly 20% year-over-year growth in October. The LSEG market data agreement is expected to provide $22 million in revenue for Q4 under the new terms.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Revenues for Q3 were $509 million, up 13% year-over-year. International clients contributed 42% of Q3 revenues, and total fixed revenues for the four major asset classes rose 28%.</p></li>\n<li><p>Other revenues increased 52%, driven by digital initiatives and the Canton Network, with $2.3 million earned from Canton Coin activity. As of Q3's end, Tradeweb held approximately 1.7 billion Canton Coins valued at $56 million.</p></li>\n<li><p>Adjusted expenses grew 12%, with technology and communication costs up 39% due to ongoing investments in data and infrastructure. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months was approximately $987 million. The company ended Q3 with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Christopher Allen, Citi: Questioned catalysts for increased volatility and the impact of the government shutdown on market activity. Hult explained, \"Part of the muted activity... is tied to the lack of data points... directly correlated to the government shutdown.\" He identified possible catalysts including Fed policy shifts, midterm elections, and ongoing geopolitical uncertainty.</p></li>\n<li><p>Jeffrey Schmitt, William Blair: Asked about the decline in electronic treasury market share and the rise in voice trades. Hult responded, \"I don't see it structural... our biggest competition is the phone... these tend to be large notional package trades that remain predominantly voice-driven for now.\" Furber added that electronic ADV in treasuries is up double digits year-to-date.</p></li>\n<li><p>Daniel Fannon, Jefferies: Inquired about the impact of lower rates on trading volumes. Hult noted, \"We've grown revenues every year... irrespective of the rate environment.\" Furber highlighted, \"Lower interest rates actually impacts in a positive way, 2 of our biggest businesses around swaps and cash credit fee per million.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Alexander Blostein, Goldman Sachs: Asked about tokenized assets. Furber described digital initiatives as \"having a real impact,\" with $5 million generated year-to-date from Canton Network activities and $55 million worth of Canton Coins on the balance sheet.</p></li>\n<li><p>Simon Clinch, Rothschild &amp; Co Redburn: Sought insights on the electronification of U.S. credit. Hult emphasized the gradual but accelerating adoption, with focus on technology, data, and efficient post-trade processes.</p></li>\n<li><p>Elias Abboud, BofA Securities: Requested updates on ICD product adoption and M&amp;A. Furber highlighted early client trades and ongoing integration, noting \"the bar is high\" for M&amp;A, with a focus on areas offering strategic growth.</p></li>\n<li><p>Kenneth Worthington, JPMorgan: Asked about digital expansion and capital priorities. Furber stated, \"We do consistently evaluate where can we amplify or accelerate,\" with frontier markets and digital asset lifecycle solutions as focus areas.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Analysts pressed on near-term catalysts, market share trends, and technology adoption, reflecting a neutral to slightly cautious tone regarding volatility and growth sustainability.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management maintained a confident but realistic outlook, frequently referencing historic resilience and innovation, with Hult stating, \"We are focused on what we can control, building innovative solutions... to win market share from the voice markets.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management displayed similar tones, with management slightly more focused on navigating low volatility and emphasizing strategic investments.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Q3 revenue growth rate slowed to 13% year-over-year from 26.7% in Q2, reflecting tougher comparables and lower market volatility.</p></li>\n<li><p>International revenue growth remained robust, though slightly slower than Q2's record 41%, with management maintaining optimism about continued global expansion.</p></li>\n<li><p>Adjusted EBITDA margin remained strong, but margin expansion was more modest compared to Q2. Expense growth decelerated from the previous quarter's 24% to 12% in Q3.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management shifted guidance language from acceleration to tighter expense controls and incremental investments in digital and infrastructure.</p></li>\n<li><p>Analyst focus shifted from extreme volatility and market share recovery in Q2 to the sustainability of growth and the impact of low volatility in Q3.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Management noted low market volatility and limited fresh macro data as headwinds, with Hult stating, \"Low volatility and limited data are near-term headwinds, not just for us, but for the broader market.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Additional risks highlighted included FX impacts, ongoing investments affecting expense levels, and competitive pressure from voice trading in complex treasury and credit trades.</p></li>\n<li><p>Analysts raised concerns about the pace of electronification, sustainability of higher margin products, and the impact of macro catalysts on trading volumes.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Tradeweb's third quarter results showed continued double-digit revenue growth and expanding international business, supported by product innovation and digital initiatives. Despite a challenging market environment with low volatility and limited data, management remains confident in delivering long-term growth, citing robust client engagement, a growing footprint in emerging markets, and record activity in digital assets. With tightened expense guidance and ongoing investment in technology and data infrastructure, the company is positioning itself for future market normalization and further electronification across asset classes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/tw/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p>The Pentagon’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has taken the lead in a sweeping effort to revamp the U.S. military’s drone program. The initiative that aims to simplify procurement, boost domestic manufacturing and rapidly deploy tens of thousands of inexpensive drones, Reuters reported Thursday, citing U.S. defense officials and people familiar with the plan.</p>\n<p>The push follows Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s July pledge to remove bureaucratic barriers and reassert U.S. dominance in unmanned systems. Hegseth announced plans to approve hundreds of domestically produced drone models and train combat units for what he called the era of “drone wars,” a direct response to lessons from Ukraine, where mass use of drones has revealed America’s lag in production scale and battlefield readiness.</p>\n<p>The involvement of DOGE, a cost-cutting office originally launched by Elon Musk and now embedded within the Pentagon, marks a significant expansion of its influence. President Donald Trump, through a June executive order, elevated the military’s drone modernization program to a top defense priority. The Pentagon declined to comment to Reuters on the DOGE initiative.</p>\n<p>The move comes amid skepticism about the Pentagon’s past drone procurement record. Its Replicator program, announced in 2023 to deliver thousands of autonomous systems by mid-2025, has yet to produce visible results. Officials have since said the effort is being transferred to “appropriate end users,” but it remains unclear how DOGE’s project will intersect with Replicator’s goals.</p>\n<p>DOGE officials have sought detailed technical data from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and the Defense Innovation Unit as part of their drone review, focusing on specifications such as weight, range and payload capacity. The team is expected to deliver recommendations to the Office of the Secretary of Defense within days.</p>\n<p>One person familiar with the plan said the goal is to purchase at least 30,000 drones in the next few months, with larger orders to follow. That would be a windfall for U.S. drone makers such as Red Cat (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RCAT\" title=\"Red Cat Holdings, Inc.\">RCAT</a></span>), Skydio, PDW and Neros, which are already supplying low-cost quadcopters to military branches.</p>\n<p>The effort is being led by Owen West, a former Marine and ex-Goldman Sachs energy trader who previously served as assistant secretary of defense for special operations. West co-authored Hegseth’s July drone memo and joined DOGE earlier this year, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Terex Corporation (TEX) Q3 2025  </p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Simon Meester, President, CEO &amp; Director, opened the call by highlighting \"We delivered $1.50 of EPS on sales of $1.4 billion with a cash conversion of 200% and are maintaining our full year outlook.\" He announced a transformative merger with REV Group, aiming to create \"a U.S.-centric large-scale specialty equipment manufacturer with iconic leading brands serving highly resilient and growing end markets.\" Meester emphasized that the combined company structure would result in Terex shareholders owning 58% and REV shareholders 42%, with REV shareholders also receiving $425 million in cash consideration.</p></li>\n<li><p>Meester stated the company will exit its Aerial segment, evaluating a potential sale or spin-off, which \"will significantly reduce our exposure to cyclical end markets.\" He outlined that the merger is expected to close in the first half of 2026, projecting at least $75 million in annual synergies and a mid-teens adjusted EBITDA profile, with a pro forma 2025 EBITDA margin of 14%.</p></li>\n<li><p>Mark Skonieczny, President and CEO of REV Group, indicated, \"Combining with Terex is a unique opportunity that we believe will create meaningful value for our shareholders.\" He described operational improvements, supply chain fortification, and early stages of product simplification as part of the foundation for growth.</p></li>\n<li><p>Jennifer Kong-Picarello, Senior VP &amp; CFO, confirmed synergy expectations: \"That's a net amount. So we have taken into account the dissynergies.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Management indicated the full year outlook is being maintained following Q3, with Meester stating, \"We are maintaining our full year outlook.\" The merger is expected to close in the first half of 2026, and the combined company will target $75 million in annual synergies and EBITDA margins of about 14% after the Aerial segment exit.</p></li>\n<li><p>No new explicit EPS or revenue guidance was provided for future quarters, but management expects the merged company to have a \"mid-teens adjusted EBITDA earnings profile in fiscal 2025 on a pro forma basis.\" A cash conversion rate of approximately 85% and pro forma sales of $5.8 billion were referenced for the combined entity.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Terex reported EPS of $1.50 for Q3 on sales of $1.4 billion and a cash conversion of 200%. These results align with \"another solid quarter\" as described by Meester. He noted that the company is \"maintaining our full year outlook.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>The merger agreement will result in the combined company having a pro forma revenue base of $5.8 billion, a strong balance sheet with approximately 2.5x leverage, and the opportunity to deleverage further after the Aerial segment exit.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Stephen Volkmann, Jefferies LLC: Asked about how the merger jump-starts future growth. Meester responded, \"It creates a new significantly less cyclical combined portfolio...besides the synergies...we do see a lot of growth potential...urban expansion, population growth, electrical grid upgrades, infrastructure investments, but also more waste and recycling.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Volkmann also questioned the timing of the Aerial segment exit. Meester replied, \"We are convinced that there will be plenty of suitors out there who will recognize the through-cycle value that we believe the Aerial's business will bring.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Mircea Dobre, Baird: Inquired about the rationale and valuation for the merger. Skonieczny explained, \"It provides the ability to participate in future upside of the company, the combined company. And the $425 million of cash consideration still leaves a strong balance sheet.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Jamie Cook, Truist: Asked about confidence in selling or spinning Access business and aftermarket growth. Meester expressed confidence in suitor interest, while Skonieczny commented, \"We're in the beginning stages of looking at telematics and other things that, that product offers.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Questions from other analysts centered on integration, synergy realization, and the timeline for the Aerial segment exit, which management said was starting formally as of the call date.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Analysts expressed cautious optimism, with several congratulations on the transaction but probing for details on growth, synergies, and execution risks.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management maintained a confident and forward-looking tone in both prepared remarks and Q&amp;A, emphasizing phrases such as \"we are very excited,\" \"we think we will hit the ground running,\" and \"we feel confident.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Compared to the previous quarter, management’s confidence has increased, with more emphasis on transformative change and less discussion of macro headwinds. Analyst tone shifted from near-term operational questions to probing the long-term strategic direction and integration challenges.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>A significant shift occurred in strategy with the announced merger and planned Aerial segment exit, replacing the previous quarter’s focus on incremental performance and tariff mitigation.</p></li>\n<li><p>The company’s tone this quarter is more assertive, with a focus on transformation, scale, and margin improvement, versus last quarter’s emphasis on segment performance and macroeconomic navigation.</p></li>\n<li><p>Analysts in the previous quarter were more focused on near-term margin and tariff impacts, while this quarter’s questions focused on deal rationale, synergy realization, and long-term growth drivers.</p></li>\n<li><p>Key metrics such as EPS and sales were slightly lower this quarter than Q2, but the outlook for margin, scale, and market positioning was more prominent.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Management acknowledged the cyclical nature of the Aerial segment and justified the planned exit as part of reducing exposure to cyclical end markets.</p></li>\n<li><p>Analysts raised concerns about the execution of the merger, synergy realization, the value and timing of the Aerial segment divestiture, and integration of REV’s businesses.</p></li>\n<li><p>Meester stated, \"We have a detailed project plan and will hit the ground running the day we close.\" He also described the process for the Aerial segment exit as \"starting the process formally today.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Terex’s Q3 2025 call marked a transformative moment with the announcement of a merger with REV Group and an exit from the Aerial segment. Management highlighted the creation of a less cyclical, U.S.-centric specialty equipment leader with a strong financial profile, targeting $75 million in annual synergies and a mid-teens EBITDA margin. The company emphasized readiness for integration, confidence in achieving planned synergies, and a robust outlook for the combined entity, while acknowledging execution and divestiture risks ahead.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/tex/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",
