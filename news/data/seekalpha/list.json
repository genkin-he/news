            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Arcosa, Inc. (ACA) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Antonio Carrillo, President and CEO, highlighted \"2025 was an outstanding year for Arcosa, demonstrated by our exceptional financial performance and significant advancement of our strategic transformation.\" He emphasized record revenues of $2.9 billion, record adjusted EBITDA of $583 million, and a 20.2% adjusted EBITDA margin. Carrillo pointed out momentum in Construction Materials and Engineered Structures, with cyclical expansion in both barge and wind towers. He announced the sale of the barge business for $450 million in cash, stating, \"we believe this is the right time to transition the barge business to an owner aligned with its long-term growth plans.\" Carrillo underscored the divestiture's impact, noting, \"The barge transaction further reduces portfolio complexity and cyclicality, raises our overall margin profile and enhances the long-term resiliency of the company.\"</li>\n<li>Gail Peck, Chief Financial Officer, reported, \"During the quarter, we generated $120 million of operating cash flow...CapEx for the fourth quarter was $64 million, resulting in full year CapEx of $166 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range.\" Peck confirmed that free cash flow for the quarter was roughly $60 million and was $202 million for the full year. She commented, \"We ended the year with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.3x comfortably within our target leverage range. This is down from 2.9x at the start of the year.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Carrillo set 2026 revenue guidance at $2.95 billion to $3.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA between $590 million and $640 million, both excluding the barge divestiture impact. He stated, \"Our 2026 guidance incorporates another record year for our growth businesses, Construction Materials and Engineered Structures.\"</li>\n<li>Barge business guidance for 2026 is full year revenues of $410 million to $430 million and adjusted EBITDA of $70 million to $75 million. The company will update full year guidance once the barge sale closes.</li>\n<li>Carrillo indicated, \"With combined double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and margin uplift\" expected for growth businesses, and a \"short-term step-down in wind towers before recovering in 2027.\"</li>\n<li>Peck projected CapEx for 2026 of $220 million to $250 million, including $70 million to $80 million for growth and $150 million to $170 million for maintenance. Net interest expense is expected between $88 million and $90 million. Effective tax rate for 2026 is estimated at 17.5% to 19.5%.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Peck stated, \"Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 13% and margin expanded 90 basis points, with all segments contributing.\"</li>\n<li>Construction Products segment revenues decreased 2% in Q4, but excluding freight, revenues increased 4% and adjusted segment EBITDA grew 3% with 140 basis points of margin expansion.</li>\n<li>Aggregates business reported freight-adjusted revenues up roughly 8%, driven by 5% pricing growth and 2% volume improvement. Adjusted cash gross profit increased 6% and per ton increased 3%.</li>\n<li>Engineered Structures saw segment revenues rise 15%, led by a 20% increase for utility and related structures. Wind tower revenue increased 3%.</li>\n<li>Transportation Products revenues rose 19% and adjusted segment EBITDA increased 24%, mainly from higher tank barge volumes and favorable mix.</li>\n<li>Free cash flow for the quarter was roughly $60 million, and for the year $202 million. Liquidity stood at $915 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ian Zaffino, Oppenheimer: Asked about redeployment of barge sale proceeds and future moves to reduce cyclicality. Carrillo responded, \"we have a very active pipeline of opportunities...mainly bolt-on acquisitions,\" and emphasized, \"now that we're a simpler company, we will focus our full attention into deploying the capital to generate additional value for our shareholders.\"</li>\n<li>Ethan Roberts, Stephens: Inquired about utility structures as a growth driver and offset to wind. Peck replied, \"we do see a path to that strong utility compensating for the step down in wind,\" and expects \"flat to maybe slight growth within the segment for next year.\"</li>\n<li>Garik Shmois, Loop Capital: Questioned Q1 impact from Northeast weather and gross profit per ton expectations. Peck answered, \"with the weather and the snow here recently, we'll see that percentage share drop just a little bit\" and anticipates \"solid unit profitability gains on -- for 2026.\"</li>\n<li>Julio Romero, Sidoti: Explored accelerating utility structures demand and customer reservations. Carrillo explained, \"we see the need to accelerate our capacity expansion because our customers need it...we had a market study by a third-party, analyze utility investment over the next 5 to 10 years.\"</li>\n<li>Brent Thielman, D.A. Davidson: Asked about Engineered Structures margin sustainability and M&amp;A pipeline. Peck responded, \"wind is going to have an impact for sure...a path to flat margins for the segment looks achievable.\" Carrillo reiterated disciplined capital allocation for M&amp;A.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts probed the sustainability of growth, impact of weather, and capital allocation, with a generally positive but inquisitive tone, seeking clarity on future growth drivers and margin implications.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and optimistic stance throughout, with Carrillo stating, \"we are a simpler company, we will focus our full attention into deploying the capital to generate additional value for our shareholders.\" Peck’s tone was measured and precise regarding financial discipline and outlook.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management were more focused on post-divestiture strategy and capital deployment, with management’s confidence levels remaining high.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance for 2026 was introduced, with a revenue range of $2.95 billion to $3.1 billion and higher projected CapEx versus the previous quarter’s $145 million to $155 million range.</li>\n<li>The company announced a key strategic shift with the barge business sale, whereas the previous quarter emphasized strong performance across segments and steady deleveraging.</li>\n<li>Analyst questions shifted from clarifying past performance to future capital deployment and growth direction post-divestiture.</li>\n<li>Management’s tone remained confident, with greater focus on executing a streamlined, growth-focused strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management referenced weather-related headwinds in the Northeast affecting Q1 results for Stavola and acknowledged ongoing policy uncertainty in the wind tower business.</li>\n<li>Carrillo cited, \"policy uncertainty makes it -- we need to get through the noise\" regarding wind towers, while also emphasizing risk mitigation through business rightsizing and facility transitions.</li>\n<li>Peck noted seasonality and weather as factors impacting quarterly financial cadence, particularly in Q1 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Arcosa management underscored a pivotal year, marked by record performance, a strategic divestiture to simplify the business and strengthen its margin profile, and a sharpened focus on growth in Construction Materials and Engineered Structures. With clear 2026 financial targets, a robust M&amp;A pipeline, and continued investment in capacity expansion, management signaled confidence in leveraging infrastructure and power market tailwinds to create additional value for shareholders while navigating near-term headwinds in wind towers and weather-impacted regions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/aca/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

Assuming Microsoft is diluted with this funding round, he believes Microsoft owns roughly $200B worth of OpenAI, or about 7% of Microsoft's market cap. “Removing this from Microsoft’s valuation makes the current multiple that much more attractive,” he explained.</p>\n<p>For Oracle, Slowinski said the debate now moves on to whether Oracle can actually execute its contracts. “While we would have initially assumed that closing the raise would be viewed positively for Oracle, we worry the debate will simply shift to the ROI of AI and whether Oracle’s capital investments will ultimately deliver an attractive return, especially as OpenAI appears to be increasingly diversifying its cloud compute stack,” the analyst explained.</p>\n<p>Other questions may include whether OpenAI needs Oracle Cloud Infrastructure after Oracle delivers on its initial contract, given the increased commitment between OpenAI and Amazon Web Services, Slowinski said.</p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

However, the analysts noted that fourth quarter operating income ($88M versus Street at $133M) and EBITDA ($898M versus consensus at $929M) came in below consensus as ramp-up/installation costs related to an uptick in capacity coming online weighed on profitability.</p>\n<p>\"While the ramp dynamics will create noise around margins near term as CRWV adds more capacity, we note that the overall demand backdrop remains robust and believe CRWV remains well-positioned to capture an outsized share of the AI cloud opportunity. Furthermore, we see potential for upside from 1) monetization of software stack, 2) continued ramp up/installation period management, and 3) upsell of other cloud solutions (CPU, storage),\" said Daryanani and his team.</p>\n<p>Related stocks: Nebius (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NBIS\" title=\"Nebius Group N.V.\">NBIS</a>) fell about 7%, while Super Micro Computer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMCI\" title=\"Super Micro Computer, Inc.\">SMCI</a>) rose around 2% on Friday.</p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

UBS now forecasts global GDP growth of 3.4% in 2026, up from 2.7% previously, arguing that a broadening recovery could favor more cyclical markets.</p>\n<p data-end=\"1061\" data-start=\"718\">The bank also warned that a weaker dollar may weigh on unhedged U.S. returns, noting that currency losses have recently outweighed the earnings uplift typically associated with dollar depreciation. Meanwhile, U.S. buyback yields are now broadly in line with global peers, reducing a key pillar of support for earnings per share and valuations.</p>\n<p data-end=\"1189\" data-start=\"1063\">UBS flagged that sector-adjusted price-to-earnings ratios in the U.S. stand about 35% above peers, well above long-term norms.</p>\n<p data-end=\"1475\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\" data-start=\"1191\">By contrast, emerging markets are seen as benefiting from accelerating global growth, cheaper valuations, and potential dollar weakness.
