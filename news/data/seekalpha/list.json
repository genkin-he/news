(DV) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Mark Zagorski opened the call by highlighting a \"strong 38% adjusted EBITDA margin and 8% year-over-year growth in revenue,\" noting that revenue came in below expectations due to late-quarter retail campaign pullbacks from agency-related changes. He emphasized \"exceptional strength across multiple sectors in the fourth quarter, including health care and technology\" and pointed out \"no new deactivations among our Top 100 customers in Q4 and usage across social and streaming TV continues to scale.\"</li>\n<li>Zagorski stated, \"Social activation accelerated meaningfully growing at approximately 60% year-over-year in Q4 and starting 2026 at an even stronger year-over-year growth rate.\" He also reported \"Authentic AdVantage on YouTube is entering the year with $8 million of expected ACV\" and that CTV measurement impression volumes were \"up 22% for the quarter.\"</li>\n<li>He elaborated on product innovation, explaining, \"Our product innovation in 2025 harnessed the power of AI to expand TAM, improved solution efficacy and drove stronger margins and also helped deliver solid results that will set the stage for future growth.\"</li>\n<li>Zagorski discussed share repurchases: \"As of today, we have $300 million authorized for share repurchases, the largest amount in DV's history, which we plan to actively deploy in 2026 at increased levels versus prior years.\"</li>\n<li>CFO Nicola Allais reported, \"For the fourth quarter, revenue was $206 million, representing 8% year-over-year growth. For the full year, revenue was $748 million, representing 14% year-over-year growth despite variability driven by the retail sector in the second half.\"</li>\n<li>Allais noted, \"In the fourth quarter, activation revenue increased 6% year-over-year and measurement revenue increased 8% year-over-year, both driven primarily by Social.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Allais guided, \"For the first quarter, we expect revenue to range between $177 million and $183 million, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 9% at the midpoint and adjusted EBITDA to range between $48 million and $52 million.\"</li>\n<li>For full year 2026, \"we expect revenue to range between $810 million and $826 million, representing an 8% to 10% year-over-year increase.\"</li>\n<li>Allais described the growth drivers: \"Incremental growth in 2026 off the base will be driven by 3 product-led growth engines: first, adoption and scale deployment of the recently launched solutions across Social and Streaming TV; second, incremental revenue growth from existing enterprise clients scaling across our product offering; and third, continued new customer acquisition driven by DV's differentiated MAP product vision.\"</li>\n<li>She added, \"We expect adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 34%\" for 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Allais stated, \"In the fourth quarter, total advertiser revenue, which includes activation and measurement grew 7% year-over-year driven by 8% growth in volume or MTM, partially offset by a 3% decline in price or MTF.\"</li>\n<li>\"Fourth quarter activation revenue grew 6%, with ABS representing 52% of activation revenue in the quarter.\"</li>\n<li>\"Measurement revenue grew 8% year-over-year, with Social measurement revenue increasing 11% and representing 49% of measurement revenue and international revenue increasing 5% and representing 29% of measurement revenue.\"</li>\n<li>\"For the full year, we achieved a net revenue retention rate of 109%, and gross revenue retention remained above 95% for the fifth consecutive year.\"</li>\n<li>Free cash flow was reported as \"approximately $173 million, representing a conversion rate of approximately 70%, up from 61% in 2024.\"</li>\n<li>\"We ended 2025 with approximately 162 million shares outstanding, approximately $260 million in cash and no long-term debt.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Matthew Swanson, RBC Capital Markets, asked about the AI revolution and product cycle. CEO Zagorski responded, \"We're early first inning. Like we're just scratching the surface right now, which makes it so exciting. As we noted, we see AI as nothing but a huge opportunity for DV.\"</li>\n<li>Swanson also inquired about bundling strategy (MAP). Zagorski answered, \"It's been a really solid response to our first integrated product, which is Authentic AdVantage. That's for YouTube that is bundling together prebid social filtering plus post-bid measurement plus optimization on YouTube. That helped drive Social Activation to 60% growth year-over-year.\"</li>\n<li>Matthew Condon, Citizens JMP Securities, asked about Q4 spend pullbacks and Q1 confidence.
