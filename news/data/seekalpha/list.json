            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Sales of Venezuelan oil under the flagship supply agreement with the United States are expected to reach $2B by the end of February, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright told reporters in Texas on Thursday.</p>\n<p>The deal, which began after U.S. forces captured President Nicolás Maduro in early January, gives Washington control over Venezuela’s oil exports, with proceeds directed into a U.S.-supervised fund in Qatar.</p>\n<p>Under the pact, major trading houses Vitol and Trafigura have been marketing most of Venezuela’s crude, while partners of state oil company PDVSA, particularly Chevron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX\" title=\"Chevron Corporation\">CVX</a>), are boosting production and shipments.</p>\n<p>Earlier in February, Wright projected that total sales from Venezuela could reach $5B within a few months as exports expand. About 40M barrels are expected to have been sold by the end of February at roughly $50 per barrel, he said.</p>\n<p>\"Most of that oil will go here to the U.S. Gulf Coast, but it'll go to India, it'll go to Asia, it's going to Europe,\" Wright said. \"Every barrel you produce will be sold, so the question is just where.\"</p>\n<p>Chinese independent refineries, which had previously imported sanctioned Venezuelan crude, are now able to buy it on the open market under the deal, Wright added.</p>\n<p>Crude (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CL1:COM\" title=\"Crude Oil Futures\">CL1:COM</a>) futures were up 0.46% at $65.77/bbl at press time, while Brent crude (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CO1:COM\" title=\"Brent Futures\">CO1:COM</a>) traded around $71.34.
