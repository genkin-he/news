            "title": "DXC targets doubling SAP and SaaS revenue over next 2-3 years while advancing AI-driven fast track solutions",
            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: DXC Technology Company (DXC) Q2 2026</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Raul Fernandez, President and CEO, stated that the quarter's financial performance was mixed, exceeding guidance on adjusted EBIT margin and non-GAAP diluted EPS, with strong free cash flow, but underperforming on revenue and bookings. Fernandez emphasized, \"We are laser-focused on building a predictable and growing company with better execution and pipeline conversion in the quarters ahead.\" He introduced a formalized two-track strategy: the core track, which aims to scale established businesses like SAP (targeting a doubling of SAP revenue over the next three years), and the fast track, focused on AI-native or AI-infused solutions with the goal \"to be 10% of our business within 36 months.\"</li>\n<li>Fernandez highlighted the launch of products such as DXC CoreIgnite for financial services, which aims to modernize bank infrastructure and create new revenue streams, as well as a partnership with Splitit to enable banks to offer Buy Now, Pay Later from existing accounts. He also introduced OASIS, an AI-powered orchestration platform soon to be piloted in managed services, and noted plans to double SaaS revenue in the insurance business in each of the next two years. \"These are 3 of our many fast-track pilots that are in the works,\" Fernandez added, pointing to broad AI adoption internally and the launch of the Xponential AI framework for clients.</li>\n<li>Robert Del Bene, Chief Financial Officer, reported, \"Total revenue was $3.2 billion, declining 4.2% year-to-year on an organic basis within our guidance range and consistent with the past several quarters.\" Del Bene commented on three consecutive quarters with a trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio above 1 and stated, \"Adjusted EBIT margin was 8%, coming in above the high end of our guidance range, reflecting disciplined cost management across the company.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul><li>The company now expects total revenue of $12.67 billion to $12.81 billion for fiscal 2026, narrowing the organic revenue year-to-year decline to 3.5%–4.5%. CES is expected to decline low single digits organically, GIS to decline mid-single digits, and insurance to grow mid-single digits. Adjusted EBIT margin is anticipated between 7%–8%, and non-GAAP diluted EPS between $2.85 and $3.35. Free cash flow guidance increased to approximately $650 million for the year. For Q3, DXC anticipates a 4%–5% organic revenue decline, adjusted EBIT margin of 7%–8%, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.75 to $0.85. Del Bene stated, \"We anticipate a third quarter book-to-bill ratio greater than 1.\" </li></ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul><li>Total revenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion, down 4.2% year-over-year. Bookings increased approximately 2% year-over-year for a book-to-bill ratio of 0.85. The trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio was 1.08. Adjusted EBIT margin reached 8%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.84, compared to $0.93 in the same quarter last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $240 million, up from $48 million year-over-year. CES segment revenue declined 3.4% organically, GIS declined 6.3%, while insurance grew 3.6% organically. The company repurchased $75 million in shares during the quarter, with $467 million remaining under the repurchase program.</li></ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bryan Bergin, TD Cowen, asked about CES performance and early improvement areas. Fernandez explained the focus on both core and fast track, with targeted plans to improve SAP revenue and leverage legacy assets like Hogan software for new fast-track AI solutions. Bergin also inquired about the sustainability of higher free cash flow, to which Del Bene responded, \"It's sustainable. We're going to keep that benefit.\"</li>\n<li>Antonio (for James Faucette, Morgan Stanley) questioned GIS trends and Hogan’s role. Fernandez clarified that Hogan is part of CES, and GIS is seeing improved customer metrics and new product pipeline momentum. Del Bene added that project-based services in both CES and GIS have faced difficulties, but pipelines are building.</li>\n<li>Yu Lee, Guggenheim Securities, asked about assumptions in revenue and margin outlook, and customer confidence in closing large deals amid pricing competition. Del Bene described macro assumptions as stable and based on backlog and pipelines, with pricing remaining stable over recent quarters.</li>\n<li>Tien-Tsin Huang, JPMorgan, focused on the CoreIgnite product and revenue model shift. Fernandez confirmed CoreIgnite is \"accretive and additive\" without impacting existing Hogan terms and sees value-based pricing as a future evolution.</li>\n<li>James Friedman, Susquehanna, asked about managing and disclosing fast track, and the scale of Hogan. Fernandez will provide more product details next year and said, \"Not all of them will be successful, but only a few of them need to be successful to help change the revenue trajectory of this company.\"</li>\n<li>Bradley Clark, BMO, pressed on cost discipline and margin sustainability. Del Bene expressed confidence in continued cost management and margin improvement, assisted by AI tools.</li>\n<li>Paul Obrecht, Wolfe Research, inquired about headcount strategy with AI integration. Fernandez sees a shift from a labor pyramid to a diamond, with AI agents at the base and ongoing workforce upskilling.</li>\n<li>Rod Bourgeois, DeepDive Equity Research, asked about milestones enabling fast track. Fernandez attributed progress to new talent and the pivot from defensive turnaround work to innovative fast-track execution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts voiced cautious optimism but probed on execution, pipeline conversion, and the sustainability of improved metrics, with a focus on the timing and impact of AI initiatives. Questions reflected a neutral to slightly positive tone, with some skepticism around revenue growth and margin improvement.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and proactive tone in both prepared remarks and Q&amp;A, frequently referencing pipeline strength, AI-driven transformation, and cost discipline, with statements such as \"We are confident our book-to-bill will move back above 1 in the second half of the fiscal year.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, analyst sentiment was slightly more probing regarding the tangible impact of new initiatives, while management’s tone grew more assertive about the potential of their AI strategy and new product launches.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul><li>The company’s two-track strategy and fast track AI initiatives were more explicitly articulated this quarter, with defined revenue growth targets for SAP and SaaS products. Guidance for organic revenue decline was narrowed, and free cash flow expectations were raised by $50 million. Bookings growth moderated from the previous quarter’s double digits to 2% growth. Management’s tone indicated increased confidence in AI strategy execution and pipeline conversion, whereas previously, focus was more on foundational turnaround and new leadership appointments. Analysts’ questions shifted from general transformation progress to more specific inquiries about product execution, sustainability of gains, and competitive positioning.</li></ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul><li>Management acknowledged underperformance in revenue and bookings, the need for improved pipeline conversion, and ongoing pressure in discretionary project-based services. Del Bene noted that project-based services have experienced difficulty across the board. Fernandez highlighted the challenge of ensuring that strong technical capabilities translate into revenue growth, particularly in SAP and fast track products. Analysts questioned the predictability of revenue and the sustainability of cost savings, as well as the risk of shifting labor models with greater AI integration.</li></ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>DXC Technology signaled a transition from foundational turnaround to growth, centering on an ambitious AI-driven fast track strategy and setting targets to double SAP and SaaS revenues in the next several years. Management highlighted tangible progress in cost control, free cash flow generation, and product innovation, but also acknowledged the need for stronger booking conversion and top-line growth. The company’s focus on leveraging legacy assets, expanding AI-powered solutions, and sustaining disciplined execution underpins its outlook for improved profitability and renewed market confidence.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/dxc/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

Tick explained the prototype will focus on brand familiarity and flexibility, while the pizza refresh is expected to build over time. Daniel Duran added test locations showed \"about a 10% uplift in our pizza incidence overall.\"</li>\n<li>Todd Brooks, Benchmark: Questioned where the brand is positioned to play offense in 2026. Tick cited \"continued work on the menu renovations\" and the new restaurant prototype as main drivers.</li>\n<li>Brian Mullan, Piper Sandler: Asked about awareness-building for the pizza launch.

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Algoma Steel Group Inc. (ASTL) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Michael Garcia opened by emphasizing Algoma's ongoing commitment to workplace safety and highlighted three central themes for the quarter: \"The U.S. 50% tariffs have effectively closed that market to us, driving lower shipments and higher production costs as we've pivoted our entire go-to-market strategy.\" Garcia detailed the company's capital strengthening through $500 million in government support and an expanded USD 375 million ABL facility, stating, \"We have embarked on an operational pivot, accelerating our EAF transformation and focusing on products for the domestic market with the goal of significantly reducing our cash burn.\"</li>\n<li>Garcia described the industry as facing \"significant disruption\" due to U.S. tariffs, leading to lower shipment volumes and elevated cost pressures. He also noted the plate mill as a bright spot, reporting plate shipments of approximately 97,000 tons in the quarter, and anticipated increased Q4 plate production.</li>\n<li>Regarding the electric arc furnace (EAF) project, Garcia reported that \"commissioning and ramp-up activities for Unit 1 have progressed in line with expectations,\" with a cumulative investment of $910 million by September 30, 2025, and a final projected cost of $987 million.</li>\n<li>Garcia announced his retirement at year-end, with CFO Rajat Marwah appointed as the next CEO effective January 1, 2026, and Michael Moraca promoted to CFO.</li>\n<li>CFO Rajat Marwah stated, \"Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $87.1 million. For the quarter, tariffs expense totaled $90 million, and we estimate Canadian sales prices were approximately 40% lower on account of tariffs, resulting in lower revenue of approximately $32 million.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management expects a \"significant inventory drawdown beginning in the fourth quarter and accelerating through 2026 as we exit the blast furnace and coke oven operations and transition to a far more efficient EAF-based supply chain.\"</li>\n<li>Marwah explained, \"A combination of our strategic operational pivot, liquidity support, working capital efficiency improvements and continued effort on driving down cost is expected to extend our liquidity runway well into the future as we look to capture opportunities and diversify the business.\"</li>\n<li>The company is focusing on completing the EAF ramp-up, pursuing diversification, and further aligning with domestic infrastructure, construction, and renewable energy sectors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 was a loss of $87.1 million.</li>\n<li>Tariffs costs for the quarter were $90 million.</li>\n<li>Cash used in operating activities was $117.3 million, with quarter-end liquidity at $337 million.</li>\n<li>Steel revenue reached $473 million, with shipment volumes at 419,000 net tons.</li>\n<li>Net sales realization averaged $1,129 per ton, while cost per ton sold averaged $1,282.</li>\n<li>Net loss was $485.1 million, primarily due to a $503 million noncash impairment loss triggered by market capitalization falling below net asset value and the impact of U.S. tariffs.</li>\n<li>Inventories stood at $790 million, up $54 million from Q2, partly due to a $14.8 million noncash write-down.</li>\n<li>The company secured $500 million in government liquidity support and expanded its ABL facility to USD 375 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ian Gillies, Stifel: Asked about production profile for 2026 and EBITDA breakeven given continued tariffs. Garcia responded that the company is \"accelerating...transition to full EAF production basically a year early,\" and Marwah indicated volumes could be \"as close as 1 million to 1.2 million tons for the year\" with EBITDA approaching breakeven after the transition.</li>\n<li>Gillies: Questioned sequential plate production. Marwah attributed lower Q3 plate output to maintenance outages but stated, \"We're running our plate mill at full production other than the days we need to take for maintenance.\"</li>\n<li>Gillies: Asked about expected capital infusions from insurance, government grants, and tax refunds. Moraca estimated \"somewhere between $30 million and $50 million more to come\" from insurance, and a \"significant working capital release over the next 12 months...north of $100 million, $150 million.\"</li>\n<li>James McGarragle, RBC: Inquired about updated CapEx and working capital for Q4. Marwah said CapEx would decline as blast furnace operations wind down and highlighted an expected working capital release.</li>\n<li>McGarragle: Queried EAF cost targets. Marwah stated initial cost would be \"scrap plus USD 220 to 250,\" declining as production scales.</li>\n<li>McGarragle: Asked if Canadian market could support 2.5 million tonnes.

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Columbia Sportswear Company (COLM) Q3 2025  </p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Timothy Boyle, Chairman, CEO &amp; President, stated that \"third quarter results reflect sustained momentum in international markets, led by double-digit percent sales growth in our Europe direct business.\" He highlighted the launch of the new global brand platform, Engineered for Whatever, and the positive early response from consumers. Boyle noted that the U.S. business is being revitalized through the ACCELERATE Growth Strategy and emphasized the importance of the new campaign: \"The early response to this campaign has been overwhelmingly positive with millions of consumers already engaged since the launch.\" He also discussed the direct impact of incremental tariff rates, estimating a $35 million to $40 million effect for 2025, with an annualized unmitigated impact of $160 million, and outlined steps to mitigate these effects in 2026, including price increases and vendor negotiations.</li>\n<li>Jim Swanson, Executive VP &amp; CFO, stated, \"SG&amp;A expense increased 5%, including investments in demand creation to launch Columbia's new brand platform Engineered for Whatever. During the third quarter, we incurred $29 million in noncash impairment charges related to prAna and Mountain Hardwear. Including the impairments, which impacted earnings by $0.46, third quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.95.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Boyle provided guidance for the fourth quarter, stating, \"we expect net sales to decline 5% to 8% year-over-year and diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.34. This brings our full year net sales outlook to $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion or flat to down 1% year-over-year. Full year diluted earnings per share is expected to be $2.55 to $2.85, including the $0.46 impact from impairments in this quarter.\" He reiterated that the forecast for spring 2026 is for flat to low single-digit wholesale growth in the first half, unchanged from the previous call.</li>\n<li>Management maintained their strategy of offsetting higher tariffs through a combination of price increases, vendor negotiations, and resourcing production, aiming to restore product margin percentages to historic levels.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Boyle reported that \"Net sales increased 1% year-over-year to $943 million. This was ahead of our outlook, driven by earlier-than-planned shipments of fall '25 wholesale orders. Overall, wholesale net sales increased 5%, while direct-to-consumer was down 5%. Gross margin declined 20 basis points to 50%.\" He also noted $29 million in noncash impairment charges, primarily related to tariffs.</li>\n<li>U.S. net sales decreased 4%, with U.S. wholesale flat and U.S. DTC net sales down high single-digit percent, attributed to the closure of temporary clearance locations and declining sales productivity. E-commerce saw a low double-digit percent decline.</li>\n<li>International growth was led by LAAP net sales up 6%, China up mid-single digits, EMEA up 10%, and Canada up 7%. Japan experienced a low single-digit decrease, and Korea was flat.</li>\n<li>Among brands, Columbia net sales increased 1%, SOREL rose 10%, prAna grew 6%, and Mountain Hardwear declined 5%.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Robert Drbul, BTIG: Asked about product differentiation and the product pipeline. Boyle: Confirmed strong velocity for the Amaze Puff and upcoming launches, including men's versions and additional footwear from the archives.</li>\n<li>John Kernan, TD Cowen: Inquired about tariff mitigation and pricing power. Boyle: \"We are quite good at it. I mean this is a daunting task, But we think we're up for it...we think we'll be able to navigate it.\"</li>\n<li>Kernan also questioned SG&amp;A deleverage. Swanson: \"...our marketing spend last year was just under 6% and will probably be at or just above 6.5% this year.\"</li>\n<li>Paul Lejuez, Citigroup: Queried about lower promotions and order books. Swanson: Cited lapping last year's heavy liquidation and emphasized ongoing healthy dealer margins. Boyle affirmed that price increases are included in the U.S. order books.</li>\n<li>Peter McGoldrick, Stifel: Asked about U.S. performance and SOREL's growth outlook. Boyle: Plans for SOREL to become year-round and grow non-winter product lines.</li>\n<li>Laurent Vasilescu, BNP Paribas: Questioned the guidance cut and U.S. performance. Swanson: Attributed adjustment to softness in U.S. DTC, with China expected to rebound.</li>\n<li>Tom Nikic, Needham: Asked about gross margin headwinds. Swanson: Projected gross margin down slightly more in Q4 due to tariffs, offset partly by lower liquidation.</li>\n<li>Jonathan Komp, Baird: Inquired about inventory and margin recovery. Boyle: Channel inventories are healthy, with specific products performing well.</li>\n<li>Mitchel Kummetz, Seaport: Questioned DTC trends and the ACCELERATE strategy's product progress. Boyle: Attributed DTC decline primarily to fewer clearance stores and highlighted successful higher-priced products.</li>\n<li>Mauricio Serna, UBS: Asked about price increases and SG&amp;A trends. Boyle: High single-digit price increases for spring and fall; Swanson: SG&amp;A up low to mid-single digits in Q4, with half of Q3's increase due to demand creation investment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed on tariff mitigation, U.S. DTC challenges, margin recovery, and promotional activity, with a neutral to slightly negative tone and recurring concerns about SG&amp;A deleverage and order book health.</li>\n<li>Management maintained confidence in tariff navigation and brand revitalization, frequently emphasizing strengths: \"We are quite good at it...we think we'll be able to navigate it,\" and optimism about the ACCELERATE strategy and new product launches.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, analyst tone remains cautious, while management continues to project confidence in strategic initiatives and mitigation plans.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance for full-year net sales and EPS was reiterated at $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion and $2.55 to $2.85, respectively, consistent with prior outlooks but with more explicit absorption of impairment charges.</li>\n<li>The ACCELERATE strategy and Engineered for Whatever campaign moved from planning to active rollout, with early positive consumer engagement reported.</li>\n<li>International growth momentum persisted, but U.S. DTC trends deteriorated further, with continued downsizing of clearance locations and more pronounced e-commerce weakness.</li>\n<li>Management tone remained confident in prepared remarks, but the Q&amp;A reflected persistent analyst skepticism on key issues, especially tariffs and expense leverage.</li>\n<li>Analysts continue to focus on U.S. weakness and margin pressures, mirroring concerns from the previous quarter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management highlighted the direct impact of incremental tariffs, estimating $35 million to $40 million for 2025 and up to $160 million annualized without mitigation.</li>\n<li>The company is absorbing much of the 2025 tariff impact and plans to offset the 2026 effect through price increases, vendor negotiations, and production resourcing.</li>\n<li>U.S. DTC softness, closure of clearance stores, and e-commerce declines remain headwinds.</li>\n<li>SG&amp;A deleverage persists due to increased marketing investments, with mitigation targeted through profit improvement plans and cost reductions.</li>\n<li>Weather-related demand volatility and uncertain consumer response to price increases were cited as ongoing risks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Columbia Sportswear management emphasized the early momentum of its ACCELERATE Growth Strategy and Engineered for Whatever campaign, citing international strength and positive product launches as key drivers. Despite ongoing U.S. challenges and material tariff headwinds, the company reiterated its commitment to restoring growth and profitability through targeted mitigation efforts, new marketing strategies, and continued investment in brand and product innovation. Full-year guidance was reaffirmed, and management remains confident in its ability to navigate the evolving tariff landscape and unlock long-term growth opportunities.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/colm/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: INmune Bio (INMB) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>David Moss, President, CEO, Treasurer, Secretary &amp; Director, stated the company has transitioned its focus after concluding the Alzheimer's trial in June and is now advancing its platform drug programs toward key development milestones. Moss said, \"CORDStrom is our most advanced program as we are now in the process of preparing for submission for marketing approval to the regulatory bodies in both the U.K. and the U.S.\" He highlighted CORDStrom's potential as \"one of the first systemic treatments for RDEB\" and described ongoing work on platform expansion into other indications and possible genetic modifications for cancer.</li>\n<li>Moss provided updates on the XPro platform, noting management is \"actively pursuing an accelerated regulatory pathway and preparing for our end of Phase II meeting with the FDA.\" He emphasized that defining the next steps for XPro is a top priority and important for future funding and partnership discussions.</li>\n<li>Moss referenced the completion of the Phase II trial of INKmune in prostate cancer, with the primary endpoint and 2 of 3 secondary endpoints met.</li>\n<li>Dr. Mark Lowdell, Chief Scientific Officer &amp; Chief Manufacturing Officer, reported CORDStrom is now in CGMP manufacturing space and technology transfer was completed, putting the company \"on track to be ready for U.K. filing at the end of Q2 next year.\" Lowdell also discussed ongoing statistical data analysis for the MissionEB trial and progress in INKmune's development.</li>\n<li>Dr. CJ Barnum, Head of Neuroscience, outlined four priorities for XPro: regulatory alignment, accelerated approval, publishing insights from Phase II MINDFuL trial, and advancing partnership discussions. Barnum stated, \"The findings demonstrate that longer treatment durations with XPro are associated with greater improvements in neuropsychiatric symptoms and biomarkers, including pTau217 and GFAP.\"</li>\n<li>Cory Ellspermann, Interim CFO, said, \"Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, was approximately $6.5 million compared with approximately $12.1 million for the comparable period in 2024.\" Ellspermann added, \"At September 30, 2025, the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $27.7 million... sufficient to fund our operations into Q4 2026.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Moss stated, \"For our CORDStrom program, we have a number of significant events in front of us. In Q4, we'll present additional data from the trial. In mid-'26, we expect to file a marketing authorization application in the U.K. A few months after... we expect to file a BLA, biologics licensing application with the FDA. We'd expect to hear back from the FDA sometime by the middle of '27 or later.\"</li>\n<li>Moss indicated that for XPro, further MRI data from the MINDFuL trial is expected in Q4, and feedback from the FDA on accelerated pathway and end of Phase II meeting minutes are anticipated in Q1 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ellspermann reported, \"Research and development expenses totaled approximately $4.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, compared with approximately $10.1 million for the comparable period in 2024. General and administrative expenses were approximately $2.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, compared with approximately $2.2 million for the comparable period in 2024.\"</li>\n<li>Ellspermann stated the company's cash position at $27.7 million as of September 30, 2025, with a runway into Q4 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Denis Reznik, Raymond James Ltd., asked about the timeline for the end of Phase II FDA meeting for XPro and reasons for any delay. Moss responded the delay was due to not having \"enough of the data in time to really get it to the FDA,\" but \"we're very close.\"</li>\n<li>Reznik asked about partnership discussions for XPro and INKmune's future. Moss said, \"Before we really have aggressive partnering discussions... they want to see what the regulatory feedback and alignment looks like\" and more data. Lowdell added, \"I'm always very keen to talk to potential partners and others that would want to invest in or buy the asset.\"</li>\n<li>Jason McCarthy, Maxim Group, inquired about regulatory feedback for CORDStrom's MAA filing. Lowdell replied, \"We are waiting for our scientific meeting with the MHRA... I'm expecting early next month to submit the data to the agency for a scientific advice meeting.\" He also noted the aim to file the MAA by Q2 next year.</li>\n<li>McCarthy also asked about CORDStrom's mechanism and platform potential. Lowdell described the unique donor selection and pooling process, making CORDStrom \"a platform for multiple different indications.\"</li>\n<li>An unknown analyst (Matt for Jim Molloy, AGP) questioned CORDStrom's place in the U.K. treatment paradigm.
