            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">U.S. President Donald Trump said Saturday that the U.S. military has begun “major combat operations” in Iran, confirming American participation in coordinated strikes after Israel launched attacks on Iranian targets.</p>\n<p><span>“Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime, a vicious group of very hard, terrible people,” Trump said in a video message on his Truth Social account.</span></p>\n<p>Airstrikes carried out by both the U.S. and Israel have targeted multiple provinces across Iran. Iranian state media reported that the Islamic Republic is preparing what it described as a “crushing response.”</p>\n<p>Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz <span>described the attack as being done “to remove threats.”</span></p>\n<p>The attack followed after the third round of talks failed between the U.S. and Iran. Ahead of the discussions, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Iran’s reluctance to talk about its ballistic missile development program, alongside its nuclear program, was a “big, big problem.” Iran had said it was willing to compromise when it came to its nuclear program, but had repeatedly said Tehran’s missile program had never been part of the talks’ agenda.</p>\n<p>U.S. President Donald Trump warned earlier in February that “really bad things” would happen unless Tehran agreed to a deal over the future of its nuclear program. The attack, which comes after a significant build up of military assets in the oil-rich Middle East region.</p>\n<p>Iran, a founding member of OPEC, is a key global oil producer and controls territory along the strategically crucial Strait of Hormuz, a chokepoint that handles roughly 20% of the world’s oil supply.</p>\n<p>Last June, the U.S. carried out strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, with intelligence assessments indicating significant damage to Tehran’s nuclear program. Iran later retaliated with a strike on a U.S. air base in Qatar, reportedly causing minor damage and no casualties.</p>\n<p><span><strong>Crude oil ETFs</strong>: (</span><span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USO\" title=\"United States Oil Fund LP ETF\">USO</a></span><span>), (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BNO\" title=\"United States Brent Oil Fund LP ETF\">BNO</a><span>), (</span><span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UCO\" title=\"ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil ETF\">UCO</a></span><span>), (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCO\" title=\"ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil ETF\">SCO</a><span>), (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USL\" title=\"United States 12 Month Oil Fund LP ETF\">USL</a><span>), (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DBO\" title=\"Invesco DB Oil Fund ETF\">DBO</a><span>), (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DRIP\" title=\"Direxion Daily S&amp;P Oil &amp;

Anatomic pathology revenue is projected to reach $162 million, up 53% from 2025, while biopharma revenue is expected to decrease to $20 million. \"We expect non-GAAP gross margins for the full year to be slightly above 40% as the product mix shifts,\" Kim said.</li>\n<li>Non-GAAP EPS guidance for 2026 is projected at a loss of $1.45 per share, and ending 2026 with approximately $685 million in cash, assuming receipt of delayed tax refunds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fourth quarter revenue was $83.3 million, compared to $84.1 million in Q3 2025. Gross margin for Q4 on a non-GAAP basis was 41%. GAAP loss for the quarter was $23.4 million, compared to $6.6 million in Q3.

Paul Kim confirmed, \"The revenue from our largest customer was $70.8 million in 2025.

Perthuis cited the Beacon test, expansion of whole genome sequencing, and the Lumera somatic assay as key drivers.</li>\n<li>David Westenberg, Piper Sandler: Asked about gross margin headwinds from the customer loss. Kim noted, \"We posted gross margins of approximately 41% in Q4 of 2025.

Hsieh stated, \"We are feeling pretty strong at the present time, given the technology and the R&amp;D effort we have.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, the tone shifted from optimistic growth and margin expansion to one of cautious confidence, with more focus on mitigating customer loss and integrating acquisitions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance shifted from positive momentum and upward revisions in Q3 to a more measured forecast for 2026, reflecting the impact of the largest customer moving in-house.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus broadened to include acquisition integration and customer diversification. The tone in Q4 was more defensive, with management repeatedly addressing customer concentration and cost management, compared to the more upbeat Q3 discussion of organic growth and new product launches.</li>\n<li>Key financial metrics saw increased losses, higher operating expenses, and a slight year-over-year revenue increase, but a sequential decline in revenue and margins.</li>\n<li>Analysts in Q4 pressed more on risks, cash management, and the integration path for new acquisitions, while Q3 questions centered on margin expansion and product pipeline.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management identified the transition of the largest customer in-housing significant volume as a core risk for 2026 and expects a sharp decline in related revenue through Q2.</li>\n<li>Mitigation strategies include offsetting lost revenue with new acquisitions, expanding the product suite, and customer pipeline growth in Precision Diagnostics.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about margin headwinds, cash burn, and the risk of further in-housing or customer concentration.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Fulgent Genetics concluded the quarter underscoring confidence in its technology platform, product innovation, and acquisition-driven expansion, while candidly acknowledging the near-term impact from its largest customer’s transition to in-house testing. Management anticipates the combination of organic growth drivers, a diversified customer base, and the integration of Bako and StrataDx will support revenue growth and improve operating leverage in the longer term, despite temporary margin pressure and increased operating expenses in the first half of 2026.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/flgt/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
