The burger also features the tangy Big Arch sauce, which has a balance of mustard, pickle, and sweet tomato flavors.

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Throughout his <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558958-berkshire-hathaways-abel-commits-to-uphold-unique-culture-buffett-munger-built\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"first annual letter\">first annual letter</a> to shareholders, Berkshire Hathaway (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.B\" title=\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\">BRK.B</a></span>) (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.A\" title=\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\">BRK.A</a></span>) CEO Greg Abel reinforced the company's long-standing culture of making investment decisions wisely. Examples include reining back growth in insurance underwriting to maintain profit margins and refraining from expanding its utilities business to meet AI demand if it's not going to provide the appropriate payoff to shareholders. He also highlighted the need to improve operating margins at its BNSF rail operations. Here are the main takeaways in Abel's discussion of the company's businesses.</p>\n<h2>Insurance</h2>\n<p>Geico: The company's rate increases from late 2022 through 2024 have restored margins but have led to lower retention, Abel pointed out. \"Restoring retention while maintaining underwriting discipline will take time,\" he said. The division is also investing in technology to improve efficiency and service while keeping its position as the industry's low-cost provider, he added.</p>\n<p>Other primary property &amp; casualty business: Additional capital entering the market has led to lower pricing or decelerating rate increases in some important lines. \"We have always prioritized underwriting discipline over volume, and as pricing became less attractive, our premium growth plateaued,\" Abel said. Those headwinds are expected to continue in 2026 \"and potentially beyond.\"</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.B\" title=\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\">BRK.B</a>) reinsurance operations are expected to write less reinsurance premium, primarily due to similar headwinds as the primary P&amp;C business. Increased capital flowing into the market, along with a more benign reinsured catastrophe loss burden in 2025, has led to significant price declines in property reinsurance, he said. </p>\n<p>The company's insurance business will remain patient because of Berkshire's structural strengths, he added. The company's insurance float — the capital it holds to pay future losses and is invested for Berkshire's benefit — was at $176B at the end of 2025, up from $171B at the end of 2024.</p>\n<h3>Other operating businesses</h3>\n<p>BNSF: The rail division is focusing on improving its operating margin. In 2025, it widened to 34.5% from 32.0% in 2024 and is modestly above its five-year average. Each one percentage point improvement in operating margin equals ~$230M of incremental operating cash flow to its owners. \"More progress is needed to translate operational improvements into stronger financial results,\" Abel said in the letter. \"The team recognizes the significance of this opportunity, and we will be disappointed if we do not deliver a substantial improvement over the next few years.\"</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway Energy ((BHE)): The company prides itself on offering value to customers in the markets it serves, averaging 24% below the national retail electric rate level. Abel points out that infrastructure built for hyperscalers and data centers, alluding to burgeoning energy demand for AI, must be paid for by customers and reflects risk to step-changes in long-term demand. But, like Berkshire's other businesses, BHE won't focus on growth for growth's sake alone. \"BHE will pursue this incremental growth and invest our shareholders’ capital only when those risks and rewards are appropriately balanced,\" Abel wrote.</p>\n<p>He also said BHE is working on programs to mitigate wildfire risk and is taking responsibility when warranted. \"When a BHE utility is responsible for a wildfire, it has acknowledged that responsibility, including PacifiCorp’s settlements related primarily to the 2020 Labor Day fires,\" he said. At the same time, it won't allow the company to be used as “deep pockets” to pay for damage that it didn't cause. \"Where responsibility does not exist, it ((BHE)) will continue to seek judicial relief,\" Abel said.</p>\n<h3><strong>Equity portfolio</strong></h3>\n<p>Some 65% of Berkshire's equity portfolio is in five companies —  Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), American Express (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXP\" title=\"American Express Company\">AXP</a>), Coca-Cola (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO\" title=\"The Coca-Cola Company\">KO</a>),  Bank of America (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAC\" title=\"Bank of America Corporation\">BAC</a>), and Chevron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX\" title=\"Chevron Corporation\">CVX</a>) — down from 71% in 2024. \"This concentrated approach will continue, with limited activity in these holdings, though we may significantly adjust a holding if we see fundamental changes in its long-term economic prospects,\" Abel wrote. Its criteria for its investments in Japan are comparable to its major U.S. holdings \"in importance and long-term value creation opportunity.\" </p>\n<p>Together, those positions at year-end totaled $194B in market value, or almost two-thirds of its $297.8B equity securities portfolio, providing combined dividends of $2.5B and yielding 10% on their original cost basis of $24.5B, Abel pointed out.</p>\n<p>Abel also called out Berkshire's investment in Kraft Heinz (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KHC\" title=\"The Kraft Heinz Company\">KHC</a>) as disappointing. \"Even after considering the preferred equity component in our original Heinz investment, our return has been well short of adequate,\" he <a href=\"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2025ltr.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"wrote\">wrote</a>.</p>\n<p>Responsibility for the equity portfolio's performance ultimately lies with Abel. But he noted that Ted Wechsler manages ~6% of Berkshire's investments, including a portion of the portfolio formerly managed by Todd Combs. \"Ted’s impact extends beyond these investments, as he continues to play a broader role in assessing significant opportunities, providing valuable input on our businesses, and supporting Berkshire in various other ways,\" Abel wrote.</p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

Wall Street had a slew of upgrades and downgrades from analysts. Here are some of the major calls for the week:</p>\n<p><strong>Wells Fargo gives bullish rating to Alphabet </strong></p>\n<p>Wells Fargo upgraded tech giant Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) to Overweight from Equal weight, citing its industry-leading capacity position to support internal efforts and monetization capabilities.</p>\n<p>The brokerage believes the company has all the pieces necessary, namely customer data, distribution, and compute capacity, to be an AI winner.</p>\n<p>GOOGL's PT was raised to $387 from $354 and said it expects Google's Gemini consumer subscription revenue business to exit 2027 at $12B ARR from $4B exiting 2025.</p>\n<p><strong>BNP downgrades Comcast, Cable One on fiber headwinds</strong></p>\n<p>BNP Paribas <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4555843-bnp-cuts-rating-on-cable-stocks-comcast-and-cable-one-on-fiber-headwinds\">downgraded</a> cable TV names Comcast (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMCSA\" title=\"Comcast Corporation\">CMCSA</a></span></span>) and Cable One (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CABO\" title=\"Cable One, Inc.\">CABO</a></span></span>) to Underperform from Neutral, as fiber expansion erodes the sector's market share.</p>\n<p>The research firm said U.S. cable stocks collapsed due to expanding fiber and fixed wireless footprints, which \"sapped the robust subscriber and ARPU growth that fueled their earlier outperformance.\"</p>\n<p>CMCSA's price target was cut by $1 to $27. The research firm said Comcast is most exposed to fiber headwinds, and they view broadband revenue estimates as “too optimistic” for the second half of 2026. Similarly, CABO's PT was slashed by $45 to $80.</p>\n<p><strong>IBM upgraded on balanced risk/reward</strong></p>\n<p>UBS <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556860-ibm-gets-rating-upgrade-at-ubs\">upgraded</a> IBM (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM\" title=\"International Business Machines Corporation\">IBM</a></span></span>) to Neutral from Sell, noting that the risk/reward going forward is more balanced.</p>\n<p>\"While we expect pushback on our rating pivot given the risk from Al across the software landscape and market concern that translating legacy COBOL using Al will hurt IBM infra, the competitive risk to IBM's Z vertically integrated platform is largely reflected in the shares with the stock trading at a 7% FCF yield. Therefore, while we continue to expect flattish 'Infra’ growth, we do not expect mainframe disintermediation over the next several years given strong customer stickiness, customer data sovereignty and complex vertically integrated stack that provides quantum-safe encryption,\" UBS said.</p>\n<p>The firm has a $236 price target on the stock.</p>\n<p><strong>First Solar downgraded</strong> <strong>after weak outlook</strong></p>\n<p>Baird Research <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556874-first-solar-downgraded-at-baird-on-numerous-unknowns-companys-weak-outlook\">downgraded</a> First Solar (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FSLR\" title=\"First Solar, Inc.\">FSLR</a></span></span>) to Neutral from Outperform with a $205 price target, cut from $264, citing \"several question marks in forward outlook\" as management's post-earnings comments left the firm \"incrementally negative even vs. our lowered expectations into the print.\"</p>\n<p>First Solar (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FSLR\" title=\"First Solar, Inc.\">FSLR</a>) continues to have a strong backlog position but remains hesitant with booking new business given outstanding variables with Section 232, clarity on FEOC, and global tariffs, among others, Baird analyst Ben Kallo wrote.</p>\n<p>RBC Capital Markets has initiated coverage of <strong>AbbVie </strong>(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABBV\" title=\"AbbVie Inc.\">ABBV</a></span></span>) at Outperform saying the company has underperformed based on unfounded concerns and will benefit from growing Skyrizi and Rinvoq sales.
