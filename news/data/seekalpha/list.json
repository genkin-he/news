Clyde stated, \"The Board took this opportunity to authorize a new $2 billion share repurchase program as we were about 80% through the existing $1.5 billion program.\"</li>\n<li>The company reaffirmed its commitment to new-to-industry store growth and reinvestments within the existing network, projecting over 45 new store openings in 2025 and a pipeline supporting 50-plus stores in 2026. \"Complementing our 50-50 approach is the Board's commitment to new-to-industry store growth and reinvestments within the existing network,\" said Clyde.</li>\n<li>Mindy West reported, \"Third quarter EBITDA was $285 million, virtually flat to the prior year despite all-in margins running about $0.02 lower.\"</li>\n<li>West also noted, \"Total margin contribution dollars were up $24.4 million or 11.2% in quarter 3. There are 2 key drivers of these exceptional results. First, nicotine categories are up over 20%, driven by strong promotional activity and center of the store categories grew approximately 5%.\"</li>\n<li>Donald Smith, Interim CFO, stated, \"During this quarter, we brought 8 new stores into service, along with another 11 raze-and-rebuilds, bringing the year-to-date total as of September 30 to 22 and 20, respectively.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Murphy USA updated its full year fuel volume guidance to between 235,000 to 237,000 gallons per store per month, revised from the original 240,000 to 245,000 gallons range, reflecting year-to-date trends and expectations for the remainder of the year.</li>\n<li>Full year merchandise contribution guidance was tightened to the upper end of the range, now between $870 million and $875 million, driven by strong Q3 performance and Q4 momentum.</li>\n<li>The company lowered its projected monthly per store operating expense range to $36,200 to $36,600, down from the original $36,500 to $37,000 range.</li>\n<li>SG&amp;A guidance for 2025 has been reduced to $230 million to $240 million, exclusive of restructuring charges.</li>\n<li>The effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be between 23.5% and 24.5%.</li>\n<li>Dividend payout is expected to continue to grow 10% annually, with an additional 10% increase or $0.63 per share for the dividend payable on December 1.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Third quarter EBITDA was reported at $285 million, matching the prior year despite lower all-in fuel margins.</li>\n<li>Average per store month fuel volumes declined by 1.8% in the third quarter but all-in margins of $0.307, including retail margins of $0.283, remained strong.</li>\n<li>Merchandise margin contribution increased by $24.4 million, or 11.2%, with nicotine categories up over 20% and center-of-store categories growing by approximately 5%.</li>\n<li>QuickChek reported its fourth successive quarter of same-store food and beverage sales growth, with total food and beverage sales up 2.7% for the quarter.</li>\n<li>Per store operating expenses rose 2.8% in the quarter, with two-thirds of the increase attributable to new and larger stores.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Edward Kelly, Wells Fargo, asked about fuel margin cadence and volume elasticity. Mindy West responded, \"Our margins are more a function of the low -- and our volume are really more a function of just this low price environment where our customers are just not as price sensitive.\"</li>\n<li>Kelly also inquired about the ZYN nicotine promotion. West explained, \"This is really more about a strategic partner investing to drive share, utilizing our large and very loyal nicotine customer base.\"</li>\n<li>Bonnie Herzog, Goldman Sachs, questioned whether the raised merchandise contribution guidance was driven primarily by the ZYN promotion. West replied, \"It does definitely include ZYN... Nicotine pouch volumes were growing around 45% in promotion. In October, we have seen that jump to 120% of prior year volumes.\"</li>\n<li>Herzog also asked about balancing shareholder returns and growth. Clyde stated, \"When we say our 50-50 capital allocation, I mean, we mean 50-50... we're really confident at that level of balanced capital allocation that makes sense.\"</li>\n<li>Irene Nattel, RBC Capital Markets, probed the halo effect of nicotine promotions and capital allocation discipline. West indicated the effect on center-of-store was small, and Clyde emphasized, \"We can see ourselves doing that quicker as well.\"</li>\n<li>Pooran Sharma, Stephens Inc., asked about West's preparedness for the CEO role and cost-control opportunities. West shared her experience across financial, commercial, and operations roles and noted, \"We're going to continue to optimize our business... So we've now made us leaner, but I think now we're uncovering opportunities... to streamline the workflow.\"</li>\n<li>Robert Griffin, Raymond James, focused on future nicotine promotional opportunities. West stated, \"We own that customer. We know that customer better than anyone.\"</li>\n<li>Jacob Aiken-Phillips, Melius Research, asked about the October fuel run-up and capital allocation. West clarified the temporary nature of the margin spike, and Clyde confirmed plans for further CapEx guidance in February.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts expressed positive sentiment regarding the leadership transition and capital returns, but were probing on the sustainability of fuel margins and the impact of promotional events, showing slight caution.</li>\n<li>Management’s tone was confident and forward-looking during prepared remarks, emphasizing resilience and continuity, while in Q&amp;A, West and Clyde provided detailed, candid responses, occasionally acknowledging uncertainty in the competitive and pricing environment.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, the tone was more positive regarding merchandise performance and capital allocation, while analysts maintained a constructive but probing stance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The current quarter featured the CEO succession announcement and a new $2 billion share repurchase program, compared to no such major leadership or capital return news in the previous quarter.</li>\n<li>Guidance for fuel volumes was revised downward, while merchandise contribution guidance was tightened to the upper end, reflecting stronger performance in nicotine and center-store categories versus cautious outlooks previously.</li>\n<li>Analysts this quarter focused more on promotional activity impacts, cost control, and capital allocation strategy, while last quarter saw more discussion on demand trends and new store pipeline execution.</li>\n<li>Management’s confidence appeared higher regarding merchandise momentum and cost structure improvements, while analysts’ tone remained consistently inquisitive.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management acknowledged the low price, low volatility environment as a challenge for fuel margins and volumes, but underscored the company’s resilience and ability to capture upside when the market normalizes.</li>\n<li>Cost pressures are being addressed through ongoing restructuring, labor model changes, and efficiency initiatives across OpEx and SG&amp;A.</li>\n<li>The company is vigilant about maintaining leverage at or below 2.5x, with flexibility to lean into the balance sheet for opportunistic investments or shareholder returns.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about the sustainability of promotional-driven growth and the potential impact of competitive dynamics and macroeconomic trends on store performance and margins.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Murphy USA’s third quarter 2025 call underscored a leadership transition, a significant new $2 billion share repurchase authorization, and robust momentum in merchandise and promotional performance, particularly in nicotine categories.
