            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: SoundHound AI, Inc. (SOUN) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Keyvan Mohajer, Co-Founder, CEO, President &amp; Director, reported, “2025 was a record year for SoundHound, nearly doubling our revenue year-over-year. We also had a record fourth quarter. Revenue was up 59%, while all key profit metrics improved.” He highlighted that SoundHound signed over 100 customer deals in Q4, including major agreements with a Japanese automotive OEM for its AI assistant, a multiyear deal with a leading U.S. telecommunications company, and a global contract with a top athletic shoes and apparel brand. Mohajer emphasized SoundHound’s Agentic platform as “the only solution that is ready to be deployed across a multitude of vertical use cases and a huge and growing range of touch points,” allowing clients to build an agent once and deploy it anywhere.</li>\n<li>Notable wins in Q4 spanned automotive, restaurants, retail, health care, insurance, government, and education, including new partnerships and renewals across regions. Mohajer stated, “We are seeing great traction because our technology is delivering real-world results.” He cited specific customer outcomes such as a large health care network’s AI agent handling more than a third of all patient appointment scheduling and a telecommunications customer achieving a 20% reduction in labor costs for billing disputes.</li>\n<li>Nitesh Sharan, Chief Financial Officer, said, “Q4 was our strongest quarter with $55.1 million in revenue, up 59% and improvements across all profit measures. For the full year, we delivered $169 million in revenue, up 99% versus the prior year.” He noted, “Our monthly active users continue to expand rapidly with Q4 growth in excess of 50% year-on-year. More notably, their query activity or usage continues to accelerate with Q4 audio queries up roughly 75% from the prior year.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sharan shared, “For 2026, we expect our revenue to be in a range of $225 million to $260 million. As in prior years, there will be a ramp in revenue through the year given the nature of our customer base, underlying seasonality, and expected large deal timing, both for renewals and new deals.” He reiterated the company’s commitment to profitable growth and noted, “We remain committed to delivering accelerated growth while being mindful of the journey to profitability.”</li>\n<li>Sharan also stated, “Our long-term expectation is that we can operate this business at scale with 70% plus gross margins and 30% plus EBIT margins.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Q4 revenue was $55.1 million, up 59% year-over-year, with enterprise AI, restaurants, and automotive verticals highlighted as growth drivers. For the full year, revenue reached $169 million, nearly doubling from the prior year.</li>\n<li>Sharan reported, “Our GAAP gross margin was 48% and adjusted for noncash amortization of purchase intangibles and employee stock compensation, our non-GAAP gross margin was 61%.” Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $7.4 million, an improvement of 56% year-over-year. GAAP net income was $40.1 million and GAAP net earnings per share of $0.10, positively impacted by a change in fair value of contingent liabilities. Non-GAAP net loss was $7.3 million and non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.02.</li>\n<li>The balance sheet showed cash and equivalents at quarter end of $248 million with no debt.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Scott Buck, H.C. Wainwright &amp; Co.: Asked about deployment and customer service capacity constraints. Mohajer answered, “We are definitely doing a lot… advances in AI… allow us to deploy faster, go live faster, develop faster. And we are able to keep up with the demand with fewer people and less resources. So demand is going up and what we need to do… is actually going down.”</li>\n<li>Buck followed up on renewals and upselling. Mohajer said, “These renewals are actually an upsell moment because we bring them the Agentic solution… it's basically the renewal with a price increase and sometimes with a bigger volume commitment.”</li>\n<li>Brian Schwartz, Oppenheimer: Inquired about the durability of enterprise AI with LLM competition. Mohajer responded that automation is disrupting traditional software and services but is a tailwind for SoundHound, enabling faster and higher quality delivery. Schwartz asked about investment profile; Sharan said, “We are now shifting from… heavy investment… to this era of breakeven… every incremental dollar point, that should go into fueling growth, but we need to be mindful that we're going to do it efficiently.”</li>\n<li>Vijay Devar (for Mike Latimore, Northland): Queried about Amelia customers on Agentic AI version 7.3 and revenue impact. Sharan said, “We assume that we kind of are on a pathway to get the majority -- vast majority, I think, over 75% migrated over by the middle of this year.” Mohajer added, “Just a pure higher containment rate is expected to increase our revenue. Many of our deals, we get paid when we successfully avoid a caller to go to a human.”</li>\n<li>James Fish, Piper Sandler: Asked how Amelia wins new CX customers over competitors. Mohajer highlighted SoundHound’s deep technology, data, and multi-industry partnerships, stating, “By choosing SoundHound, they are more guaranteed to get the best as soon as it becomes available, no matter where it comes from.” Fish also asked about M&amp;A in guidance and stock-based comp; Sharan replied, “No, our guidance does not contemplate M&amp;A that we haven't done… Our outlook reflects the base of business, the pipeline of deals… we will… update an outlook, we will certainly do that like we have in the past.” On stock comp, Sharan said equity is broadly distributed, and dilution is a consideration, but expects normalization as the company scales.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts focused on deployment capacity, durability against LLM competition, upsell dynamics, customer migration, pricing, and M&amp;A strategy. Their tone was inquisitive and occasionally skeptical, especially around competitive threats and cost structure.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and assertive stance, often emphasizing efficiency, technological leadership, and market traction. During Q&amp;A, responses remained detailed and direct, with statements like, “We are able to keep up with the demand with fewer people and less resources.”</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both management and analysts’ tone is slightly more confident, with management highlighting record performance and an improved path to profitability while analysts probed for risks but acknowledged strong results.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance for 2026 revenue increased to $225 million–$260 million, compared to the previous year’s range and a strong Q4 performance. The company reiterated the transition to a breakeven phase, highlighting operational efficiencies and cost discipline.</li>\n<li>Management’s tone is more optimistic, citing record customer wins and diversified revenue sources. Analysts’ focus shifted from concerns about automotive softness and integration of acquisitions to exploring expansion capacity and competitive differentiation.</li>\n<li>Gross margin and profitability metrics improved sequentially. The company reported stronger customer diversification and no single customer contributing more than 10% of revenue.</li>\n<li>Strategic priorities remain on Agentic AI, voice commerce, and continued expansion across industries and regions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management acknowledged resource allocation across expanding verticals but cited AI advances as a mitigating factor for scaling efficiently.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised questions about capacity, pricing, competitive threats from large LLM providers, and stock-based compensation dilution.</li>\n<li>Mohajer and Sharan described mitigation strategies, including upselling existing customers, leveraging proprietary technology, focusing on outcome-based pricing, and maintaining a disciplined approach to M&amp;A.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>SoundHound closed 2025 with record revenue growth and a strong pipeline, driven by broad adoption of its Agentic AI platform and deeper expansion into key verticals. The company projects 2026 revenue between $225 million and $260 million and expects operational efficiencies and customer migration to advanced AI solutions to further fuel growth. Management underscored its commitment to profitability, innovation, and delivering outcome-based value to customers, positioning SoundHound for continued momentum in the evolving AI landscape.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/soun/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

He shared, \"Revenue was $35.2 million\" for Q4, with average paid members at 650,000 and total interchange of $5.5 million. Schaffer also pointed out, \"Our Q4 operating cash flow was $2.2 million. Our Q4 free cash flow was $3.2 million and net loss was $7.1 million. Our Q4 non-GAAP net loss was $2.1 million and adjusted EBITDA was $3.3 million.\"</li>\n<li>Schaffer stated, \"We are initiating fiscal year 2026 free cash flow guidance of $6 million to $9 million. That's lower than previous years due to a conservative outlook on 2026, combined with the fact that we are expecting to increase investment in sales and marketing as well as AI this year.\"</li>\n<li>Expensify entered a multiyear integration partnership with Uber for Business to automate travel and meal receipts, and was recognized with the TrustRadius 2026 Buyers' Choice Award in the expense management category.</li>\n<li>CEO David Barrett announced, \"New Expensify now has full feature parity with Classic for customers representing 90% of our revenue. That's the target we've been working towards, and we've hit it.\" Barrett added, \"We've now rolled it out to 63% of Classic customers.\"</li>\n<li>Barrett emphasized, \"Expensify connects to over 10,000 global banks and over 80% of those card imports happen via direct bank connections at 0 marginal cost to us.\" He also detailed the launch of a new free submit plan to drive grassroots adoption and explained, \"Our chat-first design makes us AI first by definition, and Concierge is the accountable AI that knows what you're talking about, can fix itself and wrong and works while you sleep.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Schaffer communicated, \"We are initiating fiscal year 2026 free cash flow guidance of $6 million to $9 million. That's lower than previous years due to a conservative outlook on 2026, combined with the fact that we are expecting to increase investment in sales and marketing as well as AI this year.\"</li>\n<li>Expensify expects continued focus on migration of its approved accounting network and ongoing investment in AI and performance improvements. January paid members were reported at 626,000, with management citing seasonality and expectations for future growth in member counts as the year progresses.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Q4 revenue was $35.2 million, with average paid members at 650,000 and total interchange at $5.5 million.

And then what are the primary moats that you see for the business?\" CEO David Barrett: \"Collaboration is one of the key differentiations... Expensify is a tool for collaborating with other AIs as well. ...AI can only really automate what you can personally do... But AI can't like just issue a virtual card. Like you don't have that ability. ...AI doesn't make you PCI compliant. ...I think we've made a point starting years ago, recognizing there's this huge AI disruption on the way. And we invested for 5 years to build a platform that we think isn't merely designed to kind of survive this AI title wave, but really ride it and thrive in it.\"</li>\n<li>Kimson: \"This was the first quarter that paid members have increased since 4Q '24... what do you attribute that small increase in paid members to -- in 4Q '25?\" CFO Schaffer: \"Q4 is generally pretty strong in the same way that January is usually not. ...it's expected because we typically see seasonality. However, I think migration obviously helps us retain customers. ...we think that it's going to help user growth in general.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analyst questions focused on long-term differentiation and competitive moats in an AI-driven software landscape, as well as drivers behind member growth, with a slightly skeptical tone regarding the company's ability to defend its position and maintain growth.</li>\n<li>Management remained confident and optimistic, with Barrett stating, \"I think we've made a point starting years ago, recognizing there's this huge AI disruption on the way.

Q4 free cash flow rose to $3.2 million from $1.2 million in Q3.</li>\n<li>The company completed the migration to feature parity between New Expensify and Classic for 90% of revenue, compared to targeting this milestone in Q3.</li>\n<li>Guidance shifted from a fiscal year 2025 free cash flow range of $19 million to $23 million in Q3 to a lower 2026 guidance of $6 million to $9 million, reflecting increased investment plans.</li>\n<li>Management’s confidence on AI-first strategy and migration progress remained strong, with a notable increase in emphasis on AI-driven product features and cross-selling momentum.

He emphasized that the agency wants the company to agree to allow its models to be used for “all lawful purposes.”</p>\n<p>“This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk,” Parnell wrote in<span> </span><a href=\"https://x.com/SeanParnellASW/status/2027072228777734474?s=20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a post<span> </span></a>on X on Thursday. “We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”</p>\n<p data-end=\"213\" data-start=\"0\"><span>Anthropic (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANTHRO\" title=\"Anthropic\">ANTHRO</a>)</span> signed a $200 million contract with the <span>United States Department of Defense</span> in July, becoming the first lab to deploy its models in mission workflows on classified networks. Rivals <span>OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>)</span>, <span>Google</span> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>), and <span>xAI</span> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/X.AI\" title=\"xAI\">X.AI</a>) also received DoD awards worth up to $200 million last year.</p>\n<div><div data-module=\"mps-slot\" id=\"MidResponsive-1\"></div></div>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: MARA Holdings, Inc. (MARA) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Frederick Thiel, CEO &amp; Executive Chairman, announced a strategic partnership with Starwood Digital Ventures, describing it as a joint venture that \"accelerates MARA's expansion into AI and high-performance compute and represents a meaningful step forward in the evolution of our platform from a pure-play Bitcoin miner into an energy and digital infrastructure company.\" He detailed that the platform is expected to deliver more than 1 gigawatt of near-term IT capacity with a pathway to over 2.5 gigawatts, allowing MARA to retain up to 50% ownership in the JV and participate in future cash flows.</p></li>\n<li><p>Thiel further highlighted the acquisition of a 64% stake in Exaion, which expands MARA’s enterprise-grade AI and HPC capabilities: \"Through Exaion, we can deliver Infrastructure-as-a-Service and edge inference solutions for large energy and industrial customers, particularly in environments where requirements around data locality, latency and operational control shape how compute is deployed.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>The CEO noted expansion in Nebraska with the acquisition of a 42-megawatt data center, and an increase in NGON gas-to-power operations, stating \"we doubled our NGON gas-to-power operations from 25 megawatts to 50 megawatts converting previously flared gas into some of our lowest cost mining power.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Salman Khan, CFO, emphasized the joint venture’s financial impact: \"From a financial perspective, we expect this joint venture to generate meaningful net operating income, or NOI, and free cash flow over time by reducing earnings volatility relative to a pure Bitcoin mining model.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Management expects to continue \"taking an opportunistic approach using Bitcoin to enhance financial flexibility where appropriate\" and plans to \"continue to monetize Bitcoins opportunistically to enhance our financial flexibility, including to provide liquidity or to fund capital projects and other initiatives that we believe enhance long-term shareholder value.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>The company will prioritize capital allocation toward \"the highest-value near-term opportunities\" and indicated that the MPLX West Texas data campus project is now viewed as a longer-term initiative.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Revenues in Q4 were $202.3 million compared to $214.4 million in Q4 2024. Full year 2025 revenues grew 38% to $907.1 million from $656.4 million in 2024.</p></li>\n<li><p>MARA reported a net loss of $1.7 billion or (-$4.52) per diluted share for the quarter, versus net income of $528.3 million or $1.24 per diluted share in Q4 2024. CFO Salman Khan explained, \"of this net loss for the fourth quarter 2025, but due to the decline in the price of Bitcoin, we booked a $1.5 billion loss, which was due to a change in fair value of digital assets, including Bitcoin receivable.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Bitcoin holdings increased by over 20%, from approximately 44,000 to nearly 54,000. Energized hashrate grew 25%, from 53.2 exahash to 66.4 exahash year-over-year. The company mined 2,011 Bitcoin and purchased an additional 1,670 during the quarter.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Paul Golding, Macquarie Research: Asked about financing dynamics of the JV and technical requirements for load balancing between mining and HPC. Frederick Thiel detailed that “our initial contribution to the JV to each specific -- for each specific site would be the asset itself...we would provide capital for our share of the development costs, where we could retain up to 50% of the JV.” Regarding load balancing, Thiel explained the technology enables switching between mining and HPC: \"We've announced previously a partnership with TAE Batteries, which is a very advanced battery technology that can switch at sub-millisecond rates such that we are able to essentially balance load within data centers.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Reginald Smith, JPMorgan: Inquired about accelerated timelines and market focus. Thiel responded, \"permits have been submitted already for some sites. And we are actively engaged with tenants...having a partner who has relationships with the tenants and that the tenants already trust...dramatically reduces...the courtship period.\" On prioritization, Thiel clarified, \"we are still pursuing sites both domestically and internationally\" but emphasized immediate focus on power available today.</p></li>\n<li><p>Gregory Lewis, BTIG: Asked about geographic interest and Starwood’s potential for expansion. Thiel noted, \"our focus is to initially monetize the sites that we have because the power is already on...if you look at other locations across the country, it's a question of really triangulating high-speed Internet, always-on power and access to water.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Christopher Brendler, Rosenblatt: Sought detail on site size and economics. Thiel replied, \"you could look at a site, for example, like 1 we have in Texas, which currently operates over 200 megawatts of capacity, and that site can be converted directly to a hyperscaler site.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Kevin Dede, H.C. Wainwright: Asked about project timelines and Exaion’s capabilities. Thiel stated, \"You don't turn a spade until you have a tenant typically signed because that tenant has a specific use for the site...we have had very fairly advanced conversations with tenants, permits have already been applied for at sites.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Analysts focused on the pivot toward AI, the Starwood JV, and the monetization of existing sites, often expressing cautious optimism and seeking clarity on timelines, economics, and strategic priorities. The tone was inquisitive, with some skepticism on execution details.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management’s tone in prepared remarks was confident and forward-looking, using phrases like \"we are already well down the path\" and \"we believe this strategy positions MARA to deliver durable, compounding shareholder returns.\" During Q&amp;A, management remained detailed and explanatory, directly addressing technical and strategic questions while avoiding specifics on future financial projections, indicating a focus on execution certainty.</p></li>\n<li><p>Compared to the previous quarter, the management tone is more assertive about operational transformation and partnership value, while analysts remain focused on execution risks and the pace of transition.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The current quarter marks a formal transition from pursuing modular, self-built data centers (as emphasized in Q3) to leveraging a JV model with Starwood for institutional-grade development and tenant relationships.</p></li>\n<li><p>Guidance language has shifted from broad platform flexibility to a more targeted approach—prioritizing near-term, power-rich sites and deferring longer-term projects such as MPLX.</p></li>\n<li><p>Key metrics highlight a significant year-over-year decline in net income, offset by a sharp increase in Bitcoin holdings and energized hashrate.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management’s confidence in the new JV and international expansion is higher, with more explicit partnership announcements and operational details compared to last quarter’s focus on pipeline and modular strategy.</p></li>\n<li><p>Analyst questions in the current quarter are more focused on the mechanics and economics of the JV, accelerated execution, and monetization of assets, while last quarter included more questions on modular AI deployment, the Exaion acquisition, and international strategy.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Management cited Bitcoin price volatility as a significant headwind, with a $1.5 billion loss in digital asset fair value impacting the quarter.</p></li>\n<li><p>The company faces sizable debt maturities in 2027, with CFO Salman Khan stating, \"$925 million notes due 2031 and $1 billion notes due 2030 have a put right exercisable on June 4, 2027, and December 1, 2027, respectively.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Non-cash goodwill impairment of $82.8 million was recorded, with no impact on liquidity or cash flow.</p></li>\n<li><p>Analyst concerns centered on the timeline for securing tenants, clarity on JV economics, and execution risks linked to the pivot from Bitcoin mining to digital infrastructure.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>MARA management emphasized that the company is evolving into an energy-dominant digital infrastructure platform, with the Starwood joint venture accelerating access to institutional-grade AI and HPC tenants and Exaion strengthening enterprise and sovereign cloud capabilities. The strategy aims to maximize long-term value from every megawatt controlled, leveraging flexibility to allocate power between Bitcoin mining and high-value compute workloads as market conditions dictate, with a continued focus on disciplined capital allocation and shareholder returns.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/mara/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Flutter Entertainment plc (PDYPY) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Jeremy Jackson reported strong fourth quarter results, stating, \"2025 was another transformative year for the company, marked by our strategic execution, continued market leadership and disciplined investment, delivering group revenue up 17% and adjusted EBITDA 21% higher.\" Flutter maintained leadership in U.S. online sports betting and iGaming, launching FanDuel Predicts in Q4 to enter the prediction market opportunity. Strategic acquisitions in Brazil and Italy expanded the international portfolio, complemented by transformation and efficiency programs, with Jackson emphasizing, \"We entered 2026 in a strong position, and I've never had more conviction in our ability to capitalize on the long growth runway ahead.\"</li>\n<li>Jackson outlined that U.S. Q4 revenue grew 33% with adjusted EBITDA up 90%, highlighting a \"superb iGaming quarter,\" but noted Q4 sportsbook market trends diverged from expectations, with high gross revenue margins offset by moderating handle performance and increased customer churn. He addressed regulatory changes in India and higher U.K. taxes, stating the company responded swiftly to both.</li>\n<li>The CEO described comprehensive reviews of market trends, noting, \"Missouri launch... customer acquisition trends exceeded expectations, reaching 5% of the population within the first 30 days, making Missouri one of our best state launches to date.\"</li>\n<li>Jackson announced enhancements to FanDuel’s core sportsbook product and the rollout of a new loyalty program, aiming for \"sequential improvement in our performance throughout 2026 and deliver market share gains.\"</li>\n<li>CFO Rob Coldrake stated, \"Group revenue increased by 25% and adjusted EBITDA grew 27%, driven by a good year-on-year performance across both segments and the successful integration of our recent acquisitions.\" He reported group net income of $10 million compared to $156 million in the prior year, attributing the decline to \"higher interest costs relating to the financing of our strategic M&amp;A and increased tax expense, reflecting the significant step-up in U.S. profitability year-over-year.\"</li>\n<li>Coldrake added, \"We completed $245 million in share repurchases during Q4, bringing full year 2025 repurchases to $1 billion, in line with our guidance.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Coldrake provided 2026 guidance: \"In the U.S., we expect revenue of $7.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $1.05 billion, translating to year-over-year growth of 12% and 14%, respectively. This includes new state investment of $70 million in adjusted EBITDA as we expect to launch Alberta in Q2.\"</li>\n<li>International revenue is expected at $10.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA at $2.23 billion for 2026. The company anticipates a $70 million investment in Brazil and continued impacts from U.K. tax increases and the cessation of real money gaming in India.</li>\n<li>Prediction markets investment for 2026 is now guided toward the upper end of the previously stated range, \"closer to $300 million to reflect the significant opportunity we believe exists to drive customer acquisition.\"</li>\n<li>Coldrake remarked, \"We expect our unallocated corporate costs to be $310 million; a $30 million increase compared with the prior year.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Group revenue increased by 25% and adjusted EBITDA by 27% for Q4. Group net income was $10 million, down from $156 million in the prior year, due to higher interest and tax expenses. Net cash from operating activities declined by $224 million to $428 million, attributed to increased expenses and a $128 million adverse impact from lower customer deposits. Free cash flow declined by $335 million to $138 million, reflecting M&amp;A and higher capital expenditure.</li>\n<li>U.S. revenue grew 33% with adjusted EBITDA up 90%, driven by iGaming revenue growth of 33%. FanDuel sportsbook Q4 revenue grew 35%. International revenue grew 19% and adjusted EBITDA increased 6%.</li>\n<li>The company completed $245 million in share repurchases in Q4, totaling $1 billion for the full year.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Jordan Bender, Citizens JMP Securities: Asked if the Q4 market growth slowdown could be structural and about new customer acquisition. Jackson responded that the high NFL margin led to a \"commensurate drop in handle,\" and confirmed continued AMP growth in core cohorts.</li>\n<li>Paul Ruddy, Davy: Asked about structural hold and strategy changes. Jackson indicated no change in strategy and attributed lower handle to \"very favorable weeks of above-average margin.\"</li>\n<li>Barry Jonas, Truist Securities: Inquired about the prediction product and U.S. state tax risks. Jackson described plans for FanDuel Predicts product improvements and Coldrake noted, \"As a scale operator, we're very well placed to mitigate those [tax increases] as we've proven in the past.\"</li>\n<li>Jeffrey Stantial, Stifel: Sought clarification on market share trends and corporate costs. Jackson cited Missouri's strong launch and outlined plans to reactivate customers, while Coldrake attributed higher corporate costs to business re-segmentation and announced a cost optimization program.</li>\n<li>Edward Young, Morgan Stanley: Queried the effectiveness of the generosity strategy and product advantage. Jackson acknowledged execution issues in Q4 generosity deployment and described plans for a new sportsbook loyalty program in Q2. Coldrake noted a narrowing product gap and outlined ongoing product innovation.</li>\n<li>Additional questions focused on prediction market investment rationale, loyalty program impact, capital allocation priorities, and regulatory developments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts frequently raised concerns about market growth rates recovery, handle trends, effectiveness of generosity strategies, competitive product dynamics, and prediction market investment returns. The tone was neutral to slightly negative, with probing on execution and strategic adjustments.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone in prepared remarks, with Jackson stating, \"I've never had more conviction in our ability to capitalize on the long growth runway ahead.\" During Q&amp;A, responses included acknowledgments of recent execution missteps but emphasized corrective actions, as when Jackson admitted, \"we did not deploy our generosity efficiently in Q4...we were not efficient and effective.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the prior quarter, analyst sentiment shifted from a focus on new market opportunities to a more cautious scrutiny of execution and market share, while management’s tone evolved from optimistic to a more nuanced, though still confident, acknowledgment of emerging challenges.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance language shifted to a more measured and detailed outlook for 2026, with explicit acknowledgment of slower handle growth and increased customer churn in Q4. Management outlined additional actions to reinforce U.S. leadership and planned product and generosity strategy improvements.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus in the current quarter emphasized operational efficiency, expanded prediction market investment, and loyalty program launches, versus last quarter’s focus on new product launches and early prediction market entry.</li>\n<li>Analysts’ questions pivoted from excitement about new markets and partnerships in Q3 to concerns about market share, product competitiveness, and execution discipline in Q4.</li>\n<li>Key metrics revealed higher revenue and EBITDA growth rates in Q4 versus Q3, but also noted increased expense pressures and lower net income.</li>\n<li>Management’s confidence in executing strategic transformation and international integration remained, but responses indicated sharper attention to operational challenges.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management highlighted continued moderation in market handle trends and customer engagement, citing \"adverse recycling\" and \"less compelling content\" in NFL as key drivers.</li>\n<li>Regulatory risks remain, including higher U.K. gaming taxes and the cessation of real money gaming in India; management emphasized agility in responding to such changes.</li>\n<li>Analysts expressed concern over competitive generosity levels, structural market shifts, and the impact of high gross revenue margins on customer engagement.</li>\n<li>Coldrake addressed potential U.S. state tax increases, stating, \"we are very well placed to mitigate those as we've proven in the past.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Flutter’s management emphasized strong financial performance and market leadership in 2025, while outlining a clear strategy for 2026 centered around product innovation, disciplined investment in prediction markets, and customer engagement enhancements such as a new sportsbook loyalty program. Despite near-term pressures on handle growth and customer churn, the company expects sequential improvement through operational and strategic adjustments, targeting $7.8 billion in U.S. revenue and $1.05 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the coming year. Management maintains confidence in Flutter’s ability to deliver sustained growth and market share gains through 2026 and beyond.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/pdypy/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
