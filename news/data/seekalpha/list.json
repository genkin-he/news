            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (PEB) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Jon Bortz, Chairman &amp; CEO, highlighted that \"we wrapped up 2025 with stronger-than-expected fourth quarter growth despite the demand disruption from the government shutdown.\" He emphasized a 2.9% increase in same-property total RevPAR and a 3.9% growth in same-property hotel EBITDA, exceeding the midpoint of the company’s outlook, with performance led by San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, and redeveloped resorts. Bortz indicated that strategic revenue management, prioritizing occupancy to drive incremental profits, would remain core in 2026.</li>\n<li>Raymond Martz, Co-President, CFO, Treasurer &amp; Secretary, stated, \"adjusted EBITDA climbed 11.1% to $69.7 million, about $6 million above the midpoint, supported by strong hotel results, lower corporate G&amp;A and slightly higher-than-expected business interruption income related to LaPlaya.\"</li>\n<li>Bortz further noted, \"the hotel demand growth engines are getting stronger and several of last year's headwinds are fading and should increasingly become tailwinds.\" He added that the company's completed multi-year strategic reinvestment program at resorts is yielding strong returns, citing Newport Harbor Island Resort's total RevPAR increase of 38.5% and EBITDA jump of $9.3 million to $17.7 million for the year. </li>\n<li>The company completed two strategic asset dispositions for over $116 million and repurchased approximately 6.3 million common shares at an average price of $11.37 per share. Martz emphasized, \"these repurchases represent an attractive discount to the underlying value of our portfolio and a high return use of capital that directly increases value per share.\"</li>\n<li>Pebblebrook refinanced near-term maturities with a new $450 million senior unsecured term loan due 2031, extending its debt profile and providing flexibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For the first quarter of 2026, Pebblebrook forecasts RevPAR growth between 7.5% and 9% and total RevPAR growth of 6% to 7.5%. For the full year, RevPAR growth is expected to range from 2% to 4% and total RevPAR between 2.25% and 4.25%.</li>\n<li>As of the end of January, combined group and transient pace for 2026 is ahead by $21 million over last year, with widespread growth except for Washington, D.C.</li>\n<li>The company expects same-property EBITDA to increase by 2.1% to 6% in 2026, with the midpoint at 4%.</li>\n<li>Management described its outlook as \"appropriately cautious given policy and geopolitical risks,\" but indicated confidence in the recovery trajectory and operating efficiencies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Same-property occupancy rose 190 basis points while ADR declined 1.6%, resulting in a 1.2% RevPAR increase. Non-room RevPAR climbed 5.5%, driving total RevPAR growth of 2.9%.</li>\n<li>For the full year, resort EBITDA increased 1.3%, with redeveloped resorts showing strong performance. LaPlaya Beach Resort and Club recorded $3.1 million in business interruption proceeds in Q4, with total proceeds for 2025 at $12.7 million.</li>\n<li>Pebblebrook invested $74.6 million in capital improvements in 2025 and expects $65 million to $75 million in 2026. Run-rate corporate cash G&amp;A is forecasted to decline modestly in 2026 following a 10% reduction in corporate staffing levels.</li>\n<li>Two hotels were sold in Q4 for over $116 million, with proceeds redeployed to debt reduction and share repurchases. The company reported $150 million of cash on hand and roughly $640 million of revolver capacity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bennett Rose, Citigroup: Asked about group side visibility and composition. Jon Bortz responded that most of the pace advantage is in transient segments, with group room nights down 0.6% for the year, ADR up 2.4%, and group revenue up 1.8%. Transient room nights are up 11.6%, ADR up 0.6%, and revenue up 12.2%.</li>\n<li>Richard Hightower, Barclays: Inquired about unlevered cash returns on resort redevelopment CapEx. Raymond Martz explained, \"for these projects, that's actually closer to an ROI -- a cash ROI in that 22% to 26% range... our strategic reinvestment program... we're averaging closer to that 16% to 17% annualized cash-on-cash ROI return.\"</li>\n<li>Cooper Clark, Wells Fargo: Questioned the more conservative implied Q2–Q4 RevPAR guidance. Bortz said, \"we're being very conservative where we don't have full visibility, knowing that there are disruptions that can pop up... implied RevPAR growth of 1% to 2% for our range.\"</li>\n<li>Aryeh Klein, BMO: Asked about the transaction market. Thomas Fisher noted, \"the market is becoming certainly more constructive... debt continues to improve... I think you'll continue to see us be engaged and be heavy participants in the market as well.\"</li>\n<li>Michael Bellisario, Baird: Asked about balancing performance with further asset sales and deleveraging. Bortz replied, \"our strategy continues to be a dual approach... we'll continue to sell assets... and use that capital to do 2 things. One is pay down debt... and two, to buy back our stock, both common and preferred, trading at material discounts.\"</li>\n<li>Chris Darling, Green Street: Asked about lower CapEx and deferred maintenance risk. Bortz said, \"we're not doing a trade-off in capital. We're not deferring capital... we continue to do what we've always done, which is protect the real estate, do all the infrastructure improvement and capital investing.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts displayed a neutral to slightly positive tone, focusing on visibility in group trends, ROI on redevelopment, guidance conservatism, and transaction market prospects, with questions often seeking clarity on cautious assumptions or strategic flexibility.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a positive and confident tone in prepared remarks, emphasizing strong trends, recovery, and capital discipline. In the Q&amp;A, management was measured and sometimes defensive, particularly regarding the rationale for conservative guidance and capital allocation, but consistently provided detailed explanations.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both management and analysts’ tone remains constructive, but there is increased emphasis on risk management and conservatism in forward guidance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The current quarter shows improved RevPAR and EBITDA growth, with San Francisco and resorts as key drivers, compared to the previous quarter’s challenges from government shutdowns and event disruptions.</li>\n<li>Management’s guidance language shifted from \"cautiously optimistic\" to \"appropriately cautious,\" explicitly citing policy and geopolitical risks as reasons for conservatism, despite strong early 2026 trends.</li>\n<li>Analysts’ questions in both quarters focused on group trends, redevelopment ROI, and asset sales, but current quarter exchanges delved further into guidance methodology and capital allocation priorities.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus continues on asset rotation, share buybacks, and efficiency, with greater clarity and confidence in the portfolio’s recovery trajectory.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited policy and geopolitical risks as significant uncertainties, justifying a conservative outlook for 2026.</li>\n<li>Group demand remains soft in government and government-impacted segments, with Bortz noting, \"we do continue to see the same softness when it comes to government and government-related government-impacted industries.\"</li>\n<li>Weather disruptions and macroeconomic shocks were acknowledged as ongoing risks, but management noted improved weather resiliency and insurance settlements at LaPlaya.</li>\n<li>Analyst concerns centered on the sustainability of cost controls, capital allocation discipline, and the risk of deferred maintenance from lower CapEx, which management addressed by emphasizing ongoing investment and asset quality.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Pebblebrook Hotel Trust signals a favorable operating setup for 2026, projecting RevPAR growth between 2% and 4% and maintaining a disciplined approach to cost controls and capital allocation. Management highlights strong recovery in key markets, robust performance at redeveloped resorts, and enhanced financial flexibility through asset sales and refinancing. While policy and geopolitical risks temper the outlook, the company is positioned for continued margin expansion and free cash flow growth, with ongoing investment in property quality and strategic share repurchases supporting long-term value creation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/peb/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
