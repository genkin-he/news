He announced acquisitions of Bako Diagnostics and StrataDx for $55.5 million, stating, \"This proposed acquisition will add new anatomic pathology services, proprietary PCR tests and a national client base.\"</li>\n<li>Perthuis highlighted regulatory approvals in New York for Nova and whole genome sequencing, and noted, \"As of today, we are approximately 100% digital across all of our cases, and they are being read on Eziopath.\"</li>\n<li>Paul Kim, Chief Financial Officer, stated, \"Full year revenue for 2025 totaled $322.7 million, growing approximately 14% compared to revenue of $283.5 million in 2024, which fell slightly short of the updated guidance we provided on last quarter's earnings call, but ahead of the original guidance we provided at the beginning of 2025.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Kim projected 2026 revenue of $350 million, representing 8.5% year-over-year growth, and noted, \"We would also expect total revenues to be approximately $350 million for 2026.\"</li>\n<li>He indicated the loss from the largest customer is expected to be partially or fully offset by $50–$55 million in revenue from Bako and StrataDx acquisitions. Anatomic pathology revenue is projected to reach $162 million, up 53% from 2025, while biopharma revenue is expected to decrease to $20 million. \"We expect non-GAAP gross margins for the full year to be slightly above 40% as the product mix shifts,\" Kim said.</li>\n<li>Non-GAAP EPS guidance for 2026 is projected at a loss of $1.45 per share, and ending 2026 with approximately $685 million in cash, assuming receipt of delayed tax refunds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fourth quarter revenue was $83.3 million, compared to $84.1 million in Q3 2025. Gross margin for Q4 on a non-GAAP basis was 41%. GAAP loss for the quarter was $23.4 million, compared to $6.6 million in Q3. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was a loss of approximately $4.5 million versus a gain of $700,000 in Q3. Non-GAAP income for the quarter was $5.2 million or $0.16 per share, and for the year, $13.2 million or $0.42 per share.</li>\n<li>Operating expenses rose to $68.8 million (GAAP) in Q4 from $50.9 million in Q3, with non-GAAP operating expenses at $43.1 million versus $40.7 million in the prior quarter. The company ended 2025 with $705.5 million in cash and equivalents, not yet including a $106 million tax refund delayed by a government shutdown.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Lu Li, UBS: Asked about the revenue loss from the largest customer and risk of further in-housing. Paul Kim confirmed, \"The revenue from our largest customer was $70.8 million in 2025. And when we lay out the plan for 2026, the $350 million, we assume that we're going to be getting about $11.8 million from this customer.\"</li>\n<li>Lu Li, UBS: Inquired about growth drivers for Precision Diagnostics. Perthuis cited the Beacon test, expansion of whole genome sequencing, and the Lumera somatic assay as key drivers.</li>\n<li>David Westenberg, Piper Sandler: Asked about gross margin headwinds from the customer loss. Kim noted, \"We posted gross margins of approximately 41% in Q4 of 2025. We anticipate that to go down by approximately 4 points in the first quarter, about 2 points in the second quarter, but having a rebound in the third and the fourth quarter.\"</li>\n<li>Westenberg also queried sales synergies from Bako acquisition; Perthuis responded, \"We will be able to use our existing team to sell Bako products and the Bako team to sell Fulgent products.\"</li>\n<li>Andrew Cooper, Raymond James: Asked about cash burn and digital pathology integration.

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Via Transportation, Inc. (VIA) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>CEO Daniel Ramot highlighted that \"Via delivered another exceptional quarter, exceeding expectations on both top and bottom line performance,\" with revenue growing 30% year-over-year to $119 million in Q4. He emphasized this as the eighth consecutive quarter with 30%+ year-over-year platform revenue growth and noted, \"Q4 was the strongest quarter in company history for net new platform revenue.\" Ramot cited product innovation, the addition of 94 new customers through the Downtowner acquisition, and a strategic focus on AI as key growth drivers. He stated, \"Our pipeline grew more than 50% year-over-year in 2025,\" and described the launch of AI Labs to extend Via's technology for broader municipal use.</p></li>\n<li><p>Ramot detailed customer wins, including Sarasota County, Florida, and a Missouri agency, each demonstrating significant cost savings and expanded transit reach using Via’s platform. He noted, \"For the past year, Via's net revenue retention was 119%. We also recorded the highest gross revenue retention in Via's history, 98%, beating the previous record set just a quarter earlier.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Ramot explained the rationale for acquiring Downtowner: \"We believe that many of Downtowner's customers have additional transit technology needs that are well served by Via's platform. The average ARR per Downtowner customer is significantly lower than Via's current ARR per customer, providing an exciting opportunity for growth within the Downtowner customer base.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>CFO Clara Fain stated, \"Q4 net new revenue was the strongest in the company's history, and we exceeded our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance, showcasing our commitment to consistent execution and durable growth.\" Fain highlighted U.S. platform revenue up 39% year-over-year and described 821 customers on the platform, with 94 customers generating over $1 million in annual run rate revenue.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul><li>Fain provided guidance for Q1 2026 revenue between $123.3 million and $123.8 million, representing 25% to 25.5% year-over-year growth, and for full year 2026 revenue between $542.9 million and $545.1 million. She stated, \"We expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be between negative 2.3% and negative 1.4% compared to negative 8% in 2025.\" Fain also announced, \"We expect to deliver our first quarter of profitability in Q4 2026 with positive adjusted EBITDA, which will be a major milestone for Via.\" Long-term margin goals were reiterated at 20% to 25% adjusted EBITDA margin.</li></ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Fain reported annual run rate revenue for Q4 2025 at $476 million, a 30% year-over-year increase. She noted, \"We wrapped up Q4 2025 with negative 6% adjusted EBITDA margin, our lowest loss on record compared to negative 10% in Q4 2024 and negative $0.5 million of operating cash flows.\" R&amp;D spending declined as a percentage of revenue despite foreign exchange headwinds.</p></li>\n<li><p>2025 platform revenue was $434 million, up 31% year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA improving by 8 points. Recurring fees accounted for 97% of revenue, and upfront or one-time revenue was less than 3% of the total.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>John DiFucci, Guggenheim Securities: Asked whether services-only contracts are an anomaly. Ramot responded, \"That specific contract that I believe you're referring to is an anomaly, and it's an outcome of a very specific set of circumstances. Generally, we don't see anything like that in the market across the U.S. or Europe or any of our other markets.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Adam Hotchkiss, Goldman Sachs: Inquired about the RFP pipeline and gross margin outlook. Ramot explained, \"The number of these opportunities today that we're able to go after versus a year ago, feels much larger because of the expansion of the solutions that we're able to provide.\" Fain added, \"The breakdown of the mix of customers buying services was also consistent with about 20% of our customers buying services as well as software.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Josh Baer, Morgan Stanley: Asked about Via’s go-to-market moat. Ramot emphasized, \"Access to that market is very challenging for a number of reasons... We've invested over a decade in doing that.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Patrick Walravens, Citizens JMP: Queried about internal AI use and headcount. Ramot said, \"In our market, we are just scratching the surface as far as the number of customers that we're able to get to. For us, any gain in productivity that we can achieve, I would like to turn into selling more stuff to more customers faster rather than trying to use that to cut the team in any dramatic way.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Brian Peterson, Raymond James: Asked about the Downtowner acquisition and future M&amp;A. Fain replied, \"The Downtowner acquisition was not about the revenue contribution. We acquired them to penetrate the Destination Cities market and add 94 customers.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Brad Zelnick, Deutsche Bank: Asked about regional network effects and international progress. Fain reported a \"flywheel effect\" in 19 U.S. states and strong U.S. growth, while Ramot described regulatory headwinds slowing broader platform adoption in Germany.</p></li>\n<li><p>Aleksandr Zukin, Wolfe Research: Queried about AI and AV impact on gross margin. Fain noted, \"There are some potential step function changes to gross margin from organic efforts around AI and autonomous vehicles.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Michael Turrin, Wells Fargo: Asked about growth visibility. Fain said, \"We have over 95% visibility in our revenue guidance for the next 12 months.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Jonathan Ho, William Blair: Explored AI Labs expansion. Ramot explained, \"We have a way in a scalable way, not just one-off things that we then can't scale to build solutions that extend beyond transit.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Scott Berg, Needham &amp; Company: Asked about gross retention. Fain noted, \"We've been executing at very high levels of gross revenue retention forever. So part of it is the mission criticality of the platform.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Analysts focused on the durability of growth, pipeline strength, margin progression, and the impact of new products and acquisitions. The tone was slightly positive, with multiple congratulations and targeted questions about growth visibility and strategic direction.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management maintained a confident and optimistic tone in prepared remarks and Q&amp;A. Phrases such as \"we couldn't be more bullish\" and \"we are confident\" signaled strong conviction. Management responses were direct, especially on questions about contract mix, margin levers, and market expansion.</p></li>\n<li><p>Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management displayed increased confidence, with management offering more detail on AI, M&amp;A, and product expansion strategies.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Guidance for 2026 targets 25%+ revenue growth and a first profitable quarter in Q4 2026, compared to previous guidance aiming for 30% growth and continued losses in 2025.</p></li>\n<li><p>Customer count increased sharply from 713 in Q3 to 821 in Q4, with the Downtowner acquisition adding 94 customers. Net revenue retention and gross revenue retention set new records.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management’s tone was more assertive on AI-driven product innovation and broader municipal market opportunities. Analysts shifted from questions about foundational growth to more nuanced inquiries about deal mix, AI monetization, and margin inflection.</p></li>\n<li><p>Strategic focus has expanded from core transit solutions to include broader AI-enabled municipal services via AI Labs.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Management acknowledged challenges in regulatory environments, especially in Europe, with Ramot stating, \"That next phase where adoption of our entire platform is becoming ubiquitous... is just proving to take longer than we would have liked.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Analysts questioned the pace of gross margin improvement and the consistency of customer contract types. Fain addressed margin levers and highlighted the potential for AVs and AI to drive future step changes.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management reiterated the importance of disciplined M&amp;A and noted \"dislocation in the market\" as an opportunity for selective acquisitions.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Via closed 2025 with record-setting growth, rapid customer expansion, and continued progress toward profitability, driven by AI-powered product innovation, strategic acquisitions like Downtowner, and a robust pipeline. The company’s 2026 outlook targets 25%+ revenue growth and the milestone of first positive adjusted EBITDA in Q4, reflecting confidence in continued market penetration and the transformative potential of its technology for public sector transit and beyond.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/via/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
