AI is increasingly shifting toward a model in which people set the objectives and guardrails, he said, and the system independently executes the task, reviews its own output and delivers a finished result.</p>\n<p><span>\"The bottom line for me is that AI is real, capable of doing a lot of work that heretofore has been done by knowledge workers, and growing extremely rapidly in terms of applications.
