Discovery (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBD\" title=\"Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.\">WBD</a></span>) and would consider divestments if necessary, <em>Reuters </em>reported on Friday, citing two sources.</p>\n<p>Sources told the news outlet that EU concerns regarding divestments will likely be minor.</p>\n<p>Paramount's offer faces fewer regulatory hurdles because a combined Paramount and Warner Bros. has a market share of below 20% in all markets across Europe, sources told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>\n<p>Earlier today, Warner Bros. signed the deal with Paramount, according to an audio clip of a global town hall by the company, which was reviewed by <em>Reuters</em>.</p>\n<p>\"Netflix (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX\" title=\"Netflix, Inc.\">NFLX</a></span>) had the legal right to match the PSKY offer. As you all know, they ultimately decided not to do that. That then resulted in a signed agreement with PSKY as of this morning. So that's where everything stands,\" Bruce Campbell, Warner Bros.' chief revenue and strategy officer, reportedly said during the town hall.</p>\n<p>However, the deal would require approval under the EU's foreign subsidies regulation because Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Abu Dhabi's L'imad Holding Company, and the Qatar Investment Authority are also bankrolling the bid, the report said. The FSR targets unfair foreign state aid.</p>\n<p>According to the report, the company may be willing to divest minor channels such as its children's brands if required. Overlapping businesses include the combination of two studios and several TV channels.</p>\n<p>Outside the U.S., David Ellison has been busy trying to convince regulators, notably in the UK, Germany, and France, while his recently appointed legal chief, Makan Delrahim, met the European Commission's top merger official, Guillaume Loriot.</p>\n<p>European Parliament lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who was against Netflix's bid and met Delrahim last month, said a Paramount bid poses fewer issues.</p>\n<p>\"I think Paramount is something we could accept. It is a concentration in the production of films. There is no risk of a digital champion taking over the video streaming market,\" Schwab said.</p>\n<p>PSKY shares are up nearly 24%, NFLX is up 13%, and WBD is down nearly 2% in late afternoon trading. </p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

This resulted in originations of $213.7 million, the highest amount of capital we have invested in a quarter.\" He attributed the surge to pent-up demand following Liberation Day and noted several deals spilled over from the third quarter. Ross emphasized disciplined underwriting, stating Fidus continues to invest in niche market leaders with recurring revenue and structured debt with significant loan-to-value cushions.</li>\n<li>The company's total portfolio reached $1.3 billion on a fair value basis. Adjusted NII for Q4 was $19.4 million, up 5.1%, and the company paid total dividends of $0.50 per share for the quarter. Net asset value grew to $741.9 million, or $19.55 per share.</li>\n<li>For Q1 2026, Ross announced, \"the Board of Directors declared a total dividend of $0.52 per share, which consists of a base dividend of $0.43 per share and a supplemental dividend of $0.09 per share.\"</li>\n<li>Shelby Sherard, CFO, stated, \"Total investment income was $42.2 million for the 3 months ended December 31, a $4.9 million increase from Q3, primarily driven by a $2 million increase in interest income as a result of increased average debt investments outstanding and which includes a $0.3 million of accelerated amortization of closing fees related to debt repayments, a $3.5 million increase in fee income given an increase in investment activity in Q4, which was partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in dividend income from equity investments.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ross stated, \"We expect activity levels will pick up during the year as some private equity owners are likely to need to bring certain portfolio companies to market. As we deploy capital, we intend to stay focused on our long-term goals of generating attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders and growing net-asset-value over time.\"</li>\n<li>He noted that deal flow in Q1 2026 is \"a little more modest in nature\" but expected activity to increase as the year progresses.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Net investment income (NII) for Q4 was $0.53 per share, while adjusted NII was $0.52 per share, both increased compared to Q3.</li>\n<li>Portfolio at fair value ended at $1.3 billion, with $658.3 million in debt outstanding. The weighted average interest rate on debt was 5.2% as of December 31.</li>\n<li>Weighted average effective yield on debt investments was 12.6% as of December 31, compared to 13% at the end of Q3. Nonaccruals accounted for less than 1% of the portfolio on a fair value basis.</li>\n<li>Liquidity at year-end included $79.6 million in cash, $141.2 million availability on the line of credit, and $84 million of available SBA debentures, totaling approximately $304.8 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Robert Dodd, Raymond James: Asked about deal flow spillover into Q1 and whether activity would be more modest after the Q4 ramp. Chairman Ross responded, “Q4 was a quarter where most things kind of came to fruition... I think now in Q1 '26, deal flow is a little more modest in nature. We believe it's somewhat due to seasonal patterns... our current expectations are for an increase in both deal flow and activity throughout the year.”</li>\n<li>Dodd also probed on software business risk, especially regarding AI. Ross explained, “We believe the recent headlines, although meaningful and serious, the market dislocation in software has been blown out of proportion from our perspective... we're looking for companies that have things like data moats... vertical markets, specialized industry software... contractual revenue streams... management is critical.”</li>\n<li>Mickey Schleien, Clear Street LLC: Inquired about ARR loans. Ross replied, \"about 22% of our software portfolio today or 7.5% of our total portfolio are ARR loans as we sit here today... when we structure an ARR loan, we force growth through covenants... and we also force a transition to cash flow.\"</li>\n<li>Schleien asked about the concentration in Pfanstiehl. Ross replied, \"we are extremely comfortable with that position. I think the long-term outlook for that business, they're a leader in their space... we feel good about it today.\"</li>\n<li>Schleien questioned the dividend outlook from Pfanstiehl; Ross noted dividends are \"episodic in nature, but also reoccurring annually in some way, shape or form.\"</li>\n<li>Schleien asked about floating rate debt floors; Ross stated, \"Most of our floors that we've been originating here over the last, let's say, 3, 4 years are in the 2% range.\"</li>\n<li>Christopher Nolan, Ladenburg Thalmann: Queried on M&amp;A drivers and software company deleveraging. Ross indicated pent-up demand from PE is the main M&amp;A driver, and \"we are seeing deleveraging, whether it's an ARR loan or it's EBITDA-based loan.\"</li>\n<li>Paul Johnson, KBW: Asked about recovery rates on first lien loans. Ross estimated historical recoveries in the 60%-85% range and emphasized the 37% loan-to-value provides a significant cushion.</li>\n<li>Dylan Haynes, B. Riley Securities: Asked about deployment trends in software/tech and pricing. Ross stated Fidus remains focused on best-in-class software names and expects unique opportunities from recent market dislocation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts maintained a generally positive tone but sought detailed risk disclosures, especially regarding sector exposures and portfolio concentration. Questions were probing yet constructive, with a focus on sustainability and risk management.</li>\n<li>Management's tone was confident and slightly more detailed when discussing portfolio quality and risk controls. Ross repeatedly emphasized comfort with concentrations and underwriting discipline, and used phrases like \"we feel good about it\" and \"we are extremely comfortable\" when discussing key positions and risk areas.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management exhibited increased attention to software/AI risks and portfolio concentrations, but management's confidence level remained steady and slightly upbeat.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Q4 saw a marked increase in deal originations ($213.7 million vs. $74.5 million in Q3), attributed to pent-up M&amp;A demand following market disruptions earlier in the year.</li>\n<li>Adjusted NII per share rose to $0.52 in Q4 from $0.50 in Q3. Net asset value increased to $741.9 million from $711 million. Dividend per share for Q1 2026 was declared at $0.52, higher than the $0.50 declared for Q4 in the previous call.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus shifted to more detailed software/tech sector disclosure and risk mitigation, with increased discussion of AI and ARR exposures.</li>\n<li>Analysts in Q4 pressed more on the specifics of portfolio risk, especially in the software sector, compared to Q3's broader focus on market activity and macro risks (e.g., tariffs, government shutdown).</li>\n<li>Management's sentiment remained consistently confident, with more emphasis on underwriting standards and sector strategy in Q4.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management highlighted ongoing attention to AI risks within the software and tech-enabled services portfolio, which totaled $464 million, with 92% first-lien debt and an average loan-to-value of 37%.</li>\n<li>Nonaccruals remained low, but management continues to monitor sector and company-specific risks, especially in concentrated positions like Pfanstiehl and in the face of interest rate changes.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about portfolio concentration, sustainability of dividend income from key holdings, floating rate exposure to declining SOFR, and the impact of M&amp;A market dynamics.</li>\n<li>Management's mitigation strategies include strict underwriting, structured covenants, portfolio diversification, and a focus on first-lien security.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Fidus Investment delivered a record quarter for deal originations, driven by a rebound in M&amp;A activity and pent-up demand. The company outlined a clear focus on underwriting discipline, robust credit quality, and risk-adjusted returns, with enhanced transparency on software and tech portfolio exposures, including AI-related risks. Management expects deal flow and investment activity to build through 2026, supported by strong liquidity and a disciplined approach to capital deployment, while maintaining confidence in portfolio quality and dividend sustainability.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/fdus/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. (TCPC) Q4 2025  </p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Philip Tseng, CEO, noted a challenging quarter, stating that \"Full year 2025 adjusted NII was $1.22 per share compared to $1.52 in 2024. Annualized NII ROE for the year was 12.3% compared to 14.5% in 2024.\" He attributed the decline in NII to \"portfolio markdowns and nonaccruals as well as lower base rates and tighter spreads year-over-year.\" Adjusted NII for the fourth quarter was $0.25 per share, down from $0.30 in the previous quarter and $0.36 in the same quarter last year.</li>\n<li>Tseng highlighted significant portfolio markdowns, with NAV dropping 19% to $7.07 per share as of December 31, 2025, from $8.71 at September 30. Six portfolio companies accounted for approximately 67% or $1.11 per share of the NAV decline, with Edmentum, Razor, SellerX, Renovo, Hylan, and InMobi named as key contributors.</li>\n<li>The CEO announced a first quarter dividend of $0.17 per share and detailed share repurchases during and after the quarter totaling 749,410 shares.</li>\n<li>Jason Mehring, President, outlined that the portfolio stood at $1.5 billion across 141 companies, with 92.4% invested in senior secured loans and 7.5% in equity. \"All new portfolio company investments during 2025 were in first lien loans, bringing total portfolio exposure to first lien loans to 87.4% on a fair value basis, up from 83.6% last year.\"</li>\n<li>Mehring discussed new investments, including a $4.5 million first lien term loan to a wealth management platform and a $4 million first lien loan to Coalfire, a cybersecurity provider, emphasizing a strategy of direct origination and increased portfolio diversification.</li>\n<li>Erik Cuellar, CFO, stated, \"Gross investment income for the fourth quarter was $0.52 per share,\" including \"recurring cash interest of $0.41, nonrecurring income of $0.01, recurring discount and fee amortization of $0.02, PIK income of $0.06 and dividend income of $0.02 per share.\"</li>\n<li>Cuellar also reported, \"Net realized losses for the quarter were $73.9 million or $0.87 per share... Net unrealized losses were $66.5 million or $0.78 per share, primarily due to the unrealized markdowns on the 6 investments Phil discussed earlier.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management reiterated its focus on improving credit quality and repositioning toward first lien loans and greater portfolio diversification. Tseng stated, \"Our highest near-term priority is to improve the credit quality of our investment portfolio by working diligently to resolve challenged credits.\"</li>\n<li>The dividend was set at $0.17 per share for Q1 2026, with the goal of maintaining a sustainable and NII-covered dividend.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjusted net investment income for Q4 was $0.25 per share, compared to $0.30 in Q3 and $0.36 in Q4 2024.</li>\n<li>NAV declined to $7.07 per share at December 31, 2025, down from $8.71 at September 30.</li>\n<li>Nonaccrual debt investments represented 4% of the portfolio at fair value and 9.7% at cost.</li>\n<li>Total liquidity at year-end was $570.2 million, with $482.8 million in available borrowings and $61.1 million of cash. Net regulatory leverage was 1.41x at year-end, up from 1.2x in the previous quarter.</li>\n<li>The company paid down its entire $325 million principal amount of 2026 unsecured notes post year-end.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Robert Dodd, Raymond James: Questioned whether more aggressive strategic adjustments might be warranted given portfolio contraction and rising leverage. Philip Tseng responded, \"We continually evaluate ways to optimize returns for the shareholders. And at this time, we believe the best path forward is to continue to focus on improving the credit quality of the portfolio and executing on the investment strategy that we've been discussing.\"</li>\n<li>Dodd also asked about the effectiveness of restructurings and whether more aggressive approaches were needed. Tseng replied, \"Restructurings, they can play out in several different ways. The road to recovery... are not always linear. In fact, they're rarely linear.\"</li>\n<li>Finian O'Shea, Wells Fargo: Inquired about the rationale behind the significant NAV markdowns and the unusual timing of the 8-K filing. Jason Mehring responded, \"There hasn't been any sort of change to our valuation policy... when you look at the overall write-downs in the quarter, they were concentrated fairly heavily among those 6 names... had an equity orientation, which... is more volatile.\" Mehring emphasized the idiosyncratic nature of the events and said the 8-K was a one-off due to the magnitude and concentration of markdowns.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts expressed skepticism regarding the pace of portfolio turnaround, the need for more aggressive strategic action, and the stickiness of restructurings, with pointed questions about the viability of current plans and the causes behind NAV declines.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a neutral to slightly defensive tone, emphasizing ongoing execution of their strategy and the complexity of credit recoveries. Tseng asserted, \"We are confident in our strategy.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management exhibited increased caution, with more direct questioning from analysts and more extended explanations and justifications from management.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance language shifted from optimism about stabilization and diversification in Q3 to acknowledgment of significant NAV declines and the need for portfolio repositioning in Q4.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus increased on first lien loans and diversification, with the percentage of first lien loans rising from 83.6% to 87.4%.</li>\n<li>Key metrics deteriorated: NAV fell from $8.71 to $7.07 per share, and adjusted NII dropped from $0.30 to $0.25 per share.</li>\n<li>Analysts' tone moved from cautious to pressing, seeking clarity on strategic alternatives and the efficacy of restructuring processes.</li>\n<li>Management's confidence in the investment strategy remained, but explanations were longer and more focused on remediation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited portfolio markdowns and nonaccruals as major challenges, especially in investments underwritten before 2022.</li>\n<li>Six specific portfolio companies were responsible for most of the NAV decline.</li>\n<li>Equity-oriented positions were highlighted as particularly volatile.</li>\n<li>Tseng noted the need to \"work diligently with our borrowers, their sponsors and creditors to optimize recovery values, including pursuing restructurings and other transaction-driven outcomes when appropriate.\"</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about restructuring effectiveness and the potential need for more aggressive strategic shifts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Management emphasized the ongoing repositioning of the portfolio toward first lien senior secured loans and greater diversification, acknowledging significant NAV and NII declines driven by concentrated markdowns in legacy investments. The company reiterated its commitment to resolving challenged credits and leveraging BlackRock’s resources, with the aim of gradually improving portfolio quality and delivering sustainable returns to shareholders.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/tcpc/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

In Washington, I'm pleased to report that we've been working collaboratively and productively with parties and have reached settlement in principle, resolving the revenue requirement in the case.\"</li>\n<li>The CEO emphasized the integration and growth of Texas assets: \"SiEnergy provided 18% organic customer growth in 2025 and contributed 11% of our consolidated adjusted earnings per share. At the same time, SiEnergy posted a sizable increase to its customer backlog nearing 250,000 future meters.\"</li>\n<li>Palfreyman stated on the water segment, \"The Water segment outperformed our expectations, contributing $0.35 per share or 12% of our consolidated adjusted earnings per share in 2025.\"</li>\n<li>CFO Raymond Kaszuba said, \"For the full year 2025, we reported record adjusted earnings per share of $2.93 compared to $2.33 per share for 2024. Earnings growth was fueled by new rates in Oregon, healthy rate base growth across the business and continued strong organic customer growth.\"</li>\n<li>Kaszuba added, \"For 2026 specifically, we expect another record year for both capital investment and earnings.

With the project, once that achieves notice to proceed, we expect that we will increase that to the 5% to 7% that we just described.\"</li>\n<li>Ellinghaus inquired about SiEnergy's performance. Palfreyman said, \"We've been really pleased with the growth that we've seen at SiEnergy despite a slowdown in the housing market in Texas, we had incredible growth this year.\"</li>\n<li>Ellinghaus asked about the Oregon rate mechanism. Palfreyman confirmed, \"We are expecting receipt of that, the rate mechanism here in Oregon as part of that guidance. It is a relatively modest increase to rates, about 1.5%.\"</li>\n<li>Ellinghaus queried about water segment M&amp;A strategy. Palfreyman stated, \"We're always looking opportunistically at acquisition opportunities... but we are really happy with the platform that we have built.\"</li>\n<li>Alexis Kania, BTIG: Asked about MX3 funding and AFUDC. Kaszuba responded, \"We would be able to fund any equity through normal issuances under our ATM. And then... yes, we would also receive AFUDC during the construction period.\"</li>\n<li>Selman Akyol, Stifel: Asked about further storage expansion and behind-the-meter opportunities. Palfreyman said, \"There is strong customer demand... It's very premature to comment on any specifics there. In terms of behind-the-meter opportunities, it is something we've been approached by numerous customers... If there is a storage potential use case there, but there's nothing that we have today to announce on that front.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts were positive, focusing on growth drivers, regulatory clarity, and strategic expansions, frequently congratulating management and probing for details on forward growth and project execution.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and optimistic tone, especially in the prepared remarks.
