            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Donaldson Co. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DCI\" title=\"Donaldson Company, Inc.\">DCI</a></span>) shares dropped 17% during regular trading Thursday morning after the filtration products maker <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557625-donaldson-misses-top-line-and-bottom-line-estimates-updates-fy26-outlook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"reported\">reported</a> quarterly results that missed Wall Street expectations and trimmed its full-year earnings outlook.</p>\n<p>The company posted record fiscal second-quarter sales of $896.3 million, up 3.0% from a year earlier. However, the figure came in below the consensus estimate of $899 million.</p>\n<p>Adjusted earnings were $0.83 a share, also below analyst estimates of $0.89 a share.</p>\n<p>Donaldson (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DCI\" title=\"Donaldson Company, Inc.\">DCI</a>) reported net earnings of $92.5 million, or $0.78 a share, compared with $95.9 million, or $0.79 a share, in the prior-year period. Net income fell to $92.5 million, or $0.78 a share, from $95.9 million, or $0.79 a share.</p>\n<p>“This quarter, the Donaldson team delivered record sales, strengthened the foundation to meet strong customer demand in key, high-margin businesses and made further progress on our footprint optimization initiatives, despite near-term challenges,” Tod Carpenter, chairman, president and chief executive officer said in the earnings announcement.</p>\n<h3><strong>Segment trends mixed</strong></h3>\n<p>Donaldson (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DCI\" title=\"Donaldson Company, Inc.\">DCI</a>) said sales growth was supported by pricing and favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by lower volumes.</p>\n<p>Within the Mobile Solutions segment, sales rose 1.6%. Off-Road revenue increased 7.8% as end markets improved. On-Road sales declined 9.2% due to lower global truck production. Aftermarket sales edged up 1.1%.</p>\n<p>Industrial Solutions sales climbed 2.4%. Industrial Filtration Solutions grew 7.2% on strength in Power Generation equipment. Aerospace and Defense revenue fell 19.4% due to sales timing.</p>\n<p>Life Sciences sales advanced 16.2% driven by demand in Food and Beverage and Disk Drive markets.</p>\n<p>Gross margin declined to 33.5% from 35.2% a year ago. Adjusted gross margin was 33.7%. Operating margin was 13.2% compared with 14.4% last year, while adjusted operating margin was 14.0%.</p>\n<p>Interest expense rose to $7.7 million from $5.9 million reflecting higher debt and interest rates. The effective tax rate was 20.7% compared with 23.2% a year ago.</p>\n<p>During the quarter, Donaldson (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DCI\" title=\"Donaldson Company, Inc.\">DCI</a>) agreed to acquire Facet for approximately $820 million in cash, expanding its fuel and fluid filtration portfolio. The deal is expected to close in the second half of fiscal 2026.</p>\n<h3><strong>Lowered full-year profit guidance</strong></h3>\n<p>Management reduced its fiscal 2026 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $3.93 to $4.01 a share, down from a prior range of $3.95 to $4.11 and below the Wall Street estimate of $4.05.</p>\n<p>The company reaffirmed projected sales growth of 1% to 5% for the year. Adjusted operating margin is now expected to be between 16.0% and 16.4%, compared with prior guidance of 16.2% to 16.8%.</p>\n<p>Donaldson (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DCI\" title=\"Donaldson Company, Inc.\">DCI</a>) said it expects interest expense of about $26 million and an adjusted effective tax rate of 22% to 24% for fiscal 2026. Capital expenditures are forecast between $60 million and $75 million.</p>\n<p>The company paid $69.3 million in dividends year to date and repurchased 1.2% of its shares for $108.6 million. It does not expect additional buybacks in the second half of the year due to the pending Facet acquisition.</p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
