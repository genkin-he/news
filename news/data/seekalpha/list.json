Wrede explained, \"This reflects a margin of 12.0% at the midpoint, which is within the range of our previous 2027 long-term targets and puts us strongly on the path to the new 2030 long-term targets.\"</li>\n<li>Management reaffirmed a long-term target of $2 billion in net revenue by 2030, with an adjusted EBITDA margin between 15% and 17%.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Net revenue for Q4 2025 was $213.6 million. Full year net revenue reached $759.4 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $114 million. Gross profit was reported at $285.7 million or 37.6% of net revenue. SG&amp;A expenses were $159.4 million or 21% of net revenue, with marketing investment increasing by $10.4 million. CapEx for the year totaled $82 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities stood at $113.4 million as of December 28, 2025, with no debt outstanding.</li>\n<li>Wrede reported that the previously disclosed material weakness in internal controls has been remediated.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Scott Marks, Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Asked about the timing of the revised outlook amid volatility and winter storms. Diez-Canseco responded, \"We always want to make sure that we're setting ourselves up for success... this guide gives us the right amount of room and flexibility,\" and Wrede added, \"We are clearly gaining share in the category. So we are outperforming the category. But it is a bit of a noisy environment right now.\"</li>\n<li>Brian Holland, D.A. Davidson &amp; Co.: Inquired about macro environment concerns and the core consumer. Diez-Canseco clarified, \"We're not seeing evidence of a big change in the confidence or economic reality of our core consumers... but it might mean that we have to be a little more patient as we continue to add consumers.\"</li>\n<li>Matthew Smith, Stifel: Asked about EBITDA margin contraction and promotional activity. Wrede explained, \"We are reinvesting the price increase from last year back into promotions... this is not a step-up in promotions to drive volume. It's really a return to where we should have been promoting.\"</li>\n<li>Megan Christine Alexander, Morgan Stanley: Queried Q1 revenue expectations. Wrede said, \"At this point, 1Q, we're a bit more cautious on it than we were before... maybe the second half might be a bit stronger than the first half.\"</li>\n<li>Jon Andersen, William Blair: Asked about the $100 million share repurchase. Wrede confirmed, \"This is the first buyback program that the Board has authorized since the IPO... now is a good time for us to think about what we can do with that dry powder to create shareholder value.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts were generally neutral to slightly cautious, with several pressing for clarity on macro headwinds, promotional strategy, and the sustainability of growth. Questions probed the justification for revised guidance and the company's ability to maintain volume gains amid industry volatility.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, emphasizing operational strength and long-term strategy, but was more measured and explanatory in the Q&amp;A, acknowledging near-term volatility and a \"noisy environment.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management displayed a more cautious and pragmatic tone, especially regarding early 2026 performance and macro challenges, whereas the prior quarter emphasized strong performance and expansion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance shifted from a previously more ambitious stance to a \"more measured start\" for 2026, with management explicitly acknowledging macro volatility and order pacing disruptions from winter storms.</li>\n<li>Strategic priorities remain focused on long-term growth, capacity investments, and expanding brand awareness, but near-term targets were moderated to reflect inventory normalization and external disruptions.</li>\n<li>Analysts' focus shifted from operational expansion and supply chain improvements in Q3 to probing for details on margin compression, promotional strategy, and the sustainability of volume-led growth in Q4.</li>\n<li>Key metrics such as net revenue and adjusted EBITDA reached record levels, but guidance for 2026 reflects moderated near-term expectations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited volatile order patterns due to macroeconomic factors and severe winter storms as ongoing risks.</li>\n<li>The transition from supply allocation to unconstrained capacity presents challenges in maintaining high-quality placements and avoiding aggressive discounting.</li>\n<li>Continued investments in promotions and operational capacity could impact margins in the short term.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about the impact of industry competition, promotional environment, and the ability to convert increased brand awareness into household penetration amid category noise.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Vital Farms leadership highlighted record 2025 financial results and ongoing market share gains, while implementing a unified management structure and launching its first share repurchase program. The company reaffirmed its long-term target of $2 billion in net revenue by 2030, with 2026 guidance reflecting a measured approach to growth amid volatile order patterns and macro challenges. Management is focused on leveraging operational investments, expanding capacity, and driving profitable household penetration, positioning the company for sustainable expansion in the evolving specialty egg market.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/vitl/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

She noted full year adjusted earnings of $3.066 billion or $4.69 per share, with adjusted EPS at the high end of guidance range, and described the capital plan as \"primarily driven by strong growth at Sempra Texas, most notably from the acceleration of the Permian Basin Reliability Plan.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sempra affirmed full year 2026 adjusted EPS guidance of $4.80 to $5.30, introduced 2027 EPS guidance of $5.10 to $5.70, and issued a 2030 EPS outlook of $6.70 to $7.50.

Martin replied, \"the larger items that can impact the long-term outlook are regulatory matters,\" and clarified that the $9 billion is outside the base plan but could move into the plan as execution progresses.</li>\n<li>Pourreza also inquired about the California segment's contribution. Martin noted, \"that really reflects the impact of the approved attrition from the last GRC as you move from 2026 into 2027,\" and highlighted ongoing efficiency efforts in California.</li>\n<li>Steven Fleishman, Wolfe Research: Sought clarity on growth shaping for 2028–2030 and timing of Oncor Texas upside capital.

Martin stressed improvements in operating cash flows and pointed to $2.2 billion of additional proceeds from the SI transaction, as well as the retained 25% SI stake as potential funding sources.</li>\n<li>Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Jefferies: Questioned drivers within the 2030 guidance range and California's strategic role. Martin discussed regulatory certainty in both Texas and California and stated, \"if some of those risk factors to execution come off the table, you should expect this management team to look for opportunities to provide more visibility.\"</li>\n<li>David Arcaro, Morgan Stanley: Asked about data center pipeline, supply chain, and credit metrics. Nye reported a queue of 273 gigawatts (255 gigawatts data-related), with 38 gigawatts meeting high-certainty criteria.

Nye explained that \"what comes out of Batch Zero or other ERCOT transmission plans are not presently included in what we have in the base plan.\"</li>\n<li>Aidan Kelly, JPMorgan: Asked about commitments in the Texas load pipeline. Nye described evolving processes, now with about $3.5 billion in collateral from customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts were constructive but pressed for specifics on upside drivers, growth shaping, regulatory outcomes, and capital allocation. They frequently sought clarification on how strategic initiatives translate to financial results.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and optimistic tone in prepared remarks, with Martin saying, \"we believe Sempra offers investors an attractive combination of current yield, durable earnings growth and long-term capital appreciation,\" and remained detailed in responses. During Q&amp;A, the tone remained measured and focused, with occasional emphasis on execution risk and regulatory milestones.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both management and analysts appeared more confident, supported by improved financial results, increased capital plan, and regulatory progress.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The current quarter introduced a record $65 billion capital plan for 2026–2030, up 17% from the prior plan, and a new 2030 EPS outlook, compared to only affirming guidance in the prior call.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus continued to shift toward Texas, with more explicit details on transmission expansion and capital allocation, while California's growth is described as more moderate.</li>\n<li>Analysts’ focus moved from balance sheet and equity needs to details of upside capital opportunities and regulatory certainty.</li>\n<li>Management's confidence increased, highlighting higher cash flow projections and the elimination of base plan equity needs. Analysts showed heightened interest in execution, guidance ranges, and capital flexibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management identified regulatory risks, particularly in California and Texas, as key variables for long-term growth.</li>\n<li>Execution risk remains in closing the SI Partners transaction and finalizing Texas rate case settlements.</li>\n<li>Supply chain and permitting challenges for Texas transmission and data center projects were discussed, but management described robust mitigation efforts.</li>\n<li>Analysts highlighted potential downside from ERCOT transmission outcomes and the importance of maintaining credit metrics.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Sempra’s 2025 performance set a foundation for long-term growth, with a record $65 billion capital plan targeting 11% annual rate base growth and robust EPS guidance through 2030.
