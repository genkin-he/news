            "description": "<html><body><p>Wall Street extended its winning streak to three weeks and notched a sixth straight positive month in October, highlighting the market’s strong rebound from April lows.</p>\n<p>Gains were fueled by big tech earnings, positive trade news, and another Fed rate cut, though Chair Jerome Powell tempered optimism by saying a December cut is “far from” certain. Meanwhile, five of the Magnificent Seven reported earnings this week, keeping investor focus firmly on tech.</p>\n<p>For the week, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SP500</a>) gained<span style=\"color: #008000;\"> +0.7%</span>, while the blue-chip Dow (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJI\" title=\"Dow Jones Industrial Average Index\">DJI</a>) added <span style=\"color: #008000;\">+0.8%</span>. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COMP:IND\" title=\"NASDAQ Composite Index\">COMP:IND</a>) surged <span style=\"color: #008000;\">+2.2%</span>.</p>\n<p><strong>Here's what caught investors attention this week:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>)</strong> shares advanced on Wednesday to surpass a $5T market valuation, a level no publicly listed company has previously reached. The stock has surged nearly 51% year-to-date, after rising 170% in 2024 and 240% in 2023.</p>\n<p><strong>Fiserv (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FI\" title=\"Fiserv, Inc.\">FI</a>)</strong> plunged 47% over the week after missing Q3 estimates and announcing a major strategic overhaul with leadership and board changes alongside sharp guidance cuts. The company lowered its 2025 EPS outlook to $8.50–$8.60 (from ~$10.23) and trimmed organic revenue growth expectations to 3.5%–4% from ~10%. Takis Georgakopoulos and Dhivya Suryadevara will become co-presidents, Paul Todd will serve as CFO, and CEO Mike Lyons said the firm still has the scale and platforms to support long-term growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>)</strong> jumped more than 7% after posting better-than-expected third-quarter results, driven by strong performance in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) division. The company reported earnings of $1.95 per share, up 16% year-over-year and $0.37 above estimates. Revenue climbed 13% to $180.2 billion, about $3 billion ahead of forecasts, fueled by growth across online and physical stores, subscription services, and a 20% year-over-year increase in AWS net sales.</p>\n<p><strong>Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>)</strong> disappointed investors after its third-quarter profit was dragged down by a one-time $16 billion tax charge tied to President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” Net income fell to $2.71 billion ($1.05 per share) from $15.69 billion ($6.03 per share) a year earlier. Excluding the one-time charge, net income would have been $18.64B, or $7.25 per share.</p>\n<p><strong>UnitedHealth (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UNH\" title=\"UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\">UNH</a>)</strong> shares gained after the healthcare giant topped Wall Street expectations for the third quarter and raised its full-year earnings guidance. The company reported adjusted EPS of $2.92 on revenue of $113.2 billion, up 12.3% year-over-year. UnitedHealth now forecasts 2025 adjusted earnings of at least $16.25 per share, an increase from its prior $16.00 outlook and slightly above the $16.22 consensus estimate.</p>\n<p><strong>Cigna (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CI\" title=\"The Cigna Group\">CI</a>)</strong> fell even though its Q3 results beat on both lines, as the health insurer indicated that its pharmacy benefit services segment will see margin pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>Metsera (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTSR\" title=\"Metsera, Inc.\">MTSR</a>) </strong>confirmed receiving an unsolicited takeover offer from <strong>Novo Nordisk (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVO\" title=\"Novo Nordisk A/S\">NVO</a>)</strong>, calling it a “superior proposal” to its existing merger deal with <strong>Pfizer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE\" title=\"Pfizer Inc.\">PFE</a>)</strong>. Novo’s bid values Metsera at up to $77.75 per share (about $9 billion), consisting of an initial $56.50 cash payment and a contingent value right of up to $21.25 tied to future milestones. In contrast, Pfizer’s $4.9 billion deal, announced in September, included $47.50 per share upfront and up to $22.50 per share in milestone payments. Pfizer has until Tuesday to match the offer.</p>\n<p><strong>Lumen Technologies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LUMN\" title=\"Lumen Technologies, Inc.\">LUMN</a>)</strong> shares fell as much as 9% on Friday before trimming losses, after the wireline telecom company reported its third-quarter results and outlook. Analysts remained generally positive but noted that expectations were elevated, with the stock having surged nearly 180% since its August low. Adjusted losses were -$0.20 vs. -$0.27 expected. Revenue fell 4% Y/Y to $3.09B, but beat estimates by $50M.</p>\n<p><strong>PayPal (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PYPL\" title=\"PayPal Holdings, Inc.\">PYPL</a>)</strong> rose as the company reported a strong Q3 earnings beat and outlook, announced a partnership with OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>) to integrate its payment system into ChatGPT, and declared its first-ever quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share.</p>\n<p><strong>Dexcom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DXCM\" title=\"DexCom, Inc.\">DXCM</a>)</strong> fell 17% over the week after the medical-equipment company gave a 2026 growth outlook that is seen as cautious. During an earnings call, management declined to provide 2026 guidance in response to an analyst's question. Interim CEO Jacob Leach said that the top end of its growth range for 2026 \"is probably slightly below where the Street is today for our base case.</p>\n</body></html>",
