            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Colgate-Palmolive (CL) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Noel Wallace highlighted a \"volatile operating environment\" with pressures from \"consumer uncertainty, tariffs, geopolitics, high cost inflation and other factors\" affecting sales and profit growth across the sector. He emphasized the company's commitment to its 2030 Strategy, stating, \"We have healthy brands in growing categories with strong market shares and a diverse global footprint with nearly 50% exposure to faster growth emerging markets and a best-in-class global supply chain to service that demand.\" </li>\n<li>Wallace described the strategic transition as \"not wholesale change but rather we are working to accelerate the rate of change as we embark on our 2030 Strategy\" and detailed actions such as a \"new innovation model with additional resources focused on delivering more impactful science-based innovation across all price tiers\" and investment in AI, predictive analytics, and automation to drive efficiency and personalization at scale.</li>\n<li>The CEO noted continued investment in omnichannel demand generation, digital, data analytics, and capability scaling, with a focus on emerging markets and the Hill's brand, which is \"gaining share across almost every strategic growth segment.\" He underlined the company's \"well-funded advertising and innovation plans\" and expectation to drive growth despite global category slowdown.</li>\n<li>CFO Stanley Sutula stated, \"we said in our guidance that Q4 organic or that full year organic will be roughly in line with the year-to-date. So if you look at the year-to-date, we're roughly 1.2%.\" He added that gross margin for the year is expected to be \"roughly in line with the year-to-date gross profit margin of 60.1%.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The company updated organic sales growth guidance to be \"roughly in line with the year-to-date, which would indicate to be around 1.2% for the year,\" including a 70 basis point impact from the exit of private label. Sutula reiterated, \"we've held our EPS guidance.\"</li>\n<li>Wallace stated, \"we are preparing our plans and our strategy to address what we need to do to grow faster in this current environment. That's not only faster top line but faster margin growth and faster EPS.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The company reported that organic sales in Latin America were 1.7%, including a 150 basis point negative impact from the Colgate Total replacement. Gross profit margin was reported as 60.1% year-to-date, with full year guidance \"roughly in line\" with that figure, and Q4 expected at \"60% plus or minus.\"</li>\n<li>Hill's delivered 2.5% organic sales growth ex private label, with continued strong margin performance and broad-based growth across wet, dry, treats, cat, dog, prescription diet, and science diet segments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Dara Mohsenian, Morgan Stanley: Asked about the duration of category softness and impact of strategic levers. Wallace responded, \"we're anticipating a continued sluggishness but we're making the changes necessary to stimulate growth... that's going to be consistent all over the world.\"</li>\n<li>Peter Grom, UBS: Inquired about the oral care decline in Latin America due to formula change. Wallace explained, \"Latin America organic was 1.7%. But if you include...150 basis points negative from the volume impact from the Colgate Total replacement...we are proactively adjusting the formula for the impacted variants around the world.\"</li>\n<li>Filippo Falorni, Citi: Asked about India's GST tax change and macro outlook. Wallace replied, \"organic was down mid-singles...Longer term, we would expect the GST reduction to benefit consumption in the category.\"</li>\n<li>Lauren Lieberman, Barclays: Asked about pricing in Europe. Wallace stated, \"pricing, our anticipation is that we can keep getting positive pricing as we move forward but it will certainly be a little bit more challenged given the prolonged inflation.\"</li>\n<li>Bonnie Herzog, Goldman Sachs: Asked about Q4 organic sales growth drivers. Sutula answered, \"we had an impact...around total to the total company. That's going to improve here as we go...and so as that levels out, that also becomes a benefit here heading into Q4.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts were consistently cautious, pressing on category softness, market share, and the pace of recovery, with repeated questions on the impact of formula changes, pricing environment, and growth opportunities.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and proactive tone in prepared remarks, emphasizing strategic action and adaptability. During Q&amp;A, responses reflected realism—\"we're anticipating a continued sluggishness\"—yet reinforced confidence in the strategy and investments, often addressing concerns directly and at times acknowledging challenges.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, analyst tone was slightly more negative amid persistent category weakness, while management shifted from cautious optimism to a more urgent focus on accelerating change and mitigating headwinds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management shifted from discussing short-term adjustments and category normalization in Q2 to emphasizing acceleration of the 2030 Strategy and organizational agility in Q3.</li>\n<li>Analysts' questions in the current quarter focused more on risks from formula changes, subdued volumes, macroeconomic volatility, and execution of strategic transformation, whereas the previous quarter included more questions on category stabilization and innovation pacing.</li>\n<li>Key metrics such as organic sales growth, margin guidance, and restructuring plans were reiterated, but language indicated an increased sense of urgency and readiness to act amid softening demand.</li>\n<li>The tone from management became more action-oriented, explicitly addressing sluggishness and outlining detailed steps to drive growth.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited \"consumer uncertainty, tariffs, geopolitics, high cost inflation and other factors\" as ongoing headwinds.</li>\n<li>The company proactively addressed the impact of Colgate Total formula change in Latin America, with Wallace noting, \"we are proactively adjusting the formula for the impacted variants around the world...There may be some further costs going forward.\"</li>\n<li>Exposure to raw material inflation, especially fats and oils, affected gross margins, and management indicated that tariff and FX impacts remain significant variables.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about inventory adjustments, competitive pressures, promotional activity, and the pace of innovation and execution in key markets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Management emphasized that while Colgate-Palmolive faces persistent external headwinds and a sluggish demand environment, it is moving swiftly to implement its 2030 Strategy, focusing on accelerated innovation, digital transformation, and organizational flexibility. The company highlighted concrete steps being taken to address formula-related setbacks, drive growth in emerging categories and markets, and maintain strong gross margins and EPS growth. Management communicated strong confidence in its ability to adapt and outperform, supported by robust brand equity, disciplined execution, and continued investment in capabilities and productivity initiatives.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/cl/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

(EEX) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Herve Sedky highlighted that \"through the first 9 months of the year, we delivered solid growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA, along with solid organic growth, underscoring the strength and resilience of our increasingly diversified model and the progress we're making toward our long-term objectives.\" Sedky announced the acquisition of Generis, expanding Emerald's portfolio into high-growth peer-to-peer executive events and supporting broader sector diversification. He noted, \"With Generis, Emerald's portfolio now spans an even broader mix of high-growth sectors, strengthening our resilience across market cycles and reducing exposure to slower growth verticals.\"</li>\n<li>Sedky pointed to strong attendance at Advertising Week in New York, stating, \"The show delivered record-setting attendance and engagement this year, a strong affirmation of the appetite of high-quality in-person experiences that drive business results.\"</li>\n<li>The company is advancing technology initiatives with an AI-powered event agent and increasing centralization of go-to-market efforts to improve efficiency and customer experience.</li>\n<li>Sedky emphasized, \"With the completion of the Generis purchase in August, we've now executed 3 meaningful acquisitions this year, which advance our strategy to build a high-growth portfolio of live experiences.\"</li>\n<li>CFO David Doft stated, \"Total revenue in the quarter was $77.5 million compared to $72.6 million in the prior year quarter.\" He explained, \"Adjusted EBITDA was $12.8 million in the third quarter compared to $12.5 million in the prior year period, an increase of 2.4%.\" Doft noted the impact of Las Vegas Convention Center construction and tariffs on organic revenue, as well as the absorption of $1 million in Generis SG&amp;A costs without revenue contribution in Q3.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management raised and narrowed full-year 2025 guidance to $460 million to $465 million in revenue and $122.5 million to $127.5 million in adjusted EBITDA, reflecting the Generis acquisition and year-to-date performance.</li>\n<li>Sedky reported solid rebooking momentum for the first half of 2026 and highlighted that \"pacing for 2026... reflects sustained customer confidence across our portfolio.\"</li>\n<li>Doft confirmed, \"we are increasing our full year 2025 guidance to reflect the Generis acquisition and narrowing our guidance range given our increased visibility as we approach year-end.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Total revenue for Q3 was $77.5 million, with organic revenue down 6.8% year-over-year, primarily due to construction at the Las Vegas Convention Center and some tariff headwinds.</li>\n<li>Year-to-date total revenue reached $330.7 million, up 13.3% versus the prior year, driven by acquisitions and higher organic revenues.</li>\n<li>Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $90.8 million, a 32.4% increase from the prior year.</li>\n<li>SG&amp;A in Q3 was $51.3 million, up from $40.8 million, mainly due to acquisition expenses and higher stock-based compensation.</li>\n<li>Free cash flow in Q3 was slightly negative, impacted by timing of payables and acquisition-related cash flow dynamics.</li>\n<li>Cash at September 30 stood at $95.4 million, with total liquidity of $205.4 million, and net debt to covenant EBITDA ratio at 2.96x.</li>\n<li>The board extended and expanded the share repurchase program, allowing up to $25 million in repurchases through December 31, 2026, and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.015 per share.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Barton Crockett, Rosenblatt: Asked about the $6 million impact of tariffs and construction. Doft clarified, \"that's inclusive of both of those items. The tariff impact is actually the lesser of the items in that impact.\" He added, \"the construction is on track to be completed by the end of this year, which is great... we're enthusiastic about cycling this impact next year.\"</li>\n<li>Crockett asked about the overall impact of tariffs. Sedky responded, \"the net effect of tariffs is a very manageable impact for our business overall, but we're definitely seeing in a handful of markets.\" Doft added, \"as we cycle this year, we're hopeful that next year is a bit more normal.\"</li>\n<li>Crockett inquired about guidance excluding Generis. Doft stated, \"we are absolutely within the guidance range, excluding generics. It is the lower half of the range, to be clear.\"</li>\n<li>Allen Klee, Maxim Group: Asked about incremental revenue from all acquisitions. Doft explained, \"For the other acquisitions, it's de minimis... only Generis has that by now.\"</li>\n<li>Klee asked about the impact of Las Vegas construction on results. Doft said, \"It's a few million dollars if you back into the math.\"</li>\n<li>Klee requested an example of the AI-powered tool. Sedky described it as \"an agent that allows our customers to interrogate and basically get answers to both exhibitors and visitors to anything that they need around the entire customer journey.\"</li>\n<li>Klee followed up on platform strategy and integration. Sedky responded, \"we're progressing really well, and we're seeing the evidence of that as we acquire businesses and are able to incorporate them into the broader Emerald.\"</li>\n<li>Klee asked about the M&amp;A environment. Sedky stated, \"the pipeline is strong, and we are actively exploring a handful of opportunities.\"</li>\n<li>Klee asked for updates on commerce and content segments.

Sedky used phrases such as \"we're confident in our ability to deliver on our full-year commitments\" and \"I'm generally excited about what's ahead.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone remained consistent, but this quarter included more forward-looking references to M&amp;A, AI expansion, and integration benefits, while analysts maintained a similar level of curiosity with an emphasis on external headwinds and guidance sustainability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance was raised and the range narrowed this quarter, while in Q2 the guidance was reaffirmed.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus intensified on integrating acquisitions, AI-powered customer engagement, and cost efficiencies, building on Q2's emphasis on portfolio optimization and resilience.</li>\n<li>Analysts maintained their focus on macro headwinds, event-specific disruptions, and the impact of recent acquisitions, but pressed more on the specifics of future contribution and normalization of impacted events.</li>\n<li>Key metrics such as revenue and EBITDA continued to grow, with Q3 reflecting acquisition-driven gains and Q2 featuring stronger organic growth on a pro forma basis.</li>\n<li>Management's confidence in long-term growth levers and resilience was reiterated, though Q3 placed more emphasis on forward bookings and the impact of recent technology investments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited ongoing construction at the Las Vegas Convention Center and tariff-related headwinds as primary challenges, with both expected to abate as construction concludes and trade conditions stabilize.</li>\n<li>Exposure to tariffs remains limited, but management acknowledged impacts in China and Canada.</li>\n<li>Acquisition integration costs affected SG&amp;A, with management highlighting disciplined cost control and anticipated future margin improvements.</li>\n<li>Free cash flow was impacted by timing of payables and acquisition cash flow dynamics, noted as a temporary effect by management.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Emerald Holding, Inc. reported solid revenue and EBITDA growth for the third quarter, driven by acquisitions and continued operational execution. The company raised its full-year 2025 guidance and narrowed its outlook, incorporating the Generis acquisition and sustained momentum in event attendance and customer rebooking.

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Casella Waste Systems (CWST) Q3 2025  </p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>John Casella, Chairman, CEO &amp; Secretary, highlighted, \"In Q3, the Casella team worked hard, stayed focused on executing our operating plans, delivering another strong quarter that reinforces our improved outlook for 2025.\" He noted quarterly records for revenue and adjusted EBITDA, citing continued solid waste pricing, healthy landfill volumes, and substantial acquisition contributions. Eight acquisitions year-to-date added about $105 million in annualized revenue, with the Mountain State Waste transaction expected to close in early 2026, contributing another $30 million annually. Casella stated, \"Our M&amp;A strategy remains focused on balanced mix of smaller tuck-in acquisitions and larger opportunities that expand our geographic footprint, such as Mountain State.\" He announced his transition to Executive Chairman at year-end, with Ned Coletta to become CEO.</li>\n<li>Bradford Helgeson, Executive VP &amp; CFO, reported, \"Revenues in the third quarter were $485.4 million, up $73.7 million or 17.9% year-over-year, with $53.4 million from acquisitions, including rollover and $20.4 million from same-store growth or 4.9%.\" He added, \"Adjusted EBITDA was $119.9 million in the quarter, up $16.9 million or 16.4% year-over-year, with contribution from acquisitions, including rollover and 8% organic growth.\" Helgeson explained that solid waste revenues rose 20.6%, and Resource Solutions revenues grew 7.8% year-over-year, with recycling and other processing revenue down 5% due to lower commodity prices, but national accounts up 16.5%.</li>\n<li>Ned Coletta, President, emphasized, \"Third quarter results exceeded expectations for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Total revenues rose nearly 18% year-over-year, driven by strong 4.9% organic growth and continued contributions from acquisitions.\" Coletta detailed integration progress in the Mid-Atlantic segment, advancements in landfill permitting, and operational improvements, including route optimization and truck automation. He reaffirmed a strong balance sheet and positive outlook for the remainder of 2025 and into 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul><li>Management raised the lower end of revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2025, moving the midpoints to $1.835 billion and $420 million, respectively, citing \"increased visibility and confidence in full year results and underlying strength in the business\" (Helgeson). Organic growth for 2026 is projected in the 4% to 5% range, mainly from solid waste pricing, plus an incremental 3% or $60 million from rollover acquisition revenue, excluding future yet-to-close deals. Helgeson projected \"total revenue growth, excluding future acquisition activity that hasn't yet closed, in the range of 7% to 8%.\" Adjusted EBITDA margin improvement is targeted at 25 to 50 basis points for 2026. Free cash flow is aimed to grow in the typical long-term range of 10% to 15%.</li></ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul><li>Casella reported quarterly revenues of $485.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of $119.9 million. Solid waste revenues increased 20.6% year-over-year, with price up 4.6% and volume flat. In the landfill business, same-store price rose 3% and total tons increased 11.7%.

Adjusted free cash flow for the first nine months reached $119.5 million. Capital expenditures reached $187.8 million, with $54 million invested in recent acquisitions. As of September 30, debt stood at $1.16 billion, and cash at $193 million. The consolidated net leverage ratio was 2.34x.</li></ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Tyler Brown, Raymond James: Asked about long-term margin trajectory and impact of M&amp;A. Helgeson responded, \"We don't see anything that will challenge what we've executed and what we expect with margins over time...there's significant multiyear margin expansion opportunity.\"</li>\n<li>Brown: Clarified margin guidance for 2026. Helgeson confirmed, \"Including the M&amp;A that we've completed plus Mountain State Waste, yes.\"</li>\n<li>Brown: Asked about Mid-Atlantic synergy capture and if the $5 million estimate included pricing benefits. Coletta said, \"It does not include any pricing or margin lift...we're so early in budgeting that it'd be hard to get ahead of that.\"</li>\n<li>Brown: Inquired about AI applications. Coletta described foundational system upgrades and stated, \"We're looking for AI opportunities to really streamline. One of the areas that we're probably most excited about is...some of the automation features and AI features in that system to help us gain efficiencies.\"</li>\n<li>Trevor Romeo, William Blair: Queried internalized landfill volumes and integration teams. Coletta detailed ongoing internalization efforts and highlighted increased capabilities and best practices in integration.</li>\n<li>Adam Bubes, Goldman Sachs: Sought specifics on Mid-Atlantic margin changes and 2026 contribution. Helgeson said, \"Last year, the Mid-Atlantic...was a headwind of about 100 basis points. This quarter, it was 10 basis points.\"</li>\n<li>James Schumm, TD Cowen: Asked about Mid-Atlantic billing system timeline and Q4 revenue seasonality. Coletta projected full system integration by end of Q1 and clarified seasonality and acquisition impacts.</li>\n<li>William Grippin, Barclays: Sought view on Mid-Atlantic pricing post-integration. Coletta said, \"We've been doing more just blanket-based reasonable price increases...we've got to get into our tried and true tools.\"</li>\n<li>Shlomo Rosenbaum, Stifel: Discussed lessons from Mid-Atlantic integration. Coletta acknowledged, \"We made a bad decision...we left it on its billing system...but we're back to our core basics.\"</li>\n<li>Stephanie Moore, Jefferies: Asked about McKean facility investments and timing. Casella stated, \"The facility is up operational...it's probably Q2 '26 when we'll see -- begin to see a little bit of activity -- a little bit more activity.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts maintained a neutral to slightly positive tone, focusing on margin trajectory, integration timing, and operational improvements, with several congratulating leadership transitions and pressing for clarity on future synergies and margin expansion.</li>\n<li>Management was confident and transparent in addressing integration challenges, margin impacts from acquisitions, and growth opportunities, with Coletta and Helgeson both expressing optimism for continued margin expansion and integration progress.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, analyst sentiment was less concerned about Mid-Atlantic headwinds, while management showed increased confidence, demonstrated by more assertive forward-looking statements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul><li>Guidance language shifted to a more positive outlook, with upward revisions to revenue and EBITDA midpoints for 2025 and clear projections for 2026. Strategic focus remains on M&amp;A and integration efficiency, with more detailed discussion of operational improvements and systems upgrades. Analyst focus shifted from acute concern over Mid-Atlantic delays to interest in synergy realization and margin expansion. Key metrics such as revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow all showed notable increases over Q2, with management tone growing more confident and analysts acknowledging operational progress. Strategic priorities evolved to emphasize automation, system integration, and best practices in acquisition execution, with management expressing stronger confidence in achieving future targets.</li></ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul><li>Management cited challenges in the Mid-Atlantic integration, specifically delays in billing system consolidation and automation, but outlined mitigation strategies, including accelerated truck deliveries and system upgrades. Concerns were also raised about commodity price weakness in recycling, but contract structures helped limit impact. Future landfill capacity in the Northeast was discussed as both an opportunity and risk, with management expressing confidence in permitting progress and capacity expansion. Analysts flagged potential seasonality and acquisition-related revenue fluctuations, but management maintained that these were anticipated and manageable.</li></ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Casella Waste Systems delivered record revenue and adjusted EBITDA in Q3 2025, driven by solid pricing, strong landfill volumes, and ongoing acquisition activity. The company raised its 2025 revenue and EBITDA guidance midpoints and projects 7% to 8% revenue growth for 2026, with targeted margin expansion and robust free cash flow. Integration of recent acquisitions and operational improvements remain central, with leadership transitions set for year-end. Management expressed confidence in overcoming integration challenges and sustaining disciplined strategic growth, positioning Casella for continued value creation in the coming year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/cwst/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

Operating margins were 15.2%, and diluted EPS finished the quarter up $0.34 to $10.21.\"</li>\n<li>Merriwether noted the impact of tariffs and LIFO inventory valuation headwinds, stating, \"without this LIFO impact, our operating margin would have increased year-over-year in the period.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Merriwether detailed, \"we are narrowing our full year 2025 adjusted EPS outlook, which reflects slightly lower sales to account for the Cromwell divestiture updates and the impact of the government shutdown.\"</li>\n<li>The updated guidance includes \"daily organic constant currency sales growth of between 4.4% and 5.1% and a diluted adjusted EPS range of $39 to $39.75.\"</li>\n<li>She explained, \"October growth is off to a slow start of approximately 1% on a preliminary daily constant currency basis... if we just looked at the last 2 weeks of the month... sales are up in the 4% to 5% range.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Grainger reported $4.7 billion in sales for Q3, with operating cash flow at $597 million and $399 million returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.</li>\n<li>Operating margin was 15.2%.

Merriwether clarified, \"we stick to a longer range outlook of around 39% or around the area of 39%.\"</li>\n<li>Jacob Levinson, Melius Research: Inquired about switching from LIFO to FIFO. Macpherson explained, \"if you make that change, you end up having a cash payment... for the accumulated taxes you saved.\"</li>\n<li>Ryan Merkel, William Blair: Asked about government shutdown impact. Macpherson said, \"every day, 1 point or more impact on our total business.\"</li>\n<li>Sabrina Abrams, BofA: Probed LIFO timing and gross margin benefits. Merriwether explained, \"LIFO is really difficult to estimate... our team here was -- always continue to negotiate with suppliers.\"</li>\n<li>Thomas Moll, Stephens: Sought clarification on U.K. exit impact. Merriwether confirmed, \"$40 million is just tied to Q4. And the 20 basis points impact is for total company on an annualized basis.\"</li>\n<li>Patrick Baumann, JPMorgan: Asked about MRO market volume, Macpherson stated, \"market would have been down 2%.\" Merriwether noted, \"our return on invested capital is still north of 40%.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts were detailed, probing recurring themes of margin pressure, LIFO impacts, and the strategic exit from the U.K., with a neutral to slightly cautious tone when pressing on government shutdown effects and gross margin sustainability.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone in prepared remarks, focusing on execution and resilience. During Q&amp;A, responses were measured, with both Macpherson and Merriwether frequently reiterating stability in guidance and margin projections, using phrases such as \"we remain confident\" and \"we think it's the right thing to do.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, there was an increase in analyst focus on pricing actions, government shutdown effects, and LIFO accounting, while management's tone remained steady and focused on long-term fundamentals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The current quarter saw Grainger narrowing its full-year outlook due to the Cromwell divestiture and government shutdown, whereas last quarter's guide was reduced primarily for softer market and LIFO/tariff headwinds.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus shifted dramatically with the decision to exit the U.K. market this quarter, compared to last quarter's emphasis on pricing cycles and inventory valuation.</li>\n<li>Analysts repeatedly pressed for clarity on LIFO impact, price/cost dynamics, and the timing of price increases, reflecting heightened concern over external headwinds.</li>\n<li>Management's confidence in pricing actions and margin recovery was more pronounced, emphasizing the ability to pass through costs and stabilize at a 39% gross margin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management identified continued inflationary and tariff-related LIFO headwinds as persisting risks into 2026.</li>\n<li>The government shutdown is impacting public sector sales, with Macpherson indicating \"if it doesn't get resolved, it could become even bigger if it goes on a long time.\"</li>\n<li>Segment mix headwinds and competitive pressures, particularly in private label products, were cited as factors weighing on margins.</li>\n<li>The exit from the U.K. market introduces one-time impacts but is expected to improve profitability longer term.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Grainger’s third quarter was marked by strong execution, robust cash flow, and decisive strategic moves, notably the full exit from the U.K. market. Management narrowed its 2025 sales and EPS outlook to reflect these changes and ongoing government shutdown effects, but reiterated confidence in passing through inflationary costs and stabilizing margins. With a focus on North American and Japanese market expansion, technology-driven productivity, and a long-term gross margin target around 39%, the company expects to deliver continued value for shareholders despite near-term headwinds.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/gww/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Xenia Hotels &amp; Resorts (XHR) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Marcel Verbaas, Chairman and CEO, stated that \"our third quarter performance generally met the expectations we outlined during our second quarter earnings call,\" highlighting the ongoing challenges in leisure demand but emphasizing resilience from \"high-end positioning of our portfolio as well as unique internal growth drivers such as the continued ramp of Grand Hyatt Scottsdale Resort.\" He noted that group demand remains robust, with strong group room revenues already on the books for 2026.</p></li>\n<li><p>Verbaas announced a new partnership at W. Nashville: \"We are extremely excited about the upcoming relaunch of the food and beverage venues at W. Nashville that we announced in our release this morning.\" The company has reached an agreement with Jose Andres Group to operate and/or license almost all food and beverage venues at the hotel, projecting this will add between $3 million and $5 million to hotel EBITDA upon stabilization, ultimately aiming for the hotel to generate in excess of $20 million in hotel EBITDA over the next few years.</p></li>\n<li><p>Atish Shah, Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer, stated, \"At quarter end, we had approximately $1.4 billion of outstanding debt. About 1/4 of our debt was at variable rates and 3/4 of our debt was at fixed rates. Our weighted average interest rate at quarter end was 5.63%.\" He also mentioned, \"Our Board authorized a third quarter dividend of $0.14 per share. If annualized, this reflects over 4.5% yield on our current share price.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Shah provided guidance for the full year: \"We expect RevPAR growth of 4% at the midpoint.\" The midpoint for full year adjusted EBITDAre is now $254 million, reflecting a $2 million decrease from the previous guide, and adjusted FFO per diluted share guidance midpoint is now $1.72, a decrease of $0.01 versus prior guidance. Shah noted, \"Our current adjusted FFO per share guidance is 4% higher than our guide at the beginning of the year and 8% higher than our 2024 adjusted FFO per share.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Looking to 2026, Shah said, \"Pace continues to be healthy. As of the end of September, about 50% of our group rooms revenue for 2026 was definite. Pace for 2026 was up in the mid-teens percentage range.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>For the third quarter of 2025, Xenia reported a net loss of $13.7 million, adjusted EBITDAre of $42.2 million, and adjusted FFO per share of $0.23, representing an 8% decrease compared to the same quarter last year.</p></li>\n<li><p>Same-property RevPAR for the third quarter was flat year-over-year for the 30-hotel portfolio, with occupancy down 100 basis points and average daily rate up 1.6%. Excluding Houston assets, same-property RevPAR increased by 2.9%.</p></li>\n<li><p>Third quarter same-property hotel EBITDA was $47 million, a 0.7% increase from 2024, but margin decreased 60 basis points. Excluding Grand Hyatt Scottsdale, hotel EBITDA declined 7.8% and margin declined 160 basis points.</p></li>\n<li><p>Third quarter same-property total RevPAR increased by 3.7% year-over-year, attributed mainly to strong growth at Grand Hyatt Scottsdale and outperformance in banquet and catering revenues.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Michael Bellisario, Robert W. Baird: Asked about dividend payout relative to taxable income. Shah responded, \"We continue to utilize NOLs that we generated coming off of COVID. So we're finding the balance of providing both a good payout relative to past levels as well as utilizing those NOLs.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Bellisario: Asked about group outlook. Barry Bloom, President &amp; COO, replied, \"It's a little more in volume, but rate growth is good. I mean, better rate growth than we've seen in the last year or 2.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Jackson Armstrong, Wells Fargo: Inquired about government shutdown impact and transaction market activity. Verbaas answered, \"It's been fairly limited within our portfolio... our exposure to that type of business is probably a little bit more limited.\" On transactions, \"share buybacks continue to look probably more attractive than acquisitions at this point... I wouldn't expect us to be really active on the acquisition side here in the very near future.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Aryeh Klein, BMO: Questioned Q4 softness. Shah said, \"It is certainly more on the transient side, a combination of leisure and business transient that we've nudged down our expectations ever so slightly.\" Klein also asked about W. Nashville F&amp;B changes. Verbaas replied, \"It's going to take a few years to get to that stabilized number... we've set our expectations now to say over the next several years, we expect to get kind of north of that $20 million number.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>David Katz, Jefferies: Sought insight on leisure weakness. Verbaas explained, \"There is still this normalization that was kind of going on from these kind of outsized levels of leisure travel that we saw over the last few years... we do think that leisure has probably kind of found more of its footing in our portfolio.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Austin Wurschmidt, KeyBanc: Asked about business transient and leisure expectations. Bloom highlighted \"Northern California and Santa Clara, in particular, are seeing significant corporate growth,\" and Verbaas noted, \"I do think that we could see that there certainly could be a scenario where leisure and business transient are more on par as it relates to what kind of growth we can see out of those segments.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Analysts expressed slightly negative to neutral sentiment, probing for details on payout ratios, group and leisure demand softness, and timeline for benefits from new initiatives. Questions were often linked to visibility concerns and the speed of normalization in key segments.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management maintained a neutral to slightly positive tone in prepared remarks, with confidence in group demand and the W. Nashville partnership, and used measured language during Q&amp;A, such as \"we expect,\" \"we continue to,\" and \"we are pleased.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone shifted from optimism about outperformance to a more cautious outlook, particularly regarding leisure softness and adjusted guidance. Analysts’ tone also reflected more concern about headwinds than in Q2.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Guidance for full year adjusted EBITDAre decreased slightly from $256 million (Q2) to $254 million (Q3), and RevPAR growth guidance was lowered from 4.5% to 4%. Adjusted FFO per share midpoint declined by $0.01.</p></li>\n<li><p>Strategic focus has shifted to executing the W. Nashville F&amp;B partnership and managing CapEx, with a $10 million increase in projected 2025 capital expenditures.</p></li>\n<li><p>Analysts in both quarters focused on group pace, capital allocation, and demand trends, but Q3 saw increased concern about leisure softness and normalization timelines.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management’s confidence in group demand and Grand Hyatt Scottsdale performance remains, but there was a more cautious tone on the recovery of leisure and business transient segments.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Management highlighted ongoing macroeconomic challenges, particularly in leisure demand, and the Houston market’s impact due to prior-year hurricane-related demand.</p></li>\n<li><p>Shah noted higher-than-planned CapEx due to additional projects and the W. Nashville F&amp;B overhaul, though the company expects to spend less on CapEx than forecast at the start of 2025.</p></li>\n<li><p>Exposure to government business and a potential prolonged shutdown is limited, but management acknowledged the risk if air travel disruptions occur.</p></li>\n<li><p>Analysts expressed concerns over the timeline for F&amp;B stabilization at W. Nashville and the sustainability of group and leisure trends.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Management underscored confidence in the company’s long-term prospects, emphasizing the new W. Nashville food and beverage partnership with Jose Andres Group as a driver for incremental hotel EBITDA, continued robust group demand, and a portfolio well positioned for future growth despite short-term softness in leisure and ongoing macroeconomic headwinds. The focus remains on executing capital projects, managing expenses, and capturing outsized gains from non-rooms revenue as market conditions stabilize.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/xhr/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",
