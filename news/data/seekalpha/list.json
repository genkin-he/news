Our margins improved sequentially quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. We had a great quarter as far as orders being booked,\" but clarified, \"the bottom line is we missed our guidance, and that falls on me as the CEO of the company.\"</li>\n<li>Mastrangelo indicated the company is expanding its installed base, now covering 20% of the United States with 20 projects, and targets reaching 25% coverage in the next few months, with international expansion into Germany and the U.K. planned.</li>\n<li>He emphasized, \"on the bottom, yes, 7x year-over-year growth on revenue, combined with our highest cash position that we've had in the company's history, along with closing the gap and moving towards profitability, we've removed the going concern language inside of our 10-K filing.\"</li>\n<li>The launch of the Indensity product was announced, described as an evolution of existing technology focused on easier operation, serviceability, and manufacturing.</li>\n<li>COO John Mehas stated, \"Q4 was my first full quarter at Eos... we completed our subassembly automation, making our battery line fully automated. We closed 2025 with production records across all operations and delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of record revenue.\"</li>\n<li>Mehas acknowledged, \"we fell short of our operational targets, and that's on me,\" citing supplier nonperformance, automation quality issues, and higher-than-expected downtime as key challenges now being addressed.</li>\n<li>Interim CFO &amp; Chief Commercial Officer Nathan Kroeker reported, \"we ended the quarter with just over $701 million in backlog, booking nearly 1.1 gigawatt hours across 8 customers and 9 individual projects, representing a 9% sequential increase. During the quarter, we secured more than $240 million in new orders.\"</li>\n<li>Kroeker added, \"we ended the year with just under $625 million worth of cash on the balance sheet, the strongest cash position in the company's history.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Mastrangelo stated, \"Let me wrap up with our outlook on 2026 as we initiate guidance on revenue. You can see the progression of our guidance from 7x. If you take the midpoint of the guidance range in 2026, it's 3x what we did in 2025.\"</li>\n<li>The revenue guidance for 2026 is set at a range of $300 million to $400 million, with the lower end supported by backlog and the upper range dependent on larger project approvals and Indensity shipments in the latter half of the year.</li>\n<li>Mastrangelo explained, \"we feel very confident on the guide that we're giving on the range of $300 million to $400 million.\"</li>\n<li>He also noted, \"we will be gross margin positive in the second half of 2026.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Kroeker reported, \"in the fourth quarter, we generated $58 million in revenue, nearly double Q3. We exceeded the combined revenue of the first 3 quarters of 2025 as well as all prior year revenue combined since the company went public.\"</li>\n<li>Full year revenue was $114.2 million, described as \"more than 7x year-over-year growth.\"</li>\n<li>Full year gross loss was $143.8 million, with adjusted gross loss at $128.5 million. Operating expenses totaled $115.4 million, with noncash items making up $25 million.</li>\n<li>Net loss for the year was $969.6 million, including $746.8 million of noncash impacts primarily from mark-to-market revaluations due to the company's stock price increase.</li>\n<li>Adjusted EBITDA loss was $219.1 million, with margin improvement noted.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stephen Gengaro, Stifel: Asked about guidance credibility and risk controls after missing Q4 guidance. Mastrangelo replied, \"we tried to really look at how we can change our discipline as a company to not have happened what happened in 2025.\"</li>\n<li>Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Jefferies: Inquired about the specifics behind larger projects and backlog duration. Mastrangelo pointed to NYSERDA projects and PJM initiatives, but stressed \"approvals and queues are long.\"</li>\n<li>Dumoulin-Smith also asked about defense sector opportunities, to which Mastrangelo responded that the company is working through government processes and requirements, leveraging its American-made product.</li>\n<li>Mark Strouse, JPMorgan: Asked about the competitive landscape. Mastrangelo said, \"there's many different use cases,\" emphasizing Eos' competitive positioning for 4- to 16-hour storage and recent pipeline growth.</li>\n<li>Craig Shere, Tuohy Brothers: Queried about international margins and cash flow. Mastrangelo said, \"where we're seeing interest in our product internationally has less to do with politics and more to do with performance,\" and did not expect lower margins internationally.</li>\n<li>Jeffrey Osborne, TD Cowen: Asked about production yields and field reliability. Mehas replied, \"the goal for that automation is 97% first pass yield, and we're well on our way there.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts expressed skepticism regarding guidance reliability and questioned the company's ability to deliver on ambitious revenue targets, often pressing for specifics and risk mitigation strategies.</li>\n<li>Management's tone in prepared remarks was confident and forward-looking, emphasizing improvement and operational discipline, but shifted to a more defensive posture during Q&amp;A, acknowledging past guidance misses and operational setbacks. Mastrangelo used phrases such as \"we feel very confident\" and \"we are focused on being good stewards of that capital.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, analyst questioning was more pointed, and management appeared more cautious in its outlook and explanations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance shifted from reiterating $150 million to $160 million revenue for full-year 2025 in Q3, to projecting $300 million to $400 million for 2026.</li>\n<li>Operational focus evolved from ramping initial automation and capacity in Q3 to addressing explicit execution shortfalls and planning redundancy and process improvements in Q4.</li>\n<li>Analysts became more focused on risk, execution discipline, and margin evolution, compared to a previous emphasis on pipeline and growth.</li>\n<li>Management's confidence level, while still present, was more tempered as they acknowledged missing Q4 guidance and detailed steps to improve execution reliability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Supplier nonperformance, automation quality issues, and excessive downtime were cited as major operational risks that impacted Q4 results.</li>\n<li>Management is implementing better supplier controls, tooling improvements, and process changes to address these risks.</li>\n<li>The lack of manufacturing redundancy remains a key risk until Line 2 is operational.</li>\n<li>Revenue concentration and the timing of large project approvals present ongoing challenges for achieving top-end guidance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Eos Energy management emphasized that while the company delivered record revenue growth and strengthened its cash position in 2025, execution challenges led to a miss in guidance. With a renewed focus on operational improvements, automation, and disciplined expansion, the company has set a 2026 revenue target of $300 million to $400 million and expects to achieve gross margin positivity in the second half of the year. Management underscored ongoing efforts to build long-term value through scalable technology, robust backlog, and prudent cash management, while recognizing the need for continued operational discipline to meet evolving market demands and investor expectations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/eose/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

He stated, \"Our current new product pipeline is as strong as it's ever been with a growing mix of opportunities involving complex electronic solutions, an area where we believe we have a distinct competitive advantage.\"</li>\n<li>Olsen highlighted operational advances: \"We advanced productivity across the organization, including deploying new automation technologies in our distribution centers. These initiatives improved service levels for customers, enhanced availability for end users and generated tangible savings.\"</li>\n<li>On supply chain, Olsen noted a strategic reduction of sourcing from China to below 40% in 2025, with a target of approximately 30% in 2026: \"Strengthening supply chain resilience remains a key priority, and we continue to build deep strategic relationships with suppliers around the world.\"</li>\n<li>Channel expansion was emphasized, particularly with new business in heavy-duty and specialty vehicle segments.

Hession stated, \"Adjusted operating income was $93 million and flat compared to last year's fourth quarter.

Olsen responded, \"Our POS was up mid-single digit in the quarter, very similar to what we saw in the third quarter.\"</li>\n<li>Bret Jordan, Jefferies: Asked about inventory growth drivers. Olsen said, \"The largest proportion of inventory growth that you've seen really starting at midyear...is the higher tariff cost.\"</li>\n<li>Jeffrey Lick, Stephens: Sought clarity on drivers of anticipated sales acceleration. Olsen explained, \"We had one of our largest customers shift their order patterns in the fourth quarter...orders were down from that customer nearly 40% from the third quarter.

Leadership anticipates temporary margin pressure in early 2026 due to tariff impacts but expects profitability to improve as the year progresses. The company remains confident in its growth strategies across all segments, with ongoing investments in automation, product development, and targeted M&amp;A, while closely monitoring global trade uncertainties and customer ordering dynamics.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/dorm/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

Silvers announced significant portfolio expansion in championship golf courses and a major water park acquisition, emphasizing further diversification within the attraction sector. He noted, \"As we move into 2026, we expect to build on our strong industry relationships while substantially increasing our investment spending.\"</li>\n<li>Silvers underscored the company's capital recycling strategy: \"By executing targeted dispositions, we strengthened portfolio qualities, reduce concentration and unlock capital to deploy into higher returning experiential investments.\"</li>\n<li>The CEO also confirmed the successful closing of a $550 million public debt offering and establishment of a $400 million at-the-market equity program, which he described as \"2 significant capital market initiatives that bolster our financial flexibility and fund our growing investment pipeline.\"</li>\n<li>Silvers announced a \"5.1% increase to our monthly dividend to common shareholders.\"</li>\n<li>CFO Mark Peterson reported, \"FFO as adjusted for the quarter was $1.30 per share versus $1.23 in the prior year, an increase of 5.7%.

He added, \"We expect a similar percentage increase in AFFO per share.\"</li>\n<li>Investment spending guidance for 2026 was set at $400 million to $500 million, with disposition guidance for the same period at $25 million to $75 million.</li>\n<li>Peterson clarified, \"We expect percentage rent and participating interest of $18.5 million to $22.5 million.\"</li>\n<li>Management noted the first quarter of 2026 is expected to be lower than the full year divided by four by about $0.11 per share due to seasonality.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Total revenue for Q4 was $183 million compared to $177.2 million in the prior year, with rental revenue increasing $7.9 million year-over-year.</li>\n<li>FFO as adjusted for the full year was $5.12 per share, up from $4.87 in the prior year, and AFFO was $5.14 per share compared to $4.84.</li>\n<li>Disposition proceeds totaled $34.5 million for the quarter and $168.3 million for the year, with gains on sales recognized both quarterly and annually.</li>\n<li>The company closed on $550 million of new 5-year senior unsecured notes at a coupon of 4.75% and had $90.6 million of cash on hand at year-end.</li>\n<li>AFFO payout ratio for the quarter and year was 68%.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Michael Goldsmith, UBS: Asked about the confidence in achieving $400 million to $500 million in acquisitions. Silvers responded, \"We wouldn't put it out there if we didn't have great confidence in it... we feel really good about where we're positioning for the beginning of the year.\"</li>\n<li>Goldsmith also questioned the Topgolf transaction's impact. Silvers replied, \"They're very much aligned with what we have said that the growth pattern needs to slow down to 3 to 5 units a year where they can hit kind of the demographic and location requirements that we kind of agree with them.\"</li>\n<li>John Kilichowski, Wells Fargo: Inquired about cost of capital and conditions for tapping the ATM. Silvers indicated, \"We are clearly entering the zone where it makes sense... maybe we could even further delever.\"</li>\n<li>Bennett Rose, Citi: Sought updates on Sullivan County and theme park management changes. Silvers stated, \"We've not had really any meaningful conversations with them... it's not built into our plan.\" On theme parks, he said, \"We think that business is actually very, very... stable cash cow kind of business.\"</li>\n<li>Anthony Paolone, JPMorgan: Asked about development versus acquisitions and cap rates.

Silvers answered, \"It's actually... weighted more towards the first half of the year,\" and expects percentage rents \"up 2% over where they were last year.\"</li>\n<li>Upal Rana, KeyBanc: Asked about the transaction market and upcoming labor negotiations. Silvers commented, \"We're seeing our ability to participate in larger deals more,\" and on labor, \"everybody is saying the right thing about wanting to avoid\" strikes.</li>\n<li>Jana Galan, BofA: Queried the education portfolio. Silvers noted, \"The strength of that will allow us to capture good value if we want to do that and could be another lever that we pull to accelerate growth.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts focused on the sustainability of acquisition targets, cost of capital, tenant performance, and transaction pipeline, maintaining a neutral to slightly positive tone, with questions centering on execution confidence and sector trends.</li>\n<li>Management consistently expressed confidence in guidance and strategic direction, with Silvers stating, \"We feel really good about where we're positioning for the beginning of the year,\" but occasionally hedged with phrases like \"we think\" and \"we hope,\" indicating a disciplined but optimistic outlook.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management maintained a similar tone, though management’s confidence in accelerated investment and portfolio diversification was more pronounced.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance for FFO as adjusted per share increased from the prior quarter’s range of $5.05 to $5.13 to a 2026 range of $5.28 to $5.48, with the midpoint growth rate rising from 4.5% to 5.1%.</li>\n<li>Investment spending guidance shifted from $225 million to $275 million for 2025 to $400 million to $500 million for 2026, reflecting a substantial planned increase.</li>\n<li>Disposition guidance narrowed from $150 million to $160 million to $25 million to $75 million, indicating a reduction in anticipated asset sales.</li>\n<li>Portfolio diversification advanced, with new acquisitions in golf and water parks, and increased emphasis on fitness and wellness sectors, compared to a Q3 focus on hot springs and fitness.</li>\n<li>Management’s tone was more confident regarding access to larger transactions and capital flexibility, while analysts maintained a cautious but inquisitive approach.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management highlighted macro pressures on consumers and expense increases, as well as potential labor negotiations in the broader entertainment sector.</li>\n<li>The company is ceasing its practice of providing annual box office estimates, suggesting perceived stabilization but also reducing forward-looking granularity.</li>\n<li>Silvers addressed asset-specific uncertainty, such as the lack of progress on the Sullivan County ground lease sale, and acknowledged the possibility of using the education portfolio as a lever for future growth.</li>\n<li>Analysts probed cost of capital sensitivity, tenant performance, and the impact of major tenant transactions, indicating ongoing concern about market dynamics and execution risk.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>EPR Properties concluded the year with strong growth in per share earnings, expanded its experiential portfolio through key acquisitions, and bolstered its balance sheet with successful capital market initiatives. The company enters 2026 with a robust investment pipeline, clear guidance for increased investment spending, and leadership transitions designed to support continued growth and diversification in the experiential real estate sector.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/epr/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
