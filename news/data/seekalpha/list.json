While Anthropic’s new AI tool threatens to steal a chunk of IBM’s $21.1B consulting revenue by automating the mapping of old COBOL code, it doesn’t look like this translated code will be able to run outside the mainframe or that someone will try to risk it and transition to the cloud. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>With features like internal redundancy and shared-everything memory, the z17 mainframe remains the only machine banks trust for zero-downtime transactions. Financially, IBM is a “cash cow” with a record $14.7B in free cash flow, but with $61.3B in debt and a modest 5% growth forecast, the jury is still out on whether its $12.5B GenAI business can progress fast enough to keep Anthropic away. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/the-techie\"><span>The Techie</span></a><span>: The market's visceral reaction to IBM (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM\" title=\"International Business Machines Corporation\">IBM</a>) this week is a classic case of shooting first and asking questions later, triggered by the realization that AI is accelerating faster than even the most aggressive forecasts. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>I don’t think the sudden panic over Anthropic’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANTHRO\" title=\"Anthropic\">ANTHRO</a>) ability to automate COBOL modernization is an overnight kill switch for a company deeply embedded in global financial infrastructure. Instead, it serves as a wake-up call that the traditional high-margin consulting model is being permanently repriced. IBM isn't necessarily obsolete, but it is now in a high-stakes race to prove it can be the architect of this new automated world rather than its first major casualty.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The most important trend for the rest of 2026 is the democratization of software. As tools like Anthropic’s Claude Code become more capable, the moat for legacy software companies is shrinking. We are moving into an era where the value isn't in writing the code but in owning the data and the client relationship.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/joseph-parrish\"><span>Joseph Parrish</span></a><span>: IBM (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM\" title=\"International Business Machines Corporation\">IBM</a>) will continue to innovate, which recent years have already proved. Generating $15B in cash now, they can just buy back shares easily on the downside. I don't give much credence to speculative AI doom and gloom.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>IBM works with big customers who are risk-averse and will not lightly drop a working product. Anthropic (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANTHRO\" title=\"Anthropic\">ANTHRO</a>) merely highlights the same path that IBM can take as they are already evolving their own products with AI.</span><strong></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/screeners/9409aed046-Top-IT-Consulting-and-Other-Services-Stocks\"><span>Top IT Consulting &amp; Other Services Stocks</span></a></li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/screeners/9409aed042-Top-Systems-Software-Stocks\"><span>Top Systems Software Stocks</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\"><span>When oil markets resume trading next week, there could be major price swings as traders assess how the ongoing attacks from the U.S. and Israel on Iran are impacting Iranian oil infrastructure and global oil supply.</span></p>\n<p><span>Scenarios before the latest conflict with Iran foresaw a quick price spike that fades if the attacks didn't affect oil shipping and infrastructure such as Iranian pipelines and its Kharg island terminal. However, there would be a bigger price spike and longer-lasting impact if oil infrastructure or supplies were interrupted, for instance because of disruption of tanker traffic through the Strait of Hormuz.</span></p>\n<p><span>Oil prices have already risen on war fears. International benchmark Brent crude closed at a seven-month high of $72.87 on Friday.</span></p>\n<p><span>Iran exports some 1.6 million barrels of oil a day, most of it going to China, where privately owned refineries are less concerned about the U.S. sanctions that prevent Iran from selling its oil elsewhere. If that supply is disrupted, Chinese customers would look elsewhere for oil on the global market, potentially driving up prices.</span></p>\n<p><span>Another question is around the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of global oil supply pass through each day. Middle East exporters Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates send most of their exports through the strait. However analysts say Iran has no incentive to try to close the strait because it would cut off its own exports and hurt its only big customer, China.</span></p>\n<p><span>Limited strikes on Iran’s nuclear program and the Revolutionary Guard that avoid regime change or all-out war could see prices jump $5-$10 based on fear alone, according to Rystad Energy in a prewar scenario.</span></p>\n<p><span>A wider war involving Iranian disruption of tanker traffic could see crude push past $90 per barrel and US gas prices “well above” $3 per gallon, according to another prewar scenario from Clayton Seigle at the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies. U.S. gas prices averaged $2.98 per gallon last week, according to U.S. motoring club AAA.</span></p>\n<p><span>Related tickers: (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CO1:COM\" title=\"Brent Futures\">CO1:COM</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CL1:COM\" title=\"Crude Oil Futures\">CL1:COM</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NG1:COM\" title=\"Natural Gas Futures\">NG1:COM</a>), (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USO\" title=\"United States Oil Fund LP ETF\">USO</a></span></span>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BNO\" title=\"United States Brent Oil Fund LP ETF\">BNO</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UCO\" title=\"ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil ETF\">UCO</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCO\" title=\"ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil ETF\">SCO</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USL\" title=\"United States 12 Month Oil Fund LP ETF\">USL</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DBO\" title=\"Invesco DB Oil Fund ETF\">DBO</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DRIP\" title=\"Direxion Daily S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Exp &amp; Prod Br 2X Shs ETF\">DRIP</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GUSH\" title=\"Direxion Daily S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Exp &amp; Prod Bl 2X Shs ETF\">GUSH</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USOI\" title=\"UBS ETRACS Crude Oil Shares Covered Call ETN\">USOI</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UNG\" title=\"United States Natural Gas Fund LP ETF\">UNG</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BOIL\" title=\"ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Natural Gas ETF\">BOIL</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UNL\" title=\"United States 12 Month Natural Gas Fund LP ETF\">UNL</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FCG\" title=\"First Trust Natural Gas ETF\">FCG</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLE\" title=\"State Street Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF\">XLE</a>)</span></p>\n<p><em>The Associated Press contributed to this report.<span></span></em></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
