            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: PubMatic (PUBM) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Rajeev Goel stated that PubMatic delivered \"an exceptionally strong fourth quarter, with revenue and adjusted EBITDA ahead of guidance, healthy margins and strong cash flow.\" Goel highlighted that the company's CTV revenue grew over 50% year-over-year, excluding political, and that Activate activity grew over three times. Emerging revenues, including Activate, commerce media, and new AI solutions, nearly doubled over 2024 and now comprise nearly 10% of total revenues. Goel emphasized PubMatic's leadership in AI solutions and projected accelerated double-digit percentage growth for the second half of 2026. </li>\n<li>Goel announced the launch of AgenticOS and noted: \"By 2028, I expect 25% of all digital advertising to be executed autonomously via agentic AI. And by 2030, I expect that to jump to 50%.\" He also referenced the company’s partnerships and new product launches, including a partnership with NVIDIA and the rollout of AI Insights for publishers.</li>\n<li>Goel underlined the company’s progress in DSP diversification, saying PubMatic integrated 50 new DSP partners and grew its buyer-focused go-to-market team by nearly 20% year-over-year. The company now partners with 28 of the top 30 global streamers, and its OpenWrap SDK is integrated with Google AdMob and Google Ad Manager for mobile app.</li>\n<li>CFO Steven Pantelick stated, \"Q4 was a pivotal turning point for us, as we significantly exceeded expectations on both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Adjusting for political revenues and revenues derived from the legacy DSP referenced mid last year, the remainder of our business, which represented 83% of revenue in Q4, grew 18% year-over-year.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Pantelick reported that January revenues were in line with expectations and ad spending was healthy. PubMatic expects Q1 revenue to be in the range of $58 million to $60 million, and Q1 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between (-$0.5 million) and $1 million. \"We expect to return to double-digit revenue growth in the second half of this year, with a corresponding expansion of our margins from revenue growth, supported by disciplined investment and increased efficiencies from AI,\" Pantelick said.</li>\n<li>Full-year cost of revenue is expected to marginally increase in the low single digits, primarily due to industry-wide utility cost pass-throughs from data center providers, while full-year operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid-single-digit percentages. Pantelick explained, \"Full-year CapEx is projected to be approximately $15 million to $19 million and reflects a shift away from investments for increased ad impression capacity and instead towards expanding support for AI workloads.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Pantelick reported, \"Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $27.8 million or 35% margin, which included a foreign exchange impact of approximately $0.5 million due to the weakening U.S. dollar over the quarter. Q4 GAAP net income was $6.7 million, or $0.14 per diluted share.\"</li>\n<li>The company generated $81 million in net operating cash flows in 2025, up 10% over 2024, and delivered free cash flow of $46 million, a 32% increase over last year. Cash and equivalents stood at $145.5 million with zero debt at quarter-end.</li>\n<li>Emerging revenue streams in Q4 grew over 75% year-over-year and represented roughly 12% of total revenues. Pantelick stated, \"In just a few months, nearly 10% of publishers on our platform are now deriving revenue from our AI solutions and generating incremental revenue for PubMatic.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Shweta Khajuria, Wolfe Research, LLC: Asked about the Amazon partnership. Goel explained, \"We're 1 of 3 SSPs in their Certified Supply Exchange program...it exceeded the targets that we laid out in 2025, and we're excited about the growth opportunity for that in 2026.\"</li>\n<li>Matthew Condon, Citizens JMP Securities, LLC: Asked about PubMatic’s differentiators in the AI-driven ad landscape. Goel responded, \"We are uniquely positioned to win in this arena for a few reasons. So, first is that we have a significant advantage with respect to deep customer integrations...Second, with Activate, buyers can now buy directly in our SSP...Third is that we've launched AgenticOS...And then fourth, we have purpose-built AI infrastructure.\"</li>\n<li>Barton Crockett, Rosenblatt Securities Inc.: Asked about long-term agentic AI adoption. Goel affirmed, \"...I do think, as I mentioned earlier, this is going to be not just technology, but a value chain disruptor.\"</li>\n<li>Robert Coolbrith, Evercore ISI: Asked about drivers of upside in the quarter. Pantelick highlighted, \"We saw strong growth in emerging revenues, which grew over 75% in the fourth quarter year-over-year. We saw mobile app accelerate to 25% growth. And we saw CTV continue to perform double-digit rates.\"</li>\n<li>Matthew Swanson, RBC Capital Markets, Research Division: Inquired about DSP diversification. Goel stated, \"We've made tremendous headway in expanding our DSP mix...there's a lot of opportunity, and we have a really robust road map going after this group of DSPs.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analyst tone was positive to slightly cautious, with a focus on understanding strategic differentiation, AI monetization, and DSP diversification. Questions reflected optimism about the company’s innovation while probing for the durability of growth and execution on new initiatives.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone in both prepared remarks and Q&amp;A, with repeated references to exceeding expectations, robust growth areas, and early leadership in AI. Goel consistently emphasized, \"We are uniquely positioned\" and Pantelick referenced \"pivotal turning point\" and \"multi-year innovation road map.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to Q3, management’s tone strengthened, shifting from expectation-setting to highlighting tangible execution and early wins in agentic AI and emerging revenue streams. Analyst sentiment also improved, with more questions about scaling and monetization versus fundamental risks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Q4 guidance and commentary signaled a shift from cautious growth to a more assertive outlook, with explicit forecasts for double-digit revenue growth in the second half of 2026 and expanded AI-related revenue.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus evolved from initial AI adoption and infrastructure investment in Q3 to direct monetization and rapid scaling of agentic AI and Activate in Q4.</li>\n<li>Key metrics improved: Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin of 35% versus 16% in Q3; net operating cash flows rose to $81 million; free cash flow increased 32% year-over-year.</li>\n<li>Management's confidence increased, emphasizing structural inflection points, accelerated growth, and emerging revenue streams outpacing market rates.</li>\n<li>Analyst focus in Q4 shifted toward AI-driven differentiation, revenue scaling, and DSP diversification, compared to Q3’s questions on stabilization and infrastructure differentiation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management noted continued headwinds from a large legacy DSP, with Pantelick stating, \"The big headwind that we're working through is what we called out mid last year is the large legacy DSP.\"</li>\n<li>Pantelick addressed industry-wide utility cost pass-throughs as a factor in rising cost of revenue, with efforts underway to offset these costs via efficiency initiatives.</li>\n<li>Potential impact from regulatory or legal outcomes was discussed, including ongoing litigation against Google and uncertainty around the Google DOJ case. Goel stated, \"We, like you are waiting for the court's verdict in terms of remedies...none of that potential tailwind is included in the forward outlook.\"</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about channel shifts due to LLM models and AI search; Goel indicated limited impact to current revenue streams.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>PubMatic management emphasized that the company has entered 2026 with a stronger revenue mix, improved cost structure, and expects to return to double-digit revenue growth in the second half of the year. Early adoption and scaling of agentic AI, robust CTV and mobile growth, and disciplined expense management have positioned PubMatic for durable long-term shareholder value, with AI innovations expected to drive both revenue and operational efficiencies as the company leads the transformation in digital advertising.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/pubm/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

There was also a shift in production to meet higher electrolyte demand for Eos.</li>\n<li>The global calcium chloride business achieved record revenue and adjusted EBITDA, with the Tech Grade product for chip manufacturing growing 144% year-over-year.</li>\n<li>Murphy outlined significant milestones, including completion of Phase 1 construction at the Evergreen bromine plant, a new strategic partnership with Magrathea for magnesium production, and renewed focus on lithium extraction due to increasing prices.</li>\n<li>The company received a patent for its TETRA oasis desalination solution and noted a shift in customer plans from 25,000 to 100,000+ barrel per day desalination plants, particularly for data center cooling in West Texas.</li>\n<li>Argentina operations are expected to double revenue in 2026 over 2025, driven by new contracts and SandStorm technology.</li>\n<li>Murphy announced the retirement of CFO Elijio Serrano and the transition to Matt Sanderson as CFO, ensuring continuity in financial leadership.</li>\n<li>CFO Elijio Serrano stated, \"Cash flow from the base business in the fourth quarter was very solid at $21.8 million. For the year, free cash flow from the base business was $83 million.\"</li>\n<li>Serrano also shared, \"We ended the year with cash on hand of $73 million, double where we started the year at. Net debt is $109 million, down from $143 million at the end of '24.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Murphy projected incremental revenue growth in 2026, mainly from increased electrolyte business and major contract awards in Argentina, with expectations that Argentina revenue will double.</li>\n<li>On Completion Fluids, Murphy noted, \"2026 activity is forecasted to be higher in drilling, including more exploration with less completion activity. As a result, we do not expect the Gulf of America to reach the same record levels as in 2025.\"</li>\n<li>Guidance for Completion Fluids &amp; Products' adjusted EBITDA margins is 25% to 30% for 2026, citing increased costs from third-party bromine supplies until the new plant is operational.</li>\n<li>Water &amp; Flowback Services adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to improve from 12% in 2025 to the mid-teens in 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Completion Fluids &amp; Products revenue for Q4 was $83.7 million, up 22% year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA margins at 28.2%.</li>\n<li>Water &amp; Flowback Services revenue was $63 million, flat sequentially, while Argentina activity increased.</li>\n<li>Corporate and other expenses were $11.3 million, including higher variable compensation due to the record performance.</li>\n<li>Consolidated TETRA free cash flow, including Arkansas investments, was $33 million for 2025.</li>\n<li>Days sales outstanding improved from 71 at the end of 2024 to 62 at the end of 2025.</li>\n<li>Tax loss carryforward stands at approximately $84 million, which can offset up to $300 million of taxable income in the U.S.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stephen Gengaro, Stifel, asked about deepwater market evolution and margin progression.

Murphy explained, \"We're hopeful that one of these data center desalination projects will materialize in the first half of this year...it does hopefully set us up for a first revenue of a large facility sometime in 2027.\"</li>\n<li>On accelerating the bromine plant, Murphy said, \"We're not slowing the pace of this project by any means to try to pace it with cash flow funding. We are moving as quickly as we can.\"</li>\n<li>Robert Brooks, Northland, sought clarity on modularity of desalination plants. Murphy explained economies of scale favor a single larger facility.</li>\n<li>Brooks also asked about U.S. Water &amp; Flowback outperformance; Murphy indicated SandStorm technology and Argentina growth would drive margin improvement.</li>\n<li>Jonathan Tanwanteng, CJS, asked about third-party bromine supply. Murphy clarified, \"There's no issue with the long-term contract...we are definitely securing third-party supply well above now the long-term contract.\"</li>\n<li>On potential supply shortfalls, Murphy said, \"We have secured -- contractually secured well what we need for 2026.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed for clarity on margin sustainability, timing of contract wins, and supply chain security, showing a neutral to slightly positive tone while probing for downside risks.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone in prepared remarks, using phrases like \"we are very well positioned\" and \"we feel very well positioned to benefit from the multiyear deepwater activity recovery.\"</li>\n<li>In the Q&amp;A, management continued to show confidence but acknowledged near-term margin pressures and cost increases, especially for bromine. Murphy often reaffirmed guidance ranges and strategic direction.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, sentiment remains optimistic but slightly more cautious regarding margin and supply chain headwinds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The company reiterated its One TETRA 2030 strategy, but now projects reaching 75 million pounds of bromine plant capacity by 2029, up from the 48 million pound estimate in the prior definitive feasibility study.</li>\n<li>There is a notable shift in desalination plant customer interest, moving from 25,000 to 100,000+ barrel per day facilities.</li>\n<li>The previous quarter highlighted ongoing cost controls and achieving record revenue/EBITDA despite a lower rig count, while the current quarter focuses more on execution and supply chain, especially with bromine and electrolyte growth.</li>\n<li>Management's tone is steady, but there is more emphasis on securing supply and bridging costs until new capacity comes online.</li>\n<li>Analysts continue to focus on margin sustainability and contract timing, but with heightened attention to supply constraints and project execution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited higher short-term costs for third-party bromine supply until the new Arkansas plant is operational.</li>\n<li>Margin pressure in Completion Fluids &amp; Products is expected until 2028.</li>\n<li>Potential delays in large desalination projects due to engineering and multi-party coordination.</li>\n<li>The company acknowledged the need to secure additional bromine supply in the open market through 2027.</li>\n<li>Management noted competitive pricing in U.S. Water &amp; Flowback but expects technology and international growth to offset.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>TETRA Technologies delivered record revenue and EBITDA in 2025, driven by Gulf of America completion fluids, West Memphis plant output, and global calcium chloride growth, while achieving major milestones in bromine plant construction and desalination technology. The company anticipates incremental revenue growth in 2026, led by electrolyte and Argentina contracts, but projects a moderation in Gulf of America completion activity. Margin pressures from higher bromine input costs are expected until the Arkansas plant is operational, with the company confident in its strategic direction and well-positioned to benefit from multi-year market trends as it advances toward 2030 objectives.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/tti/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Tutor Perini Corporation (TPC) Q4 2025 </p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Gary Smalley stated that \"Tutor Perini had a tremendous year in 2025, perhaps our best year ever. Our results were highlighted by a record $5.5 billion of revenue, a return to strong profitability that produced $4.29 of adjusted earnings per share, a fourth consecutive year of record operating cash flow with $748 million of cash that shattered last year's record.\" </li>\n<li>Smalley emphasized a \"sustained focus on cash, the return to profitability and providing ambitious yet reasonable earnings goals, all with the goal of significantly increasing short- and long-term shareholder value.\" He reported delivery on these priorities, citing \"unprecedented share price performance and record returns for our shareholders.\"</li>\n<li>The company ended 2025 with a backlog of $20.6 billion, up 10% year-over-year, driven by $7.4 billion in new awards and contract adjustments, including mega projects such as the Midtown bus terminal replacement in New York and the UCSF Benioff New Children's Hospital in California.</li>\n<li>Smalley highlighted that the Civil segment generated more than $2.8 billion in revenue, its highest ever, and noted that the Specialty Contractors segment returned to profitability ahead of expectations in the second half of 2025.</li>\n<li>The Board of Directors authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share and a $200 million share repurchase program, with another $0.06 dividend declared.</li>\n<li>CFO Ryan Soroka stated, \"we generated a new record operating cash flow of $748 million for the year, up 49% compared to the previous record of $504 million for 2024.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Smalley expressed that, \"we anticipate double-digit revenue growth and strong earnings in 2026 with even higher earnings expected in 2027, by which time newer large projects should be in the construction phase. For 2026, we expect adjusted EPS in the range of $4.90 to $5.30.\"</li>\n<li>Management expects continued strong operating cash generation in 2026 and beyond, driven mainly by project execution activities and anticipated resolution of remaining legacy disputes.</li>\n<li>The company expects \"a modest backlog reduction in the near term, followed by resumed backlog growth as we capture our share of major new projects.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Soroka reported, \"Revenue for 2025 was $5.5 billion, up 28% with the robust growth primarily due to the increased project execution activities on certain large newer civil and building segment projects in the Northeast, Hawaii and Guam.\"</li>\n<li>Civil segment revenue was $2.8 billion, up 34%, with operating income for the segment nearly tripling to $391 million from $138 million in 2024. Segment operating margin of 13.7% was within the expected range.</li>\n<li>Building segment operating income was $58 million, a reversal from a $24 million loss in 2024, with the margin improving to 3.1%.</li>\n<li>Specialty Contractors segment posted a slight operating loss of $7 million for 2025, a significant improvement from a $103 million loss in 2024. The segment returned to profitability in the second half.</li>\n<li>Net income attributable to Tutor Perini for 2025 was $80 million or $1.51 of GAAP EPS compared to a net loss of $164 million in 2024. Adjusted net income was $229 million or $4.29 per share, compared to an adjusted net loss of $124 million, or $(2.37) per share, in 2024.</li>\n<li>The company ended the year with cash and cash equivalents exceeding total debt by $327 million, compared to a $79 million net debt position at the end of 2024.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Steven Fisher, UBS: Asked about backlog coverage and seasonality in Q1. Smalley responded, \"first of all, we've got great visibility into the to the results for 2026 and really beyond. There's not much that has to happen for us to hit the numbers that we've represented... Q1 is usually light for us. It's typically the way it goes. It will be the same this year.\"</li>\n<li>Fisher also asked about expected lumpiness in backlog. Smalley indicated, \"our plan shows us a little north of where we are currently... it could be lumpier than it has been over the last couple of years where every quarter, we seem like we're hitting a new record. But the pipeline is rich.\"</li>\n<li>Alexander Rygiel, Texas Capital: Asked about improved contract terms. Smalley explained, \"Now what we've been able to do with the limited competition is to work with our customers... to drive better payment terms, better terms with respect to no damages for delay... I think what you'll see is less disputes as we go forward.\"</li>\n<li>Adam Thalhimer, Thompson, Davis: Asked about the negative impact to Civil in Q4 from a Canadian project. Smalley said, \"In Q4, I think it was $42 million, as I recall. And that's a consolidated joint venture.\"</li>\n<li>Liam Burke, B. Riley: Asked about resource constraints for larger projects. Soroka responded, \"we certainly haven't seen any of the constraints on resources... the majority of our labor is sourced from the union halls.\"</li>\n<li>Michael Dudas, Vertical Research: Asked about margin expectations for mega projects. Smalley stated, \"margin will only build over time, and that's probably with all segments as these 9 -- the big 9, as we'll say, continue to move into full production.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts expressed positive sentiment, congratulating management repeatedly and showing interest in guidance visibility, margin improvement, and backlog quality. Questions sought clarification but did not indicate skepticism or negativity.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone both in prepared remarks and responses. Smalley repeatedly emphasized visibility, strength of backlog, and margin improvements, and used phrases such as \"we feel good\" and \"we are confident.\"</li>\n<li>Both analysts and management displayed a similar or even more positive sentiment than in the previous quarter, with less focus on risk or caution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance for 2026 adjusted EPS was raised to $4.90 to $5.30, up from a 2025 range of $4 to $4.20.</li>\n<li>Backlog decreased slightly to $20.6 billion from a prior record of $21.6 billion, with management introducing the expectation of near-term lumpiness as opposed to consistent quarterly increases.</li>\n<li>Civil segment continued to drive growth, but Building and Specialty Contractors segments also improved, with the latter returning to profitability in the second half.</li>\n<li>Management's tone evolved to emphasize greater confidence and reduced focus on dispute resolutions, compared to the previous quarter's slightly more cautious outlook.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management noted the possibility of a \"lower-than-anticipated success rate for future project pursuits, the potential for project delays, slower ramp-ups for our newer projects and any unexpected settlements and/or adverse legal decisions associated with the resolution of disputes.\"</li>\n<li>Smalley highlighted contingency reserves for \"unknown or unexpected outcomes and developments in 2026.\"</li>\n<li>Analysts asked about resource constraints and legacy disputes, but management expressed confidence in mitigation strategies and ongoing progress in dispute resolution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Tutor Perini's management emphasized that 2025 marked a record year for revenue, earnings, and cash flow, with robust backlog providing strong visibility into sustained double-digit revenue growth and higher earnings for 2026 and beyond. Improvements in contract terms, reduced litigation risk, and margin expansion across all segments were highlighted as key drivers of performance, while contingency planning and a healthy balance sheet underpin continued confidence in the company's guidance and strategic direction.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/tpc/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
