Their inflation estimates have been terrible so far this year,\" he said in an interview on Fox Business's \"Mornings with Maria.\" \"Inflation keeps coming down.\"</p>\n<p>Bessent contends that the Fed's economic models are broken. \"And I'm just not sure what they're thinking here in terms of signaling that they may not want to cut rates at their December meeting,\" he said. At Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference after the FOMC meeting, he said a December rate cut is \"<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510526-another-rate-cut-in-december-is-not-a-foregone-conclusion-powell-says-at-press-conference\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"not a foregone conclusion\">not a foregone conclusion</a>\" due to the differing views of the committee's members and the halt of government data during the federal shutdown.</p>\n<p>To be sure, the most recent data shows inflation holding above the Fed's 2% goal.

As reported previously, the Treasury Secretary, who is leading the interview process for the next Fed chair, has narrowed the list of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4508484-bessent-unveils-fed-chair-finalists-before-year-end-decision\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"candidates to five people\">candidates to five people</a>. He expects to hold a second round of interviews in early December, and anticipates that President Donald Trump will choose a nominee by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>When asked how he assesses the current economy, given the lack of federal government data due to the shutdown, Bessent pivoted to his outlook for next year.</p>\n<p>\"I'm very optimistic for 2026, both in terms of growth and the inflation levels. I think we're going to go back to the same levels that we had under Trump's 1.0 where we had high growth and low inflation,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Trillions of dollars of investment are coming into the U.S., and productivity is increasing, he said. \"I think the job growth will rebound very strongly, and, more importantly, I think the real after-tax wages for working Americans are going to go up.\"</p>\n<p>He expects that Americans will see larger tax rebates next year due to tax policy changes, such as no tax on tips and overtime pay.</p>\n<p><strong>Dear readers: </strong>We recognize that politics often intersects with the financial news of the day, so we invite you to click<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831696-politics-and-the-markets-103025\" target=\"_blank\" title=\" here to join the separate political discussion.\"> here to join the separate political discussion.</a></p>\n</body></html>",

For Q2, sales are expected between $175 million to $185 million, with adjusted EBITDA margins ranging from 3% to 5%. Full-year adjusted EBITDA margin guidance remains 8% to 9%.</li>\n<li>Menneto reaffirmed, \"Our focus remains unchanged: protect dealer health, manage production with precision, and continue to push the pace of innovation and execute on our strategic growth priorities.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Beckman reported, \"Net sales increased 13.5% to $194.7 million, and unit volume increased 10.3% to 1,129 units.\"</li>\n<li>The Malibu and Axis brands represented approximately 47.7% of unit sales, Saltwater Fishing 25.5%, and Cobalt 26.8%.</li>\n<li>Consolidated net sales per unit increased 2.9% to $172,500 per unit.</li>\n<li>Gross profit fell to $27.9 million, with gross margin at 14.3%.

Adjusted net income per share was $0.15.</li>\n<li>Free cash flow for Q1 was $2.5 million, including $4.3 million in capital expenditures.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Martin Mitela, Raymond James: Asked about interest rates and their effect on consumer sentiment and mix. Menneto responded, \"Consumer gets encouraged, the dealer gets encouraged. But when you're looking at what will it do to retail finance rates, that will take a little bit of time to manifest itself into the marketplace.\"</li>\n<li>Mitela also queried higher dealer incentives for the Malibu brand. Beckman explained, \"We expect it to continue to be a competitive promotional environment, but not anything like we've seen here recently.\"</li>\n<li>Kevin Condon, Robert W. Baird: Asked about inventory management and retail decline shape. Beckman stated, \"We're expecting the markets to be down, and we're going to pace our production kind of in line with those expectations.\"</li>\n<li>Anna Glaessgen, B. Riley: Requested details on Q2 margin and inventory balancing. Beckman noted, \"There's a modest amount of deleverage that you can expect, and that's embedded in that guidance.\"</li>\n<li>Eric Wold, Texas Capital: Inquired about the MBI Acceptance rollout and discounting. Menneto said, \"We're excited about the overall adoption from our dealer base.\" Beckman added, \"It remains competitive. I mean it is still a soft retail environment.\"</li>\n<li>Noah Zatzkin, KeyBanc: Sought color on ASPs and M&amp;A strategy. Beckman pointed to \"modest year-over-year price increases,\" while Menneto confirmed, \"No changes on that front to announce there.\"</li>\n<li>Jaime Katz, Morningstar: Probed expense leverage and gross margin resilience. Beckman highlighted, \"To get real leverage, you have to see the markets turn… we are expecting higher margins in the second half embedded in our guidance.\"</li>\n<li>Michael Albanese, Benchmark: Asked about consumer behavior. Menneto responded, \"No change from what we were talking about earlier about where that cash buyer, payment buyer dynamic has landed over the last few quarters.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed on inventory, promotional activity, and the impact of interest rates, reflecting a slightly negative to neutral sentiment as they sought clarity on margin pressures and consumer trends.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and realistic tone, often referencing discipline and readiness—\"We remain focused on working closely with our dealer partners to support rightsized inventory levels,\" and \"We are confident in our ability to deliver on our strategic objectives.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone was similarly pragmatic and forward-looking, though current sentiment reflected slightly more optimism in the adoption of new financing programs and product launches.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance language and market expectations were consistent with the previous quarter, reiterating a mid- to high-single-digit market decline and flat to down sales outlook.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus remained on dealer health, inventory alignment, and innovation, with the new MBI Acceptance program as a notable addition.</li>\n<li>Analysts again focused on inventory, dealer incentives, and margin resilience, but current discussion included more detail on early results from new financing initiatives.</li>\n<li>Key metrics changed: net sales and unit volumes were lower than in Q4 2025, gross margin declined, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased slightly compared to Q1 of the previous year.</li>\n<li>Management’s confidence in innovation and retail tools was more pronounced this quarter, while analysts continued to express caution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited continued softness in retail demand and elevated inventories entering the quarter.</li>\n<li>Increased unit labor and material costs, along with higher dealer incentive costs, pressured gross margins.</li>\n<li>Tariff-related cost headwinds of 1.5% to 3% of cost of sales were incorporated into guidance, with active mitigation strategies through supply chain management and vertical integration.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about the competitive promotional environment, the timing and impact of interest rate changes, and the outlook for margin leverage in a declining market.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Malibu Boats, Inc. delivered a solid first quarter with revenue growth above expectations and maintained its fiscal 2026 guidance despite ongoing softness in the marine retail environment. The company highlighted continued innovation, disciplined management of dealer health, and early positive adoption of its new MBI Acceptance financing platform. Management remains committed to navigating near-term market headwinds and is confident in its strategic positioning for future growth as market conditions improve.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/mbuu/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

The company also slightly narrowed its adjusted earnings-per-share guidance to $25.00 to $25.75, from $24.50 to $25.75.</p>\n<p>Management characterized the revision as a reflection of “momentum” tempered by the pending sale of its U.K. Building Services unit.</p>\n<h3>Margins decline</h3>\n<p>Operating margins, dipped to 9.4% from 9.8% a year earlier, and selling, general and administrative expenses held steady at 10% of revenue even as total revenue surged. Depreciation and amortization costs also increased to $47.8 million from $34.5 million last year, reflecting heavier capital investment and integration of acquisitions such as Miller Electric Company, acquired earlier in 2025.</p>\n<h3>Earnings, revenue beat</h3>\n<p>Emcor (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EME\" title=\"EMCOR Group, Inc.\">EME</a>) posted third-quarter earnings of $6.57 a share, topping analysts’ forecasts of $6.53, while revenue rose 16.4% to $4.30 billion, above estimates of $4.28 billion. Net income climbed to $295.4 million, up from $270.3 million a year earlier.</p>\n<p>Operating income rose to $405.7 million, or 9.4% of revenue, though that margin slipped slightly from 9.8% a year ago. Earnings, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, known as ebitda, also increased year over year, reflecting robust project execution across multiple sectors.</p>\n<h3>Backlog and sector momentum</h3>\n<p>Emcor’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EME\" title=\"EMCOR Group, Inc.\">EME</a>) remaining performance obligations, a measure of future contracted work, climbed to a record $12.61 billion, up 29% from a year earlier. Growth was led by its network and communications, water and wastewater, institutional and industrial segments, offset partly by the completion of some large semiconductor projects.</p>\n</body></html>",

Conversely, CoStar Group (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSGP\" title=\"CoStar Group, Inc.\">CSGP</a></span>) and UnitedHealth Group (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UNH\" title=\"UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\">UNH</a></span>) face downgrades due to concerns over spending efficiency and a challenging market environment, respectively.</p>\n<h2>Upgrades</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>):</strong> Upgrade Hold to Buy by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835045-meta-buy-the-q3-earnings-dip-rating-upgrade\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Ahan Vashi\">Ahan Vashi</a>. Despite a significant one-time tax charge affecting Q3 earnings, the analyst sees strong core KPIs and a bullish outlook supported by technical and fundamental analysis.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“Considering Meta’s healthy business performance, reasonable valuation, and constructive technical setup, I am upgrading Meta back to a Buy rating in light of its Q3 2025 earnings dip. … Meta is potentially in the middle of a bullish Wave-5 move as per Elliott Wave Theory, with a target range of $850-1075 per share.”</em></p></blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mondelez International (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDLZ\" title=\"Mondelez International, Inc.\">MDLZ</a>):</strong> Upgrade Hold to Buy by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834762-mondelez-focusing-on-cocoa-deflation-after-weak-q3-rating-upgrade\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Caffital Research.\">Caffital Research.</a> The analyst expects earnings to rebound as cocoa prices begin to moderate, which should alleviate pressure on margins.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“Cocoa prices have started to moderate due to improved crops, setting up a gradual earnings recovery in the upcoming years. The stock now undervalues Mondelez’s normalized earnings potential, and as such, I upgrade my rating on MDLZ stock to Buy.”</em></p></blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Downgrades</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>CoStar Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSGP\" title=\"CoStar Group, Inc.\">CSGP</a>):</strong> Downgrade Buy to Hold by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834973-costar-sga-spend-isnt-delivering-enough-growth-downgrade\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Sandpiper Investment Research\">Sandpiper Investment Research</a>. The analyst expresses concerns about high SG&amp;A spending not delivering proportional growth and the company’s lofty valuation.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“Until management can meaningfully improve margins, get better returns on incremental SG&amp;A dollars spent to drive gross profit growth. CoStar just doesn’t deserve a $30+ billion market cap. ”</em></p></blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>UnitedHealth Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UNH\" title=\"UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\">UNH</a>): </strong>Downgrade Buy to Hold by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835128-unitedhealth-stock-q3-risk-reward-profile-signals-time-to-hold-not-buy-downgrade\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"StockBros Research\">StockBros Research</a>. While acknowledging good Q3 earnings, the analyst is cautious about ongoing profitability pressures and elevated valuations.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“Investors buying today can buy UNH at a reasonable price, but it still has to deal with elevated medical utilization, regulatory headwinds, and turnaround work at Optum. Despite the long-term picture still looking good, the urgency to add at these levels is gone.”</em></p></blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</body></html>",
