            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Phathom Pharmaceuticals (PHAT) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Steven Basta highlighted that \"we had a successful Q4. We delivered on expectations for both revenue and cash operating expense levels, coming in at the better end of our guided ranges.\" Basta explained that key steps were taken to enhance the capital structure, including reducing interest expense and modifying outstanding term loan obligations. The company believes that \"our cash on hand, along with anticipated future cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy all obligations under both our term debt and our revenue interest financing agreements.\"</li>\n<li>Basta indicated confidence in reaching operating profitability beginning in Q3 2026 and for the full year, with $320 million to $345 million revenue guidance for 2026. He added, \"Our sales organization is positioned to deliver, and we're seeing clear signs that our GI strategy is working.\"</li>\n<li>The CEO reported that over 1.1 million VOQUEZNA total prescriptions have been filled to more than 230,000 patients, and 273,000 prescriptions were filled in Q4 alone. Covered prescriptions grew 21% quarter-over-quarter to 174,000 in Q4.</li>\n<li>Basta emphasized recent capital structure improvements, including a successful equity offering in January and renegotiation of debt terms that extended the term loan maturity to February 2029 and reduced interest rates.</li>\n<li>CFO Sanjeev Narula stated, \"Our revenues for Q4 of $57.6 million were consistent with pre-release and demonstrated 16% sequential quarterly growth.\" Narula described the gross to net for Q4 as at the high end of the 55% to 60% range, with gross margin at approximately 87%. He added, \"After accounting for quarterly cash expenses, we reported a loss from operations, excluding stock-based compensation of approximately $320,000, a 95% improvement compared to Q3.\"</li>\n<li>Narula noted the completion of an oversubscribed equity offering in January, raising $130 million, and a term facility modification reducing principal to $175 million and lowering the interest rate from 12% to 9.85%.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Narula provided 2026 net revenue guidance of $320 million to $345 million, incorporating an accounting-related shift of $17 million to $20 million from gross to net adjustments to cost of goods sold. Gross margin for 2026 is anticipated at approximately 80%. Cash operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, are projected at $235 million to $255 million, reflecting a 14% decrease at midpoint versus 2025.</li>\n<li>Revenue is expected to follow a similar cadence to last year, with approximately 40% in the first half and 60% in the second half, and Q1 flagged as the slow quarter due to seasonality. Management anticipates achieving operational profitability, excluding stock-based compensation, by Q3 and for the full year 2026, and expects to achieve cash flow positivity in 2027.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Full year 2025 net revenues were $175.1 million, representing 217% year-over-year growth, with Q4 revenue of $57.6 million. Cash operating expenses for Q4 were $50.3 million, better than the less than $55 million target. Net cash usage for Q4 was approximately $5 million, down 64% from Q3.</li>\n<li>Full year cash operating expenses were approximately $284 million. The company ended 2025 with about $130 million in cash and cash equivalents, and following the term debt modification, cash on hand was approximately $190 million.</li>\n<li>Narula explained, \"Our financial profile has transitioned meaningfully, and I'm excited for this next phase.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Kristen Kluska, Cantor Fitzgerald: Asked about early signals from the strengthened sales force and strategy. Basta responded that the focus on the GI call point is key and \"we are seeing consistent signs of momentum,\" including an increase in adoption rates among gastroenterologists and a growth in the number of high-frequency writers.</li>\n<li>Annabel Samimy, Stifel: Inquired about patient transition to primary care and sales inflection points. Basta noted uplift in primary care prescribing and expects steady growth, stating, \"2026 is just going to be a year of heads down execution.\"</li>\n<li>Anthea Li, Jefferies: Asked about Q1 growth and Medicare coverage. Basta confirmed typical seasonality and no fundamental change in broad Medicare coverage, though incremental increases in covered Medicare scripts are occurring.</li>\n<li>Joseph Stringer, Needham: Asked about seasonality and IQVIA data. Basta said, \"We're not seeing anything that's unusual in that regard,\" highlighting expected seasonal patterns and the impact of winter storms.</li>\n<li>Daniel (for Paul Choi), Goldman Sachs: Queried on prescription channels. Basta explained that about half of prescriptions go through BlinkRx, with 36% as Blink dispensed cash scripts. GoodRx cash pay volumes are currently small.</li>\n<li>Chase Knickerbocker, Craig-Hallum: Asked about sales rep productivity. Basta estimated the company is in the \"seventh or eighth inning\" of the transition to full sales force effectiveness.</li>\n<li>Min Lee, Guggenheim: Asked about long-term vision beyond VOQUEZNA. Basta stated the only new active indication is EoE for VOQUEZNA, and the company is initiating business development activities to consider additional GI assets for future launches.</li>\n<li>Martin Auster, Raymond James: Asked about seasonality and gross to net trends. Basta expects some uptick in cash pay patients in Q1, while Narula anticipates gross to net to remain stable within the 55% to 59% guidance.</li>\n<li>Matthew Caufield, H.C. Wainwright: Asked about competition in the P-CAB space. Basta suggested a second entrant would likely grow overall category awareness rather than take share.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts expressed positive sentiment, frequently congratulating management on execution, revenue growth, and the strengthened balance sheet. Several analysts sought additional detail on growth drivers and the impact of strategic changes.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and upbeat tone in prepared remarks, using phrases such as \"we believe we've set ourselves up for success\" and \"we are seeing clear signs that our GI strategy is working.\" During Q&amp;A, management responses remained detailed and focused on execution, signaling steady confidence about future growth and profitability.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management sentiment was more positive, with less focus on cost reduction and more on growth and execution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The current quarter saw management reiterate and expand on the GI-focused strategy, with evidence of increasing adoption and writing frequency among gastroenterologists. Revenue guidance for 2026 was introduced, reflecting higher expected growth.</li>\n<li>Compared to Q3, the emphasis shifted from restructuring and cost-cutting to operational execution, sales force effectiveness, and capital structure improvement.</li>\n<li>Analysts in both quarters focused on growth trajectory, sales force alignment, and market penetration, but current questions showed more interest in long-term growth and competitive positioning.</li>\n<li>The tone of management was more confident, with multiple references to momentum and readiness for the next phase of growth.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management highlighted seasonality and winter storm impacts on Q1 performance, stating that \"Q1 is going to be the slowest quarter because of typical seasonality.\"</li>\n<li>Medicare coverage for VOQUEZNA remains incremental rather than broad, with no change to system-wide coverage anticipated in guidance.</li>\n<li>Competition from other P-CAB entrants, such as tegoprazan, was acknowledged, but management expects category growth rather than direct share loss.</li>\n<li>Cash flow covenants and liquidity requirements were addressed, with management stating confidence in meeting all obligations through cash on hand and expected operational cash flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Management expressed strong confidence in Phathom's financial position, sales force momentum, and the effectiveness of its GI-focused strategy. The company projects continued revenue growth, operating profitability beginning in Q3 2026, and cash flow positivity in 2027, supported by an improved capital structure and disciplined expense management. Phathom is positioned to deliver on its long-term vision of building a broader GI portfolio while remaining focused on execution and growth in the coming year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/phat/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Thryv Holdings, Inc. (THRY) Q4 2025  </p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Joe Walsh, Chairman &amp; CEO, highlighted that \"2025 was a solid year, and our team accomplished a lot. SaaS revenues grew 34% year-over-year, and SaaS adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 16.8%. We are accelerating on the AI front. It is advancing our product road map, and we are well-positioned as a leading SaaS platform for small businesses.\" He announced a strategic shift: \"Going forward, our entire strategy centers on one powerful offering, the Thryv platform, powered by AI, we'll be launching later in 2026.\" Walsh addressed the transition from legacy print and marketing services to SaaS, emphasizing growth in high-value customers and integration of Keap’s platform and engineering talent. He stated, \"Growth in quality customers spending $400 a month or more is 18-plus percent in the fourth quarter of last year. We’ve had steady growth in that segment. Quality customers now account for 69% of our revenue in Q4 compared to 60% in the prior year.\"</li>\n<li>Sean Wechter, Chief Technology Officer, explained, \"The first 2 levers I pulled when I arrived was to amp up our AI efforts and our data assets, get them cleaned up…our strategy is to adopt the latest and greatest AI tools and partners…we want to bring AI down market to small businesses in an ambient way, meaning ideally, AI does the intended task for you, hopefully, proactively.\"</li>\n<li>Paul Rouse, CFO, stated, \"SaaS revenue increased 14.1% to $119 million in the fourth quarter and was within guidance. Keap contributed $16.2 million in the fourth quarter…SaaS ARPU reached $373, representing a 15% increase year-over-year. Seasoned NRR stayed flat at 94% for the quarter. Growth in quality customers spending $400 a month or more grew by 3,000 or 18% year-over-year and now represents more than 20% of our client base.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Paul Rouse provided guidance for 2026: \"For the first quarter, we expect SaaS revenue in the range of $114 million to $115 million. For the full year, we expect SaaS revenue in the range of $461 million to $471 million…For the first quarter, we expect SaaS adjusted EBITDA in the range of $12 million to $13 million. For the full year, we expect SaaS adjusted EBITDA in the range of $70 million to $75 million.\"</li>\n<li>Walsh added, \"You will have noticed in Paul's guidance that's a little bit conservative on the quarterly guide and the guide for the year for SaaS…we expect slower growth for a few quarters, reaccelerating later in the year, and going strong into next year.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul><li>SaaS revenue for the fourth quarter was $119 million. Full-year SaaS revenue was $461 million. SaaS adjusted gross margin was 70.4% in the fourth quarter and 72.7% for the full year. SaaS adjusted EBITDA reached $20 million in Q4 and $73.8 million for the full year, with ARPU at $373. Marketing Services revenue was $72.6 million for Q4 and $324 million for the year, with adjusted EBITDA for Marketing Services at $18.8 million in Q4. Free cash flow was $31.1 million for 2025, and net debt was reduced to $251 million.</li></ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Arjun Bhatia, William Blair: Asked about the adoption curve of the new platform and migration impacts. Walsh responded, \"We’ve engineered everything together into one platform…there’s a little bit of cannibalization where it’s eating up some of business center customers…But it doesn’t have the heat and light that it had before because the market sell grow platform has really captured everyone’s imagination.\"</li>\n<li>Bhatia followed up on retention and overlap with seasoned customers. Walsh explained, \"There are definitely some new customers that are coming in right away…69% of our clients are this quality metric, where we make good margins.\"</li>\n<li>Zach Cummins, B. Riley Securities: Asked about go-to-market strategy for quality customers. Walsh said, \"We pretty much have decided that our phenomenal in-person sales organization should really spend its time with the larger businesses…we’ve been building this sort of product-led growth approach where for a smaller business that wants to come in, we’re going to have products that they can buy, and they’ll be able to do that.\"</li>\n<li>Cummins followed up on development and rollout of the new platform. Walsh replied, \"We have a trial version out and a small beta that will be expanding more broadly fairly soon…we’re selling it right now. But there’s dramatically improved versions…we plan over the course of the year.\"</li>\n<li>Matthew Swanson, RBC: Asked about pricing and migration impacts. Walsh stated, \"We’re going to have a product for them…there’ll be a higher tier…we’re coming up with this more streamlined, simple approach.\"</li>\n<li>Swanson inquired about legacy product end-of-life. Walsh responded, \"I think it’s too early to think about that…we’ve more cleaned up and segregated that.\"</li>\n<li>Jason Kreyer, Craig-Hallum Capital Group: Asked about embedded AI value. Walsh shared, \"There’s just a long list of different things that AI can do…we’re organizing and pulling it all together and making everything in a complete package to help you accomplish growing your business.\"</li>\n<li>Kreyer also asked about churn during migration. Walsh said, \"We’re seeing churn overall gently trend down…as we move upmarket, I think we’ll get lower churn.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed on platform migration, retention, and the development roadmap, showing a neutral to slightly positive tone as they acknowledged progress but probed for clarity on execution, churn, and product differentiation.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone in prepared remarks, particularly Walsh’s statements on the future direction and platform integration. During Q&amp;A, Walsh was detailed and transparent about platform cannibalization and strategy, using phrases like \"we’ve just captured lightning in a bottle\" and \"we have a tremendous right to win in.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone shifted from focusing on partner integration and verticals to emphasizing unified platform strategy and quality customer growth, while analysts’ tone remained probing but constructive.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance language shifted from emphasizing partner performance and vertical expansion in Q3 to a unified platform launch and quality customer focus in Q4, with full-year SaaS revenue guidance moving from $460–$463 million in Q3 to $461–$471 million in Q4.</li>\n<li>Management’s confidence increased around AI initiatives and the new product-led growth model, while acknowledging near-term growth moderation due to transition effects and cannibalization of legacy products.</li>\n<li>Key metrics such as quality customer revenue share (69% in Q4 vs. 60% prior year) and multiproduct adoption (19,000 clients with two or more SaaS products) showed continued improvement.</li>\n<li>Analysts’ focus shifted from execution against guidance and partner integration to the mechanics and timing of platform migration and upmarket strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Walsh noted cannibalization of existing Business Center customers and a managed decline in Marketing Services revenue as the company transitions to SaaS.</li>\n<li>Management highlighted that the upgrade pool from legacy platforms is largely behind, with future growth to be driven more by organic acquisition, expansion, and retention.</li>\n<li>Churn among smaller, lower-value customers was acknowledged, but management stated, \"while it creates some pressure on our aggregate retention metrics, it does have minimal impact on our overall revenue.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Thryv’s Q4 2025 call emphasized a strategic evolution to a unified, AI-powered SaaS platform targeting higher-value small businesses, with quality customers now accounting for a greater share of revenue and multiproduct adoption accelerating. Management outlined conservative near-term guidance as the company navigates product transitions and cannibalization, but projects a return to stronger growth as the new platform, enhanced by AI and the Keap acquisition, launches in 2026 and drives increased retention and expansion among established small business clients.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/thry/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
