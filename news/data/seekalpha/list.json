            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Franklin BSP Realty Trust (FBRT) Q3 2025  </p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Richard Byrne, Chairman and CEO, highlighted the successful closing and integration of the NewPoint acquisition, stating the third quarter was \"a transitional period for FBRT\" and emphasizing that \"NewPoint had a record volume quarter...with $2.2 billion of originations\" contributing $9.3 million to distributable earnings in its first full quarter. Byrne also noted, \"Our distributable earnings were $0.22 per fully converted share.\"</li>\n<li>Byrne reported that liquidity for the acquisition limited new loan originations early in the quarter, which led to a slight decline in core portfolio size. \"We originated approximately $304 million in new loan commitments...funded $196 million...and received $275 million in loan repayments,\" with the expectation that \"our core portfolio [will] return to its target size of at least $5 billion over the next few quarters.\"</li>\n<li>Byrne announced, \"We have resumed share repurchases in Q4,\" with 540,000 shares repurchased for $6 million through October 24 and $25.6 million remaining on the buyback allocation. The Board expanded authorization through December of next year.</li>\n<li>CFO, COO &amp; Treasurer Jerome Baglien stated, \"FBRT reported GAAP net income of $17.6 million or $0.13 per fully converted common share. Distributable earnings for the quarter were $26.7 million or $0.22 per fully converted share.\"</li>\n<li>Baglien explained that the new $1.1 billion CRE CLO will \"add an incremental $0.05 to $0.07 per share of quarterly earnings once this cash is deployed into new assets,\" and asset sales from the REO portfolio \"can contribute approximately $0.08 to $0.12 per share per quarter to distributable earnings over time.\"</li>\n<li>President Michael Comparato described the acquisition of NewPoint as making FBRT \"one of, if not the largest middle market lenders in the country with over 300 employees,\" highlighting strong origination activity and ongoing cross-selling opportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management expects the core portfolio to reach at least $5 billion over the next few quarters. Baglien detailed that the new CLO transaction \"should be an accretive liability for us for 3 to 5 years.\"</li>\n<li>Full year agency originations are expected to come in toward the upper end of initial guidance. Baglien also indicated, \"We continue to expect NewPoint to be accretive to GAAP earnings and book value per share in the first half of 2026 and accretive to distributable earnings in the second half of 2026.\"</li>\n<li>Comparato signaled an ongoing focus on integrating NewPoint and deploying capital, stating, \"We are now highly focused on playing offense. Our integration plan with NewPoint is on track, and we firmly believe FBRT has more tailwinds than headwinds.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>GAAP net income was $17.6 million or $0.13 per fully converted share. Distributable earnings reached $26.7 million or $0.22 per fully converted share, including $1.7 million of realized losses from a REO sale. Excluding this loss, distributable earnings were $0.23 per share.</li>\n<li>Book value at quarter end was $14.29 per fully converted share, with the decrease attributed to dividend under coverage and the NewPoint acquisition.</li>\n<li>NewPoint contributed $9.3 million to distributable earnings, with $19.7 million of MSR income and a servicing portfolio of $47.3 billion at quarter end.</li>\n<li>Core portfolio ended at $4.4 billion across 147 loans. Multifamily assets comprised 75% of the portfolio.</li>\n<li>Available liquidity was $522 million at quarter end, and net leverage was 2.55x.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Matthew Erdner, JonesTrading: Asked about origination volumes and drivers for higher volume in Q4. President Comparato responded that cross-selling and converting floating rate loans to CMBS contributed, and \"if we can execute where we stand today...Q4 will be a monster quarter for us in the CMBS group.\"</li>\n<li>Erdner also asked about alternative investments amid tight spreads. Comparato clarified, \"We are actively, actively originating in our core business...If we can find better returns with the same or better overall credit and liquidity profile, we're going to explore those things.\"</li>\n<li>Erdner asked Baglien about compensation and benefits expense. Baglien explained it will \"trend with volume...you might scale into a greater share in the second half of the year than the first half.\"</li>\n<li>Timothy D'Agostino, B. Riley Securities: Inquired about repayment pace. Baglien said repayments are \"relatively in line with what we've seen throughout the year.\"</li>\n<li>D'Agostino also asked about core portfolio target size. Comparato stated, \"We're targeting a stabilized portfolio...of between $5 billion and $5.5 billion.\"</li>\n<li>Christopher Muller, Citizens JMP Securities: Queried if NewPoint’s record quarter is repeatable. Comparato replied, \"I wouldn't use 1 quarter to extrapolate forward...this is probably a bit of an outlier.\"</li>\n<li>Muller followed up on GSE conservatorship and market impact. Comparato said, \"I'm still sceptical that this happens or happens quickly because I do think it's a very, very complicated web to untangle.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts focused on origination volumes, expense variability, and the sustainability of NewPoint's outperformance, with a generally neutral to slightly positive tone. They sought clarification on growth prospects, margin trends, and repayment pacing.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone in prepared remarks, emphasizing future growth, integration progress, and new capital deployment. In Q&amp;A, responses remained detailed and constructive, with Comparato reiterating confidence: \"We're just waking up every day, looking to find what we think are the best risk-adjusted returns.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone remained confident but more forward-looking, while analysts’ tone shifted from cautious to more constructive, especially regarding integration and growth projections.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The current quarter saw the completion and integration of the NewPoint acquisition, with a record origination quarter for NewPoint and a strong initial earnings contribution, compared to Q2 when the acquisition had just closed and integration was starting.</li>\n<li>Management resumed share repurchases and expanded the buyback authorization, a new development this quarter.</li>\n<li>Core portfolio size declined slightly in Q3 due to limited new originations, but management reaffirmed a $5 billion target, consistent with Q2 guidance.</li>\n<li>Both quarters highlighted a focus on reducing REO exposure, but Q3 included explicit details about realized losses and future contribution estimates from asset sales.</li>\n<li>Analyst questions in Q3 revolved around sustainability of origination volumes, expense variability, and the impact of the NewPoint acquisition, while Q2 focused more on initial integration steps, market spreads, and capital redeployment strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management noted that maintaining liquidity for the NewPoint acquisition limited new loan originations early in the quarter.</li>\n<li>Three new loans were added to the watch list, with one removed following full repayment.</li>\n<li>One multifamily watch list asset is expected to be a short sale, and the position was marked down by $2.3 million during the quarter.</li>\n<li>President Comparato acknowledged challenging market spreads and stated, \"Spreads on whole loan origination have tightened to levels that are less than compelling at the moment.\"</li>\n<li>Office loan exposure was reduced to $70 million, now only 1.6% of the portfolio, and management expects further reductions in Q4.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Franklin BSP Realty Trust delivered a transitional third quarter marked by strong NewPoint performance and initial integration benefits, modest core portfolio contraction, and a renewed focus on capital deployment and portfolio growth. Management outlined a clear path to expanding the core portfolio to at least $5 billion, enhanced by new financing capacity and disciplined risk management, while emphasizing ongoing share repurchases and expectations for further earnings contributions from both the NewPoint platform and legacy asset resolution in the coming quarters.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/fbrt/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

Gonzalez emphasized the company's flexibility, noting \"over 24,000 entitled units in our residential pipeline in various stages of planning, engineering, permitting or development.\"</li>\n<li>Leasing revenue increased by 7% to a quarterly record of $16.7 million, while hospitality revenue rose by 9% to a third quarter record of $60.6 million.</li>\n<li>Gonzalez announced the sale of Watercrest senior living for $41 million, generating a gross profit of $19.4 million. He explained, \"Senior living is an asset type that is needed for the regional ecosystem, but it is not an asset type we plan to grow as part of our commercial leasing portfolio because these types of assets take longer to lease in multifamily and because they entail considerable operational intensity.\"</li>\n<li>Capital allocation included $20.4 million for capital expenditures, $8.7 million for share repurchase, $8.1 million for cash dividends, and $28.4 million for project debt reduction, with the share balance now \"below $58 million for the first time in nearly 30 years.\"</li>\n<li>The quarterly dividend increased by 14% to $0.16 per share. \"Since we started this dividend program in 2020, we have increased dividend payments by 129%.\"</li>\n<li>Gonzalez noted new daily nonstop flights between Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport and New York City's LaGuardia Airport, stating the company is \"poised to leverage this new opportunity by expanding marketing efforts to promote the quality of the Watersound lifestyle.\"</li>\n<li>Marek Bakun, Executive VP &amp; CFO, reinforced the company's strategy: \"We have already received a number of questions. So we'll go ahead and start with the first one.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management indicated the continuation of a \"measured and multifaceted capital allocation strategy,\" with a focus on recurring revenue growth, strategic asset monetization, and reinvestment. Guidance language remained cautious, with recurring revenue and capital allocation dependent on market and company-specific circumstances.</li>\n<li>Gonzalez stated, \"Our capital allocation strategy is not singular to save cash. Certainly, our capital expenditures are a part of it. Share repurchase are part of it. Dividends are a part of it and project debt reduction are a part of it.\"</li>\n<li>The company anticipates ongoing evaluation of operating properties and timberlands for monetization opportunities, as well as maintaining flexibility to respond to market changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Residential real estate revenue reached $36.8 million, with average homesite base price increasing to $150,000 and gross margin at 53%.</li>\n<li>Leasing revenue set an all-time quarterly record at $16.7 million, and hospitality revenue achieved a third quarter record of $60.6 million.</li>\n<li>Watercrest senior living was sold for $41 million, resulting in a gross profit of $19.4 million.</li>\n<li>Share repurchases totaled $24.9 million through the first 9 months of 2025, compared to 0 in the same period of 2024.</li>\n<li>Dividend raised to $0.16 per share, a 14% increase.</li>\n<li>Recurring revenue for the first 9 months: hospitality $169 million, leasing $49.4 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Unnamed analyst: \"At the current buyback rate, the company is repurchasing around 1% of the company on an annual basis...why are we building our cash balance rather than increasing the pace of our buyback?\" Jorge Gonzalez: \"Having cash is a high-class problem. And we have been generating real cash, not through gimmicks or short-term financial engineering techniques.\"</li>\n<li>Analyst: \"Why not sell more of these assets at values that are material relative to a current market cap and use the proceeds to meaningfully reduce our share count...?\" Gonzalez: \"We are continuing to evaluate not only our operating properties, but timberlands in our portfolio...What we're not going to do is sell assets at a discount.\"</li>\n<li>Analyst: \"Where does the company see cash levels 12 to 18 months from now?...what cash levels does the company feel comfortable with?\" Gonzalez: \"It's really going to depend on facts and circumstances...liquidity is important. It's important for many reasons.\"</li>\n<li>Analyst: \"Any progress update on the talks with a large-scale builder interested in the entire Pigeon Creek, DSAP.\" Gonzalez: \"Those talks are ongoing. We don't have anything specific to report at this moment in time, but we are encouraged with the progress.\"</li>\n<li>Analyst: \"Plans for the beachfront lots about a block east...\" Bakun: \"That is a future growth area. Clearly, having that growth to the north will continue to add value to this property.\"</li>\n<li>Analyst: \"Has management identified or received interest on additional opportunities to monetize some of the assets within the hospitality or leasing segments?\" Gonzalez: \"We're constantly evaluating all of our assets...it's an evaluation that's ongoing.\"</li>\n<li>Analyst: \"Significant uptick in lot sales at WindMark Beach...Is there an ability to expand the scale of the community in the future?\" Gonzalez: \"We have been selling a lot of home sites and our builder in WindMark has been selling a lot of homes.

Management reaffirmed a disciplined, multifaceted capital allocation approach, with notable increases in share repurchases and dividends.

Sandri highlighted, “Chicken is the only protein expected to see an increase, offset by decreases in availability of beef, pork and turkey.” He described ongoing investments in the U.S. and Mexico, including the conversion of a Big Bird facility to Case Ready and the construction of a new Prepared Foods facility in Walker County, Georgia, all remaining on schedule.</li>\n<li>Sandri indicated that “all projects remain on schedule” and that these investments are expected to “enhance our competitive differentiation in Fresh, further diversify our portfolio through brands and enhance operating efficiencies.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Net revenues were reported at $4.76 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of $633.1 million. U.S. adjusted EBITDA for Q3 was $479.1 million. Case Ready’s profitability was higher both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Prepared Foods net sales grew by over 25% through expanded offerings and increased distribution. In Mexico, revenues rose over 5% year-over-year. Europe’s net revenues increased by more than 6% year-over-year.</li>\n<li>CapEx for the third quarter was $182 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $440 million, with a full-year estimate of $700 million. The company had $1.7 billion in total cash and available credit at quarter end, and net debt totaled less than $2.5 billion with a leverage ratio of slightly more than 1x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Benjamin Theurer, Barclays: Asked about the drivers behind commodity price declines and the company’s exposure to commodity pricing. Sandri responded that “pricing is a function of supply and demand,” and noted that “demand remains robust,” with chicken growing in the foodservice segment by around 4% in volume and QSR volumes increasing by more than 6%. He estimated that about 25% of Pilgrim’s Pride’s portfolio is exposed to commodity markets.</li>\n<li>Peter Galbo, BofA Securities: Questioned the record beef-to-chicken price spread and lack of cross-product elasticity. Sandri explained the shift in consumer behavior from foodservice to retail, supporting both beef and chicken demand in retail, and noted, “the record spreads and then people moving away from beef into chicken.”</li>\n<li>Andrew Strelzik, BMO Capital: Sought clarification on whether input cost headwinds and EU export demand challenges would persist. Sandri indicated input cost timing issues would recede as lower-cost inventory cycles through, and differentiated offerings would continue in the EU. Galvanoni noted, “it’s a bit of a timing situation within U.S. Prepared Foods relative to that input cost fluctuation.”</li>\n<li>Pooran Sharma, Stephens: Asked about M&amp;A vs. organic growth in Europe. Sandri stated that organic investments in the UK and Ireland do not preclude M&amp;A, and that opportunities exist across Europe in chicken, meals, and branded product segments.</li>\n<li>Guilherme Palhares, Santander: Questioned leverage outlook and export opportunities. Galvanoni said, “we don’t really see any major change in Q4,” and Sandri commented on the competitiveness of U.S. chicken and changing export dynamics, particularly regarding dark meat deboning.</li>\n<li>Heather Jones, Heather Jones Research: Inquired about Q4 pricing risks and portfolio exposure to commodity pricing. Sandri responded that retail demand remains strong and the company is “less impacted by the commodity prices” now due to differentiated offerings and more fixed or negotiated pricing with key customers.</li>\n<li>Priya Ohri-Gupta, Barclays: Asked about the impact of promotional investment on the P&amp;L and bond buybacks. Sandri described promotional activity as an investment that boosts volume and reduces operating costs, while Galvanoni said buybacks were winding down, with no recent activity in the last three months.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts’ tone was inquisitive and occasionally skeptical, pressing for clarity on margin dynamics, supply/demand balance, and capital allocation. Questions sought deeper explanations regarding input cost timing, export trends, and contract pricing risks.</li>\n<li>Management’s sentiment was confident in prepared remarks, emphasizing strong demand and operational progress. In Q&amp;A, Sandri maintained a constructive, slightly defensive stance, particularly when discussing commodity exposure and supply imbalances, using phrases such as “as I mentioned.”</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, analyst skepticism increased around market volatility and input cost impacts, while management’s tone shifted from confident to more measured and explanatory.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Q3 guidance maintained a focus on growth investments and portfolio diversification, with language shifting to emphasize operational efficiency and margin resilience amid commodity volatility. This contrasts with Q2’s emphasis on margin expansion and special dividend announcements.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus remained on prepared foods and branded growth, but management highlighted greater sensitivity to commodity input cost fluctuations and market volatility this quarter.</li>\n<li>Analysts’ focus shifted from CapEx cadence and special dividends in Q2 to commodity pricing, elasticity, and the sustainability of margin improvements in Q3. Management’s confidence, while still present, was more cautious and detailed in addressing risks.</li>\n<li>Key metrics such as U.S., Europe, and Mexico adjusted EBITDA margins declined versus Q2, and management acknowledged lower profitability in several segments due to input costs and market pricing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management identified volatility in commodity chicken values, particularly in September, and the impact of supply surges on pricing. The risk of input cost headwinds, especially in Prepared Foods, was acknowledged with mitigation via inventory cycling and contract adjustments.</li>\n<li>The European segment faces challenges from lower hog prices, antidumping actions by China, and increased competition from imported meat, with management responding through differentiated products and longer-term key customer contracts.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about the sustainability of retail and QSR demand, potential downside from SNAP reductions, and the effect of promotional pricing on margins.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Pilgrim’s Pride underscored robust demand for chicken across retail and foodservice, strengthened by strategic investments in prepared foods and brand differentiation. Management highlighted the ongoing expansion in the U.S. and Mexico, with all growth projects progressing as planned. Despite margin pressures from commodity volatility and input costs, the company emphasized its diversified portfolio, operational improvements, and strong liquidity as key drivers for sustained growth and value creation for shareholders.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ppc/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Thryv Holdings (THRY) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Joe Walsh, Chairman &amp; CEO, shared updates on Thryv's ongoing business transformation, emphasizing the integration of Keap and the strengthening of the partner ecosystem. Walsh described the recent Grow Conference as pivotal: \"This partner update was like Christmas, us delivering on the value that they were looking for. And so, I have better expectations as we go into '26. I think these partners are pretty impressed at the pace at which we are delivering and innovating the software.\"</li>\n<li>Walsh highlighted the success of Marketing Center, noting it is \"our fastest-selling product\" and plays a central role in the company's \"market, sell, and grow\" strategy. He observed significant interest from both existing and prospective customers, with many using Marketing Center alongside competitors’ CRMs.</li>\n<li>AI advancements were cited as a major tailwind: \"We're rolling out lots of AI within the software...AI is being used throughout the product to make it easier for small business people, kind of meet them where they are.\"</li>\n<li>Walsh announced the appointment of Sean Wechter as Chief Technology Officer, stating, \"He is all AI all the time. And we're really excited about what we think we can do with Sean in the year ahead to really up-level even further our integration of AI.\"</li>\n<li>CFO Paul Rouse reported, \"SaaS reported revenue was $115.9 million in the third quarter, representing an increase of 33% year-over-year. Keap contributed $16.8 million in the third quarter. Excluding Keap, Thryv SaaS business grew 14% year-over-year.\"</li>\n<li>Rouse also noted, \"We ended the third quarter with 103,000 SaaS subscribers, including 13,000 from Keap, representing a 7% increase year-over-year.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For Q4 2025, SaaS revenue is expected in the range of $118 million to $121 million. Full year 2025 SaaS revenue guidance is updated to a range of $460 million to $463 million.</li>\n<li>For Q4, SaaS adjusted EBITDA is expected in the range of $19.2 million to $21.2 million. Full year SaaS adjusted EBITDA guidance is raised to a range of $73 million to $75 million.</li>\n<li>Rouse stated, \"For the full year, we expect Marketing Services revenue in the range of $323 million to $325 million.\" Marketing Services adjusted EBITDA guidance was updated to a range of $76 million to $78 million.</li>\n<li>Management communicated a continued strategic focus on ramping product adoption and verticalization, with particular momentum in home services and HVAC.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Rouse reported that SaaS adjusted gross margin increased 80 basis points year-over-year, reaching 73%.</li>\n<li>SaaS adjusted EBITDA was $19.6 million in Q3, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17%.</li>\n<li>ARPU for SaaS reached $365 overall, with Thryv at $355 and Keap at $437. Multiproduct adoption accelerated, with 17,000 clients using two or more SaaS products, representing 20% of the base.</li>\n<li>Marketing Services revenue for the quarter was $85.7 million. Marketing Services adjusted EBITDA was $21.2 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 25%.</li>\n<li>Total company billings were $184.2 million, down 4% year-over-year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $14.6 million, with year-to-date free cash flow at $18.8 million. Net debt decreased by $9 million to $265 million, with a leverage ratio of 1.9x.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Scott Berg, Needham &amp; Company: Asked about SaaS growth coming in at the low end of guidance and drivers behind this. Walsh responded that execution \"was a smidge shy of where we wanted to be,\" and stated, \"I can't blame anything outside at all.\"</li>\n<li>Berg followed up on partner ecosystem improvements. Walsh explained that partner morale is \"rising beautifully right now,\" after a year of focused investment and engagement.</li>\n<li>Jason Kreyer, Craig-Hallum: Inquired about the customer environment and impact of macro trends. Walsh said, \"We're not that economically sensitive...when we don't deliver, it's mostly our fault.\"</li>\n<li>Kreyer also asked about the impact of the vertical sales emphasis. Walsh indicated the push into verticals such as HVAC is aimed at raising ARPU and targeting larger, more stable clients, with early vertical sales \"coming in more like the 8,000 that we're going for.\"</li>\n<li>Alinda Li, William Blair: Asked about strategies under the new CTO and operational efficiency. Walsh noted an acceleration in product development and integration capabilities under Wechter.</li>\n<li>Zach Cummins, B. Riley: Sought detail on keeping clients visible in answer-based engines. Walsh described answer engines as a \"tailwind for us,\" emphasizing their ability to drive leads and value.</li>\n<li>Matthew Swanson, RBC: Questioned trends within the higher-spending SaaS client cohort. Walsh highlighted lower churn and higher product adoption among clients spending $400 or more per month.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts expressed a mix of cautious inquiry and optimism, with questions focused on growth, execution, and client trends. The tone was neutral to slightly positive, with an emphasis on clarifying strategic direction and operational details.</li>\n<li>Management's sentiment was confident in prepared remarks, emphasizing transformation, AI, and product innovation. During Q&amp;A, Walsh acknowledged minor execution shortfalls but maintained a positive outlook, frequently referencing improvements and future expectations. Direct quotes such as \"I have better expectations as we go into '26\" and \"I think some of these partners work across different tools than just Keap...they're turning back our way more excited about what we're doing\" reflect this confidence.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone remained optimistic but more focused on operational execution and partner engagement. Analysts' tone was more probing regarding execution and product adoption.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Q3 guidance for SaaS revenue was lowered to $115.9 million actual, compared to Q2's guidance range of $116 million to $117 million. SaaS adjusted EBITDA in Q3 ($19.6 million) came in above the previous quarter's Q3 guidance range.</li>\n<li>Full year SaaS revenue guidance is now $460 million to $463 million, narrowed from Q2's $460 million to $465 million range. SaaS adjusted EBITDA guidance increased from $70.5 million-$73.5 million in Q2 to $73 million-$75 million in Q3.</li>\n<li>ARPU continued to expand, and focus shifted further to higher-value, multiproduct clients. Net revenue retention declined to 94% from 103%, attributed to legacy client transitions.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus continues to shift toward verticalization and moving upmarket, while continued integration of AI and the onboarding of the new CTO signal further acceleration in product development.</li>\n<li>Analysts in Q3 focused more on executional details and partner channel progress, while in Q2, questions centered on capital allocation and new product introductions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited \"temporary noise\" in SaaS metrics due to the migration of legacy marketing services clients and the resulting impact on ARPU and NRR.</li>\n<li>The transition off older tech platforms is expected to generate ongoing short-term volatility in metrics.</li>\n<li>Analyst concerns centered on execution, particularly the slight miss at the low end of SaaS guidance and the pace of partner channel improvement.</li>\n<li>Management stated, \"We are making steady progress building a solid software client base with strong underlying fundamentals,\" and emphasized that declines in Marketing Services billings are intentional and managed as part of the transformation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Thryv management highlighted accelerated AI integration, increasing multiproduct adoption, and a strategic focus on vertical solutions as key drivers in the business transformation. While legacy client transitions and executional challenges created some noise in metrics this quarter, management reaffirmed its commitment to upmarket growth, operational efficiency, and the partner ecosystem, with raised full-year SaaS adjusted EBITDA guidance underscoring confidence in sustainable profitability and ongoing transformation into a leading SaaS provider.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/thry/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

He also stated, \"We look forward to sharing top line results from the RISE UP Phase III trial of PYRUKYND in sickle cell disease by year-end.\"</li>\n<li>Goff announced global progress with \"approval for PYRUKYND in adults with thalassemia in Saudi Arabia, our first global regulatory approval for this indication,\" and a \"positive CHMP opinion recommending PYRUKYND for marketing authorization in Europe.\"</li>\n<li>The company reported \"$12.9 million in net revenue, underscoring the strong value proposition of PYRUKYND.\"</li>\n<li>Cecilia Jones, CFO, stated, \"Third quarter net PYRUKYND revenue was $12.9 million, an increase of 44% compared to $9 million in the third quarter of 2024 and an increase of 3% compared to $12.5 million in the second quarter of 2025.\"</li>\n<li>Jones affirmed, \"On a full year basis, given the strong execution of our sales force to date, we anticipate net revenues in 2025 to show robust growth compared to 2024, although we recognize this growth is on a relatively small revenue base.\"</li>\n<li>She highlighted a \"strong balance sheet with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and investments.\"</li>\n<li>Tsveta Milanova, Chief Commercial Officer, noted \"262 patients have completed prescription enrollment forms, including 14 in the third quarter\" and \"149 patients currently on therapy, up 5% from the second quarter.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The company expects \"fourth quarter performance will benefit from an additional ordering week compared to the third quarter and we anticipate PYRUKYND net revenue will continue to reflect continued focus on PK deficiency ahead of potential approval for thalassemia in the U.S.\" (Jones)</li>\n<li>Full-year net revenues in 2025 are anticipated \"to show robust growth compared to 2024.\" (Jones)</li>\n<li>The team remains \"confident in our ability to deliver a successful launch\" for PYRUKYND in thalassemia, pending regulatory approval (Milanova).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Third quarter net PYRUKYND revenue was $12.9 million.</li>\n<li>Cost of sales for the quarter was $1.7 million; R&amp;D expenses were $86.8 million; SG&amp;A expenses were $41.3 million.</li>\n<li>The company ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.3 billion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Eric Schmidt, Cantor Fitzgerald: Asked about the REMS program details and business development strategy. Sarah Gheuens, Chief Medical Officer, responded, \"We per process don't comment on the details of REMS in the label. However, indeed, to your point, there are many different forms of REMS... it will include monitoring and some form of education.\" Goff said, \"Our pursuit really is not timed to anything in particular... our sweet spot, of course, is rare diseases.\"</li>\n<li>Alec Stranahan, BofA Securities: Inquired about liver monitoring requirements in different geographies and commercial implications. Gheuens explained for Saudi, \"it's in line with our proposal of once-a-month monitoring for the first 6 months\" and said for Europe, \"the label will only be final when you have the EC decision.\" Milanova added, \"We don't anticipate that to be a barrier to prescribing or have an impact on our commercial opportunity.\"</li>\n<li>Emily Bodnar, H.C. Wainwright: Asked about positive data for low-risk MDS and the cadence for European thalassemia launch. Gheuens said, \"we were able to announce enrollment of our Phase IIb trial today... there is a huge unmet need for this patient population.\" Milanova described the European launch process as requiring \"12 to 18 months\" for pricing and reimbursement after regulatory approval.</li>\n<li>Marc Frahm, TD Cowen: Queried about liver events in PKR trials and commercial demand in the Gulf. Gheuens stated, \"safety profile remains exactly the same as when we declared this hepatocellular injury risk and we have not observed anything... that warrants us to update the safety profile.\" Milanova noted demand is strong but access is slow due to national procedures.</li>\n<li>Tessa Romero, JPMorgan: Asked about timing for RISE UP top line data. Goff responded, \"we're on track for that data by year-end.\"</li>\n<li>Lydia (for Salveen Richter, Goldman Sachs): Questioned REMS program implications for other indications. Goff clarified, \"the REMS request has been specific to thalassemia.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts maintained a neutral to slightly positive tone, focusing on regulatory processes, risk monitoring, and the pace of global launches, with repeated questions about REMS and regulatory timing.</li>\n<li>Management projected confidence in both prepared remarks and Q&amp;A, with statements such as \"we are well positioned\" and \"we remain confident\" (Goff, Milanova). During Q&amp;A, management remained measured and avoided specifics on regulatory matters, often reiterating regulatory processes and timelines.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, the tone remains confident and focused on execution, with an increased emphasis on regulatory hurdles and market access challenges.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The current quarter featured the PDUFA date extension for PYRUKYND in thalassemia to December 7, whereas the previous quarter anticipated the original September 7 date.</li>\n<li>Third quarter net revenue rose slightly quarter-over-quarter ($12.9 million in Q3 vs. $12.5 million in Q2), with patient enrollments and those on therapy both increasing.</li>\n<li>SG&amp;A expenses decreased compared to Q2, while R&amp;D expenses were lower than the previous quarter, partly due to the absence of a milestone payment seen in Q2.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus shifted to global regulatory and launch milestones, with new international approvals secured and a positive European opinion.</li>\n<li>Analysts in both quarters focused on regulatory updates and commercial launch readiness, but this quarter included more granular questions about REMS and regional launch processes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited the ongoing FDA review and REMS program requirements as key challenges.</li>\n<li>Milanova acknowledged the slow patient access and reimbursement processes in international markets, particularly in Saudi Arabia and Europe.</li>\n<li>Gheuens reiterated the company's vigilance regarding hepatocellular injury risk, stating no new safety concerns had emerged.</li>\n<li>Analysts consistently probed for potential regulatory barriers, commercial uptake risks, and implications of REMS programs across indications.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Agios Pharmaceuticals highlighted steady commercial growth for PYRUKYND, with sequential increases in revenue and patient uptake, while signaling confidence in achieving a successful U.S. launch for thalassemia following the PDUFA date extension to December 7. The company emphasized its robust cash position and disciplined strategic investments supporting both near-term milestones and long-term pipeline expansion. Management remains focused on regulatory progress, commercial execution, and addressing the significant unmet needs in rare diseases, with key data readouts and regulatory decisions expected in the coming months.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/agio/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",
