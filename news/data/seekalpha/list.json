Adjusted EBITDA rose 21% to $55.6M, helped by productivity initiatives, SG&amp;A savings, removal of McDonald's USA-related costs, and $4.8M of business interruption insurance recoveries tied to the 2024 cyber incident. Notably, the company generated $45.0M of operating cash flow and $27.9M of free cash flow in the quarter.</p>\n<p>In the U.S. segment, revenue fell 6.1% to $230.2 million as closures drove a 5.8% organic revenue decline, but APD increased 4.5% year over year and 7.0% sequentially to $660, reflecting the pruning of low-volume, unprofitable doors. International revenue grew 2.9% to $142.5M, driven by Japan and Mexico despite POA reductions in those markets. </p>\n<p>CEO Josh Charlesworth highlighted the meaningful progress made on the company's turnaround, emphasizing strong consumer demand, profitable U.S. expansion, and capital-light international franchise growth. He noted that exiting underperforming U.S. doors modestly pressured revenue but materially lifted EBITDA margin. \"In 2026, we look forward to building on this momentum through systemwide sales growth, additional refranchising activity, disciplined capital expenditures, lower net leverage, and positive free cash flow generation,\" he stated.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Krispy Kreme (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DNUT\" title=\"Krispy Kreme, Inc.\">DNUT</a>) plans to open at least 100 shops globally. FY26 system-wide sales growth of 2% to 4% is anticipated.</p>\n<p>Shares of Krispy Kreme (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DNUT\" title=\"Krispy Kreme, Inc.\">DNUT</a>) rallied 12.4% in premarket action to $3.36 vs. the 52-week range of $2.50 to $6.51.
