About half of the spend was on short-lived assets, mainly GPUs and CPUs, to support increasing Azure platform demand, growing first-party apps at AI solutions, accelerating research and development, or R&amp;D, by product teams, and continued replacement for end-of-life server and networking equipment, according to Hood.</p>\n<p>\"The remaining spend was for long-lived assets that will support monetization for the next 15 years and beyond, including $11.1 billion of finance leases that are primarily for large data center sites.

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Cavco Industries, Inc. (CVCO) Q2 2026</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO William Boor opened the call by highlighting \"focused execution across our operations that led to the strong overall results we're reviewing today.\" He noted revenue increased 9.7% year-over-year and was flat sequentially, while operating profit rose about 27% from last year's Q2 and 3% over last quarter.</li>\n<li>Boor emphasized \"notable regional differences,\" with the Northern U.S. seeing double-digit shipment growth and the Southeast region experiencing a slowdown, as shipments in the area from the Carolinas and Tennessee to Louisiana were down about 4% year-to-date and down 10% in July and August compared to last year.</li>\n<li>Production rates were adjusted: \"we did need to slow our Southeast production in Q2 and the plants reacted well,\" explained Boor, citing extended downtime and rate reductions in the Southeast, while other regions maintained elevated production rates.</li>\n<li>On backlogs, Boor stated \"we remained at about 5 to 7 weeks. Unit backlog was up slightly quarter-to-quarter.\"</li>\n<li>Boor highlighted the financial services segment: \"operating profit is up $14 million from a loss last year to an $8 million profit this year. This has been driven by our insurance business.\"</li>\n<li>The American Homestar acquisition closed after Q2 ended. Boor said, \"integration is moving quickly and very well,\" and the combined company \"is off to a great start.\"</li>\n<li>Boor underscored capital allocation: \"we continued investing in our existing plants. We closed on the American Homestar acquisition immediately after the quarter using cash on hand, and we were able to repurchase $36 million of our common shares.\"</li>\n<li>CFO Allison Aden reported, \"Net revenue for the second fiscal quarter of 2026 was $556.5 million, up $49 million or 9.7% from $507.5 million in the prior year quarter.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management described the market as \"in balance with manufacturer production,\" with Boor stating \"there are scenarios that it strengthens and others that it weakens from here. We're comfortable operating in this environment because we've demonstrated the ability to closely monitor and adjust.\"</li>\n<li>The company remains focused on monitoring regional variations, especially in the Southeast, and stands ready to adjust production as needed to maintain backlogs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Factory-built housing segment net revenue was $535.1 million, up $48.8 million or 10% from $486.3 million in the prior year quarter, driven by a 5.4% increase in homes sold and a 4.4% rise in average revenue per home sold.</li>\n<li>Financial services segment net revenue was $21.4 million, up $0.3 million or 1.4% from the prior year quarter.</li>\n<li>Consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 24.2%, up 130 basis points from 22.9% last year.</li>\n<li>Selling, general and administrative expenses were $72.2 million or 13% of net revenue, compared to $67 million or 13.2% last year, with the increase due to higher incentive compensation and deal costs from the American Homestar acquisition.</li>\n<li>Interest income was $5 million, down from $5.7 million last year.</li>\n<li>Pretax profit was $67.3 million, up $12.3 million or 22.4% from $55 million in the prior year period.</li>\n<li>Net income was $52.4 million and diluted earnings per share was $6.55 per share versus $5.28 per share last year.</li>\n<li>The company repurchased just over $36 million of common shares and closed the American Homestar acquisition using cash on hand.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Dan Moore, CJS Securities, Inc.: Asked about order trends and production rates in Q3. Boor responded that \"our wholesale orders were down just a little bit in the quarter\" and production rates remain relatively steady, with adjustments localized by region.</li>\n<li>Moore inquired about Texas market dynamics. Boor said, \"we had a really, really good quarter in retail\" and \"the market is there. Our retail guys are doing a great job.\"</li>\n<li>Moore asked about gross margin expectations and tariff impacts. Aden said, \"the impact of tariffs in Q2 was approximately $2 million,\" and future impacts will depend on commodity prices and market conditions.</li>\n<li>Greg Palm, Craig-Hallum: Asked about Cavco's ability to outgrow the industry. Boor attributed this to digital marketing, rebranding, and a strengthened national sales team.</li>\n<li>Palm inquired about the mix of homes sold through company-owned retail. Mark Fusler said, \"this quarter, we're about 22.9% that were sold through our retail channel.\"</li>\n<li>Jay McCanless, Wedbush: Asked about multi-section home trends. Boor noted an uptick but said \"I'm not sure that we've really got a theory that it's a trend.\"</li>\n<li>Jesse Lederman, Zelman &amp; Associates: Asked about financial services margin improvements. Boor emphasized that \"well over 50% of the improvement is due to the changes we've made\" in underwriting and claims management.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts focused on regional differences, production adjustments, margins, and the integration of American Homestar. Their tone was neutral to slightly positive, with direct questions about risks and future impacts.</li>\n<li>Management's tone during prepared remarks was confident, highlighting operational flexibility and strong results. During Q&amp;A, responses were detailed and balanced, acknowledging uncertainties but expressing comfort with current market positioning. Boor used phrases such as \"we're comfortable operating in this environment\" and \"not intending to be evasive, it's more that we're just seeing all conditions across the country.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both management and analysts maintained a steady tone, with slightly increased focus on cost pressures and regional shipment dynamics.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue was effectively flat sequentially, while operating profit increased 3% over last quarter.</li>\n<li>The previous quarter saw a 16.6% sequential revenue increase, while this quarter was flat due to seasonal trends and regional variation.</li>\n<li>There is a continued focus on regional shipment performance, especially as the Southeast lagged while the Northern regions outperformed.</li>\n<li>Management reiterated confidence in the company’s ability to adjust production as needed and highlighted the completed American Homestar acquisition, which was pending in the prior quarter.</li>\n<li>Analysts maintained a similar focus on regional performance, pricing, and cost pressures, but questioned more deeply on integration and product mix following the acquisition.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited \"significant regional differences\" in shipment trends, with the Southeast slowing while other regions grew.</li>\n<li>Tariff increases, particularly on Canadian lumber, are expected to impact costs. Aden explained, \"the Canadian lumber countervailing duties have been increased from their long-term 14.5% to 35%,\" with an additional 10% tariff announced.</li>\n<li>Management is monitoring the ability to pass through increased costs, noting that \"our ability to pass these costs through pricing will be very dependent upon local market conditions.\"</li>\n<li>The impact of regulatory changes and the ongoing integration of the American Homestar acquisition were also mentioned as areas to watch.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Cavco Industries delivered solid financial results in Q2 2026 with steady revenue, improved profitability, and notable strength in its financial services business. The company navigated regional shipment differences by actively managing production rates and maintained healthy backlogs. The successful closing and integration of the American Homestar acquisition expands Cavco's retail presence, positioning the company for future growth. Cost pressures from tariffs and regional shipment uncertainty remain, but management emphasized operational agility and a balanced capital allocation strategy as key to sustaining performance going forward.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/cvco/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",
