            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: PACS Group, Inc. (PACS) Q4 2025 </p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Jason Murray, CEO &amp; Chairman, highlighted a milestone year for PACS, stating the company delivered “record performance, which is a testament to the strength of our platform, the dedication of our teams and our continued focus on operational excellence.” Murray emphasized successful integration of 2024 acquisitions, execution of 8 additional strategic acquisitions in 2025, and efforts to deepen local scale within existing markets. </li>\n<li>Murray also reported ongoing improvements in clinical quality and occupancy, noting, “Our mature facilities are operating at strong occupancy levels and facilities acquired in 2024 continue progressing through integration and stabilization as they adopt our clinical systems and operating processes.” </li>\n<li>The CEO detailed that 207 facilities, or 73.4% of the skilled nursing portfolio, are now rated 4 or 5 stars in CMS quality measure, with the average star rating in mature facilities rising to 4.4. </li>\n<li>Murray shared examples of turnaround success, including a Kentucky facility that improved from a 2-star to a 5-star CMS quality rating within one year and highlighted a newly built Oceanside, CA, facility that achieved a zero-deficiency certification survey and reached profitability in its first year. </li>\n<li>The company’s portfolio now spans 321 facilities in 17 states, with occupancy at 89.1% overall and mature facilities at 94.9%. </li>\n<li>Mark Hancock, Interim CFO &amp; Executive Vice Chairman, stated, “Revenue for the quarter was $1.36 billion, up approximately 12% over the same period in the prior year. Net income totaled $59.8 million for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDAR was $237.7 million, while adjusted EBITDA was $142.1 million.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For 2026, PACS expects revenue in the range of $5.65 billion to $5.75 billion, with a midpoint of $5.7 billion, representing nearly 8% growth over 2025. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be between $555 million and $575 million, with a midpoint of $565 million, reflecting almost 12% growth over 2025. </li>\n<li>Hancock explained the outlook “reflects steady organic growth and margin expansion through improved occupancy and skilled mix across our portfolio, stable reimbursement assumptions and continued disciplined capital allocation to support ongoing acquisition activity.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Full year 2025 revenue totaled $5.29 billion, up 29% from 2024. Net income for the year was $191.5 million, with diluted EPS at $1.22 per share. Adjusted EBITDA reached $505 million. </li>\n<li>The company maintained a net leverage of approximately 0.3x at year-end after deploying over $145 million in investments, including real estate and acquisitions funded from existing liquidity. </li>\n<li>General and administrative expenses increased 21% year-over-year, attributed to scaling corporate infrastructure and compliance. </li>\n<li>Mature facilities saw occupancy rise to 94.9%, while ramping and new facilities experienced lower occupancy as they transition through integration.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>David MacDonald, Truist Securities, Inc., asked about payer relationships and share gain opportunities. Joshua Jergensen, President &amp; COO, responded that high quality ratings enhance contract negotiations, stating, “we become a very attractive partner for really any of the insurers in the space that are looking for places to send their patients with high-quality care, access to bed, bed availability, density.” </li>\n<li>On the M&amp;A pipeline, MacDonald inquired about annual acquisition targets. Hancock replied, “we've baked in kind of a nominal number of facilities being acquired in 2026 to the tune of about 5 facilities per quarter with nominal revenue as those come on.” Jergensen added that the pipeline is “very robust,” with a focus on disciplined, selective acquisitions and real estate ownership. </li>\n<li>Asked about de novo development, Jergensen said, “historically, the de novo development hasn't been the primary driver of our growth strategies...while not opposed to continuing to do that, if there are states and areas where it makes sense...that will be a part of the strategy.” </li>\n<li>MacDonald also questioned M&amp;A pricing trends. Hancock answered that “we have seen price increases over recent years...but we also see that also starting to plateau in pricing versus...the accelerated pricing we've seen in recent years.” </li>\n<li>Benjamin Hendrix, RBC Capital Markets, asked about value-based purchasing program impacts. Jergensen replied, “Any time...we see clinical quality tied to reimbursement, we feel very confident. Our model has always consistently began with care...as reimbursement is tied to quality metrics and other things, we believe that we're positioned as well, if not better, than anyone else in the industry.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts focused on competitive positioning, M&amp;A pipeline, and regulatory reimbursement, with a slightly positive tone highlighted by congratulatory remarks and questions about growth opportunities and deal selectivity.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and optimistic stance, repeatedly referencing disciplined execution, quality improvement, and a robust M&amp;A pipeline. Murray described momentum as “energized and moving forward with discipline and focus.”</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management displayed increased confidence, with less focus on operational disruption or past challenges. The tone in both prepared remarks and Q&amp;A was more positive and forward-looking.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance for 2026 reflects a shift to steady organic growth (8% revenue, nearly 12% EBITDA growth), compared to 30% revenue growth guidance in 2025, signaling normalization after a year of transformative acquisitions.</li>\n<li>Management’s tone has shifted from a focus on overcoming past challenges and compliance improvements to highlighting integration success and scalable infrastructure.</li>\n<li>Analysts’ questions moved from governance and operational controls to sustainable growth, payer relationships, and acquisition selectivity.</li>\n<li>Key metrics show continued occupancy strength in mature facilities, a higher proportion of high-rated facilities, and disciplined capital deployment. The emphasis on quality ratings and regulatory compliance remains strong.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management noted rising acquisition and real estate pricing, but observed this is starting to plateau.</li>\n<li>There is ongoing integration risk as ramping and new facilities transition, reflected in lower occupancy relative to mature facilities.</li>\n<li>Industry fragmentation and regulatory complexity remain challenges, but PACS continues to cite its scale and operational model as mitigants.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised questions about pricing environment, value-based purchasing changes, and the impact of new reimbursement models.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>PACS Group’s Q4 2025 call reveals a company that has fully transitioned from a period of transformative growth and integration to a focus on steady, disciplined expansion. With record results, elevated quality ratings, and a robust M&amp;A pipeline, management projects 8% revenue growth and nearly 12% adjusted EBITDA growth for 2026. Strengthened by a scalable operating model and conservative balance sheet, PACS signals readiness to drive sustainable value while navigating evolving industry dynamics and maintaining leadership in clinical quality.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/pacs/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Cable One, Inc. (CABO) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Interim CEO &amp; CFO Todd Koetje reported year-over-year growth in residential broadband connect activity and significant improvement in disconnects compared to the previous quarter, yet net subscriber figures remained negative. Koetje stated, \"Residential data customers declined by approximately 10,700 in the fourth quarter. Gross connect activity improved sequentially through the first 3 quarters of 2025 and meaningfully year-over-year in the fourth quarter, while disconnects improved significantly in Q4 versus the third quarter.\" He highlighted the completion of the billing platform transformation and rollout of new products including premium Wi-Fi powered by Wi-Fi 7 and enhanced online security, mentioning that over one-third of residential broadband customers were using advanced in-home capabilities via the Eero partnership, with adoption exceeding 80% during the quarter.</li>\n<li>Koetje discussed the competitive environment, noting that \"fixed wireless is now essentially ubiquitous across our footprint with multiple providers\" and that nearly 60% of passings now face gig-capable wired broadband competition, with just over 50% reflecting fiber-to-the-home. He emphasized the company's network excess capacity, stating average monthly data usage reached 835 gigabits per customer, and more than 30% of customers exceeded 1 terabyte per month.</li>\n<li>On strategic initiatives, Koetje announced the launch of a mobile pilot in six markets with a broader launch expected in late Q1, and outlined expansion of business services through a broker and agent channel. He also welcomed Ed Butler as Senior Vice President of Business Services, noting plans to accelerate product launches under his leadership.</li>\n<li>Koetje referenced integration planning for the $480 million MBI acquisition, anticipated to close in October, and reaffirmed focus on cost and tax efficiencies.</li>\n<li>CEO Jim Holanda described the company as operating from \"a position of financial strength\" with \"substantial liquidity and a business model that generates significant and durable free cash flow.\" Holanda highlighted priorities including deepening customer relationships, expanding converged offerings, and evolving sales and service models using digital tools and AI. Holanda concluded, \"The priorities are clear, the foundation is strong, and I am confident in the team's ability to execute with discipline as we look ahead.\"</li>\n<li>Vice President of Investor Relations Jordan Morkert reported, \"For the fourth quarter of 2025, total revenues were $363.7 million compared to $387.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of 6.1% year-over-year. Residential data and business data revenues decreased by 4.2% and 1.3%, respectively. Operating expenses were $93.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to $99.9 million in the fourth quarter of last year.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Koetje indicated capital expenditures for 2026 are expected to remain substantially consistent with 2025 levels. He stated, \"We currently expect our cash income taxes to be between approximately $40 million and $50 million as we continue to track towards cash tax savings of approximately $120 million through 2027 as a result of the tax legislation passed in 2025.\"</li>\n<li>Koetje confirmed, \"With the pilot complete and the necessary platforms in place, we are positioned to scale mobile in a disciplined and financially responsible manner,\" targeting a broader launch in late Q1.</li>\n<li>He also stated, \"We continue to believe MBI is a strong fit for our company and expect cost and tax efficiencies over time, and we believe the preparation underway today positions us well to deliver on those expectations.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Morkert reported adjusted EBITDA of $193.9 million for Q4, an 8.1% decrease year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 53.3%. Capital expenditures for Q4 were $74 million, including $12.7 million for new market expansion and $1.6 million for integration activities. Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures totaled $119.9 million compared to $139.1 million in the prior year quarter.</li>\n<li>For the full year, total revenues were $1.5 billion, down from $1.58 billion in 2024. Residential data revenues declined by $24.2 million or 2.6%, while business data revenues grew 0.35%. Capital expenditures were $285.3 million, and free cash flow reached $516.5 million. The company paid down $403.4 million in debt during 2025, ending the year with $152.8 million in cash and equivalents and a total debt balance of $3.2 billion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Gregory Williams, TD Cowen: Asked CEO Jim Holanda about early learnings and the broadband ARPU trajectory for 2026. Holanda responded, \"Cable One, great people, great teams, very focused on the competition, execution on the plan for this year... ample capacity to deal with the convertible notes as well as the MBI close at a very reasonable cost of capital... additional product sets to continue to add value to our existing broadband base... The AI tools that are available to the industry to help on ARPUs, operational efficiencies, customer satisfaction, sales productivity, other areas.\"</li>\n<li>Williams also inquired about broadband ARPU. Koetje answered, \"We managed expectations around anchoring to that Q2 ARPU, which was $81 in a quarter and kind of plus or minus $1 to that, which we were within that, about $0.50 below that. The headwinds in that were some of the ongoing focus on selling into all customers, that value-conscious customer cohort... but also being much more aggressive in head-to-head competition.\"</li>\n<li>Sebastiano Petti, JPMorgan: Asked about the timing and strategic role of mobile and convergence. Holanda replied, \"Mobile is integral. I think Comcast and Charter have proven that since their launch... It's pivotal in terms of how we think about the business and adding value to our higher ARPU existing broadband customers... it does take some time for people to get comfortable with that.\"</li>\n<li>Craig Moffett, MoffettNathanson: Asked if video could return as a strategic tool. Holanda stated, \"Everything is on the table in terms of potential toolkits on how we retain customers and add value and attract new ones... I think there are some interesting options to add value for the broadband-only universe that we have at little to no cost.\"</li>\n<li>Frank Louthan, Raymond James: Asked about plans to return to positive broadband subscriber adds and the timeline. Holanda said, \"There is simply no quick fix on the broadband side. The entire industry is facing these kinds of headwinds. But I think when you add up all of these little things and are executing flawlessly on behalf of customers, that's what it's going to take.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pursued a slightly negative tone, probing for clarity on broadband ARPU, the effectiveness of new initiatives, the competitive landscape, and the timeline for subscriber stabilization. Questions reflected skepticism about the pace of improvement and the impact of promotional and competitive pressures.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a neutral to confident tone in prepared remarks, emphasizing strategic progress and foundational improvements. In the Q&amp;A, both Holanda and Koetje acknowledged industry challenges and the need for ongoing execution but avoided overpromising on rapid turnaround, using phrases such as \"it's not a quick fix\" and \"we remain confident in our long-term outlook.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone was more forward-looking with greater emphasis on operational readiness and execution, while analysts showed ongoing concern about short-term metrics and competitive threats.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Net subscriber losses narrowed from Q3 to Q4, with improved gross connects and lower disconnects, contrasting the \"weaker than expected\" subscriber results reported previously.</li>\n<li>Leadership changed from Julia Laulis to Jim Holanda as CEO, with Koetje serving as interim CEO &amp; CFO, signaling a shift in strategic direction and operational focus.</li>\n<li>The Q4 call introduced the launch of a mobile pilot and imminent rollout, while Q3 was focused on pilot planning. Business services expansion via new sales channels was also highlighted in Q4.</li>\n<li>Management’s tone shifted from addressing platform migration and churn spikes in Q3 to emphasizing network capability, foundational investments, and execution in Q4. Analysts maintained a slightly skeptical stance regarding near-term subscriber gains and ARPU stability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Koetje noted ongoing competitive pressure from fixed wireless and fiber overbuilds, as well as customer sensitivity to promotional roll-offs. He observed, \"customer sensitivity around promotional roll-offs continue to influence customer behavior, particularly in a heightened value-conscious environment.\"</li>\n<li>Management acknowledged the possibility of further fiber overbuild in the footprint, with Koetje stating, \"we will expect to continue to see that move up from where it is now.\"</li>\n<li>Analyst questions highlighted concerns about the timeline for returning to positive subscriber growth and the durability of ARPU in the face of value-driven customer acquisition strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Cable One’s leadership emphasized improvements in customer acquisition and retention, with sequential gains in broadband connects and a disciplined approach to network upgrades and mobile rollout. Management remains focused on defending its customer base, executing new product launches, integrating the pending MBI acquisition, and maintaining a strong balance sheet. The company continues to navigate a highly competitive landscape, prioritizing operational discipline and long-term value creation for shareholders.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/cabo/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

(SEER) Q4 2025  </p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Omid Farokhzad reported Q4 revenue of $4.2 million, bringing full-year 2025 revenue to $16.6 million, which he noted represented 17% year-over-year growth. He attributed underperformance this quarter to \"ongoing budgetary pressures, including uncertainty around NIH funding in the fourth quarter that have continued to impact customer spending decisions.\"</li>\n<li>Farokhzad detailed significant progress for 2025, stating \"our installed base grew significantly. Consumable kit volume increased meaningfully. The Proteograph was selected to power multiple population-scale studies.\" He highlighted a 33% increase in total revenue excluding related party revenue and a near doubling of cumulative publications.</li>\n<li>The CEO announced a new $25 million share repurchase authorization, following the repurchase of 5.3 million shares in 2025, reducing total outstanding shares by 13% since program inception.</li>\n<li>Farokhzad emphasized product advancements, specifically the Proteograph ONE assay and SP200 automation instrument, saying \"more than 1,000 samples per week can be run on the Proteograph ONE, representing nearly a tenfold increase from the 112 samples per week we achieved in 2021.\"</li>\n<li>He also introduced the development of the fourth generation Proteograph Analysis Suite (PAS), set for release later in the year, with AI capabilities to enable chat-based data interaction. Additionally, he outlined plans to launch a proteoform profiling assay kit in 2027 and a next-generation detector for deep unbiased proteomics.</li>\n<li>CFO David Horn stated, \"Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2025 was $4.2 million, representing an increase of 5% compared to $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 and was primarily due to higher product revenue.\"</li>\n<li>Horn highlighted cost controls, noting \"total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2025 were $19.6 million, including $3.2 million of stock-based compensation, a decrease of 23% compared to $25.5 million, including $6 million of stock-based compensation in the fourth quarter of 2024.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Seer expects 2026 revenue in the range of $16 million to $18 million, with CFO Horn explaining, \"At the midpoint, our guidance reflects ongoing pressure on instrument placements and new project funding since customers remain cautious with new expenditures in the current uncertain funding environment, especially as it relates to NIH funding.\"</li>\n<li>Management indicated that \"our guidance does not include contributions from additional population scale studies that we may announce in 2026, which would represent upside to our guidance range if they occur.\"</li>\n<li>CEO Farokhzad described the guidance as \"guarded,\" citing the need for clear momentum before increasing projections and referencing \"lumpy quarters\" due to the small number of high-value deals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Total Q4 revenue was $4.2 million, with product revenue of $2.8 million and service revenue of $1.2 million. No related party revenue was recognized in Q4.</li>\n<li>Gross profit for Q4 was $2.2 million, with a gross margin of 52%.

Free cash flow loss for 2025 was $45.6 million, with expectations to reduce this loss in 2026.</li>\n<li>The Board adopted a tax benefit preservation plan to protect $262 million in net operating loss carryforwards.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Kyle Boucher, TD Cowen, asked about the Q4 revenue shortfall and whether delays impacted results. Horn answered, \"there was some NIH funding around some projects that got delayed that was supposed to be paid in '25 and didn't, got pushed into this year.\"</li>\n<li>Boucher inquired about the rationale for 2026 guidance given recent momentum. Farokhzad said, \"the guide may seem conservative. I think the challenge we have is that until I see a very clear momentum, we want to be guarded in the way we see our revenue projections.\" Horn added, \"the guide does assume we kind of have a difficult NIH environment remaining as far as we can see.\"</li>\n<li>Boucher asked about barriers to adoption beyond funding. Farokhzad responded that \"the data that's coming from the customers is reflected on the publications that are coming. The biological insight that comes when you do untargeted proteomics at scale is profound.\" He underscored the need for more evidence and publications to drive wider adoption.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed management on revenue shortfalls, guidance conservatism, and adoption barriers, maintaining a neutral to slightly negative tone as they probed reasons for slower growth and future visibility.</li>\n<li>Management conveyed confidence in long-term opportunity but acknowledged near-term challenges, with Farokhzad stating \"the tailwind is getting stronger and stronger, despite the ongoing headwind of the macro picture.\" The tone was measured, particularly when discussing guidance and customer adoption.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, analyst tone shifted from cautious optimism to more pointed concerns about growth trajectory, while management’s outlook became more conservative, emphasizing prudence and evidence-based forecasting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue growth slowed, with Q4 2025 revenue at $4.2 million compared to $4.1 million in Q3, and annual guidance for 2026 ($16 million to $18 million) below the prior full-year target.</li>\n<li>Installed base growth and consumable volumes remained strong, but management’s tone around guidance shifted from expecting strong growth to emphasizing caution due to persistent NIH funding uncertainties.</li>\n<li>Analysts in both quarters focused on instrument placements, large-scale study opportunities, and funding headwinds, but current questions revealed heightened concern over whether recent momentum can sustain higher growth.</li>\n<li>Management reiterated commitment to innovation and highlighted a new search for a Chief Commercial Officer as a forthcoming organizational change.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Persistent uncertainty around NIH and government funding remains a key challenge, directly impacting customer purchasing decisions and timing of orders.</li>\n<li>Management’s mitigation strategies include expanding volume-based pricing, strategic programs like SIPP and STAC to lower adoption barriers, and a new tax benefit preservation plan.</li>\n<li>Analyst concerns centered on the lumpy nature of quarterly results, conservatism in guidance, and the need for more widespread customer adoption to drive sustained growth.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Seer’s management highlighted solid progress in expanding its installed base, advancing product innovation, and maintaining a strong cash position, but emphasized caution in revenue guidance for 2026 amid ongoing NIH funding uncertainties and elongated sales cycles. The company is investing in next-generation technology and has expanded its share repurchase program, while continuing to focus on lowering adoption barriers and capturing new market opportunities as customer evidence and validation build. Investors are closely watching for concrete signs that accelerating scientific adoption and product validation will translate into sustained and material revenue growth.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/seer/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

The company repurchased 1.7 million shares in Q4 for $22.4 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Joseph Gallo, Jefferies: Asked about ARR guidance visibility and product drivers. CFO Caci responded, \"we have this consistent kind of growth across all 3 regions... We see nice pipeline building across all of those metrics.\"</li>\n<li>Gallo followed up on AI revenue realization. CEO Jiang responded, \"we are seeing enterprises, actually all have AI projects and deliver realizations around efficiency... But these are the exact kind of problems we address for our customers and partners.\"</li>\n<li>Chirag Ved, Evercore: Inquired about hybrid pricing strategy and early feedback. Jiang explained the move toward capacity-based licensing and noted no major seat count reduction yet due to a mix of consumption and virtual AI agent licensing.</li>\n<li>Rudy Kessinger, D.A. Davidson: Requested color on net new ARR seasonality. Caci stated, \"Q1 is generally a step down sequentially from Q4, and it's usually our lowest quarter in terms of ARR... we feel really good about where we're going to land for Q1 and really the year.\"</li>\n<li>Jason Ader, William Blair: Asked about free cash flow. Caci cited one-time tax payments and timing of invoicing as primary factors, adding, \"I think our free cash flow is still going to be above what we would consider our non-GAAP operating income.\"</li>\n<li>William Vandrick, Scotiabank: Queried the shift in ARR contribution from Control Suite. Caci attributed it to increased migration activity, and Jiang said, \"average deal size of a control license sale is actually lower than the other modules, but it is our highest margin product.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed for more granularity on guidance drivers, ARR pacing, and product mix shifts, reflecting a slightly positive but analytical tone with a focus on sustainability and execution.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and upbeat tone during prepared remarks and Q&amp;A, repeatedly expressing strong conviction in both the market opportunity and AvePoint’s ability to deliver growth.

So excluding it, GRR would have been 90%.\"</li>\n<li>The company expects slower growth in services revenue and flat term license revenue in 2026.</li>\n<li>There is an explicit focus on managing stock-based compensation and investing in marketing while maintaining profitability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>AvePoint management reiterated that the company’s durable growth is driven by rising demand for secure data governance and AI readiness across industries and geographies. With a robust pipeline, advancing platform innovation, and a new investment cycle targeting expanded market reach, AvePoint projects continued double-digit ARR and revenue growth in 2026, reinforcing its commitment to profitable growth and long-term shareholder value.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/avpt/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Autodesk (ADSK) Q4 2026</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Andrew Anagnost opened by highlighting the company delivered “strong fiscal '26 results today with billings, revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share and free cash flow, all above the high end of our guidance ranges.” Anagnost emphasized the completion of the final phase of Autodesk’s go-to-market optimization, calling it “one of the most far-reaching transformations in enterprise software,” enabling resilience and unlocking new growth and margin opportunities. He underscored the rollout of cloud-based platforms and AI capabilities, stating, “Autodesk is building the future and the path to it for our customers.”</li>\n<li>CFO Janesh Moorjani reported, “Q4 was another robust quarter for Autodesk, capping off a strong fiscal year. Autodesk continues to demonstrate growth and resilience, investing to advance our leadership in cloud platform and AI while also expanding operating margins.” He noted, “Total revenue in the fourth quarter grew 19% as reported and in constant currency,” and explained the impact of the new transaction model on billings and revenue. Moorjani also remarked on capital allocation, with $333 million in share repurchases for the quarter and $1.4 billion for the year.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Moorjani stated, “For fiscal '27, our billings guidance range is $8.48 billion to $8.58 billion. Our revenue guidance range is $8.1 billion to $8.17 billion. Our GAAP operating margin guidance range is 26% to 28%. Our non-GAAP operating margin guidance range is 38.5% to 39%. Our free cash flow guidance range is $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion.” He highlighted that the guidance reflects “the potential for disruption again in fiscal '27” due to restructuring focused on customer-facing sales functions and embedded this risk “discretely into our guidance.”</li>\n<li>Management expects “billings to be slightly more weighted towards the second half of the year” due to anticipated short-term disruption from restructuring and the timing of large EBA cohorts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fourth quarter total revenue increased 19% as reported and in constant currency. The new transaction model contributed $137 million to revenue in the quarter. Excluding this, revenue grew 14% in constant currency. Billings rose 33% as reported, with a $185 million boost from the new transaction model.</li>\n<li>Fourth quarter GAAP operating margin was 22%, with non-GAAP operating margin at 38%. Moorjani stated, “Fourth quarter free cash flow of $972 million benefited from overall billings strength as well as the linearity of billings in the quarter.”</li>\n<li>The company repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares in Q4, totaling $333 million. For the year, share repurchases amounted to $1.4 billion, reducing shares outstanding by 2.1 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Saket Kalia, Barclays: Asked about Autodesk’s position in the AI ecosystem and competitive moats related to LLMs. Anagnost responded, “It's not our goal to compete with the core capabilities of what the frontier models are good at. What our goal is, is to ensure that the combination of what the frontier models do, what an LLM does and what our proprietary foundation models do is always better than what a frontier model can do alone.”</li>\n<li>Jay Vleeschhouwer, Griffin Securities: Inquired about the development of Forma versus Revit and integration of World Labs technology. Anagnost explained, “Forma and the whole stack around Forma, from design to make, is going to be very much focused on the cloud and AI-enabled tools. Everyone is going to have access to the workflow tools, the agentic layer, that's the Autodesk Assistant.”</li>\n<li>Jason Celino, KeyBanc: Asked about the impact of AI-driven efficiency on industry headcount and Autodesk’s growth. Anagnost said, “We absolutely want fewer people per project because we want our customers executing more projects. There's plenty of demand for projects out there. So at a kind of a task-based automation level... the kinds of things that you're seeing us do right now around speeding up modeling activity and things like that, that's kind of improving the core value of a seat of software.”</li>\n<li>Bhavin Shah, Deutsche Bank: Sought clarity on mitigating sales organization disruption. Moorjani stated, “We did put operational guardrails in place with the partners to try and avoid that kind of activity... we actually saw those work quite effectively. There are some early renewals that happen every year. But here in Q4, those were not remarkably different than what we typically see.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts focused on AI monetization, the impact of go-to-market changes, and the sustainability of growth, often pressing for specifics around guidance prudence and risks, reflecting a slightly skeptical but engaged tone.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and forward-looking tone in prepared remarks, with Anagnost stating, “I've never been more confident in the long-term value we are creating for our customers, for the industries that shape the world and for you, our shareholders.” During Q&amp;A, responses remained detailed but occasionally defensive, especially when addressing restructuring risks and AI impact.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone shifted from emphasizing resilience in a stable macro environment to increased confidence in operational execution and the ability to navigate restructuring challenges.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The current quarter’s guidance is more explicit about embedded risks from restructuring, while last quarter’s guidance reflected broader macroeconomic caution and included additional prudence for new executive appointments.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus continues on AI, cloud platforms, and expanding operational footprint, but the latest call included more detail on monetizing AI and consumption-based models.</li>\n<li>Analysts’ questions this quarter centered more on sales structure changes, AI competitive positioning, and the practical effects of automation on customer behavior, compared to last quarter’s focus on growth mechanics and channel evolution.</li>\n<li>Key metrics, such as revenue and billings growth, accelerated from the prior quarter, while the company focused on transitioning to new business models and capital allocation consistency.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management flagged “the potential for disruption again in fiscal '27” due to restructuring, specifically as it affects customer-facing sales roles.</li>\n<li>Moorjani described how the company “embedded this risk discretely into our guidance for fiscal '27.”</li>\n<li>Operational guardrails were implemented with partners to minimize disruptive transaction timing and early renewals, with management noting only typical renewal activity in Q4.</li>\n<li>Analysts expressed concern over the impact of sales optimization and AI-driven automation on Autodesk’s growth and customer capacity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Autodesk’s leadership is projecting confidence in its ability to drive growth and profitability through continued investment in AI, cloud platforms, and sales optimization. The company’s fiscal 2027 guidance reflects anticipated near-term disruption from restructuring, balanced by strong business momentum, an expanding operational footprint, and a disciplined approach to risk and capital allocation. Management highlights that their investments in AI and platform capabilities, combined with a resilient go-to-market structure, position Autodesk for long-term value creation for both customers and shareholders.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/adsk/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

(NTAP) Q3 2026</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO George Kurian opened the call highlighting a strong quarter, reporting \"Q3 revenue of $1.71 billion, an increase of 4% year-over-year. Excluding the divested Spot business, total revenue was up 6%.\" He pointed to accelerating growth and record highs in operating income and EPS, with the company \"on track to deliver our strongest year yet.\"</li>\n<li>Kurian emphasized NetApp's role during Super Bowl LX, where their technology \"transformed Levi's Stadium into an interactive data center,\" managing billions of data points for real-time operations. He described this as a marquee moment showcasing NetApp's reliability in high-demand settings.</li>\n<li>The CEO cited customer traction in AI, with \"approximately 300 customers selected NetApp to help prepare their data for AI and to be the storage foundation for their AI innovations.\" Major enhancements to NetApp's AI platform, including AFX and the AI Data Engine (AIDE), are capturing significant interest: \"AFX is our disaggregated storage system purpose-built for AI... strong early momentum with AFX, in its first quarter of shipment.\"</li>\n<li>Kurian discussed the company's all-flash array portfolio, noting all-flash array revenue reached a record and grew 11% year-over-year to $1 billion in Q3. Keystone, its storage-as-a-service offering, saw revenue grow about 65% from Q3 a year ago.</li>\n<li>The CEO highlighted \"Public Cloud Services revenue grew 17% year-over-year, driven by first-party and marketplace services, which grew 27%\" (excluding Spot). About half of this revenue came from new-to-NetApp customers, underscoring cloud as a driver for customer acquisition.</li>\n<li>Addressing the inflation in memory prices, Kurian stated, \"we have raised our pricing and will do so again, as needed,\" while emphasizing agility, supplier partnerships, and portfolio breadth as mitigation strategies.</li>\n<li>CFO Wissam Jabre stated, \"we delivered strong results, exceeding both the midpoint of the revenue guidance range and the high-end of the EPS guidance range. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.71 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.12, up 11% year-over-year.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The CFO provided Q4 guidance: \"We expect revenue of $1.87 billion, plus or minus $75 million. At the midpoint, this implies a growth of 8% year-over-year... We expect Q4 gross margin to be between 69.5% and 70.5%. Operating margin is anticipated to be in the range of 30.5% to 31.5%. We expect EPS to be between $2.21 and $2.31.\"</li>\n<li>For the full year 2026, \"we now expect fiscal year 2026 revenue to be between $6.772 billion and $6.922 billion, which at the $6.847 billion midpoint, reflects 4% growth year-over-year... EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.92 to $8.02.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hybrid Cloud revenue was $1.54 billion, up 5% year-over-year, while Public Cloud revenue reached $174 million.

Kurian responded that large deals worked on for many quarters closed in Q3, with more expected in Q4.</li>\n<li>Singh, Oppenheimer: Questioned product gross margin management amid pricing pressures. Jabre explained, \"we do have agility and the ability also to manage the situation through either adjusting prices, working with our customers and partners to be more agile.\"</li>\n<li>Katherine Murphy, Goldman Sachs: Inquired about the 300 AI deals and mix of use cases. Kurian noted strong momentum across industries and early success with AFX in neoclouds, but cautioned AFX adoption ramp would differ from past products.</li>\n<li>Samik Chatterjee, JPMorgan: Asked about the magnitude and customer response to price increases. Kurian pointed out, \"We raised prices at the start of this quarter... customers budget in dollars, not in systems, and those dollars are tied to their IT spending priorities.\"</li>\n<li>Aaron Rakers, Wells Fargo: Probed supply chain and pricing environment for NAND flash. Jabre said they are \"still mostly covered from our prebuys that we did earlier in the fiscal year,\" with some open market purchases in Q3.</li>\n<li>Multiple analysts focused on memory pricing impacts, customer behavior regarding hybrid versus all-flash storage, and margin sustainability. Management repeated their focus on flexibility, value-delivery, and managing supplier relationships.</li>\n<li>Wamsi Mohan, BofA: Asked about supply availability and negotiation dynamics for SSDs. Kurian replied, \"We are not experiencing any supply shortages at this time and are not aware of any that is upcoming.\"</li>\n<li>Erik Woodring, Morgan Stanley: Questioned gross margin sustainability amid memory inflation. Kurian said, \"we anticipate pricing and the sort of the tight supply environment to continue for a period of time.\"</li>\n<li>Several analysts asked about AI storage adoption cycle, with Kurian stating, \"roughly 60% were still in the data prep, data readiness, data lake models and 40% were in production, training or production inferencing use cases.\"</li>\n<li>There were frequent queries on the competitive environment, with Kurian noting, \"most of the players in the market are rational... everybody is roughly in the same boat in terms of the cost structure.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed management on the sustainability of growth drivers, price increases, memory supply, and mix shifts, generally maintaining a neutral to slightly cautious tone given supply and pricing pressures.</li>\n<li>Management's tone was confident in prepared remarks, emphasizing record results and operational discipline, but became measured and sometimes defensive in Q&amp;A, especially on questions about gross margins and supply risks. Phrases such as \"it's too early to draw a trend\" and \"we are not experiencing any supply shortages at this time\" reflected caution.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, analysts’ tone remained probing on supply chain and pricing issues, while management’s confidence remained steady, with more emphasis on navigating dynamic memory pricing and supply.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Q3 showed continued acceleration in AI and cloud, with 300 AI deals versus 200 in Q2, and all-flash array revenue growth rising from 9% to 11% year-over-year.</li>\n<li>Guidance for Q4 revenue growth increased to 8% year-over-year, compared to Q3's 3% growth guidance in the prior quarter.</li>\n<li>Gross margin guidance for Q4 (69.5%-70.5%) is below Q3’s reported 71.2% and the prior quarter’s guidance, reflecting memory cost pressures and revenue mix changes.</li>\n<li>Management and analysts continued to focus on memory cost inflation, supply chain agility, and customer purchasing trends, with more pointed questions on margin sustainability.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus remained on AI, cloud, and Keystone, while management highlighted new capabilities and sustained customer acquisition in cloud.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management repeatedly cited inflation in memory prices, with Kurian stating the need for continued price adjustments and supply chain agility.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about the sustainability of gross margins and the impact of further memory price hikes.</li>\n<li>Management outlined mitigation strategies: price increases, multi-supplier qualification, operational agility, and offering hybrid arrays for price-sensitive workloads.</li>\n<li>No current supply shortages reported, but the environment remains dynamic.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>NetApp management underscored another record-setting quarter, driven by robust demand for AI, cloud, and all-flash storage, along with disciplined operational execution. The company raised its full-year outlook and Q4 guidance, citing strong momentum in new AI wins and cloud customer acquisition. Management emphasized active strategies to manage memory price inflation and supply chain dynamics, supporting their confidence in delivering sustained growth and long-term shareholder value.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ntap/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

Based on our current operating plan and anticipated milestones, we believe our cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2025, will be sufficient to fund operations into 2028.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management anticipates delivering top line data from the Emerge pivotal MDD study in late Q2, with additional Phase III readouts for GAD and MDD expected throughout 2026. Barrow indicated, \"With 3 Phase III readouts expected in 2026, the first of which is just months away, we expect the year ahead to be a pivotal one, both for Definium and psychiatry at large.\" </li>\n<li>Plans were confirmed to provide further enrollment updates and disclose additional trial progress at the upcoming Investor and Analyst Day in April.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Roberts detailed, \"Research and development expenses were $117.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2025, compared to $65.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, representing an increase of $52.4 million.\" She added that general and administrative expenses rose to $48.6 million from $38.6 million year-over-year. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2025, was $183.8 million compared to $108.7 million for the previous year.</li>\n<li>The company reported, \"During 2025, the change in fair value was $22.8 million, reflecting an increase in our stock price from $6.96 at December 31, 2024, to $13.39 at December 31, 2025.\"</li>\n<li>Roberts emphasized, \"We are pleased to enter 2026 with the financial flexibility to accelerate several key initiatives, including NDA preparation, market access priority activities, market research and KOL education.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Lin Tsai, Jefferies LLC, Research Division: For this interim that you did, it's very interesting for Voyage. I'm curious in the hypothetical scenario where the DMC asked or recommended you to upsize the trial, what would have been effectively the placebo-adjusted delta for that to happen, give or take? And just to confirm, there were no other scenarios with this interim such as stopping for futility or even stopping for success? Barrow: \"It was a blinded sample size re-estimation... there's no implication. There's no learnings or inference that can be derived either from this analysis or for any other outcome of the analysis.\"</li>\n<li>Basma Radwan Ibrahim, Leerink Partners LLC: Have you conducted the interim look for Panorama as well or not yet? And -- or are you planning to do it once you hit 80% enrollment similar to Voyage? And also regarding the MDD, when are you going to plan to do the interim look exactly for the Emerge trial? Barrow: \"For Panorama, our second pivotal study in GAD, we'll be sharing additional details and enrollment updates at our Analyst Day in April. For the 2 MDD studies, of course, Emerge is now fully enrolled and the data -- top line data that we'd be sharing would be the completed final top line analysis from that study.\"</li>\n<li>Brian Abrahams, RBC Capital Markets: Can you maybe elaborate a little bit more on your latest views on clinically meaningful delta? And really how would hitting stat sig with a smaller delta potentially impact your plans in Panorama as well as how you'd see the drug positioned commercially? Barrow: \"When it comes down to that placebo-adjusted change... if we're seeing a magnitude of change that's as large or larger than those and the placebo-adjusted change that's larger than 4 points, it's hard not to get incredibly excited about that in our mind.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts displayed a mix of curiosity and cautious optimism, seeking clarity on statistical power, clinical meaningfulness, and regulatory strategy.

Prepared remarks were more upbeat, while Q&amp;A responses revealed more caution, especially regarding margin headwinds and adoption cycles.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, analyst sentiment continues to focus on commercial growth and operational improvements, while management remains consistently confident but slightly more specific about operational priorities and timing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance for 2026 introduces a new revenue target of $112 million to $115 million, up from 2025’s $96.2 million result and higher than the prior quarter’s guidance of $95 million to $96 million.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus shifted from completing the portfolio optimization (evo divestiture) in Q3 to expanding cross-sell and partnership strategies, especially with the QKine agreement in Q4.</li>\n<li>Analysts in both quarters focused on commercial growth, margin expansion, and the impact of macro and sector-specific dynamics, though the Q4 call included more detail on operational challenges (bag yields) and new partnership initiatives.</li>\n<li>Management’s tone remained confident but provided more operational detail and specific timelines for resolving issues and launching new products in Q4.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management flagged bag yield issues as a 2- to 3-point headwind on gross margin in the second half of 2025, with a remediation plan expected to take effect by Q4 2026.</li>\n<li>hPL media business was flat year-over-year due to import restrictions in China, though the issue has since abated.</li>\n<li>R&amp;D expenses increased due to higher headcount and investment in key projects.</li>\n<li>Commercial revenue concentration continues, with top 20 BPM customers accounting for roughly 80% of BPM revenue, which management sees as providing visibility but could pose a concentration risk.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>BioLife Solutions management expects 2026 to deliver another year of strong revenue growth, expanding operating margins, and improved profitability, supported by an increased focus on commercial customers, cross-selling initiatives, and new strategic partnerships. The company remains committed to operational excellence and leveraging its leadership position in the CGT market to drive sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/blfs/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

He stated, \"We made important progress on several fronts... accomplished key strategic brand divestitures and completed our important corporate reorganization.\" Nuzzo emphasized the company’s leading market position, noting, \"We are 7x the size of the next largest Pilates competitor... and one of the top brands in yoga and stretch.\"</li>\n<li>Nuzzo acknowledged recent challenges, including \"sales growth started to moderate beginning in late 2024 and into 2025\" and \"marketing and lead management missteps that contributed to member top-of-funnel challenges,\" which affected same-store sales, especially at Club Pilates. To address these, he announced renewed investments in member acquisition at the studio level and improvements in franchisee recruiting, international expansion, and digital platforms.</li>\n<li>CFO John Meloun reported, \"We ended the quarter with 3,097 global open studios, opening 78 gross new studios during Q4 with 51 in North America and 27 internationally.\" He added, \"Revenue for the quarter was $83 million, flat from the prior year period.

Dorsey responded, \"There's a few things that have all been compounding towards this moment... as we functionalized, it allowed us to act more like one company...

A big part of me wanting to do this right now is I wanted to get ahead of it.\"</li>\n<li>Darrin Peller, Wolfe Research: Inquired about sustaining momentum post-headcount reduction.
