She remarked, \"Fred will continue to play a role in our evaluation of potential organic and inorganic opportunities.\"</li>\n<li>Aronson reported Q3 total revenue of $384.2 million, a 13% year-over-year increase on a GAAP basis, and constant currency revenue growth that \"exceeded the high end of the range of the growth expectations that were outlined on the Q2 2025 earnings call.\"</li>\n<li>Aronson called out the launch and milestones for key products including the Prelude Wave hydrophilic sheath introducer and Embosphere Microspheres, as well as the worldwide use of Scout Radar localization technology for breast cancer.</li>\n<li>With respect to WRAPSODY CIE, Aronson said, \"Our Renal Therapies group has been impressively executing the U.S. commercial strategy... and they continue to exceed our expectations.\" She detailed progress with reimbursement strategies in both inpatient and outpatient settings.</li>\n<li>The company announced an agreement to acquire the C2 CryoBalloon technology for $22 million, intended to \"strengthen our position in the multibillion-dollar gastroenterology market.\"</li>\n<li>CFO Raul Parra stated, \"Third quarter total revenue growth was driven primarily by 13% growth in our Cardiovascular segment and to a lesser extent, 4% growth in our Endoscopy segment.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2025 guidance was updated to reflect strong Q3 performance: GAAP net revenue growth is projected at 11% to 12% year-over-year, with constant currency revenue growth in the range of 10.3% to 11.2%.</li>\n<li>Aronson affirmed, \"We remain focused on delivering continued strong execution, solid constant currency growth and strong free cash flow generation in 2025.\"</li>\n<li>Parra updated 2025 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to a range of $3.66 to $3.79, up from the prior range of $3.52 to $3.72.

Parra credited focused sales groups and integration of the Cook acquisition, adding SG&amp;A increases were partly due to \"variable bonus accrual, truing that up to kind of the year-to-date performance.\"</li>\n<li>Additional questions covered Endoscopy integration, China market softness, capital allocation, and regulatory developments.

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Axos Financial (AX) Q1 2026  </p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Gregory Garrabrants reported \"a strong start to our fiscal 2026, generating $1.6 billion of net loan growth linked quarter, including $1 billion of loans and leases and on-balance sheet securitizations acquired in the Verdant acquisition, which closed on September 30, 2025.\" Garrabrants highlighted a 17% year-over-year increase in book value per share and noted \"nearly 16% return on average common equity and the 1.8% return on average assets in the 3 months ended September 30, 2025.\"</li>\n<li>Garrabrants emphasized the completion of the Verdant Commercial Capital acquisition, stating \"we paid a modest 10% premium on the roughly $40 million of book value of Verdant at September 30. The seller will also have an opportunity to earn up to $50 million over the next 4 years if the business generates a greater than 15% return on equity on an annual and cumulative basis.\"</li>\n<li>CFO Derrick Walsh stated, \"Noninterest expenses were approximately $156 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2025, up by $5.6 million from the 3 months ended June 30, 2025. Excluding approximately $1.3 million of deal-related expenses from the Verdant acquisition in September, total noninterest expenses were up by approximately $4.3 million on the linked quarter.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Garrabrants stated, \"We expect the Verdant acquisition to add an incremental $150 million to $200 million of net new loans and operating leases per quarter at attractive spreads starting in the second quarter of this fiscal year ending December 31.\"</li>\n<li>Management expects loan growth \"to come in at the low to mid-teens range on an annual basis in the remaining 9 months of our fiscal year 2026.\"</li>\n<li>Walsh provided further guidance: \"We expect the combination of strong originations from our commercial lending businesses, growing contributions from incubator businesses such as floor plan lending, slowing prepayments in our multifamily lending business and incremental contributions from the Verdant equipment finance business to drive loan growth in the low to mid-teens year-over-year growth over the next 12 months.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Net interest income was $291 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, representing an increase of approximately $11 million linked quarter. Net interest margin was 4.75% for the quarter, down 9 basis points from 4.84% in the previous quarter. Excluding excess liquidity, net interest margin was approximately flat quarter-over-quarter.</li>\n<li>Noninterest income increased by approximately 13% year-over-year due to higher banking service fees, mortgage banking income and prepayment penalty fees.</li>\n<li>Net income was approximately $112.4 million in the quarter, up from $110.7 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2025. Diluted EPS was $1.94 for the quarter compared to $1.92 in the June quarter.</li>\n<li>Adjusted net income and adjusted EPS, excluding deal-related expenses and allowance for credit loss adjustment for the Verdant acquisition, were $119 million and $2.06 per share, respectively, for the quarter ended September 30.</li>\n<li>Total originations for investment, excluding single-family warehouse lending, were over $4.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, representing an 11% linked quarter increase.</li>\n<li>Total on-balance sheet deposits increased 6.9% year-over-year to $22.3 billion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Kyle Peterson, Needham &amp; Company: Questioned credit quality and emerging risks. Garrabrants responded that Axos turned down problematic deals, stating \"in late stages of credit cycles, people sometimes get pretty sloppy on structure.\"</li>\n<li>Peterson asked about fee income sustainability. Walsh clarified, \"nothing from the fee income that was a one-timer in this past quarter from the Verdant profile. The expectation is a few million dollars will come through in that noninterest income line item as we look forward.\"</li>\n<li>Gary Tenner, D.A. Davidson, inquired about funding costs relating to the Verdant acquisition. Walsh answered, \"It's a little north or about 5.5%, and they have a 3.7% weighted average in years.\"</li>\n<li>Tenner also asked about the balance of average purchase loans. Walsh explained, \"we had a big bump of $12 million in the gain on sale in the mortgage banking last quarter...so that's why the average balance was much higher for your purchase loans in the June quarter.\"</li>\n<li>Kelly Motta, KBW, raised questions about capital ratios and acquisition appetite. Garrabrants said, \"we feel very good about the capital ratios where they are and even having them go down a bit.\"</li>\n<li>David Feaster, Raymond James, requested an update on NDFI risk management. Garrabrants provided a detailed breakdown of risk controls and monitoring practices, particularly in relation to fraud and collateral verification.</li>\n<li>Timothy Coffey, Janney Montgomery Scott, asked about expense modeling. Garrabrants replied, \"our personnel expense and professional services growth will be -- the growth will be below 30% of the net interest income and noninterest income growth.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed on credit risk, capital levels, and acquisition integration, reflecting a slightly cautious tone with detailed requests for risk management explanations and capital planning.</li>\n<li>Management displayed confidence, particularly in addressing credit quality and integration of the Verdant acquisition. Garrabrants repeatedly emphasized a disciplined approach and low risk tolerance, stating, \"we feel very good about the capital ratios where they are,\" and highlighting risk mitigation strategies.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management were more focused on acquisition impacts and risk controls, with less emphasis on margin pressure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management increased its loan growth guidance from \"mid- to high end of our single-digit and low teens range\" to \"low to mid-teens range\" annually following the Verdant acquisition.</li>\n<li>The completion of the Verdant acquisition represents a significant strategic shift from the prior quarter, with new contributions to loan and lease growth.</li>\n<li>Net interest margin declined from 4.84% to 4.75%, while net interest income and deposits continued to rise.</li>\n<li>Analyst questions shifted from margin and deposit growth to credit risk, capital adequacy, and acquisition integration, reflecting the increased scale and complexity of operations.</li>\n<li>Management confidence remained steady, with increased emphasis on risk management and capital sufficiency.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management identified potential risks in credit cycle deterioration, loan structure slippage, and fraud, particularly referencing \"lender-on-lender violence language\" and document forgery risks.</li>\n<li>Garrabrants detailed ongoing vigilance and controls, stating, \"we do a good job with it, but we're continually on guard because people come up with new and interesting ways of doing bad things.\"</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns regarding funding costs, capital ratios, and acquisition integration, all of which management addressed with detailed explanations and reaffirmed confidence in mitigation strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Axos Financial entered fiscal 2026 with robust loan growth, driven by the strategic Verdant acquisition and continued expansion in commercial lending and deposit gathering. Management projects loan growth in the low to mid-teens annually for the remainder of the year, supported by enhanced distribution channels and a disciplined approach to risk and expenses. The company remains focused on operational leverage, capital strength, and further strategic opportunities, positioning itself for sustained profitability and growth.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ax/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Arthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co. (AJG) Q3 2025  </p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO J. Gallagher opened by emphasizing, \"We had a terrific and obviously very active third quarter. Our two-pronged revenue growth strategy, that's organic and M&amp;A, delivered revenue growth of 20%. In fact, over the last 30 quarters, we've delivered double-digit top line growth 26 times. This is now our 19th straight quarter of double-digit growth.\" He highlighted the momentum from the AssuredPartners acquisition, stating, \"The early days of the AssuredPartners folks coming together with the Gallagher team is off to a terrific start. Already, we're selling together. We're showing that we are better by being together.\"</li>\n<li>CEO Gallagher detailed segment performance: Brokerage segment reported revenue growth of 22% with 4.5% organic. Adjusted EBITDAC margin was flat year-over-year at 33.5%, but underlying margin expansion was 60 basis points when excluding M&amp;A and interest income. Retail P&amp;C in the U.S. achieved organic growth of more than 7%, while international was flat. Employee Benefits saw around 1% organic growth. Wholesale and specialty businesses delivered 5% organic growth, and reinsurance was in the high single digits. \"AP's third quarter organic was 5%. That really shows you that a terrific sales-driven culture is joining our team.\"</li>\n<li>On the insurance pricing environment, he explained, \"Property down 5%; casualty lines up 6% overall, including general liability up 4%, commercial auto up 5% and umbrella up 8%; U.S. casualty lines are up 8%.\" He noted persistent trends across lines and bifurcation by client size.</li>\n<li>For the Risk Management segment, Gallagher reported, \"Third quarter revenue growth was 8%, including organic of 6.7%. We saw strong new business revenue and excellent client retention in the third quarter and believe these favorable dynamics will continue through the end of the year.\"</li>\n<li>Regarding M&amp;A, Gallagher described the AssuredPartners integration, saying, \"Since the mid-August close, dozens of Gallagher leaders and hundreds of others have been traveling to AP offices and hosting gatherings. We've been sharing our stories with thousands of our new colleagues and highlighting all the tools and expertise that is now at their fingertips.\"</li>\n<li>CFO Douglas Howell stated, \"Over the last 30 days, we finally got usable AP data down to the customer level detail. That gave us the policy inception data necessary to implement our 606 accounting and harmonize revenue accounting methods. ... the new detail did not change our annual view of revenue or EBITDAC. Second, however, it did reveal that AP's business is much more seasonally skewed than we could previously estimate.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Gallagher stated, \"As we sit today, we are seeing Brokerage segment fourth quarter organic of around 5%, which would bring our full year organic to more than 6%.\"</li>\n<li>For Risk Management, Gallagher said, \"Accordingly, we expect about 7% organic growth in the fourth quarter.\"</li>\n<li>CFO Howell added, \"Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we see organic around 5%. ... If we were to deliver fourth quarter organic around 5%, we would finish the year with organic above 6%.\"</li>\n<li>Howell reiterated, \"We still see annualized run rate synergies of $160 million by the end of '26 and $260 million to $280 million by early '28.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Gallagher reported, \"EPS for our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments, we posted GAAP EPS of $1.76 and adjusted EPS of $2.87. That would have been $0.22 higher had we levelized for the intra-quarter revenue seasonality related to AssuredPartners that we closed on August 18.\"</li>\n<li>CFO Howell explained, \"Brokerage segment organic growth of 4.5%. That's about $11 million of less revenues than our September IR Day thinking. Half of that relates to those lumpy life sales that didn't get closed. ... The other half or so relates to contingents.\"</li>\n<li>For Risk Management, Howell said, \"Risk Management segment organic growth was 6.7%. That was in line with our expectations, and that resulted due to strong new business revenues and excellent retention. ... Adjusted EBITDAC margin of 21.8% was better than our September IR Day expectations.\"</li>\n<li>Howell stated, \"Revenue up 17%, net earnings up 27%, EBITDAC up 25%, organic year-to-date at 6.6% and EBITDAC margin over 36%.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo: Asked about synergy treatment in organic revenue. CFO Howell: \"If we pick up some more on the AssuredPartners book of business, that would not -- that would understate organic revenues.\"</li>\n<li>Greenspan: Asked for organic outlook for 2026. CFO Howell: \"We still believe that. Early indications that we're having terrific success in our Reinsurance business. We're having terrific success in our P&amp;C businesses.\"</li>\n<li>Greenspan: On M&amp;A pipeline post-AP acquisition. CEO Gallagher: \"We're going to have most of their folks in the field come to the home office over the next 1.5 months or so. ... That pipeline has not been yet put into our pipeline report.\"</li>\n<li>Andrew Kligerman, TD Cowen: Questioned organic growth expectations in the current pricing environment. CFO Howell: \"I think where we top up on that is because of our wholesale business that performs well, our programs. ... we've got our reinsurance business.\"</li>\n<li>Charles Peters, Raymond James: Asked about $160 million of synergies. CFO Howell: \"It's easy for me to always say 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. We're going to get 1/3 for revenue uplift. ... and I think 1/3 of that will come from our operating expenses.\"</li>\n<li>Mark Hughes, Truist Securities: Inquired about Employee Benefits outlook. CFO Howell: \"The fourth quarter is a time where we do a lot of our helping customers enrollment. We see that as pretty strong right now. ... human resource leaders are waking up to the spiraling -- the increasing cost of medical inflation.\"</li>\n<li>Ryan Tunis, Cantor Fitzgerald: Queried about differences from previous cycles. CEO Gallagher: \"Right now, we're dealing with still across all of the lines a positive 4%. ... our data and analytic capabilities. ... Our data lake, OneSource, now actually comprises 3 years of the AP data.\"</li>\n<li>Robert Cox, Goldman Sachs: Asked about reinsurance brokerage growth. CEO Gallagher: \"When we did the Willis transaction, one of the things we told the investment community ... was that we thought there was an advantage of making sure that our retail operations, our wholesale operations and our reinsurance operations were seen together on the same page. ... That has worked to a level that I think is better than any of us expected.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts frequently pressed on guidance precision, synergy realization, pricing environment impacts, and M&amp;A pipeline integration. Questions reflected a neutral to slightly positive tone, with some skepticism around the impact of seasonality and margin pressures.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a positive and confident tone in both prepared remarks and Q&amp;A, repeatedly highlighting operational momentum, \"terrific\" results, and the integration benefits from AssuredPartners. CEO Gallagher and CFO Howell both conveyed a sense of strong forward momentum, though Howell was transparent regarding modeling challenges due to AP seasonality.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone remained upbeat, but analysts seemed more focused on the implementation and integration challenges of the large AssuredPartners acquisition and its effect on margins and organic growth.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance for full-year organic growth shifted from a 6.5%-7.5% range in Q2 to \"more than 6%\" in Q3, indicating slightly more conservative language, likely influenced by seasonality from the AssuredPartners acquisition.</li>\n<li>The AssuredPartners acquisition, closed in Q3, was a key new development, with significant discussion on its integration, seasonality, and synergy realization, compared to Q2 where its closure was still pending.</li>\n<li>Analysts in Q3 were more focused on the practical impacts of the AP integration, while Q2 analysts probed more on pricing and general organic growth run rates.</li>\n<li>Margin expansion discussions in Q2 were more robust, with Q3 management noting \"flat\" headline margin but underlying expansion after adjustments.</li>\n<li>Management's confidence in M&amp;A and future prospects remained steady, but Q3 remarks included more caveats about seasonality and timing in results.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Seasonality of AssuredPartners revenue recognition introduces quarterly volatility, as detailed by CFO Howell: \"AP's business is much more seasonally skewed than we could previously estimate.\"</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about the sustainability of organic growth rates in a shallow pricing environment.</li>\n<li>Large life case timing and contingent commission variability continue to pose headwinds to quarterly organic growth.</li>\n<li>Medical cost inflation and its impact on Employee Benefits was highlighted as a pressure area.</li>\n<li>Integration of the AssuredPartners M&amp;A pipeline and realization of projected synergies remain closely watched.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Arthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co. management emphasized the continuation of double-digit revenue growth, robust organic expansion, and strong early results from the AssuredPartners integration. Despite some quarterly volatility from AP seasonality, the company projects Brokerage organic growth of around 5% for Q4 2025 and expects to finish the year above 6% organic growth. Management highlighted substantial future synergy opportunities and the strength of its platform to support both M&amp;A and organic momentum into 2026, while acknowledging near-term integration and margin headwinds. The company remains bullish on its ability to drive growth and deliver shareholder value through strategic execution and operational discipline.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ajg/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

He emphasized Cloudflare's role in the evolving AI landscape, stating, \"We estimate 80% of the leading AI companies already rely on us.\"</li>\n<li>CFO Thomas Seifert said, \"Revenue growth accelerated for the second consecutive quarter to 31% year-over-year, providing clear evidence of the momentum building in our business... We complemented this robust growth with a highly balanced operating plan, investing significantly in our innovation pipeline and expanding our go-to-market capacity.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul><li>Seifert guided Q4 revenue in the range of $588.5 million to $589.5 million, representing an increase of 28% year-over-year. Operating income is expected in the range of $83 million to $84 million, with diluted net income per share of $0.27.

Prince responded, \"We are transforming from being a product-led growth company to being a true enterprise sales company... you're seeing the large deals tick up.\" Seifert added, \"RPO growth points to primarily 2 drivers, the customer quality and the platform expansion.\"</li>\n<li>Adam Borg, Stifel, inquired about sales productivity gains. Prince said, \"We think that these will continue... the productivity will continue to tick up in coming quarters.\"</li>\n<li>Gabriela Borges, Goldman Sachs, questioned capacity constraints for Workers. Prince responded, \"I don't think we're capacity constrained because of somewhat the nature of how we've architected Cloudflare... we can move workloads to wherever we have capacity anywhere in the world.\"</li>\n<li>Fatima Boolani, Citi, asked about AI-native ecosystem exposure and concentration risk. Prince replied, \"Even though we're excited about AI and AI inference, it is still a relatively de minimis portion of our overall revenue, growing fast, but not -- I don't see any current concentration risk that's there.\"</li>\n<li>Mark Murphy, JPMorgan, asked about quantum-safe security and egress fees. Prince noted, \"We have rolled that out across our entire network for every customer, whether they pay us or not...\" and \"egress fees are the cost that hyperscalers charge you every time your data leaves their system... we believe that a multi-cloud universe is the right universe.\"</li>\n<li>Jackson Ader, KeyBanc, asked about CJ Desai's departure and enterprise seasonality. Prince stated, \"That bench continues to be strong... we will have no trouble finding someone else who is world-class.\" Seifert said, \"We gave the guidance we gave for the fourth quarter in light of what we are seeing.\"</li>\n<li>Michael Cikos, Needham, asked about SASE traction.

Questions reflected optimism about enterprise momentum and future pipeline.</li>\n<li>Management's tone in prepared remarks was confident, with phrases such as \"the team is firing on all cylinders\" and \"I am incredibly bullish.\" In Q&amp;A, management maintained confidence but addressed change (notably Desai's departure) with reassurance: \"That bench continues to be strong.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management showed increased confidence as revenue acceleration and enterprise traction became more pronounced.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul><li>Revenue growth accelerated from 28% in Q2 to 31% in Q3.

Free cash flow rose from $33.3 million to $75 million. RPO growth accelerated sequentially. Guidance for Q4 and the full year was increased from the prior quarter. Management tone reflected greater conviction, emphasizing execution and momentum in enterprise sales.</li></ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul><li>CEO Prince announced the departure of President of Product &amp; Engineering Chirantan Desai, acknowledging his impact but expressing confidence in the remaining leadership team. Competition from hyperscalers in AI workloads was noted, but Prince highlighted Cloudflare's differentiation. No customer contributed more than 2% of revenue, minimizing concentration risk. Gross margin pressure was acknowledged, linked to product mix and higher paid traffic, but unit economics remained stable. Management indicated ongoing focus on operational efficiency and partner-led growth to mitigate competitive and execution risks.</li></ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Cloudflare's third quarter was marked by accelerated revenue growth, rising large customer contribution, and substantial gains in net retention and free cash flow. The leadership transition with CJ Desai's departure was addressed with confidence in the company's talent bench. Guidance reflects continued momentum, with management targeting a $3 billion annualized revenue run rate by Q4 2026 and reinforcing its position as a strategic partner in the evolving AI and enterprise IT landscape.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/net/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Grid Dynamics Holdings, Inc. (GDYN) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Leonard Livschitz reported \"third quarter revenue of $104.2 million was another all-time high, fueled by AI demand,\" noting that \"AI grew 10% on a sequential basis and contributed to over 25% of our third quarter organic revenue.\" Management announced a $50 million share repurchase program, representing about 15% of company cash, as \"the buyback reflects our confidence in the long-term prospects of the business and commitment to investing in ourselves.\" Livschitz also highlighted a robust pipeline, with \"the strongest pipeline of new large enterprise logos since the beginning of the year,\" and said, \"new programs are multi-quarter in nature and with budget extending well into 2026.\"</li>\n<li>The company is executing a \"company-wide initiative to expand our profitability and margins,\" with Livschitz stating, \"over the next 12 months, we expect to improve our margins by at least 300 basis points.\"</li>\n<li>SVP Vasily Sizov stated, \"clients who were previously focused on near-term risk management are now taking a more constructive and strategic view, thinking about how to position themselves for growth in 2026 and beyond.\"</li>\n<li>Rahul Bindlish, Sales and Marketing Advisor, reported that \"partner influence revenue has grown to over 18% of total company revenue,\" and outlined expansion of partnerships, including with NVIDIA and other ISVs.</li>\n<li>CFO Anil Doradla stated, \"we recorded the third quarter revenues of $104.2 million, slightly higher than the midpoint of our $103 million to $105 million guidance. On a year-over-year basis, this represents a growth of 19.1%.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Doradla guided fourth quarter revenues to be \"in the range of $105 million to $107 million\" and non-GAAP EBITDA \"in the range of $13 million to $14 million.\" Full year revenue outlook is expected to be \"between $410.7 million to $412.7 million.\"</li>\n<li>The company expects \"net billable engineers added to be at the similar levels as in the third quarter.\"</li>\n<li>Management projects margin improvement of \"at least 300 basis points\" over the next 12 months. Livschitz added, \"our 2026 revenue growth will build on the top of this higher baseline, providing a strong foundation for continued expansion and operating leverage.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Third quarter revenues were $104.2 million, up 19.1% year-over-year, as reported by Doradla. Non-GAAP EBITDA was $12.7 million, or 12.2% of revenues, in line with the prior quarter.</li>\n<li>GAAP net income was $1.2 million, or $0.01 per share, compared to $5.3 million, or $0.06 per share, in the previous quarter.</li>\n<li>Non-GAAP net income was $8.2 million, or $0.09 per share, slightly down from $8.3 million, or $0.10 per share, in Q2.</li>\n<li>Cash and cash equivalents stood at $338.6 million at quarter end.</li>\n<li>Retail contributed $27.8 million to revenues, TMT accounted for 27.4% of total revenues, and finance contributed 24.6% of revenues.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Puneet Jain, JPMorgan: Asked about growth rates in 2026 and billable headcount. Livschitz responded, \"we are the highest billable headcount in the history of the company. The rate of growth has also picked up quite a bit, and we see that going into the Q4.\"</li>\n<li>Jain followed up on Agentic AI constraints. Sizov explained, \"Agentic AI and AI in general is the fastest-growing practice for us... lower skilled employees can be replaced with higher skilled employees in a lower number... augmented by sophisticated AI solutions.\"</li>\n<li>Bryan Bergin, TD Cowen, inquired about Agentic managed services and growth segmentation. Sizov said, \"currently, majority of the revenue... are actually related to solving the business cases,\" making it difficult to discern incremental gain.</li>\n<li>Surinder Thind, Jefferies, asked about partnership percentages. Bindlish expected, \"in the long term, we'll end up somewhere between 25% and 30%.\"</li>\n<li>Thind queried the share repurchase rationale. Doradla said, \"we believe that... our deployment of this capital at these levels is a clear good return on investment.\"</li>\n<li>Mayank Tandon, Needham, asked about 4Q budget flush potential. Doradla responded, \"at this stage, we do not believe it's a budget flush... our fundamental tone here is driven by what we're seeing in '26.\"</li>\n<li>Matt Dezort, William Blair, questioned margin expansion dependency on growth. Doradla stated, \"even if the demand environment stays the way it was in 2025, we think we... are going to expand at least 300 bps.\"</li>\n<li>Dezort followed up on AI advantage. Sizov highlighted, \"our history of utilizing AI... creates a differentiation for us... with utilizing LLMs, it's just another tool in our toolbox.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed for clarity on margin expansion, AI differentiation, partnership growth, and the sustainability of recent improvements. Their tone was generally positive but included probing questions about near-term revenue timing and margin drivers.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and optimistic tone throughout, with Livschitz remarking, \"we have many reasons to be optimistic about our outlook.\" During Q&amp;A, management addressed concerns directly and emphasized ongoing momentum and structural demand recovery.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management's confidence level increased, shifting from cautious optimism to a more assertive growth narrative. Analyst tone remained constructive but focused more on execution details.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Q3 revenue increased from $101.1 million in Q2 to $104.2 million, with non-GAAP EBITDA remaining stable at $12.7 million. GAAP net income declined from $5.3 million to $1.2 million quarter-over-quarter.</li>\n<li>The company shifted from emphasizing integration of recent acquisitions to focusing on organic growth, margin expansion, and a share repurchase program.</li>\n<li>Analysts in both quarters asked about margin expansion, AI adoption, and partnership traction, but Q3 saw increased attention to the sustainability of the demand recovery and the mechanics of margin improvement.</li>\n<li>Management's tone in Q3 was more confident and forward-looking, highlighting multi-quarter contracts and a stronger pipeline, compared to the more cautious tone in Q2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management identified FX headwinds and client concentration as ongoing challenges, with Doradla noting, \"there was a negative impact from FX fluctuations on our costs, both on a quarterly and year-over-year basis.\"</li>\n<li>The company continues to rationalize its customer portfolio, reducing exposure to nonstrategic clients.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised questions about the timing of revenue ramp, potential dependency on budget flushes, and the durability of partnership-influenced revenue.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Grid Dynamics management emphasized record AI-driven revenue, a strong pipeline of long-term contracts, and a major focus on margin expansion, targeting at least 300 basis points of improvement in the next year. The newly announced $50 million share repurchase reflects confidence in the company’s long-term growth trajectory and valuation.

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: OSI Systems (OSIS) Q1 2026</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Ajay Mehra highlighted \"the outstanding performance of our global OSI team in delivering a record-breaking first quarter\" and pointed to 12% revenue growth and 23% growth in service revenues as key achievements. He emphasized a \"record Q1 backlog and feel confident about the future outlook.\"</li>\n<li>Security division revenues reached $254 million, with \"solid 13% year-over-year growth,\" supported by strong bookings and record backlog. Mehra stated, \"we announced approximately $75 million in nonintrusive inspection product and integration orders and more than $60 million in RF product orders that we received during Q1.\"</li>\n<li>Mehra noted momentum from government sector demand, stating, \"Driven by factors like geopolitical conflicts, terrorism and crime, governments worldwide are investing heavily in advanced systems to enhance detection, deterrence and response capabilities.\"</li>\n<li>A five-year contract with CBP was awarded, with Mehra explaining, \"We are providing our CertScan platform to support CVP's strategic goals by modernizing its inspection capabilities.\"</li>\n<li>Optoelectronics and Manufacturing posted record Q1 revenues with \"notable strength and expansion across our product lines in North America.\" Healthcare division sales rose 10% year-over-year, with Mehra noting improvement plans are \"beginning to see tangible benefits.\"</li>\n<li>CFO Alan Edrick reported, \"revenues increased 12% year-over-year to a Q1 record of $385 million\" and cited a \"book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.1 in the quarter\" leading to a record Q1 backlog approaching $1.9 billion.</li>\n<li>Edrick stated, \"we are raising our fiscal '26 guidance for both revenues and adjusted earnings per share.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Edrick announced updated guidance: \"We now anticipate year-over-year revenue of $1.825 billion to $1.867 billion, representing a growth rate of 6.5% to 9.0%, up from the previous growth range of 5.4% to 8%.\"</li>\n<li>Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance was raised to a range of $10.20 to $10.48, which \"represents 9% to 12% year-over-year growth.\"</li>\n<li>Edrick noted that this outlook includes \"an approximate 60% headwind from a reduction of revenues from our Mexico contracts in fiscal '26 in our Security division.\"</li>\n<li>Management cautioned that \"the actual impact on the company's financial results of timing changes...is difficult to predict and could vary significantly from the anticipated impact currently reflected in our guidance.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Edrick reported, \"Q1 revenues were up 12% compared to the first quarter of the prior fiscal year with strength across the 3 segments.\"</li>\n<li>Security division revenues in Q1 were $254 million, an increase of 13% year-over-year. Optoelectronics and Manufacturing sales, including intercompany, increased 12% year-over-year to $110 million. Healthcare division sales posted 10% year-over-year growth.</li>\n<li>Q1 gross margin was 32%. Edrick said, \"This was down from the same quarter in the prior year as a less favorable revenue mix on product sales outweighed an increase in gross margin from higher service revenues.\"</li>\n<li>Selling, general and administrative expenses were $67 million or 17.4% of sales, compared to $72.2 million or 21% of sales in Q1 last year.</li>\n<li>R&amp;D expenses in Q1 were \"slightly above $20 million or 5.3% of revenues, up from $17.8 million or 5.2% of revenues in the same quarter last year.\"</li>\n<li>Year-over-year operating cash flow improved in Q1. Edrick explained, \"We continue to expect substantial cash inflows in fiscal '26 as we continue to collect those remaining receivables, which should lead to sizable operating cash flow this fiscal year.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Josh Nichols, B. Riley Securities: Asked about products and markets driving security strength, given a typically slower Q1. Edrick answered, \"We saw both on the revenues and the bookings side throughout the regions...Service revenues, of course, were exceptionally strong for us.\"</li>\n<li>Nichols: Queried on service revenue growth relative to overall guidance. Edrick responded, \"We're expecting faster growth than our recurring service revenue in this particular year.\"</li>\n<li>Nichols: Probed on Mexico revenue contribution for the year. Edrick replied, \"That's a good estimate, probably just slightly below that.\"</li>\n<li>Jeff Martin, ROTH Capital Partners: Asked if heavy government investment is a new phenomenon. Mehra indicated \"there's a lot more acceleration going on\" and referenced \"the big beautiful bill...with the opportunities in the Golden Dome.\"</li>\n<li>Martin: Inquired about the impact of the government shutdown. Mehra said, \"we've had very limited impact...It's really not a big deal.\"</li>\n<li>Mariana Perez Mora, BofA Securities: Asked about unbilled receivables. Edrick replied, \"We've seen the unbilled receivables in Mexico at September 30 come down nicely from June 30, and we expect to see that continued progress throughout the fiscal year.\"</li>\n<li>Perez Mora: Asked about capital deployment and M&amp;A. Mehra stated, \"We're always looking at expanding our capabilities...any acquisition that we look at is going to be carefully looked at.\"</li>\n<li>Seth Seifman, JPMorgan: Asked about security division margin expansion. Edrick explained, \"the final quarter of the difficult Mexico comps when it comes to a margin perspective...is this upcoming quarter...as we get past the end of this calendar year and move into January, the comps get much more normalized from a Mexico perspective.\"</li>\n<li>Lawrence Solow, CJS Securities: Requested the RF sensor business contribution. Edrick replied, \"last year, we did about $4 million in revenues from that business. And this past quarter, we did about $19 million of revenues.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed for granularity on segment growth drivers, Mexico receivables, and margin outlook, signaling a slightly positive to neutral tone with a focus on sustainability and cash conversion.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and positive tone in both prepared remarks and Q&amp;A, emphasizing recurring revenue growth, backlog strength, and cash flow expectations. Mehra stated, \"we feel very good about it in terms of what opportunities there are, not just in the U.S. but internationally.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to last quarter, both analysts and management retained a tone of cautious optimism, with a slight increase in management confidence around guidance and cash flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The company raised both revenue and EPS guidance for FY26, compared to more conservative projections in Q4 FY25.</li>\n<li>Security division revenues showed strong organic growth even as Mexico contract contributions declined, a trend that management says is more than offset by other segments.</li>\n<li>Analysts continued to probe Mexico exposure and cash collections, but showed increased focus on the growing recurring revenue base and margin expansion opportunities.</li>\n<li>Management's tone shifted from emphasizing headwinds (Mexico, AR) in Q4 FY25 to highlighting \"momentum,\" \"record backlog,\" and improved cash flow visibility in Q1 FY26.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus is now more balanced between Security and Optoelectronics, with Healthcare showing signs of improvement after previous softness.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management acknowledged continued headwinds from reduced Mexico contract revenues, estimating a 60% reduction year-over-year.</li>\n<li>The company highlighted margin fluctuations due to product mix and ongoing investments in R&amp;D.</li>\n<li>Edrick noted, \"the actual impact on the company's financial results of timing changes...is difficult to predict and could vary significantly from the anticipated impact currently reflected in our guidance.\"</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns regarding the timing of government funding, cash collections from Mexico, and the impact of the U.S. government shutdown, but management indicated minimal near-term risk.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>OSI Systems management emphasized confidence in delivering strong financial results for fiscal 2026, citing record backlog, robust security and recurring service growth, and improved cash collection outlook. The company raised both revenue and EPS guidance for the year, while highlighting ongoing investments in innovation, operational efficiency, and a disciplined approach to capital deployment.

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Itron, Inc. (ITRI) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Thomas Deitrich opened by stating Itron set new records for margins, profit, and free cash flow on revenue in line with expectations, with revenue of $582 million, adjusted EBITDA of $97 million, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.54, and free cash flow of $113 million. Deitrich highlighted \"Utilities are operating in an increasingly complex environment marked by accelerating load growth, rising costs, heightened regulatory scrutiny and greater technical demands.\" He noted distributed intelligence-enabled endpoints topped 16 million, with more than 10 million additional units in backlog, and licensed DI applications grew 119% year-over-year to $20 million. The Outcomes segment grew 11% year-over-year, led by higher recurring revenue.</li>\n<li>Deitrich shared that \"lower-than-expected Q3 bookings and heightened uncertainty have tempered our year-end booking expectations,\" clarifying that \"achieving a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio for 2025 remains possible,\" but bookings are expected below that target for the year. He emphasized \"these changes are not due to competitive dynamics nor fundamental changes in the market. Our opportunity pipeline has expanded by over 25% since the start of the year.\"</li>\n<li>On strategic moves, Deitrich announced the Urbint acquisition, expected to close in Q4 2025, stating \"Urbint's SaaS business model delivers solutions for emergency preparedness and response, damage prevention and worker safety.\"</li>\n<li>CFO Joan Hooper stated, \"Third quarter revenue of $582 million was near the top end of the range we provided and lower than the prior year due to planned portfolio changes and the timing of large project deployments.\" Hooper highlighted, \"Gross margin of 37.7% set a company record for the second consecutive quarter and was 360 basis points higher than last year due to favorable customer and product mix.\"</li>\n<li>Hooper further noted, \"Q3 free cash flow of $113 million or 19.5% of revenue is a new company record and compares to $59 million a year ago. This increase reflects improved working capital, lower tax payments and higher operational earnings growth.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Itron anticipates fourth quarter revenue to be between $555 million to $565 million, with the midpoint representing a decline of 9% year-over-year.</li>\n<li>Non-GAAP earnings per share for Q4 are expected in the range of $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share, with a negative effective tax rate of approximately 19% due to a favorable tax resolution.</li>\n<li>For full year 2025, Itron now projects revenue within a range of $2.35 billion to $2.36 billion, with a midpoint down 3% versus 2024. Normalizing for 2024 catch-up revenue, this implies approximately 2% year-over-year growth.</li>\n<li>Full year 2025 non-GAAP EPS outlook is increased to a range of $6.84 to $6.94 per diluted share, with an expected annual effective tax rate of approximately 12%.</li>\n<li>Management maintained that \"our fourth quarter outlook does not include any impact from the Urbint acquisition.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Itron reported revenue of $582 million, adjusted EBITDA of $97 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.54 for Q3 2025.</li>\n<li>Gross margin reached 37.7%, setting a company record for the second consecutive quarter.</li>\n<li>Free cash flow was $113 million, a new record, attributed to improved working capital, lower tax payments, and higher operational earnings growth.</li>\n<li>By segment, Device Solutions revenue was $104 million with gross margin of 30.9%, Network Solutions revenue was $394 million with gross margin of 39.3%, and Outcomes revenue was $84 million with gross margin of 38.9%.</li>\n<li>Total debt at the end of the quarter was $1.265 billion, and cash and equivalents were $1.332 billion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Noah Kaye, Oppenheimer: Asked about revenue delta versus prior implied guidance and gross margin trajectory. Joan Hooper responded, \"I would say the biggest weakness is in networks...they're going a little slower than we would have expected...From a standpoint of gross margin, I would expect Q4 to look pretty close to what Q3 is.\"</li>\n<li>Kaye followed up on booking conversion delays. Deitrich responded, \"the demand is coming. That record pipeline...is pretty clearly a strong signal of where the market is going...Where we have seen some delays in decisions...is on the more hardware-oriented projects...I still see the environment as very robust. Our '27 targets are clearly on track.\"</li>\n<li>Jeffrey Osborne, TD Cowen: Inquired about the 6% decline in networks. Deitrich explained, \"What we saw...is the catch-up of the constrained revenue from prior years when you lap it year-over-year. We also had...a completion of a major deployment in the networks business that rolled off.\"</li>\n<li>Osborne asked about visibility into customer deployment schedules. Deitrich stated, \"We know what their deployment rates are and those get reprofiled...No projects have stopped.\"</li>\n<li>Osborne requested clarification on outcomes segment backlog duration. Deitrich clarified, \"The backlog is generally 3, 4 years in length overall.\"</li>\n<li>Alfred Moore, ROTH Capital Partners: Asked about 2026 growth trajectory. Deitrich said, \"I think there will be growth. It's just a question of what level it would be.\"</li>\n<li>Moore asked about Urbint synergies. Deitrich highlighted, \"tremendous overlap between the customers that they have and that we have.\"</li>\n<li>Scott Graham, Seaport Research Partners: Asked if 2027 targets could be revisited.
