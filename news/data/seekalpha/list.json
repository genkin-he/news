(QBTS) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Alan Baratz, President, CEO &amp; Director, described fiscal 2025 as an inflection point for both D-Wave and the quantum computing industry, emphasizing, \"We delivered proof, we delivered revenue, and we delivered real-world advantage.\" He highlighted D-Wave's commercial and technical progress, including the first sale of an Advantage quantum computer system to the Julich Supercomputing Centre and demonstration of quantum supremacy on a real-world problem with the Advantage2 system. Baratz asserted, \"We are the only quantum computing company to demonstrate quantum supremacy on a useful real-world problem.\"</li>\n<li>The CEO announced the acquisition of Quantum Circuits, positioning D-Wave as \"the only dual platform quantum computing company\" and stating, \"No other gate-model vendor today\" has a comparable architectural advantage. Baratz also noted the launch of a U.S. Government Solutions business unit and relocation of company headquarters to Boca Raton, Florida.</li>\n<li>John Markovich, Chief Financial Officer, reported, \"Revenue for fiscal 2025 totaled $24.6 million, an increase of $15.8 million or 179% from fiscal 2024 revenue of $8.8 million.\" He emphasized, \"All of our revenue is derived from selling, providing access to or providing services for quantum computing systems.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Markovich stated, \"We will continue our practice of not providing formal financial guidance. However, I would like to provide some parameters.\" He explained that, \"With fiscal 2026 year-to-date bookings already exceeding our annual bookings for any year in the company's history,\" D-Wave expects \"incrementally higher revenue growth in the second half of this year when compared to the first half.\"</li>\n<li>Operating expenses are projected to \"increase quarterly operating expenses by approximately 15% sequentially over the immediately prior fiscal quarter,\" driven by investments in both annealing and gate-model technology, R&amp;D, and expansion of the government business unit.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fiscal 2025 revenue reached $24.6 million, consisting of $16.2 million in systems sales, $5.5 million in QCaaS subscription revenue, and $2.7 million in professional services. Fiscal 2025 bookings were $18.7 million.</li>\n<li>GAAP gross profit was $20.3 million with a GAAP gross margin of 82.6%. Non-GAAP gross profit stood at $21.1 million and non-GAAP gross margin was 86%.</li>\n<li>Fiscal 2025 net loss was $355 million or $1.11 per share, impacted by $250.5 million in noncash nonoperating charges related to warrant liability. Adjusted net loss was $84.5 million or $0.26 per share. Adjusted EBITDA loss for the year was $71.8 million.</li>\n<li>As of December 31, 2025, consolidated cash and marketable securities were $884.5 million. D-Wave invested $250 million in cash for the acquisition of Quantum Circuits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Harsh Kumar, Piper Sandler: Asked about timing advantage from built-in error correction in gate-model. Baratz: \"We believe that this combination will allow us to build and deploy scaled error-corrected superconducting gate-model systems ahead of anybody else.\"</li>\n<li>Quinn Bolton, Needham &amp; Co.: Asked about OpEx increase post-Quantum Circuits acquisition. Markovich: \"That 15% fully includes the incremental costs associated with QCI.\"</li>\n<li>William Kingsley Crane, Canaccord: Inquired about QCaaS retention and upsell potential. Markovich responded that the company does not publish retention rates but is seeing larger QCaaS deals. Baratz added, \"We are really beginning to see an increase in the size of QCaaS deals.\"</li>\n<li>Joseph McCormack, Evercore: Questioned Quantum Circuits' revenue contribution and pipeline. Markovich indicated expectations for professional services and QCaaS revenue from Quantum Circuits and a developing sales pipeline for system sales.</li>\n<li>Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan, TD Cowen: Asked about foundry risk. Baratz detailed risk mitigation by diversifying fabrication sources and clarified that current critical components are fabricated in-house.</li>\n<li>Other analysts focused on system capacity, pipeline strength, the mix of QCaaS and system sales, and government business opportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts were consistently positive, focusing on commercial traction, pipeline expansion, system sales, and technological advantages.

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Asure Software, Inc. (ASUR) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>CEO Patrick Goepel reported that full year revenues reached $140.5 million, representing a 17% increase over the prior year, with organic growth in the fourth quarter at 10% compared to 4% in the third quarter. Goepel stated, “We believe that we are at an inflection point in the business following the launch of Asure Central last October with more than 2/3 of our clients upgrading to the new portal.” He noted improved attach rates, with a 10% year-over-year increase in clients buying multiple products in the payroll business.</p></li>\n<li><p>Goepel emphasized the company’s adoption of AI, highlighting the launch of Luna, “the industry’s first true AI agent for payroll and HR.” Goepel explained that Luna “detects issues, resolves them, logs outcomes and supports both employees through self-service and business owners and administrators across their workflows.” Over 80,000 messages were handled by Luna in the first 90 days, offsetting the workload equivalent to three client service reps.</p></li>\n<li><p>Goepel introduced AsureWorks, an administrative services outsourcing model, stating, “Clients who adopt managed payroll and compliance services typically represent 2 to 3x the revenue of a payroll-only client with further upside as additional models are managed.” He described early sales results as promising, with new bookings up 35% in 2025, and a contracted backlog of approximately $100 million, up 18% since Q3 2025.</p></li>\n<li><p>CFO John Pence reported, “Fourth quarter total revenues were $39.3 million, increasing by 28%, compared to the prior year period, while recurring revenue grew by 18% to $33.7 million.” Pence highlighted that EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $8.7 million, up from $3.4 million in the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter increased 82% to $11.4 million from $6.2 million in the prior year. He added, “Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29%, an increase of 900 basis points compared to the 20% we realized in the prior year.”</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Pence gave updated guidance for 2026, stating, “We are expecting the first quarter revenues to be in the range of $41 million to $43 million and adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter is expected to be between $10 million and $11 million.” For the full year 2026, he said, “We are also updating our 2026 revenue which we believe will be between $159 million and $162 million, with adjusted EBITDA margins of between 23% and 25%.” He added, “We expect to convert approximately 41% of this backlog in the next 12 months.”</p></li>\n<li><p>Goepel reiterated the medium-term plan to reach $180 million to $200 million in revenues with sustained adjusted EBITDA margins of 30% plus.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>For the fourth quarter, total revenues were reported as $39.3 million. Recurring revenue for Q4 was $33.7 million, and professional services and hardware revenue totaled $5.6 million. Gross profit was $27.2 million with full-year gross margins at 68% and non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter at 75%. Net income for Q4 was $0.8 million, compared to a net loss of $3.2 million in the prior year. Cash and cash equivalents at year-end were $25.2 million, with debt at $67.6 million.</p></li>\n<li><p>Pence noted, “Gross margins for the full year were 68% compared to 69% in the prior year. Non-GAAP gross margins for the fourth quarter were 75% compared to 73% in the prior year.”</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Eric Martinuzzi, Lake Street Capital Markets: “I think I've got this right. The -- you bumped up the low end of revenue in the 2026 guidance, is that correct?” John Pence: “Yes, we took it up $1 million.” Martinuzzi: “Was anything in particular that caused that...wondering where the incremental confidence from?” Pence: “We closed an acquisition a couple of weeks ago. So we wanted to give a little bit more upside as a result of that.”</p></li>\n<li><p>Richard Baldry, ROTH Capital Partners: “So post the Lathem acquisition, the nonrecurring revenue stepped up pretty meaningfully. So when we look out to next year, can you walk us through how to think about the cadence on that line?” Pence: “I would expect next year or 2026 to be kind of in that low 90s of recurring revenue...we're hoping to have that kind of half model in by the back half of the year.”</p></li>\n<li><p>Jeff Van Rhee, Craig-Hallum Capital Group: “Pat, you mentioned the target reps. Just where are we now in terms of rep count?” Goepel: “I think we're somewhere around 118 reps or so in that area. We have a plan to get to 150...We're investing in enablement. We're investing in training.”</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Analysts focused on guidance clarity, attach rates, and the impact of AI and acquisitions, with a neutral to slightly positive tone and specific interest in organic growth acceleration and product adoption.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management displayed high confidence, using phrases like “we believe that we are at an inflection point” and “we are excited about 2026 and look forward to 2026 being a major inflection point,” while acknowledging early days in AI-driven cost reduction.</p></li>\n<li><p>Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management showed increased optimism, with more emphasis on organic growth and AI’s impact.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The current quarter saw a sequential improvement in organic growth from 4% to 10%, with a full-year rate of 5% versus 7% implied in the previous outlook.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management increased the low end of 2026 revenue guidance by $1 million, citing a recent acquisition, and maintained its focus on cross-sell and product adoption as key growth drivers.</p></li>\n<li><p>Analysts in the current quarter pressed for specifics on attach rates and recurring revenue, while management provided more detailed color on AI strategy and operational efficiency.</p></li>\n<li><p>The tone from both management and analysts was more upbeat compared to the previous quarter, with a shift toward discussing scalability, sales force expansion, and deeper product integration.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Management cited interest rate cuts as a potential headwind, stating, “We have modeled two more rate cuts during 2026. We believe that as our client fund balances increase, this will help offset some of these rate cuts.”</p></li>\n<li><p>Gross margins were noted as slightly lower due to revenue mix changes and increased lower-margin nonrecurring sales from the Lathem acquisition, but management is forecasting improvement as integration continues.</p></li>\n<li><p>Analysts asked about acquisition pace, sales cycles, and pipeline strength, with Goepel stating, “Pipeline prospects are really good. We are increasing our marketing spend this year.”</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Asure Software closed 2025 with strong revenue growth and accelerating organic momentum, highlighted by rapid adoption of Asure Central and the launch of its AI-driven Luna agent. The company raised its 2026 revenue guidance, expects double-digit organic growth, and is investing in both sales force expansion and product innovation. Management remains confident that AI integration, cross-selling, and new service models like AsureWorks will drive improved margins and long-term growth, positioning the company for continued profitability and shareholder value creation in 2026 and beyond.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/asur/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Ambarella, Inc. (AMBA) Q4 2026</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fermi Wang, President and CEO, announced that fiscal 2026 was a record year for Ambarella, with revenue increasing 37% year-over-year, driven by \"5-nanometer new product cycles\" and \"50% year-over-year growth in our Edge AI revenue.\" Wang highlighted that \"about 80% of our full year fiscal 2026 revenue is Edge AI, all of which is also defined as a fiscal AI.\" He emphasized both auto and IoT revenue growth, citing increases in unit shipments and average selling price.</li>\n<li>Wang detailed the commercial ramp of new products: \"Our new third-generation 5-nanometer CV75 and the CV72 AI SoCs are rapidly growing, reaching a high single-digit percent of total revenue in Q4, and these new products are poised to be an important source of incremental revenue in the new year.\"</li>\n<li>Strategic initiatives included expanding indirect sales channels and launching a semi-custom/custom ASIC business: \"We are incrementally building an indirect sales channel including independent software developers, distributors and system integrators,\" and \"the establishment of a semi-custom/custom ASIC business, where we have strong interest from a variety of companies.\"</li>\n<li>Wang also referenced significant customer wins in industrial automation, video conferencing, enterprise security, and automotive, including a \"design win at the warehouses of a large U.S.-based e-commerce provider\" and Ford's launch of \"the Dealer-Fit truck bed camera last quarter, it's a smart security camera for the truck bed built on our CV25.\"</li>\n<li>CFO John Young stated, \"Fiscal year 2026 revenue increased 37.2% to $390.7 million. Automotive revenue led by telematics increased in the high single digits and IoT increased almost 50% year-over-year, led by portable video and a continuation of strong growth in physical security.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Wang projected, \"Looking further into fiscal 2027, we anticipate total revenue growth in the 10% to 15% range with non-GAAP gross margin within our long-term model of 59% to 62%.\"</li>\n<li>Young provided Q1 fiscal 2027 guidance: \"We forecast Q1 revenue to be seasonal and in the range of $97 million to $103 million or $100 million at the midpoint. Sequentially, auto revenue is expected to increase with IoT revenue expected to be seasonally down. We expect fiscal Q1 non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 59% to 60.5%.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Young reported, \"For fiscal year 2026, non-GAAP gross margin was 60.7% versus 62.7% in fiscal 2025. Non-GAAP operating expense increased 12.9% for the year versus 6.5% in the prior year.\"</li>\n<li>Q4 revenue was $100.9 million, \"slightly above the midpoint of our prior guidance range of $97 million to $103 million down 7% from the prior quarter and up 20.1% year-over-year.\"</li>\n<li>Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was 59.8%. Non-GAAP operating expense in Q4 was $56.5 million. Q4 non-GAAP net profit was $5.5 million or $0.13 per diluted share.</li>\n<li>Cash and marketable securities at quarter end were $312.6 million. Free cash flow for the year reached $58 million or 15% of revenue, with Q4 free cash flow at $15 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Quinn Bolton, Needham &amp; Company: Asked about the e-commerce warehouse robotics win. Wang replied, \"it's in production, although it's a low volume production right now, but we definitely expect that will continue to grow.\"</li>\n<li>Bolton also inquired about the auto pipeline. Wang clarified, \"the auto opportunities we have either won or being invited to bid upon in the next 6 years from fiscal year 2027 to fiscal year 2032 is approximately $13 billion.\"</li>\n<li>Tore Svanberg, Stifel: Asked about channel strategy and the semi-custom ASIC business. Wang said, \"our goal for this new go-to-market strategy is to focus on buildup with our partners... we're targeting at least certain milestones with distributors and the system integrators... revenue probably -- I'm not expecting any meaningful revenue this year from this new business model.\"</li>\n<li>Svanberg asked about growth mix for fiscal '27. Wang confirmed both unit and ASP growth, \"we are confident about our own new product ramp-up like CV72, CV75 and CV7.\"</li>\n<li>Kevin Cassidy, Rosenblatt: Queried about the drone market and competition from China. Wang responded, \"DJI continue to build their own silicon, but they also use our external silicon solution... outside that, I think the majority of the other drone market... they definitely need to try to use external silicon.\"</li>\n<li>Joseph Moore, Morgan Stanley: Asked about long-term gross margin. Wang explained, \"when the custom semi-custom chip design become more mature, if we need to change the model because of that, we will come to talk to our investor world about this.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts largely focused on clarifying growth drivers, pipeline opportunities, and risks related to competition and new business models, with a tone that was neutral to slightly positive, reflecting curiosity and scrutiny rather than skepticism.</li>\n<li>Management's tone in prepared remarks was confident, with repeated references to \"record\" performance, new product momentum, and strategic expansion. During Q&amp;A, Wang and Young maintained a composed and responsive tone, occasionally expressing caution around projections for new business models and external risks, but generally reaffirming confidence in the company’s strategy.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, the sentiment remained positive, with management displaying consistent confidence in Edge AI leadership and product portfolio expansion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue for Q4 was $100.9 million, down 7% sequentially from Q3’s $108.5 million, in line with earlier guidance referencing seasonality.</li>\n<li>Full-year revenue rose from prior guidance of $379 million midpoint to $390.7 million actual. Non-GAAP gross margin eased from 60.9% in Q3 to 59.8% in Q4.</li>\n<li>Management’s guidance for fiscal 2027 shifted from a focus on unit and ASP growth in the past quarter to explicit revenue growth targets of 10%-15% and continued margin stability.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus broadened with the introduction of indirect sales channels and the semi-custom ASIC initiative, while maintaining momentum in automotive and IoT.</li>\n<li>Analysts’ questions in both quarters centered on growth mix, margin sustainability, and pipeline health, but recent discussions included more attention to new go-to-market models and competition in emerging markets like drones and robotics.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Wang acknowledged ongoing supply chain constraints: \"While facing a variety of industry-wide supply chain constraints, we shipped more than 25 million units across more than 15 SoCs with many variants.\"</li>\n<li>Management addressed the potential impact of DRAM price increases, indicating limited direct exposure but monitoring for possible indirect effects on lower-margin customer segments.</li>\n<li>Geopolitical and regulatory risks in the drone market were noted, with Wang stating, \"our current design win with that only in production is not impacted by the new regulations... we are watching the potential impact in the future.\"</li>\n<li>The indirect sales channel and semi-custom ASIC business are in early stages, with Wang noting, \"I'm not expecting any meaningful revenue this year from this new business model.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Ambarella’s management highlighted record Edge AI-driven growth in fiscal 2026, driven by strong new product cycles, new strategic initiatives in sales channels and custom ASICs, and anticipation of 10%-15% revenue growth in fiscal 2027. Despite some seasonality and margin pressure, the company emphasized its leadership in Edge AI, expanding customer wins in automotive, IoT, and robotics, and a robust pipeline worth $13 billion in auto opportunities over the next six years. Management expressed confidence in sustaining growth and innovation, while closely monitoring supply chain dynamics, competition, and the evolving regulatory landscape.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/amba/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

(FIGR) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Michael Tannenbaum stated that the company is focused on three key areas for 2026: \"continuing to scale our marketplace, particularly through Figure Connect and driving more volume into our capital-light exchange,\" broadening product offerings in mortgage-adjacent categories, and \"expanding the broader blockchain ecosystem around that marketplace, where tokenization, decentralized finance and atomic settlement are setting the standard of how a modern capital marketplace should function.\"</li>\n<li>Tannenbaum highlighted that over half of consumer loan marketplace volume transacted through Figure Connect for the first time, calling this a structural milestone since its June 2024 launch, reducing reliance on balance sheet intermediation and creating a more capital-light model.</li>\n<li>The CEO emphasized AI integration, noting, \"AI is primarily about fueling growth opportunities for us and our partner ecosystem rather than simply optimizing costs,\" and described recent launches of AI-powered customer service and title review workflows.</li>\n<li>Tannenbaum announced a major partnership with Agora Data to bring auto finance assets into Democratized Prime, expected to add tens of millions of dollars in volume in the coming months, and announced a forthcoming strategic partnership with Newtek to deliver Figure’s HELOC for small business and develop embedded lending/banking solutions anchored by Figure’s stablecoin, YLDS.</li>\n<li>He called first lien mortgage a central growth driver, stating, \"as of Q4, first lien represents roughly 19% of our originations, up from 12% just a year ago,\" and projected that \"2026 will be the year of the first lien for Figure.\"</li>\n<li>Tannenbaum described recent blockchain ecosystem expansion, including cross-chain integration with Solana, growth of YLDS in circulation nearing $0.5 billion (over 20x since Q3), and the launch of OPEN, an on-chain native equity marketplace.</li>\n<li>He addressed a recent security incident affecting loan inquiry records of approximately 12,400 individuals, clarifying, \"this was not a blockchain or protocol-related event\" and stating the incident is not expected to have a material financial impact.</li>\n<li>CFO Minchung Kgil reported, \"we reported exceptional consumer loan marketplace volume this quarter, reaching $2.7 billion, an increase of 131% year-over-year,\" with sequential growth despite seasonal headwinds.</li>\n<li>Kgil stated, \"adjusted net revenue of $158 million, an increase of 106% year-over-year,\" and highlighted a net take rate of 3.8%, up 40 basis points year-over-year.</li>\n<li>She added, \"GAAP net income for the quarter was $15 million, representing a margin of 9.4% compared to 7% in Q4 of last year,\" and reported adjusted EBITDA of $81.3 million, up 426% year-over-year, with margin expanding to 51.6%.</li>\n<li>Kgil announced a $200 million share repurchase program, described as reflecting \"the strength of our balance sheet, the durability of our operating profile and our confidence in the long-term opportunity in front of us.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Kgil provided forward guidance that the near- to medium-term net take rate is expected to be \"between 3.5% to 4%, which takes into account factors such as product mix, marketplace participation and capital market conditions.\"</li>\n<li>She reiterated that the focus remains on \"scaling long-term marketplace margin durability and capital efficiency, not short-term pricing optimization at the expense of marketplace slowdown.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Consumer loan marketplace volume rose to $2.7 billion, a 131% year-over-year increase.</li>\n<li>Adjusted net revenue was $158 million, up 106% year-over-year.</li>\n<li>Net take rate was 3.8% for the quarter, increasing by 40 basis points year-over-year, but lower quarter-over-quarter due to product mix and broader market execution.</li>\n<li>GAAP net income reached $15 million, with a margin of 9.4%.</li>\n<li>Adjusted EBITDA was $81.3 million, up 426% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA margin reached 51.6%.</li>\n<li>Figure ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents.</li>\n<li>Loans held for sale totaled $404 million, up $15 million this quarter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Dan Dolev, Mizuho: Asked about the Agora partnership's upside. Tannenbaum responded, \"It's an entrance into the massive auto finance sector... a huge opportunity for us from a democratized Prime perspective... and a connect upsell opportunity.\"</li>\n<li>Patrick Moley, Piper Sandler: Inquired about partner adds and their impact. Tannenbaum described, \"three primary motions that are all working really well\" and confirmed accelerated partner growth as an indicator of continued volume growth into 2026.</li>\n<li>Ryan Tomasello, KBW: Probed on monetization of third-party assets. Tannenbaum said, \"this is pure margin... leveraging our capital market infrastructure,\" and Kgil noted, \"we do anticipate this impacting the overall volume coming into Figure Connect,\" with auto loans likely commanding lower take rates.</li>\n<li>Robert Wildhack, Autonomous Research: Asked about take rate outlook. Kgil explained the shift, citing increased mix of auto and first lien loans, causing lower take rates, but maintained, \"contribution margin has been around the 80%.\"</li>\n<li>James Yaro, Goldman Sachs: Asked about partner ramp-up time. Tannenbaum indicated, \"in general, that's roughly what we see\" at about three months, with partner diversity impacting ramp time. Kgil added existing partners also contribute significantly to growth.</li>\n<li>Unknown Analyst: Requested an update on securitization for HELOC and new products. Kgil stated that AAA ratings earned in Q3 and Q4 have helped gain on sale premium and that new products require seasoning before securitization. Tannenbaum clarified auto loans via Agora would not be held on Figure's balance sheet.</li>\n<li>Kyle Peterson, Needham: Inquired about private credit jitters and crypto-backed loan performance. Kgil reported no change in demand for Figure loans, stating jitters are \"really on the commercial loans rather than these residential mortgage type of loans.\" Tannenbaum said, \"zero losses in crypto-backed loans to date.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts generally expressed positive sentiment, with phrases like \"very impressive as always\" and \"I echo the congrats on the strong execution.\"</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and forward-looking tone in prepared remarks, emphasizing structural milestones and growth, but addressed headwinds and product mix changes directly and in detail.</li>\n<li>The tone in Q&amp;A was more probing on structural metrics and growth sustainability, with management providing detailed and occasionally clarifying responses. Management confidence remained steady compared to the previous quarter, with emphasis on operational progress and future opportunity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance on net take rate shifted from \"stable around 4%\" in Q3 to a range of 3.5%-4% in Q4, with management citing product mix changes, especially increased auto and first lien loans.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus broadened, with new partnerships highlighted (Agora Data, Newtek), and a stronger emphasis on scaling third-party asset volume.</li>\n<li>Analysts' questions in Q4 focused more heavily on monetization, product mix, and margin durability, compared to Q3’s focus on partner growth and product road map.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone in both quarters, but expanded on operational details and risk mitigation in Q4, especially regarding security incidents and product expansion.</li>\n<li>Key metrics such as loan volume, net revenue, and adjusted EBITDA continued strong growth, but with a noticeable emphasis on capital-light scalability and margin sustainability in Q4.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management disclosed a security incident affecting 12,400 customer records, clarified as a phishing attack not related to blockchain infrastructure, and stated, \"the incident is not expected to have a material impact on our financial results.\"</li>\n<li>Product mix changes could lead to lower take rates, with Kgil noting, \"auto... these are shorter-term loans, and they're going to have a different type of profile and different types of buyers that come into Connect Marketplace.\"</li>\n<li>Seasonal declines in home-based lending were noted but offset by growth in new products and partners.</li>\n<li>Analyst concerns centered on take rate stability, volume growth sustainability, and risks from private credit volatility, all addressed by management as manageable within Figure’s operating model.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Management emphasized that Figure’s transition to a capital-light marketplace is accelerating, supported by robust marketplace volume, expanding asset classes, and the integration of blockchain-based solutions across its ecosystem. Strategic partnerships and product launches are expected to drive further growth, while the company remains focused on margin durability, operational efficiency, and long-term profitability, with a strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation supporting continued innovation and expansion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/figr/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

We completed approximately $1.1 billion of acquisitions during the year, adding about 250 locations and 13,000 BOE a day within our existing operating areas.\"</li>\n<li>CFO Guy Oliphint reported, \"Our guidance is kind of consistent with what we've discussed before. We thought '26 will be low. We thought '27 will be low based on strip, and that's all played out. So based on where we are today, we don't see ourselves being a full cash taxpayer until '28 or beyond.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For full year 2026, management expects total production to average 415,000 BOE per day and oil production to average 189,000 barrels per day, with CapEx of $1.85 billion, including approximately $400 million in non-D&amp;C spend.

Walter responded that their strategy has focused on both organic and inorganic growth, citing inventory quality and basin maturity as differentiators.</li>\n<li>MacCurdy followed up on capital allocation in 2026. Walter explained, \"Our plan is to use every tool we've got in the toolkit... capital allocation really is all of the above, and we don't see any need to kind of limit or restrict ourselves going forward.\"</li>\n<li>Neal Dingmann, William Blair: Asked about the ground game and PR's confidence in ongoing M&amp;A.

Marcus, President, CEO &amp; Chairman, emphasized, \"we exit the year with good momentum. And as we look ahead to 2026, we're encouraged by the growth opportunities that we see ahead.\" Marcus detailed strategic actions in theaters including price optimization, digital ticketing improvements, concession enhancements, and the expansion of the Marcus Movie Club loyalty program. He highlighted strong market share in family-oriented films and pointed to a robust upcoming movie slate for 2026 and 2027.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Paris expects a meaningful step down in capital expenditures for 2026 after a heavy reinvestment cycle, with anticipated total capital expenditures of $50 million to $55 million. He stated, \"we expect this decrease in capital expenditures to result in a significant increase in free cash flow in 2026, which will be allocated to opportunistic growth investments and returning capital to shareholders.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Marcus projected optimism for the theater division in 2026, noting, \"the current slate has a stronger mix of tent-pole films and the grossing potential of 2026 franchises is greater based on their historical predecessor box office performances.\" For hotels, Paris communicated expectations for \"low single-digit RevPAR growth, led by modest growth in group business and steady leisure and business travel.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Paris reported fourth quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $26.8 million, up 3.6% year over year. Full-year adjusted EBITDA was $99.3 million, a 3.1% decrease.

Again, we're trying to be very thoughtful about customer sensitivity to price changes, and we do want to continue to drive attendance.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Wold inquired about hotel segment leisure and group booking trends. Paris explained, \"Group overall remains healthy. And as we've said a few times over the last few months or a few quarters, our renovated properties are winning really well with groups.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Michael Hickey asked about growth prospects and free cash flow leverage. Marcus replied, \"We're very focused on, as you know, our pricing strategies and making sure that our prices are market appropriate and that we're offering the right product to the right customer.\" Paris added, \"our free cash flow conversion on that is going to be very strong.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Hickey pressed on M&amp;A appetite. Marcus noted, \"we continue to actively search for opportunities to deploy capital to grow our businesses, and we are disciplined in our approach.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Andrew Crum questioned occupancy rate softness. Paris clarified, \"occupancy in the fourth quarter last year did get a benefit from a bunch of group business related to the election...It is very much a mix story that is market-specific and at times even property specific.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Patrick Sholl inquired about capital allocation and M&amp;A underwriting differences.

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Service Properties Trust (SVC) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Christopher Bilotto, President and CEO, highlighted the completion of hotel sales and active steps to reduce leverage, stating, \"During the quarter, we sold 66 hotels totaling nearly 8,300 keys for $534 million.\" He emphasized that the company used proceeds and cash on hand to redeem all $800 million of 2026 debt maturities and $300 million of February 2027 notes, adding, \"We remain focused on selling additional hotels and executing further strategies to improve SVC's cash flows, debt maturity profile and overall cost of capital.\"</li>\n<li>Bilotto announced the sale of Simply Suites for $7.1 million and the marketing of 9 focused service hotels and 7 full-service Sonesta managed hotels, aiming for total proceeds of $175 million to $200 million, with the sales expected to increase annual EBITDA by about $13 million and improve leverage metrics.</li>\n<li>The CEO detailed a new $745 million, 5-year mortgage financing, secured by the net lease master trust, with an expected annual cash savings of $14 million or $0.08 per share due to a lower interest rate.</li>\n<li>Bilotto noted, \"SVC's portfolio continued to deliver steady top line growth as RevPAR increased 70 basis points year-over-year, outpacing the broader industry by 180 basis points and representing the fifth consecutive quarter of outperformance.\"</li>\n<li>The appointment of Keith Pierce and Jeff Leer as Co-CEOs of Sonesta, effective April 1, was announced, with Bilotto stating, \"We believe their leadership and experience will be instrumental in further optimizing Sonesta RevPAR market share performance while driving operational discipline.\"</li>\n<li>Jesse Abair, Vice President, reported that 2025 acquisitions totaled $101 million, with a net lease portfolio of 760 properties and annual base rents of $390 million, noting an average rent coverage of 2.7x and a 97% lease rate. He stated, \"Annualized base rent increased 2.4%, largely a function of our recent acquisition activity.\"</li>\n<li>Brian Donley, CFO, said, \"Normalized FFO was $27.5 million or $0.17 per share, flat compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDAre decreased $5 million year-over-year to $125.6 million.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>SVC introduced full year 2026 guidance, projecting RevPAR of $108 to $113 and hotel EBITDA of $124 million to $144 million for 94 hotels owned at year-end. Net lease NOI is expected between $380 million and $386 million.</li>\n<li>Consolidated adjusted EBITDAre is forecasted at $500 million to $520 million, with normalized FFO per share of $0.65 to $0.77. CapEx is projected at $120 million to $140 million, with free cash flow generation after CapEx anticipated for 2026.</li>\n<li>Management noted, \"This guidance does not reflect the impact of completing 17 Sonesta hotel dispositions, and it assumes $25 million of capital recycling in our net lease portfolio.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For Q4 2025, normalized FFO was $27.5 million or $0.17 per share, and adjusted EBITDAre was $125.6 million.</li>\n<li>Comparable hotel RevPAR rose by 70 basis points, while the gross operating profit margin declined by 370 basis points to 20.5%.</li>\n<li>The hotel portfolio generated adjusted hotel EBITDA of $21.3 million, a 35% decrease year-over-year, attributed to elevated labor and overhead costs, and the absence of prior year business interruption insurance.</li>\n<li>At quarter-end, debt stood at $5.2 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.95%.</li>\n<li>CapEx for Q4 was $106 million, with a full year total of $238 million, including major projects at the Nautilus in Miami and other Sonesta properties.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Jackson Armstrong, Wells Fargo: Asked about RevPAR trends and the width of guidance. Brian Donley responded, \"We're tracking in line, if not exceeding our projections for the full year guidance,\" citing portfolio volatility and citywide events as reasons for the broader guidance range.</li>\n<li>Armstrong: Inquired about the strategic shift in net lease acquisitions. Christopher Bilotto explained, \"The $25 million guidance will be supported by sales of net lease properties, so kind of net 0 in that standpoint.\"</li>\n<li>Armstrong: Sought expense growth detail. Donley said, \"Overall, to the midpoint, just top line is a little over 4% expectation on growth. The bottom line, we're seeing around 6% and a big part of that is labor.\"</li>\n<li>Armstrong: Questioned the impact of new Sonesta management. Bilotto stated, \"Certainly, with this management team coming in... we view it as a positive... I think they'll do just that.\"</li>\n<li>Tyler Batory, Oppenheimer: Asked about RevPAR and portfolio quality. Donley indicated, \"The guidance and the growth trajectory, the midpoint RevPAR is around $110, which is a 3% RevPAR growth.\"</li>\n<li>Batory: Probed margin and CapEx outlook. Donley detailed, \"$120 million to $140 million is a big step for us. The pace of large significant renovations are winding down. The Nautilus is definitely the biggest piece of this year.\"</li>\n<li>Batory: Asked about debt headroom and maturities. Donley responded, \"Not a lot of headroom for a large transaction, but... the 0 coupons are already secured by assets.\"</li>\n<li>John Massocca, B. Riley: Focused on hotel dispositions and EBITDA impact. Bilotto confirmed, \"The 9 focused service that are part of the 16 we're in the market with are the carryover from 2025.\"</li>\n<li>Massocca: Asked about EBITDA mix and unencumbered assets. Donley replied, \"It's not too far off from high-60s to low-30s from an EBITDA mix.\"</li>\n<li>Massocca: Sought clarification on net lease coverage. Bilotto said, \"The coverage drop is largely a function of TA coverage dropping 7 basis points quarter-over-quarter... But in the meantime... those leases are backed by BP credit.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts maintained a neutral tone, with questions focused on guidance ranges, the impact of leadership changes, and capital deployment. There was a persistent emphasis on expense pressures, asset sales, and debt management, but without overt skepticism or negative language.</li>\n<li>Management's tone in prepared remarks was cautiously optimistic, highlighting \"continued progress\" and \"momentum\" while acknowledging challenges such as \"elevated labor costs\" and \"operational disruption.\" During the Q&amp;A, responses remained measured, with confidence in strategy but no overstatement of positive outcomes. Phrases like \"we feel confident\" and \"we believe\" indicated a balanced outlook.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both management and analysts maintained a similar pragmatic stance, with management slightly more upbeat about the impact of recent asset sales and refinancing, while analysts continued to press on execution and margin risks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance for 2026 is more detailed, with explicit projections for RevPAR, hotel EBITDA, net lease NOI, and adjusted EBITDAre, whereas Q3 focused more on near-term asset sales and debt reduction.</li>\n<li>The pace of hotel dispositions continued, but there is a clear shift toward winding down large-scale CapEx and focusing on free cash flow generation, versus Q3's emphasis on major renovations and capital deployment.</li>\n<li>Analyst questions in both quarters centered on asset sales, debt strategy, margin outlook, and CapEx discipline, but Q4 saw increased focus on execution timing for asset sales and the impact of Sonesta's new management.</li>\n<li>Management's confidence increased regarding the transition to a stronger debt profile and the benefits of recent refinancing, while reiterating caution on labor and operational costs.</li>\n<li>The shift in strategic priorities is evident in the more conservative net lease acquisition target and a deliberate reduction in hotel CapEx.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited \"elevated labor costs and broader operating expense pressures\" and \"temporary operational disruption\" from hotel dispositions as headwinds.</li>\n<li>The CEO cautioned about \"the impact of the prolonged government shutdown\" and \"value-conscious customers remain sensitive to broader macroeconomic conditions.\"</li>\n<li>The net lease portfolio's coverage ratio saw a small drop, attributed to the TA assets, though these are backed by BP's credit.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about the breadth of RevPAR guidance, margin pressures from labor and benefits, and the execution risk of planned asset sales.</li>\n<li>Management's mitigation strategies included targeting hotel sales to improve EBITDA, focusing on high-performing renovated assets, and using proceeds to reduce debt and interest costs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Service Properties Trust's fourth quarter call outlined continued portfolio optimization, major debt reduction initiatives, and a cautious approach to capital deployment. Management signaled confidence in achieving $500 million to $520 million in adjusted EBITDAre for 2026 and expects free cash flow generation following a period of elevated capital investment. The company plans to further reduce leverage through targeted asset sales, focus on operational discipline, and maintain a stable net lease platform, while remaining attentive to cost pressures and market volatility.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/svc/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Indivior Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (INDV) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>CEO Joseph Ciaffoni stated that 2025 was a transition year, highlighting the successful completion of Phase I Generate Momentum and the delivery of record net revenue for SUBLOCADE of $856 million, a 13% increase versus 2024, and total net revenue of $1.24 billion, up 4% from the prior year. He emphasized, \"We improved our commercial execution and generated momentum for SUBLOCADE, delivering record net revenue in 2025 of $856 million, a 13% increase versus 2024 and total net revenue of $1.24 billion, representing a 4% increase compared to the prior year.\" Ciaffoni announced the completion of the $295 million DOJ obligation payment and introduced a new $400 million share repurchase program. He described the shift to Phase II of the Indivior Action agenda, Accelerate, projecting accelerated SUBLOCADE dispense unit growth and net revenue in 2026, with immediate growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash flow.</p></li>\n<li><p>Chief Commercial Officer Patrick Barry reported, \"In the fourth quarter, we delivered strong dispense unit growth of 12% versus the prior year and 6% versus the third quarter. New patient starts in the fourth quarter were up 25% year-over-year.\" Barry noted record levels in active SUBLOCADE prescribers and outlined improvements in field force messaging, commercial channel productivity, patient activation, and policy engagement.</p></li>\n<li><p>CFO Ryan Preblick stated, \"We delivered on our financial commitments in 2025. We grew total SUBLOCADE net revenue by 13% and adjusted EBITDA by 20% year-over-year, and we simplified the organization while strengthening our financial profile.\" Preblick also highlighted the authorization of the new $400 million share repurchase program and reaffirmed 2026 financial guidance.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul><li>The company reaffirmed 2026 guidance with total net revenue expected in the range of $1.125 billion to $1.195 billion, reflecting a modest decline at the midpoint due to anticipated SUBOXONE Film pressure and lower international revenue. SUBLOCADE net revenue is projected between $905 million and $945 million, representing 8% growth at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA is expected between $535 million and $575 million, a 30% increase at the midpoint, with margin expansion to 48%. Operating expenses are guided between $430 million and $450 million. Ciaffoni said, \"We expect to deliver SUBLOCADE dispense unit growth in the mid-teens, an acceleration compared to the 7% dispense unit growth we achieved in 2025.\"</li></ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul><li>Fourth quarter total net revenue reached $358 million, up 20% year-over-year, led by SUBLOCADE net revenue of $252 million for the quarter, a 30% increase. Full year SUBLOCADE dispense volume grew 7%. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 increased 91% to $142 million, and for the full year rose 20% to $428 million with a 500 basis point margin improvement. Fourth quarter operating expenses were $164 million; full year operating expenses totaled $622 million, both down versus the prior year. The company ended the year with $222 million in gross cash and investments after settling the DOJ obligation.</li></ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>David Amsellem, Piper Sandler: Asked about LAI buprenorphine penetration, market share, and capital deployment priorities. Ciaffoni responded that LAI penetration is at 9%, with analogs in schizophrenia suggesting potential for 20% to 30%. He emphasized a focus on new patient share and stated, \"From a share perspective, we have seen over many quarters, our market share stabilizing in the mid-70%.\" On capital deployment, Ciaffoni emphasized targeting commercial-stage assets with over $200 million peak sales potential and a long runway; \"We're looking for assets that have peak sales potential of greater than $200 million.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Chase Knickerbocker, Craig-Hallum: Inquired about assumptions behind 2026 guidance and capital allocation between buybacks and M&amp;A. Ciaffoni said, \"We're assuming mid-teens SUBLOCADE growth,\" and Preblick explained, \"We authorized the $400 million program to be ready to be prepared to buy back shares and be opportunistic.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Yuchen Ding, Jefferies: Asked about Medicaid funding risks and SG&amp;A trends. Ciaffoni avoided specifics on DTC spend and Medicaid outlook for 2027 but noted current penetration leaves ample room for growth regardless of Medicaid fluctuations. Preblick clarified the Q4 SG&amp;A step-up was due to the DTC campaign, with relatively flat expense phasing in 2026.</p></li>\n<li><p>Christian Glennie, Stifel: Clarified reconciliation of SUBLOCADE guidance and impacts from gross-to-net. Ciaffoni said, \"In 2025, gross to net served as a tailwind. In 2026, gross to net will serve as a headwind to the business.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Brandon Folkes, H.C. Wainwright: Asked about the criminal justice system's role in guidance. Barry responded the segment is \"a rebased business\" contributing to overall expected growth.</p></li>\n<li><p>Thibault Boutherin, Morgan Stanley: Asked about ex-U.S. SUBLOCADE and R&amp;D impacts. Preblick indicated rest-of-world SUBLOCADE revenue will be \"relatively flat year-over-year,\" with growth in Australia and Canada offset by the Nordics. Heidbreder detailed timelines for two Phase II trial readouts and outlined criteria for potential Phase III advancement.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Analysts pressed on growth drivers, market share, capital deployment, Medicaid risk, SG&amp;A, and the reconciliation of guidance metrics, reflecting a neutral to slightly positive tone with several requests for clarification on strategic priorities and market opportunity.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management maintained a confident and disciplined tone, particularly around SUBLOCADE’s growth prospects, capital deployment, and cost controls. Phrases such as \"we are confident\" and \"we expect\" were prevalent in prepared remarks, while responses in Q&amp;A avoided specifics but underscored strategic focus and financial discipline.</p></li>\n<li><p>Compared to the previous quarter, analyst sentiment remains consistent, with continued focus on growth levers, commercial execution, and cost management. Management’s confidence appears to have increased, with stronger emphasis on financial strength and capital allocation optionality.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Guidance language has shifted from projecting growth to reaffirming specific 2026 financial targets, including an 8% SUBLOCADE net revenue growth midpoint and 30% adjusted EBITDA growth. Strategic focus has moved from completing organizational simplification to emphasizing commercial acceleration and capital deployment.</p></li>\n<li><p>Analysts maintain focus on SUBLOCADE growth drivers and market share, while also probing capital allocation and operating cost discipline. Key metrics such as SUBLOCADE net revenue and adjusted EBITDA show acceleration from previous guidance.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management’s tone is more assertive and confident, referencing the completion of Phase I and a pivot to Phase II Accelerate, with greater clarity on share repurchase and M&amp;A strategy. Analysts’ tone remains questioning but constructive, seeking greater detail on execution and risk factors.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Management highlighted gross-to-net headwinds in 2026, the expected decline in SUBOXONE Film revenue, and potential volatility in Medicaid funding as areas of concern. Ciaffoni stated, \"At 8%, 9% long-acting injectable penetration, there is so much opportunity for growth with SUBLOCADE across the board, inclusive of Medicaid, it will not be impacted whether Medicaid population is plus or minus a certain percentage.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Analysts asked about the impact of Medicaid funding, the reconciliation of guidance metrics, and the role of the criminal justice system. Management’s responses stressed the underutilization of long-acting injectables and a broad opportunity for SUBLOCADE growth.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Indivior’s leadership outlined a clear transition from organizational restructuring to commercial acceleration in 2026, underpinned by a new share repurchase program and guided by targeted investment in SUBLOCADE and potential business development. The company projects mid-teens SUBLOCADE unit growth, 8% net revenue growth for the product, and a 30% increase in adjusted EBITDA, supported by ongoing cost controls and a disciplined capital allocation strategy. Management’s confidence in SUBLOCADE’s durability and the company’s financial strength sets the stage for executing on Phase II of its action agenda.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/indv/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
