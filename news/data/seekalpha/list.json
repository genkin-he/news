It occurs when a significant number of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange simultaneously register new 52-week highs and new 52-week lows, a divergence considered a sign of fractured market breadth.</p>\n<p data-end=\"735\" data-start=\"302\">Additional conditions typically include a rising market index and a negative or weakening McClellan Oscillator, a momentum gauge.</p>\n<p data-end=\"1029\" data-start=\"737\">The indicator is named after the 1937 Hindenburg airship disaster to evoke the risk of a sudden market “crash,” though analysts caution that not every signal leads to sharp declines. Historically, clusters of omens, rather than isolated readings, have drawn the most attention from traders. It has, however, been more of a false alarm than not in the past decade.</p>\n<p data-end=\"1233\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\" data-start=\"1031\">The S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SP500</a>) rose 1.5% since the start of the year. </p>\n<p data-end=\"1233\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\" data-start=\"1031\">Here is a chart from Subu Trade:</p>\n<p data-end=\"1233\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\" data-start=\"1031\"> </p>\n<figure class=\"regular-img-figure\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><img alt=\"Hindenburg Omen\" data-caption=\"\" data-original-src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/attachment/image/8079e7fc24a50bd4530c36270d057a86.jpg\" data-rel=\"lightbox\" data-source=\"Subu Trade\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"435\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\" src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/attachment/image/8079e7fc24a50bd4530c36270d057a86.jpg?io=w640\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/attachment/image/8079e7fc24a50bd4530c36270d057a86.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/attachment/image/8079e7fc24a50bd4530c36270d057a86.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/attachment/image/8079e7fc24a50bd4530c36270d057a86.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/attachment/image/8079e7fc24a50bd4530c36270d057a86.jpg?io=w240 240w\" width=\"680\"/></span><figcaption class=\"overlay-title\"><p class=\"item-caption\"><span class=\"item-source\">Subu Trade</span></p></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Here are some S&amp;P ETFs:<span> </span></strong><span>(</span><span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a></span></span><span>), (</span><span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VOO\" title=\"Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF\">VOO</a></span></span><span>), (</span><span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IVV\" title=\"iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF\">IVV</a></span></span><span>), (</span><span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RSP\" title=\"Invesco S&amp;P 500 Eql Wght ETF\">RSP</a></span></span><span>), (</span><span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSO\" title=\"ProShares Ultra S&amp;P500 ETF\">SSO</a></span></span><span>), (</span><span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UPRO\" title=\"ProShares UltraPro S&amp;P500 ETF\">UPRO</a></span></span><span>), (</span><span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SH\" title=\"ProShares Short S&amp;P500 ETF\">SH</a></span></span><span>), (</span><span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SDS\" title=\"ProShares UltraShort S&amp;P500 ETF\">SDS</a></span></span><span>), and (</span><span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPXU\" title=\"ProShares UltraPro Short S&amp;P500 ETF\">SPXU</a></span></span><span>).</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
