            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">As U.S. and Israeli airstrikes hit Iran over the weekend, traders on prediction platform Polymarket were collecting payouts. And drawing scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Roughly $529 million changed hands in markets tied to the timing of a potential U.S. strike, Bloomberg News reported late Saturday. Analytics firm Bubblemaps said six newly created accounts made about $1 million combined by betting the U.S. would attack Iran by Feb. 28. The accounts, opened in February, focused solely on strike-related wagers, with some shares reportedly purchased for as little as 10 cents just hours before explosions were reported in Tehran.</p>\n<p>Blockchain analysts say such patterns of new wallets, concentrated bets and well-timed trades can resemble insider activity. But they caution that the evidence is circumstantial. U.S. officials had signaled possible military action for weeks, fueling heavy speculation. A Feb. 28 strike contract alone drew about $90 million in trading volume, far more than other dates.</p>\n<p>Not every bettor profited. One of the flagged accounts had previously lost money wagering on an earlier strike before placing a larger bet that ultimately paid off.</p>\n<p>The episode underscores the murky oversight surrounding prediction markets, where traders can participate with little more than a crypto wallet. Polymarket, which operates offshore and bars U.S. users, didn’t respond to requests for comment by Bloomberg News. The company has said its markets aggregate public information and help gauge risk during fast-moving events.</p>\n<p>Other Iran-related contracts have also sparked debate, including one tied to whether Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei would be out of power by the end of March. Critics note that the market’s terms do not exclude death as a qualifying outcome, raising ethical concerns.</p>\n<p>Regulated rival Kalshi, overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said it doesn’t offer contracts that settle on death and has taken enforcement actions against users suspected of trading on nonpublic information.</p>\n<p>Whether the latest Iran bets reflect privileged knowledge or simply aggressive speculation remains unclear, a question blockchain data alone cannot resolve.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Dear Readers:</span></strong><span> We recognize that politics often intersects with the financial news of the day, so we invite you to click </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4867597-politics-and-the-markets-030126#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"here\"><span>here</span></a><span> to join the separate political discussion.</span></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Air travel across the Persian Gulf remained largely frozen for a second straight day as Iran’s retaliatory strikes rippled through the region, forcing leading carriers to prolong flight suspensions and stranding tens of thousands of passengers, according to several media reports.</p>\n<p>Emirates, the world’s biggest long-haul international airline, said its operations were suspended until further notice. Etihad Airways pushed its cancellations through 2 a.m. Monday, and Qatar Airways confirmed that its flights remained grounded, with an update expected later Monday morning.</p>\n<p>The United Arab Emirates’ civil aviation authority said it had assisted more than 20,000 travelers caught in the disruption. The Gulf’s aviation system, which typically connects distant cities with a single stopover, has effectively stalled, leaving large numbers of passengers unable to continue their journeys.</p>\n<p>Airports across the region reported damage after Iran launched missiles and drones following weekend strikes by Israeli and U.S. forces. In Abu Dhabi, authorities said one person was killed and several others injured after air defenses intercepted a drone overnight. Dubai International Airport, the busiest hub for international travel, reported damage to part of a concourse that left four employees hurt.</p>\n<p>Bahrain’s main airport sustained damage from a drone strike, while Kuwait’s airport was also hit, with several workers treated for minor injuries.</p>\n<p>While Middle Eastern airspace has faced intermittent restrictions in recent years, aviation analysts say a sweeping, multi-hour shutdown of this magnitude is without precedent. The halt underscores the broader risks stemming from escalating tensions between Iran, Israel and the United States, and the vulnerability of critical infrastructure in the energy-rich Gulf.</p>\n<p>The suspension has scrambled aircraft rotations and crew assignments worldwide. With planes and flight crews out of position, industry experts expect it could take days to restore schedules even after airspace reopens.</p>\n<p>The impact has extended well beyond the Gulf. India’s aviation regulator said domestic airlines canceled more than 400 flights on Saturday, with a similar number expected to be scrapped Sunday. Carriers in Europe, Canada and Asia, including Singapore, have also paused service to parts of the Middle East.</p>\n<p>Over the past two decades, Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad have transformed the Gulf into a central crossroads for global aviation, using expansive fleets and strategically located hubs to channel traffic between continents. That model, which turned the region into one of the world’s most important transit corridors, now faces one of its most severe operational tests.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

While Anthropic’s new AI tool threatens to steal a chunk of IBM’s $21.1B consulting revenue by automating the mapping of old COBOL code, it doesn’t look like this translated code will be able to run outside the mainframe or that someone will try to risk it and transition to the cloud. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>With features like internal redundancy and shared-everything memory, the z17 mainframe remains the only machine banks trust for zero-downtime transactions. Financially, IBM is a “cash cow” with a record $14.7B in free cash flow, but with $61.3B in debt and a modest 5% growth forecast, the jury is still out on whether its $12.5B GenAI business can progress fast enough to keep Anthropic away. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/the-techie\"><span>The Techie</span></a><span>: The market's visceral reaction to IBM (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM\" title=\"International Business Machines Corporation\">IBM</a>) this week is a classic case of shooting first and asking questions later, triggered by the realization that AI is accelerating faster than even the most aggressive forecasts. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>I don’t think the sudden panic over Anthropic’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANTHRO\" title=\"Anthropic\">ANTHRO</a>) ability to automate COBOL modernization is an overnight kill switch for a company deeply embedded in global financial infrastructure. Instead, it serves as a wake-up call that the traditional high-margin consulting model is being permanently repriced. IBM isn't necessarily obsolete, but it is now in a high-stakes race to prove it can be the architect of this new automated world rather than its first major casualty.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The most important trend for the rest of 2026 is the democratization of software. As tools like Anthropic’s Claude Code become more capable, the moat for legacy software companies is shrinking. We are moving into an era where the value isn't in writing the code but in owning the data and the client relationship.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/joseph-parrish\"><span>Joseph Parrish</span></a><span>: IBM (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM\" title=\"International Business Machines Corporation\">IBM</a>) will continue to innovate, which recent years have already proved.
