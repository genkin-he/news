            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Chih-Hsiang Lin highlighted record quarterly results, stating \"total revenue increased 83% compared to 2024 to a record $456 million.\" He emphasized the \"robust demand in both our CATV and data center business\" and noted a \"fourth 800G buying order from one of our major hyperscale customers to support its AI data center growth.\" Lin added, \"We have become ramping up production of this 800G module in anticipation of a strong volume ramp starting in Q2.\"</li>\n<li>Lin discussed manufacturing expansion, saying, \"due to the software investment we have made, we have materially expanded our manufacturing capacity.\"</li>\n<li>CFO Stefan Murry stated, \"we are pleased to deliver record fourth quarter results that were in line with or better than our expectations and which capped off the strongest year in our company's history.\" Murry also outlined four key priorities for 2026: \"scaling our next-generation data center products...expanding our production capacity...diversifying our revenue base; and...strengthening operational execution to improve our margins and long-term profitability.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Murry projected Q1 2026 revenue between $150 million and $165 million, with non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 29% to 31%. Non-GAAP net income is expected to be in the range of a loss of $7 million to a loss of $0.3 million and non-GAAP earnings per share between a loss of $0.09 per share and breakeven.</li>\n<li>He added, \"we expect to generate over $1 billion in revenue this year with a non-GAAP operating profit of over $120 million.\"</li>\n<li>Management stated that \"this revenue level is limited by our production capacity and supply chain, not market demand, which we believe is much larger.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Q4 2025 revenue was $134.3 million, up 34% year-over-year and 13% sequentially, and in line with guidance of $125 million to $140 million.</li>\n<li>Non-GAAP gross margin was 31.4%, above the high end of the guidance range. Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.01, narrower than the guidance range of a loss of $0.13 to a loss of $0.04.</li>\n<li>Data center revenue was $74.9 million, up 69% year-over-year and 70% sequentially. Sales of 100G products increased 54% year-over-year; 400G products increased 141% year-over-year.</li>\n<li>CATV revenue was $54 million, up 3% year-over-year but down 24% sequentially from a record Q3.</li>\n<li>Operating expenses were $49.3 million or 37% of revenue.</li>\n<li>Cash and equivalents at quarter end were $216 million; inventory was $183.1 million. Capital investments for the quarter totaled $84 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Simon Leopold, Raymond James: Asked for clarification on 800G revenue, to which Murry replied \"it was below $4 million.\" Lin added, \"a lot below it is delayed to Q1, but we have emphasized the revenue will be big in Q2 next year across the target.\"</li>\n<li>Leopold inquired about gross margin trajectory. Lin responded, \"the gross margin for 1.6T is much, much higher than the other products...I believe we're going to achieve 40% gross margin by late Q3 or Q4 next year.\"</li>\n<li>Leopold questioned CATV outlook. Murry explained, \"they're spending this year and next year a significant amount of their spend...towards the amplifiers...and that's where we play.\"</li>\n<li>Michael Genovese, Rosenblatt Securities: Asked about 800G ramp milestones. Murry said, \"the firmware has to be modified to work with all those different platforms...that should be done in the middle of next month...that's basically the last hurdle to kind of unleash the ramp.\"</li>\n<li>Genovese questioned production mix. Lin explained, \"by end of next year, I would say more than 55% will be manufactured in the U.S. or even 60% or 65%...but let me say that more than 80%, 85% of investment will be in Texas.\"</li>\n<li>George Notter, Wolfe Research: Asked about tariffs. Murry stated, \"the one place where I'm pretty confident in saying it's not going to be tariff, it's product that's made in the U.S., and that's what we're scaling up to do.\"</li>\n<li>Ryan Koontz, Needham &amp; Company: Inquired about laser supply. Murry said, \"we're planning to triple our production of indium phosphide-related devices here...by the middle part of next year.\"</li>\n<li>Tim Savageaux, Northland Capital Markets: Asked about data center revenue growth. Murry replied, \"we also do expect to see some revenue in 800 gig, just not the dramatic ramp that we expect to see starting in Q2.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts focused heavily on near-term 800G ramp, production bottlenecks, gross margin targets, and CATV demand, with a tone that was inquisitive but occasionally pressing, especially regarding execution timelines and supply constraints. </li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone in prepared remarks, using phrases like \"we believe this positions us well\" and \"we are pleased to deliver record fourth quarter results.\" During Q&amp;A, management acknowledged some operational bottlenecks and displayed slight defensiveness when clarifying production and margin timelines, but reiterated confidence in ramping capacity and meeting demand.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management displayed increased optimism, especially regarding scale and demand, but with heightened scrutiny around execution risk and production capacity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance for 2026 shifted to a higher revenue target ($1 billion) versus prior focus on achieving $300 million in CATV; margin expansion targets became more specific, aiming for 40% gross margin by late Q3 or Q4 next year.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus moved decisively toward scaling 800G and 1.6T production and U.S. manufacturing footprint; capital investment plans expanded significantly relative to Q3.</li>\n<li>Analysts in both quarters pressed for details on production scaling and customer demand, but Q4's exchanges were more focused on resolving capacity bottlenecks and ramping new products. </li>\n<li>Management's tone evolved from cautious optimism to confident ambition, particularly in outlining explicit targets and acknowledging capacity as the main constraint.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management noted supply chain and manufacturing capacity as the primary constraints to revenue growth, rather than demand.</li>\n<li>Ongoing firmware optimization was cited as a reason for delayed 800G revenue in Q4, with expectations for resolution in Q1 and ramp in Q2.</li>\n<li>Tariffs remain a cost risk, though Murry explained efforts to onshore production to mitigate this.</li>\n<li>Analysts repeatedly questioned execution risks in manufacturing scale-up and order fulfillment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Applied Optoelectronics closed 2025 with record results and signaled a pivotal year ahead, targeting over $1 billion in revenue for 2026 as it ramps 800G and 1.6T production for hyperscale data center customers. Management underscored that near-term growth is gated by manufacturing capacity rather than demand, with substantial investments focused on U.S. expansion and automation. The outlook is anchored by strong customer commitments and a robust product pipeline, though execution risks tied to supply chain and scaling remain under close watch by both management and analysts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/aaoi/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

It’s important to remember that the company has 430M accounts, and in today’s fintech landscape—where wallets are one of the hottest areas—such scale is very attractive. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>With an enterprise value of around $40B and roughly $6B in annual free cash flow, PayPal trades at low multiples that could also draw interest from private equity. They could potentially unlock more value by breaking the company into parts. A spinoff of Venmo, a growing business and a leader in its category, could make sense and might even be worth the majority of PayPal’s current market cap on its own. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>) could be interested in PayPal’s consumer-facing business, given its strong push into wallets and the influence it already has over PayPal’s destiny through Apple Pay. Alphabet's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) Google Pay could also be a logical contender, along with Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), which explored fintech a few years ago with WhatsApp-based payments. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Large platforms are likely not interested in Braintree or PayPal’s other B2B units, but the consumer accounts and wallet base represent a highly attractive strategic asset, as I see it.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/atilla-zambito\"><span>Atilla Zambito</span></a><span>: After PayPal (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PYPL\" title=\"PayPal Holdings, Inc.\">PYPL</a>) reached a market cap of just $38B, it was only a matter of time until the company received interest in all or part of its business. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>First, PayPal is highly cash-generative and has a healthy balance sheet. Second, it has one of the largest user bases in the world. Moreover, PayPal owns attractive assets, such as its BNPL business, Venmo, and Braintree. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>PayPal could be acquired by a large competitor like Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) to complement its own payment service or by a larger bank seeking to enter the fintech space. Business parts could be sold to competitors as well; for example, unbranded checkout Braintree to Adyen (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ADYEY\" title=\"Adyen N.V.\">ADYEY</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ADYYF\" title=\"Adyen N.V.\">ADYYF</a>) or Venmo to Block (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XYZ\" title=\"Block, Inc.\">XYZ</a>). It remains to be seen who will buy what, but I’m convinced that investors will see some form of a deal or deals soon.</span></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

Discovery (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBD\" title=\"Warner Bros.

So that's where everything stands,\" Bruce Campbell, Warner Bros.' chief revenue and strategy officer, reportedly said during the town hall.</p>\n<p>However, the deal would require approval under the EU's foreign subsidies regulation because Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Abu Dhabi's L'imad Holding Company, and the Qatar Investment Authority are also bankrolling the bid, the report said. The FSR targets unfair foreign state aid.</p>\n<p>According to the report, the company may be willing to divest minor channels such as its children's brands if required. Overlapping businesses include the combination of two studios and several TV channels.</p>\n<p>Outside the U.S., David Ellison has been busy trying to convince regulators, notably in the UK, Germany, and France, while his recently appointed legal chief, Makan Delrahim, met the European Commission's top merger official, Guillaume Loriot.</p>\n<p>European Parliament lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who was against Netflix's bid and met Delrahim last month, said a Paramount bid poses fewer issues.</p>\n<p>\"I think Paramount is something we could accept. It is a concentration in the production of films. There is no risk of a digital champion taking over the video streaming market,\" Schwab said.</p>\n<p>PSKY shares are up nearly 24%, NFLX is up 13%, and WBD is down nearly 2% in late afternoon trading. </p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
