While Anthropic’s new AI tool threatens to steal a chunk of IBM’s $21.1B consulting revenue by automating the mapping of old COBOL code, it doesn’t look like this translated code will be able to run outside the mainframe or that someone will try to risk it and transition to the cloud. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>With features like internal redundancy and shared-everything memory, the z17 mainframe remains the only machine banks trust for zero-downtime transactions. Financially, IBM is a “cash cow” with a record $14.7B in free cash flow, but with $61.3B in debt and a modest 5% growth forecast, the jury is still out on whether its $12.5B GenAI business can progress fast enough to keep Anthropic away. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/the-techie\"><span>The Techie</span></a><span>: The market's visceral reaction to IBM (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM\" title=\"International Business Machines Corporation\">IBM</a>) this week is a classic case of shooting first and asking questions later, triggered by the realization that AI is accelerating faster than even the most aggressive forecasts. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>I don’t think the sudden panic over Anthropic’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANTHRO\" title=\"Anthropic\">ANTHRO</a>) ability to automate COBOL modernization is an overnight kill switch for a company deeply embedded in global financial infrastructure. Instead, it serves as a wake-up call that the traditional high-margin consulting model is being permanently repriced. IBM isn't necessarily obsolete, but it is now in a high-stakes race to prove it can be the architect of this new automated world rather than its first major casualty.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The most important trend for the rest of 2026 is the democratization of software. As tools like Anthropic’s Claude Code become more capable, the moat for legacy software companies is shrinking. We are moving into an era where the value isn't in writing the code but in owning the data and the client relationship.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/joseph-parrish\"><span>Joseph Parrish</span></a><span>: IBM (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM\" title=\"International Business Machines Corporation\">IBM</a>) will continue to innovate, which recent years have already proved. Generating $15B in cash now, they can just buy back shares easily on the downside. I don't give much credence to speculative AI doom and gloom.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>IBM works with big customers who are risk-averse and will not lightly drop a working product. Anthropic (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANTHRO\" title=\"Anthropic\">ANTHRO</a>) merely highlights the same path that IBM can take as they are already evolving their own products with AI.</span><strong></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/screeners/9409aed046-Top-IT-Consulting-and-Other-Services-Stocks\"><span>Top IT Consulting &amp; Other Services Stocks</span></a></li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/screeners/9409aed042-Top-Systems-Software-Stocks\"><span>Top Systems Software Stocks</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

However, there would be a bigger price spike and longer-lasting impact if oil infrastructure or supplies were interrupted, for instance because of disruption of tanker traffic through the Strait of Hormuz.</span></p>\n<p><span>Oil prices have already risen on war fears. International benchmark Brent crude closed at a seven-month high of $72.87 on Friday.</span></p>\n<p><span>Iran exports some 1.6 million barrels of oil a day, most of it going to China, where privately owned refineries are less concerned about the U.S. sanctions that prevent Iran from selling its oil elsewhere. If that supply is disrupted, Chinese customers would look elsewhere for oil on the global market, potentially driving up prices.</span></p>\n<p><span>Another question is around the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of global oil supply pass through each day. Middle East exporters Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates send most of their exports through the strait.

The revised Paramount (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSKY\" title=\"Paramount Skydance Corporation\">PSKY</a>) offer was at a purchase price of $31.00 per share in cash, a one-dollar increase from its earlier bid, which valued the company at around $108B.</p>\n<p><strong>Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>)</strong> shares fell nearly 5.5% Thursday, their worst day since April 16, despite posting blowout earnings. The performance highlights the market’s heightened sensitivity to earnings from large-cap technology companies, particularly those tied to artificial intelligence and data center demand.</p>\n<p><strong>Block (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XYZ\" title=\"Block, Inc.\">XYZ</a>)</strong> announced on Thursday that it's slashing its headcount by more than 40% because intelligent technology means fewer people can do more.
