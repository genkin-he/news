            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Fidus Investment (FDUS) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Edward Ross, Chairman of the Board &amp; CEO, highlighted that \"deal flow was strong, driven by a healthy M&amp;A environment compared to earlier in the year. This resulted in originations of $213.7 million, the highest amount of capital we have invested in a quarter.\" He attributed the surge to pent-up demand following Liberation Day and noted several deals spilled over from the third quarter. Ross emphasized disciplined underwriting, stating Fidus continues to invest in niche market leaders with recurring revenue and structured debt with significant loan-to-value cushions.</li>\n<li>The company's total portfolio reached $1.3 billion on a fair value basis. Adjusted NII for Q4 was $19.4 million, up 5.1%, and the company paid total dividends of $0.50 per share for the quarter. Net asset value grew to $741.9 million, or $19.55 per share.</li>\n<li>For Q1 2026, Ross announced, \"the Board of Directors declared a total dividend of $0.52 per share, which consists of a base dividend of $0.43 per share and a supplemental dividend of $0.09 per share.\"</li>\n<li>Shelby Sherard, CFO, stated, \"Total investment income was $42.2 million for the 3 months ended December 31, a $4.9 million increase from Q3, primarily driven by a $2 million increase in interest income as a result of increased average debt investments outstanding and which includes a $0.3 million of accelerated amortization of closing fees related to debt repayments, a $3.5 million increase in fee income given an increase in investment activity in Q4, which was partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in dividend income from equity investments.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ross stated, \"We expect activity levels will pick up during the year as some private equity owners are likely to need to bring certain portfolio companies to market. As we deploy capital, we intend to stay focused on our long-term goals of generating attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders and growing net-asset-value over time.\"</li>\n<li>He noted that deal flow in Q1 2026 is \"a little more modest in nature\" but expected activity to increase as the year progresses.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Net investment income (NII) for Q4 was $0.53 per share, while adjusted NII was $0.52 per share, both increased compared to Q3.</li>\n<li>Portfolio at fair value ended at $1.3 billion, with $658.3 million in debt outstanding. The weighted average interest rate on debt was 5.2% as of December 31.</li>\n<li>Weighted average effective yield on debt investments was 12.6% as of December 31, compared to 13% at the end of Q3. Nonaccruals accounted for less than 1% of the portfolio on a fair value basis.</li>\n<li>Liquidity at year-end included $79.6 million in cash, $141.2 million availability on the line of credit, and $84 million of available SBA debentures, totaling approximately $304.8 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Robert Dodd, Raymond James: Asked about deal flow spillover into Q1 and whether activity would be more modest after the Q4 ramp. Chairman Ross responded, “Q4 was a quarter where most things kind of came to fruition... I think now in Q1 '26, deal flow is a little more modest in nature. We believe it's somewhat due to seasonal patterns... our current expectations are for an increase in both deal flow and activity throughout the year.”</li>\n<li>Dodd also probed on software business risk, especially regarding AI. Ross explained, “We believe the recent headlines, although meaningful and serious, the market dislocation in software has been blown out of proportion from our perspective... we're looking for companies that have things like data moats... vertical markets, specialized industry software... contractual revenue streams... management is critical.”</li>\n<li>Mickey Schleien, Clear Street LLC: Inquired about ARR loans. Ross replied, \"about 22% of our software portfolio today or 7.5% of our total portfolio are ARR loans as we sit here today... when we structure an ARR loan, we force growth through covenants... and we also force a transition to cash flow.\"</li>\n<li>Schleien asked about the concentration in Pfanstiehl. Ross replied, \"we are extremely comfortable with that position. I think the long-term outlook for that business, they're a leader in their space... we feel good about it today.\"</li>\n<li>Schleien questioned the dividend outlook from Pfanstiehl; Ross noted dividends are \"episodic in nature, but also reoccurring annually in some way, shape or form.\"</li>\n<li>Schleien asked about floating rate debt floors; Ross stated, \"Most of our floors that we've been originating here over the last, let's say, 3, 4 years are in the 2% range.\"</li>\n<li>Christopher Nolan, Ladenburg Thalmann: Queried on M&amp;A drivers and software company deleveraging. Ross indicated pent-up demand from PE is the main M&amp;A driver, and \"we are seeing deleveraging, whether it's an ARR loan or it's EBITDA-based loan.\"</li>\n<li>Paul Johnson, KBW: Asked about recovery rates on first lien loans. Ross estimated historical recoveries in the 60%-85% range and emphasized the 37% loan-to-value provides a significant cushion.</li>\n<li>Dylan Haynes, B. Riley Securities: Asked about deployment trends in software/tech and pricing. Ross stated Fidus remains focused on best-in-class software names and expects unique opportunities from recent market dislocation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts maintained a generally positive tone but sought detailed risk disclosures, especially regarding sector exposures and portfolio concentration. Questions were probing yet constructive, with a focus on sustainability and risk management.</li>\n<li>Management's tone was confident and slightly more detailed when discussing portfolio quality and risk controls. Ross repeatedly emphasized comfort with concentrations and underwriting discipline, and used phrases like \"we feel good about it\" and \"we are extremely comfortable\" when discussing key positions and risk areas.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management exhibited increased attention to software/AI risks and portfolio concentrations, but management's confidence level remained steady and slightly upbeat.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Q4 saw a marked increase in deal originations ($213.7 million vs. $74.5 million in Q3), attributed to pent-up M&amp;A demand following market disruptions earlier in the year.</li>\n<li>Adjusted NII per share rose to $0.52 in Q4 from $0.50 in Q3. Net asset value increased to $741.9 million from $711 million. Dividend per share for Q1 2026 was declared at $0.52, higher than the $0.50 declared for Q4 in the previous call.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus shifted to more detailed software/tech sector disclosure and risk mitigation, with increased discussion of AI and ARR exposures.</li>\n<li>Analysts in Q4 pressed more on the specifics of portfolio risk, especially in the software sector, compared to Q3's broader focus on market activity and macro risks (e.g., tariffs, government shutdown).</li>\n<li>Management's sentiment remained consistently confident, with more emphasis on underwriting standards and sector strategy in Q4.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management highlighted ongoing attention to AI risks within the software and tech-enabled services portfolio, which totaled $464 million, with 92% first-lien debt and an average loan-to-value of 37%.</li>\n<li>Nonaccruals remained low, but management continues to monitor sector and company-specific risks, especially in concentrated positions like Pfanstiehl and in the face of interest rate changes.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about portfolio concentration, sustainability of dividend income from key holdings, floating rate exposure to declining SOFR, and the impact of M&amp;A market dynamics.</li>\n<li>Management's mitigation strategies include strict underwriting, structured covenants, portfolio diversification, and a focus on first-lien security.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Fidus Investment delivered a record quarter for deal originations, driven by a rebound in M&amp;A activity and pent-up demand. The company outlined a clear focus on underwriting discipline, robust credit quality, and risk-adjusted returns, with enhanced transparency on software and tech portfolio exposures, including AI-related risks. Management expects deal flow and investment activity to build through 2026, supported by strong liquidity and a disciplined approach to capital deployment, while maintaining confidence in portfolio quality and dividend sustainability.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/fdus/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. (TCPC) Q4 2025  </p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Philip Tseng, CEO, noted a challenging quarter, stating that \"Full year 2025 adjusted NII was $1.22 per share compared to $1.52 in 2024. Annualized NII ROE for the year was 12.3% compared to 14.5% in 2024.\" He attributed the decline in NII to \"portfolio markdowns and nonaccruals as well as lower base rates and tighter spreads year-over-year.\" Adjusted NII for the fourth quarter was $0.25 per share, down from $0.30 in the previous quarter and $0.36 in the same quarter last year.</li>\n<li>Tseng highlighted significant portfolio markdowns, with NAV dropping 19% to $7.07 per share as of December 31, 2025, from $8.71 at September 30. Six portfolio companies accounted for approximately 67% or $1.11 per share of the NAV decline, with Edmentum, Razor, SellerX, Renovo, Hylan, and InMobi named as key contributors.</li>\n<li>The CEO announced a first quarter dividend of $0.17 per share and detailed share repurchases during and after the quarter totaling 749,410 shares.</li>\n<li>Jason Mehring, President, outlined that the portfolio stood at $1.5 billion across 141 companies, with 92.4% invested in senior secured loans and 7.5% in equity. \"All new portfolio company investments during 2025 were in first lien loans, bringing total portfolio exposure to first lien loans to 87.4% on a fair value basis, up from 83.6% last year.\"</li>\n<li>Mehring discussed new investments, including a $4.5 million first lien term loan to a wealth management platform and a $4 million first lien loan to Coalfire, a cybersecurity provider, emphasizing a strategy of direct origination and increased portfolio diversification.</li>\n<li>Erik Cuellar, CFO, stated, \"Gross investment income for the fourth quarter was $0.52 per share,\" including \"recurring cash interest of $0.41, nonrecurring income of $0.01, recurring discount and fee amortization of $0.02, PIK income of $0.06 and dividend income of $0.02 per share.\"</li>\n<li>Cuellar also reported, \"Net realized losses for the quarter were $73.9 million or $0.87 per share... Net unrealized losses were $66.5 million or $0.78 per share, primarily due to the unrealized markdowns on the 6 investments Phil discussed earlier.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management reiterated its focus on improving credit quality and repositioning toward first lien loans and greater portfolio diversification. Tseng stated, \"Our highest near-term priority is to improve the credit quality of our investment portfolio by working diligently to resolve challenged credits.\"</li>\n<li>The dividend was set at $0.17 per share for Q1 2026, with the goal of maintaining a sustainable and NII-covered dividend.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjusted net investment income for Q4 was $0.25 per share, compared to $0.30 in Q3 and $0.36 in Q4 2024.</li>\n<li>NAV declined to $7.07 per share at December 31, 2025, down from $8.71 at September 30.</li>\n<li>Nonaccrual debt investments represented 4% of the portfolio at fair value and 9.7% at cost.</li>\n<li>Total liquidity at year-end was $570.2 million, with $482.8 million in available borrowings and $61.1 million of cash. Net regulatory leverage was 1.41x at year-end, up from 1.2x in the previous quarter.</li>\n<li>The company paid down its entire $325 million principal amount of 2026 unsecured notes post year-end.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Robert Dodd, Raymond James: Questioned whether more aggressive strategic adjustments might be warranted given portfolio contraction and rising leverage. Philip Tseng responded, \"We continually evaluate ways to optimize returns for the shareholders. And at this time, we believe the best path forward is to continue to focus on improving the credit quality of the portfolio and executing on the investment strategy that we've been discussing.\"</li>\n<li>Dodd also asked about the effectiveness of restructurings and whether more aggressive approaches were needed. Tseng replied, \"Restructurings, they can play out in several different ways. The road to recovery... are not always linear. In fact, they're rarely linear.\"</li>\n<li>Finian O'Shea, Wells Fargo: Inquired about the rationale behind the significant NAV markdowns and the unusual timing of the 8-K filing. Jason Mehring responded, \"There hasn't been any sort of change to our valuation policy... when you look at the overall write-downs in the quarter, they were concentrated fairly heavily among those 6 names... had an equity orientation, which... is more volatile.\" Mehring emphasized the idiosyncratic nature of the events and said the 8-K was a one-off due to the magnitude and concentration of markdowns.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts expressed skepticism regarding the pace of portfolio turnaround, the need for more aggressive strategic action, and the stickiness of restructurings, with pointed questions about the viability of current plans and the causes behind NAV declines.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a neutral to slightly defensive tone, emphasizing ongoing execution of their strategy and the complexity of credit recoveries. Tseng asserted, \"We are confident in our strategy.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management exhibited increased caution, with more direct questioning from analysts and more extended explanations and justifications from management.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance language shifted from optimism about stabilization and diversification in Q3 to acknowledgment of significant NAV declines and the need for portfolio repositioning in Q4.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus increased on first lien loans and diversification, with the percentage of first lien loans rising from 83.6% to 87.4%.</li>\n<li>Key metrics deteriorated: NAV fell from $8.71 to $7.07 per share, and adjusted NII dropped from $0.30 to $0.25 per share.</li>\n<li>Analysts' tone moved from cautious to pressing, seeking clarity on strategic alternatives and the efficacy of restructuring processes.</li>\n<li>Management's confidence in the investment strategy remained, but explanations were longer and more focused on remediation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited portfolio markdowns and nonaccruals as major challenges, especially in investments underwritten before 2022.</li>\n<li>Six specific portfolio companies were responsible for most of the NAV decline.</li>\n<li>Equity-oriented positions were highlighted as particularly volatile.</li>\n<li>Tseng noted the need to \"work diligently with our borrowers, their sponsors and creditors to optimize recovery values, including pursuing restructurings and other transaction-driven outcomes when appropriate.\"</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about restructuring effectiveness and the potential need for more aggressive strategic shifts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Management emphasized the ongoing repositioning of the portfolio toward first lien senior secured loans and greater diversification, acknowledging significant NAV and NII declines driven by concentrated markdowns in legacy investments. The company reiterated its commitment to resolving challenged credits and leveraging BlackRock’s resources, with the aim of gradually improving portfolio quality and delivering sustainable returns to shareholders.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/tcpc/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

In Washington, I'm pleased to report that we've been working collaboratively and productively with parties and have reached settlement in principle, resolving the revenue requirement in the case.\"</li>\n<li>The CEO emphasized the integration and growth of Texas assets: \"SiEnergy provided 18% organic customer growth in 2025 and contributed 11% of our consolidated adjusted earnings per share. At the same time, SiEnergy posted a sizable increase to its customer backlog nearing 250,000 future meters.\"</li>\n<li>Palfreyman stated on the water segment, \"The Water segment outperformed our expectations, contributing $0.35 per share or 12% of our consolidated adjusted earnings per share in 2025.\"</li>\n<li>CFO Raymond Kaszuba said, \"For the full year 2025, we reported record adjusted earnings per share of $2.93 compared to $2.33 per share for 2024. Earnings growth was fueled by new rates in Oregon, healthy rate base growth across the business and continued strong organic customer growth.\"</li>\n<li>Kaszuba added, \"For 2026 specifically, we expect another record year for both capital investment and earnings. At the same time, we are focused on returning capital to shareholders.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The company is initiating 2026 earnings per share guidance of $2.95 to $3.15 and reaffirming its long-term earnings per share growth rate of 4% to 6% compounded annually from 2025 adjusted earnings per share through 2030.</li>\n<li>Palfreyman indicated that if the MX3 project receives notice to proceed, \"we expect that we will increase that to the 5% to 7% that we just described.\"</li>\n<li>The company expects SiEnergy and Northwest Natural Water to contribute approximately 25% of consolidated earnings for 2026.</li>\n<li>Capital expenditures for 2026 are anticipated at approximately $500 million to $550 million, with a five-year CapEx plan of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion through 2030.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjusted earnings per share for 2025 reached $2.93, up from $2.33 in 2024.</li>\n<li>Cash provided by operating activities was approximately $270 million, about 35% above 2024.</li>\n<li>Record capital investment of $467 million was made in 2025, with $340 million allocated to acquisitions.</li>\n<li>SiEnergy contributed $0.33 per share for 2025, above initial expectations.</li>\n<li>Water segment earnings per share increased $0.21 and contributed $0.35 per share, also above expectations.</li>\n<li>Year-end liquidity stood at approximately $590 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Christopher Ellinghaus, Siebert Williams Shank: Asked about the impact of MX3 on growth guidance and project timeline. Palfreyman responded, \"Without MX3, we are very comfortable with our 4% to 6% long-term EPS growth guidance. With the project, once that achieves notice to proceed, we expect that we will increase that to the 5% to 7% that we just described.\"</li>\n<li>Ellinghaus inquired about SiEnergy's performance. Palfreyman said, \"We've been really pleased with the growth that we've seen at SiEnergy despite a slowdown in the housing market in Texas, we had incredible growth this year.\"</li>\n<li>Ellinghaus asked about the Oregon rate mechanism. Palfreyman confirmed, \"We are expecting receipt of that, the rate mechanism here in Oregon as part of that guidance. It is a relatively modest increase to rates, about 1.5%.\"</li>\n<li>Ellinghaus queried about water segment M&amp;A strategy. Palfreyman stated, \"We're always looking opportunistically at acquisition opportunities... but we are really happy with the platform that we have built.\"</li>\n<li>Alexis Kania, BTIG: Asked about MX3 funding and AFUDC. Kaszuba responded, \"We would be able to fund any equity through normal issuances under our ATM. And then... yes, we would also receive AFUDC during the construction period.\"</li>\n<li>Selman Akyol, Stifel: Asked about further storage expansion and behind-the-meter opportunities. Palfreyman said, \"There is strong customer demand... It's very premature to comment on any specifics there. In terms of behind-the-meter opportunities, it is something we've been approached by numerous customers... If there is a storage potential use case there, but there's nothing that we have today to announce on that front.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts were positive, focusing on growth drivers, regulatory clarity, and strategic expansions, frequently congratulating management and probing for details on forward growth and project execution.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and optimistic tone, especially in the prepared remarks.

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Natural Resource Partners L.P. (NRP) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>President &amp; COO Craig Nunez stated that \"NRP generated $46 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter and $169 million of free cash flow in the full year 2025.\" He emphasized ongoing challenges, noting, \"All three of our key commodities, metallurgical coal, thermal coal and soda ash continued to struggle with sales prices that are near or below our estimates of operator's marginal cost of production.\" Nunez addressed the ongoing downturn in the soda ash market, stating, \"We believe 2026 will be worse\" and described the current environment as \"the worst bear market in its 60-plus-year history.\" He revealed a $39 million investment in the Sisecam Wyoming joint venture to support its capital structure and reduce bank debt, which will delay the anticipated increase in unitholder distributions from August to a subsequent quarter.</li>\n<li>Chief Financial Officer Christopher Zolas reported, \"In the fourth quarter of 2025, NRP generated $31 million of net income, $45 million of operating cash flow and $46 million of free cash flow.\" Zolas highlighted that \"our Mineral Rights segment generated $40 million of net income, $49 million of operating cash flow and $50 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter.\" He pointed out that segment declines were due to weaker metallurgical coal markets and that soda ash segment income and cash flow also fell from the prior year. Zolas confirmed, \"We used the free cash flow generated from our business segments in 2025 to repay $109 million of debt. Even including the impact of our planned $39 million capital investment into Sisecam Wyoming, we remain on track to accomplish our deleveraging goal this year.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Nunez indicated that the timing for a substantial increase in unitholder distributions has shifted: \"The $39 million investment in Sisecam Wyoming is one such event and will push the distribution increase we had expected to occur in August back to a subsequent quarter.\"</li>\n<li>He reiterated, \"The longer the bear market continues for all three of our key commodities, the greater the likelihood something happens that pushes that timing back. But right now, that's what the timing looks like.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>NRP reported $31 million of net income, $45 million of operating cash flow, and $46 million of free cash flow for Q4 2025. Full-year figures were $136 million of net income, $166 million of operating cash flow, and $169 million of free cash flow.</li>\n<li>The Mineral Rights segment posted $40 million of net income and $49 million of operating cash flow for Q4, with full-year figures at $166 million and $182 million, respectively.</li>\n<li>Soda ash segment net income decreased $3 million for the quarter and $15 million for the year compared to the prior periods, with operating and free cash flow both down $11 million for the quarter and $31 million for the year.</li>\n<li>The Corporate and Financing segment improved by $3 million in Q4 and $9 million for the full year in net income due to debt reduction, with interest costs also down.</li>\n<li>NRP paid a Q4 distribution of $0.75 per common unit, matching the Q3 payout, and announced a special distribution of $0.12 per common unit to help cover unitholder tax liabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>David Spier, Nitor Capital Management: Asked if the soda ash JV is debt-free after the contribution and about further capital contributions. President &amp; COO Nunez replied, \"The JV is not debt free. The JV has $50-plus million of debt remaining after the contribution.\" He added, \"We do not have that. That's not our plan right now... If things get worse, there could be situations where we would elect to put more capital into the soda ash venture.\"</li>\n<li>Spier asked whether the $39 million investment was required or elected. Nunez responded, \"It was our election.\"</li>\n<li>Phillip Cramer, BATS Wireless: Inquired about the timing of a substantial distribution increase. Nunez answered, \"No, not in May... The timing would say it's probably in November.\"</li>\n<li>Alberto Vadia, Fruit Tree Capital: Asked about not bidding at a recent mineral rights auction. Nunez explained, \"Auctions are typically not places where you come away with attractive opportunities and for mineral type assets. So you're not likely to see us participate in auctions... we are still on our path to delever and our goal is to essentially pay off all of our debt and then focus primarily on returning capital to unitholders.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts maintained a probing but neutral tone, seeking clarification on capital allocation, the soda ash JV, and distribution timing. There was no evident skepticism, but questions targeted uncertainty and risk management.</li>\n<li>Management's tone was measured and cautious, particularly regarding market conditions and future distributions. Nunez acknowledged misjudging the \"extent, the depth and the duration of the downturn now that we're in it,\" and repeatedly stressed discipline and the potential for further delays if market weakness persists.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone has shifted from cautious optimism to increased caution, with more explicit warnings about the duration and severity of commodity market downturns.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance on distribution increases shifted: previously targeted for August, now delayed to a subsequent quarter due to the Sisecam Wyoming investment.</li>\n<li>Management focus remains on deleveraging, but with heightened attention to capital preservation amid extended commodity bear markets.</li>\n<li>Analyst questions have shifted from operational and capital allocation details to direct concerns about the sustainability of investments and the likelihood of further capital injections.</li>\n<li>Key metrics for free cash flow and segment performance have declined compared to prior periods, and management language reflects greater concern for ongoing market headwinds.</li>\n<li>The previous quarter's tone was conservatively optimistic about eventual distribution increases; the current quarter is more reserved, with explicit caveats tied to market uncertainty.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited persistent low prices for metallurgical coal, thermal coal, and soda ash, with no near-term catalysts for recovery.</li>\n<li>The soda ash market is expected to deteriorate further in 2026, with international prices below cost for most producers.</li>\n<li>There is risk of further capital contributions to the soda ash JV if market conditions worsen, though none are currently planned.</li>\n<li>Lack of new leasing activity for carbon sequestration and slow progress on geothermal, solar, and lithium initiatives were acknowledged.</li>\n<li>Analyst concerns focused on the risk of additional required investments and delays in increasing distributions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Management underscored that despite challenging market conditions and a worsening outlook for key commodities, Natural Resource Partners L.P. remains focused on generating free cash flow and reducing debt. The special $39 million capital commitment to the Sisecam Wyoming joint venture will delay the anticipated distribution increase until at least November, and management emphasized that further delays are possible if commodity bear markets persist. The company continues to prioritize deleveraging and capital discipline, with a cautious approach to new investments and acquisitions until markets stabilize.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/nrp/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

(DK) Q4 2025 </p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Avigal Soreq, President and CEO, highlighted 2025 as a transformational year, stating that \"we have made progress on all fronts, including improving the free cash flow profile of the company and increasing the economic separation between DK and DKL.\" Soreq announced that Delek reported an adjusted EPS of $0.44 and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $226 million for Q4 2025, excluding SRE, and raised the enterprise optimization plan (EOP) target to at least $200 million on an annual run rate basis. </li>\n<li>Soreq detailed that DKL achieved a record year with approximately $536 million in adjusted EBITDA and set 2026 EBITDA guidance for DKL at $520 million to $560 million. He emphasized DKL’s progress in sour gas solutions and third-party EBITDA expected to exceed 80% in 2026. \"Achieving this level of economic separation has been cornerstone of our sum-of-the-parts strategy,\" Soreq said. </li>\n<li>Soreq reported a successful turnaround at Big Spring refinery, stating, \"The focus of this turnaround is to further enhance reliability and operational flexibility, positioning the refinery for improved cost structure and margin capture.\" He also noted the EOP's growing impact, estimating a $50 million contribution to Q4 2025 P&amp;L and increasing the annual EOP improvement expectation to at least $200 million.</li>\n<li>Soreq described the monetization of 2023 and 2024 RINs, rapid use of proceeds to reduce the inventory intermediation agreement, and projected a $40 million annual improvement in free cash flow from this restructuring. He reaffirmed a commitment to shareholder returns, referencing $15 million in dividends and $20 million in share buybacks during the quarter.</li>\n<li>Mark Hobbs, Executive VP &amp; CFO, stated, \"For the fourth quarter, Delek had net income of $78 million or $1.26 per share. Adjusted net income was $143 million or $2.31 per share, and adjusted EBITDA was approximately $375 million.\"</li>\n<li>Hobbs highlighted that logistics delivered approximately $142 million in adjusted EBITDA and that cash flow from operations, adjusted for working capital and SREs, was $119 million, an improvement of $211 million from the prior year.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Soreq communicated that EOP-related cash flow improvement expectations have been raised to at least $200 million annually. DKL's 2026 EBITDA guidance was announced in the range of $520 million to $560 million. Soreq also noted, \"we expect DKL third-party EBITDA to exceed 80%.\"</li>\n<li>Hobbs provided Q1 2026 throughput guidance: Tyler at 70,000–74,000 barrels per day, El Dorado at 66,000–71,000 barrels per day, Big Spring at 22,000–28,000 barrels per day due to the planned turnaround, and Krotz Springs at 82,000–86,000 barrels per day.

Excluding SREs, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS were $226 million and $0.44 per share, respectively.</li>\n<li>The refining segment's adjusted EBITDA declined by $91 million from the previous quarter, driven primarily by seasonality. Supply and marketing contributed $23 million to Q4, with $35 million from wholesale marketing. Asphalt posted a loss of $4.2 million. Logistics delivered $142 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter.</li>\n<li>Cash flow provided by operations was $503 million, including a $26 million net inflow from changes in working capital. Financing activities included $380 million in paydown of the inventory intermediation agreement, $20 million in share repurchases, $15 million in dividends, and $22 million in DKL distribution payments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Douglas George Blyth Leggate, Wolfe Research: Asked about cash inflow and recognition for SREs already awarded, and risks for '25 through '28 RINs. Soreq responded that SRE is \"a huge, huge topic\" impacting many refineries and remains critical. Hobbs added that $360 million was monetized from prior year SREs, used to pay down $380 million under the IIA, reducing annual interest expense by at least $40 million. Bhardwaj noted additional monetization is expected in the first half of 2026.</li>\n<li>Paul Cheng, Scotiabank: Inquired about DKL consolidation timeline and Big Spring refinery turnaround initiatives. Soreq stated the goal is full value reflection in share and unit price, noted reduction in DK's DKL ownership to around 60%, and described multiple strategic options. On Big Spring, Soreq emphasized a focus on reliability, crude slate optimization, and product mix; no major new capital projects are included in the current turnaround.</li>\n<li>Alexa Petrick, Goldman Sachs: Asked about drivers of raised cash flow guidance and capital allocation priorities. Soreq described EOP as a \"lifestyle\" across the company and stated, \"we are not stopping here\" regarding future EOP improvements. On capital allocation, Soreq reiterated a disciplined approach, maintaining dividends, balancing buybacks and the balance sheet.</li>\n<li>Jason Gabelman, TD Cowen: Queried supply and marketing line volatility and DKL transaction details. Soreq and Bhardwaj explained seasonal and structural drivers, with some volatility expected but core business improvements ongoing. Wright noted recent DKL transactions further economic separation, but EBITDA impact is not material.</li>\n<li>Ryan Todd, Piper Sandler: Asked about sustainability of margin capture. Soreq identified safe operations, strong commercial activity, and EOP as key, with post-turnaround improvements at Tyler and KSR.
