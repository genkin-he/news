(EEX) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Herve Sedky highlighted that \"through the first 9 months of the year, we delivered solid growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA, along with solid organic growth, underscoring the strength and resilience of our increasingly diversified model and the progress we're making toward our long-term objectives.\" Sedky announced the acquisition of Generis, expanding Emerald's portfolio into high-growth peer-to-peer executive events and supporting broader sector diversification. He noted, \"With Generis, Emerald's portfolio now spans an even broader mix of high-growth sectors, strengthening our resilience across market cycles and reducing exposure to slower growth verticals.\"</li>\n<li>Sedky pointed to strong attendance at Advertising Week in New York, stating, \"The show delivered record-setting attendance and engagement this year, a strong affirmation of the appetite of high-quality in-person experiences that drive business results.\"</li>\n<li>The company is advancing technology initiatives with an AI-powered event agent and increasing centralization of go-to-market efforts to improve efficiency and customer experience.</li>\n<li>Sedky emphasized, \"With the completion of the Generis purchase in August, we've now executed 3 meaningful acquisitions this year, which advance our strategy to build a high-growth portfolio of live experiences.\"</li>\n<li>CFO David Doft stated, \"Total revenue in the quarter was $77.5 million compared to $72.6 million in the prior year quarter.\" He explained, \"Adjusted EBITDA was $12.8 million in the third quarter compared to $12.5 million in the prior year period, an increase of 2.4%.\" Doft noted the impact of Las Vegas Convention Center construction and tariffs on organic revenue, as well as the absorption of $1 million in Generis SG&amp;A costs without revenue contribution in Q3.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management raised and narrowed full-year 2025 guidance to $460 million to $465 million in revenue and $122.5 million to $127.5 million in adjusted EBITDA, reflecting the Generis acquisition and year-to-date performance.</li>\n<li>Sedky reported solid rebooking momentum for the first half of 2026 and highlighted that \"pacing for 2026... reflects sustained customer confidence across our portfolio.\"</li>\n<li>Doft confirmed, \"we are increasing our full year 2025 guidance to reflect the Generis acquisition and narrowing our guidance range given our increased visibility as we approach year-end.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Total revenue for Q3 was $77.5 million, with organic revenue down 6.8% year-over-year, primarily due to construction at the Las Vegas Convention Center and some tariff headwinds.</li>\n<li>Year-to-date total revenue reached $330.7 million, up 13.3% versus the prior year, driven by acquisitions and higher organic revenues.</li>\n<li>Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $90.8 million, a 32.4% increase from the prior year.</li>\n<li>SG&amp;A in Q3 was $51.3 million, up from $40.8 million, mainly due to acquisition expenses and higher stock-based compensation.</li>\n<li>Free cash flow in Q3 was slightly negative, impacted by timing of payables and acquisition-related cash flow dynamics.</li>\n<li>Cash at September 30 stood at $95.4 million, with total liquidity of $205.4 million, and net debt to covenant EBITDA ratio at 2.96x.</li>\n<li>The board extended and expanded the share repurchase program, allowing up to $25 million in repurchases through December 31, 2026, and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.015 per share.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Barton Crockett, Rosenblatt: Asked about the $6 million impact of tariffs and construction. Doft clarified, \"that's inclusive of both of those items. The tariff impact is actually the lesser of the items in that impact.\" He added, \"the construction is on track to be completed by the end of this year, which is great... we're enthusiastic about cycling this impact next year.\"</li>\n<li>Crockett asked about the overall impact of tariffs. Sedky responded, \"the net effect of tariffs is a very manageable impact for our business overall, but we're definitely seeing in a handful of markets.\" Doft added, \"as we cycle this year, we're hopeful that next year is a bit more normal.\"</li>\n<li>Crockett inquired about guidance excluding Generis. Doft stated, \"we are absolutely within the guidance range, excluding generics. It is the lower half of the range, to be clear.\"</li>\n<li>Allen Klee, Maxim Group: Asked about incremental revenue from all acquisitions. Doft explained, \"For the other acquisitions, it's de minimis... only Generis has that by now.\"</li>\n<li>Klee asked about the impact of Las Vegas construction on results. Doft said, \"It's a few million dollars if you back into the math.\"</li>\n<li>Klee requested an example of the AI-powered tool. Sedky described it as \"an agent that allows our customers to interrogate and basically get answers to both exhibitors and visitors to anything that they need around the entire customer journey.\"</li>\n<li>Klee followed up on platform strategy and integration. Sedky responded, \"we're progressing really well, and we're seeing the evidence of that as we acquire businesses and are able to incorporate them into the broader Emerald.\"</li>\n<li>Klee asked about the M&amp;A environment. Sedky stated, \"the pipeline is strong, and we are actively exploring a handful of opportunities.\"</li>\n<li>Klee asked for updates on commerce and content segments.

Sedky used phrases such as \"we're confident in our ability to deliver on our full-year commitments\" and \"I'm generally excited about what's ahead.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone remained consistent, but this quarter included more forward-looking references to M&amp;A, AI expansion, and integration benefits, while analysts maintained a similar level of curiosity with an emphasis on external headwinds and guidance sustainability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance was raised and the range narrowed this quarter, while in Q2 the guidance was reaffirmed.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus intensified on integrating acquisitions, AI-powered customer engagement, and cost efficiencies, building on Q2's emphasis on portfolio optimization and resilience.</li>\n<li>Analysts maintained their focus on macro headwinds, event-specific disruptions, and the impact of recent acquisitions, but pressed more on the specifics of future contribution and normalization of impacted events.</li>\n<li>Key metrics such as revenue and EBITDA continued to grow, with Q3 reflecting acquisition-driven gains and Q2 featuring stronger organic growth on a pro forma basis.</li>\n<li>Management's confidence in long-term growth levers and resilience was reiterated, though Q3 placed more emphasis on forward bookings and the impact of recent technology investments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited ongoing construction at the Las Vegas Convention Center and tariff-related headwinds as primary challenges, with both expected to abate as construction concludes and trade conditions stabilize.</li>\n<li>Exposure to tariffs remains limited, but management acknowledged impacts in China and Canada.</li>\n<li>Acquisition integration costs affected SG&amp;A, with management highlighting disciplined cost control and anticipated future margin improvements.</li>\n<li>Free cash flow was impacted by timing of payables and acquisition cash flow dynamics, noted as a temporary effect by management.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Emerald Holding, Inc. reported solid revenue and EBITDA growth for the third quarter, driven by acquisitions and continued operational execution. The company raised its full-year 2025 guidance and narrowed its outlook, incorporating the Generis acquisition and sustained momentum in event attendance and customer rebooking.

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Casella Waste Systems (CWST) Q3 2025  </p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>John Casella, Chairman, CEO &amp; Secretary, highlighted, \"In Q3, the Casella team worked hard, stayed focused on executing our operating plans, delivering another strong quarter that reinforces our improved outlook for 2025.\" He noted quarterly records for revenue and adjusted EBITDA, citing continued solid waste pricing, healthy landfill volumes, and substantial acquisition contributions. Eight acquisitions year-to-date added about $105 million in annualized revenue, with the Mountain State Waste transaction expected to close in early 2026, contributing another $30 million annually. Casella stated, \"Our M&amp;A strategy remains focused on balanced mix of smaller tuck-in acquisitions and larger opportunities that expand our geographic footprint, such as Mountain State.\" He announced his transition to Executive Chairman at year-end, with Ned Coletta to become CEO.</li>\n<li>Bradford Helgeson, Executive VP &amp; CFO, reported, \"Revenues in the third quarter were $485.4 million, up $73.7 million or 17.9% year-over-year, with $53.4 million from acquisitions, including rollover and $20.4 million from same-store growth or 4.9%.\" He added, \"Adjusted EBITDA was $119.9 million in the quarter, up $16.9 million or 16.4% year-over-year, with contribution from acquisitions, including rollover and 8% organic growth.\" Helgeson explained that solid waste revenues rose 20.6%, and Resource Solutions revenues grew 7.8% year-over-year, with recycling and other processing revenue down 5% due to lower commodity prices, but national accounts up 16.5%.</li>\n<li>Ned Coletta, President, emphasized, \"Third quarter results exceeded expectations for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Total revenues rose nearly 18% year-over-year, driven by strong 4.9% organic growth and continued contributions from acquisitions.\" Coletta detailed integration progress in the Mid-Atlantic segment, advancements in landfill permitting, and operational improvements, including route optimization and truck automation. He reaffirmed a strong balance sheet and positive outlook for the remainder of 2025 and into 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul><li>Management raised the lower end of revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2025, moving the midpoints to $1.835 billion and $420 million, respectively, citing \"increased visibility and confidence in full year results and underlying strength in the business\" (Helgeson). Organic growth for 2026 is projected in the 4% to 5% range, mainly from solid waste pricing, plus an incremental 3% or $60 million from rollover acquisition revenue, excluding future yet-to-close deals. Helgeson projected \"total revenue growth, excluding future acquisition activity that hasn't yet closed, in the range of 7% to 8%.\" Adjusted EBITDA margin improvement is targeted at 25 to 50 basis points for 2026. Free cash flow is aimed to grow in the typical long-term range of 10% to 15%.</li></ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul><li>Casella reported quarterly revenues of $485.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of $119.9 million.

Helgeson responded, \"We don't see anything that will challenge what we've executed and what we expect with margins over time...there's significant multiyear margin expansion opportunity.\"</li>\n<li>Brown: Clarified margin guidance for 2026. Helgeson confirmed, \"Including the M&amp;A that we've completed plus Mountain State Waste, yes.\"</li>\n<li>Brown: Asked about Mid-Atlantic synergy capture and if the $5 million estimate included pricing benefits. Coletta said, \"It does not include any pricing or margin lift...we're so early in budgeting that it'd be hard to get ahead of that.\"</li>\n<li>Brown: Inquired about AI applications. Coletta described foundational system upgrades and stated, \"We're looking for AI opportunities to really streamline. One of the areas that we're probably most excited about is...some of the automation features and AI features in that system to help us gain efficiencies.\"</li>\n<li>Trevor Romeo, William Blair: Queried internalized landfill volumes and integration teams. Coletta detailed ongoing internalization efforts and highlighted increased capabilities and best practices in integration.</li>\n<li>Adam Bubes, Goldman Sachs: Sought specifics on Mid-Atlantic margin changes and 2026 contribution. Helgeson said, \"Last year, the Mid-Atlantic...was a headwind of about 100 basis points. This quarter, it was 10 basis points.\"</li>\n<li>James Schumm, TD Cowen: Asked about Mid-Atlantic billing system timeline and Q4 revenue seasonality. Coletta projected full system integration by end of Q1 and clarified seasonality and acquisition impacts.</li>\n<li>William Grippin, Barclays: Sought view on Mid-Atlantic pricing post-integration.

Coletta acknowledged, \"We made a bad decision...we left it on its billing system...but we're back to our core basics.\"</li>\n<li>Stephanie Moore, Jefferies: Asked about McKean facility investments and timing. Casella stated, \"The facility is up operational...it's probably Q2 '26 when we'll see -- begin to see a little bit of activity -- a little bit more activity.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts maintained a neutral to slightly positive tone, focusing on margin trajectory, integration timing, and operational improvements, with several congratulating leadership transitions and pressing for clarity on future synergies and margin expansion.</li>\n<li>Management was confident and transparent in addressing integration challenges, margin impacts from acquisitions, and growth opportunities, with Coletta and Helgeson both expressing optimism for continued margin expansion and integration progress.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, analyst sentiment was less concerned about Mid-Atlantic headwinds, while management showed increased confidence, demonstrated by more assertive forward-looking statements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul><li>Guidance language shifted to a more positive outlook, with upward revisions to revenue and EBITDA midpoints for 2025 and clear projections for 2026. Strategic focus remains on M&amp;A and integration efficiency, with more detailed discussion of operational improvements and systems upgrades. Analyst focus shifted from acute concern over Mid-Atlantic delays to interest in synergy realization and margin expansion. Key metrics such as revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow all showed notable increases over Q2, with management tone growing more confident and analysts acknowledging operational progress. Strategic priorities evolved to emphasize automation, system integration, and best practices in acquisition execution, with management expressing stronger confidence in achieving future targets.</li></ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul><li>Management cited challenges in the Mid-Atlantic integration, specifically delays in billing system consolidation and automation, but outlined mitigation strategies, including accelerated truck deliveries and system upgrades. Concerns were also raised about commodity price weakness in recycling, but contract structures helped limit impact. Future landfill capacity in the Northeast was discussed as both an opportunity and risk, with management expressing confidence in permitting progress and capacity expansion. Analysts flagged potential seasonality and acquisition-related revenue fluctuations, but management maintained that these were anticipated and manageable.</li></ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Casella Waste Systems delivered record revenue and adjusted EBITDA in Q3 2025, driven by solid pricing, strong landfill volumes, and ongoing acquisition activity. The company raised its 2025 revenue and EBITDA guidance midpoints and projects 7% to 8% revenue growth for 2026, with targeted margin expansion and robust free cash flow. Integration of recent acquisitions and operational improvements remain central, with leadership transitions set for year-end. Management expressed confidence in overcoming integration challenges and sustaining disciplined strategic growth, positioning Casella for continued value creation in the coming year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/cwst/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

Excluding Houston assets, same-property RevPAR increased by 2.9%.</p></li>\n<li><p>Third quarter same-property hotel EBITDA was $47 million, a 0.7% increase from 2024, but margin decreased 60 basis points. Excluding Grand Hyatt Scottsdale, hotel EBITDA declined 7.8% and margin declined 160 basis points.</p></li>\n<li><p>Third quarter same-property total RevPAR increased by 3.7% year-over-year, attributed mainly to strong growth at Grand Hyatt Scottsdale and outperformance in banquet and catering revenues.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Michael Bellisario, Robert W. Baird: Asked about dividend payout relative to taxable income. Shah responded, \"We continue to utilize NOLs that we generated coming off of COVID. So we're finding the balance of providing both a good payout relative to past levels as well as utilizing those NOLs.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Bellisario: Asked about group outlook. Barry Bloom, President &amp; COO, replied, \"It's a little more in volume, but rate growth is good. I mean, better rate growth than we've seen in the last year or 2.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Jackson Armstrong, Wells Fargo: Inquired about government shutdown impact and transaction market activity. Verbaas answered, \"It's been fairly limited within our portfolio... our exposure to that type of business is probably a little bit more limited.\" On transactions, \"share buybacks continue to look probably more attractive than acquisitions at this point... I wouldn't expect us to be really active on the acquisition side here in the very near future.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Aryeh Klein, BMO: Questioned Q4 softness. Shah said, \"It is certainly more on the transient side, a combination of leisure and business transient that we've nudged down our expectations ever so slightly.\" Klein also asked about W. Nashville F&amp;B changes. Verbaas replied, \"It's going to take a few years to get to that stabilized number... we've set our expectations now to say over the next several years, we expect to get kind of north of that $20 million number.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>David Katz, Jefferies: Sought insight on leisure weakness. Verbaas explained, \"There is still this normalization that was kind of going on from these kind of outsized levels of leisure travel that we saw over the last few years... we do think that leisure has probably kind of found more of its footing in our portfolio.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Austin Wurschmidt, KeyBanc: Asked about business transient and leisure expectations. Bloom highlighted \"Northern California and Santa Clara, in particular, are seeing significant corporate growth,\" and Verbaas noted, \"I do think that we could see that there certainly could be a scenario where leisure and business transient are more on par as it relates to what kind of growth we can see out of those segments.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Analysts expressed slightly negative to neutral sentiment, probing for details on payout ratios, group and leisure demand softness, and timeline for benefits from new initiatives. Questions were often linked to visibility concerns and the speed of normalization in key segments.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management maintained a neutral to slightly positive tone in prepared remarks, with confidence in group demand and the W. Nashville partnership, and used measured language during Q&amp;A, such as \"we expect,\" \"we continue to,\" and \"we are pleased.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone shifted from optimism about outperformance to a more cautious outlook, particularly regarding leisure softness and adjusted guidance. Analysts’ tone also reflected more concern about headwinds than in Q2.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Guidance for full year adjusted EBITDAre decreased slightly from $256 million (Q2) to $254 million (Q3), and RevPAR growth guidance was lowered from 4.5% to 4%. Adjusted FFO per share midpoint declined by $0.01.</p></li>\n<li><p>Strategic focus has shifted to executing the W. Nashville F&amp;B partnership and managing CapEx, with a $10 million increase in projected 2025 capital expenditures.</p></li>\n<li><p>Analysts in both quarters focused on group pace, capital allocation, and demand trends, but Q3 saw increased concern about leisure softness and normalization timelines.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management’s confidence in group demand and Grand Hyatt Scottsdale performance remains, but there was a more cautious tone on the recovery of leisure and business transient segments.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Management highlighted ongoing macroeconomic challenges, particularly in leisure demand, and the Houston market’s impact due to prior-year hurricane-related demand.</p></li>\n<li><p>Shah noted higher-than-planned CapEx due to additional projects and the W. Nashville F&amp;B overhaul, though the company expects to spend less on CapEx than forecast at the start of 2025.</p></li>\n<li><p>Exposure to government business and a potential prolonged shutdown is limited, but management acknowledged the risk if air travel disruptions occur.</p></li>\n<li><p>Analysts expressed concerns over the timeline for F&amp;B stabilization at W. Nashville and the sustainability of group and leisure trends.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Management underscored confidence in the company’s long-term prospects, emphasizing the new W. Nashville food and beverage partnership with Jose Andres Group as a driver for incremental hotel EBITDA, continued robust group demand, and a portfolio well positioned for future growth despite short-term softness in leisure and ongoing macroeconomic headwinds. The focus remains on executing capital projects, managing expenses, and capturing outsized gains from non-rooms revenue as market conditions stabilize.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/xhr/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: MasTec (MTZ) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Jose Mas, CEO, reported revenue for the quarter just shy of $4 billion, a 22% year-over-year increase, and adjusted EBITDA of $374 million, a 20% year-over-year increase. Mas stated that adjusted earnings per share was $2.48 and noted, \"despite a revenue record quarter, backlog at quarter end was $16.8 billion, a roughly $325 million sequential increase with every segment delivering backlog growth.\" He highlighted exceeding guidance across revenue, EBITDA, and EPS metrics, attributing performance to the scale and diversification of the company.</li>\n<li>Mas emphasized the Communications segment's 33% revenue growth and 38% EBITDA increase, all organic, with improved margins. The Clean Energy and Infrastructure segment saw a 20% revenue increase and 36% EBITDA improvement. Power Delivery grew revenue 17% and EBITDA 21%. Mas noted, \"our visibility in [the Pipeline] segment is considerably better than backlog suggests\" and expects further backlog growth by year-end.</li>\n<li>Mas commented on the ramp-up of the Lumen contract in Communications and highlighted a major new transmission and substation project in Power Delivery, expected to start in mid-2026.</li>\n<li>Paul Dimarco, CFO, stated, \"we are increasing 2025 full year revenue guidance to $14.075 billion with adjusted EBITDA of $1.135 billion, slightly above the low end of our previous guidance. Our revised outlook reflects higher than previously anticipated levels of Communications and Pipeline activity, offset by lower Power Delivery revenue than previously expected due in part to timing of activity on Greenlink in Q4 as our customer works through the isolated permit delays. Adjusted EPS is forecasted to be $6.40, up 62% versus 2024.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The company increased 2025 full year revenue guidance to $14.075 billion and adjusted EBITDA to $1.135 billion. Adjusted EPS is forecasted at $6.40, reflecting a 62% increase from 2024. Management expects double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth in the Power Delivery segment for full year 2025, and reiterated expectations for strong growth in the Pipeline segment for 2026 and beyond. Mas said, \"we continue to expect further backlog growth in the current quarter and to end the year at another record level.\"</li>\n<li>The outlook for Clean Energy and Infrastructure remains robust, with Mas stating, \"we are well positioned at current backlog levels for strong continued growth in this segment.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue for the quarter was just shy of $4 billion, a 22% year-over-year increase. Adjusted EBITDA was $374 million, up 20% year-over-year. Adjusted EPS was $2.48. Backlog stood at $16.8 billion at quarter end, up $325 million sequentially and 21% year-over-year, with all segments contributing to growth.</li>\n<li>The Communications segment posted $915 million revenue, 33% year-over-year growth, with 11.3% EBITDA margin. Clean Energy &amp; Infrastructure revenue was $1.4 billion, a 20% increase, and segment EBITDA margin rose to 8.5%. Pipeline Infrastructure revenue was $598 million, a 20% increase, and segment EBITDA margin was 15.4%. Cash flow from operations was $89 million, with free cash flow of $36 million. The company ended the quarter with approximately $2 billion in liquidity and net leverage of 1.95x.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ati Modak, Goldman Sachs: Asked about pipeline backlog and revenue guidance for 2026. Mas responded, \"I think we'll grow the business double digits in '26, but really the growth is going to be substantial in '27 and beyond from what we're seeing from the projects that have been committed to us, and it's extremely exciting.\"</li>\n<li>Jamie Cook, Truist Securities: Asked about permitting issues with Greenlink and capacity for large projects. Mas indicated the main change in Q4 guidance is due to Greenlink delays, with 2025 revenue from Greenlink now expected at \"somewhere in the $250 million range\" versus $375–425 million previously. He emphasized confidence in execution and noted, \"the project portion of our Power Delivery business is one of the biggest growth potentials that MasTec has.\"</li>\n<li>Philip Shen, ROTH Capital Partners: Asked if $8 of EPS is on the table for 2026. Mas replied, \"we're really comfortable with where consensus sits... those are fantastic statistics.\" On margin expansion, Mas noted significant investments for growth but expressed confidence in margin improvement.</li>\n<li>Steven Fisher, UBS: Inquired about Communications margin investments and margin trajectory. Mas said, \"we have opportunities for further growth in 2026. The market is really hot.\" On Power Delivery project risks, Mas stated, \"we do not expect any impact to profitability whatsoever on that project over the period other than obviously it being in different periods than what we originally expected.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts focused on guidance, margin improvement, backlog visibility, and project execution, with a generally positive and inquisitive tone, though some concern surfaced around permitting delays and investment impacts on margins.</li>\n<li>Management tone was confident and constructive in both prepared remarks and Q&amp;A, frequently referencing strong growth, robust backlog, and margin improvement opportunities. Mas stated, \"we are pleased with our third quarter results and maintain strong confidence in expected growth based on drivers and powerful demand drivers across each of our businesses.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, analysts remained focused on growth and margin improvement, but showed more interest in segment-specific risks and project timing. Management’s tone shifted from cautiously optimistic to more assertively confident regarding future growth and backlog.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance was raised from a range of $13.9–$14 billion in Q2 to $14.075 billion in Q3. Adjusted EPS guidance increased from a midpoint of $6.34 in Q2 to $6.40 in Q3. Margin improvement was highlighted as a key achievement, with consolidated margin at 9.4% in Q3 versus 7.8% in Q2.</li>\n<li>Communications, Clean Energy, and Pipeline segments all reported sequential revenue and margin improvements. The Power Delivery segment saw some revenue moderation due to Greenlink delays, but management reaffirmed double-digit growth for the year.</li>\n<li>Analysts’ focus shifted from broad growth and investment strategy in Q2 to more granular questions about project timing, permitting issues, and margin expansion drivers in Q3. Management’s language became more confident about double-digit growth in Pipeline and Communications, and more specific in addressing project risks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited isolated permitting delays in the Greenlink project as a challenge impacting Q4 Power Delivery revenue. Mas stated, \"obviously, they're facing some challenges on permits, quite frankly, that were originally issued and are now being reviewed.\"</li>\n<li>Investments required for rapid geographic and segment expansion were noted as a headwind for margins, but management expects these to pay off.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised questions about capacity to execute multiple large projects and possible labor constraints in Pipeline and Power Delivery.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>MasTec’s Q3 2025 call emphasized record revenues, robust backlog growth, and improved margins across all segments. Management highlighted raised guidance for revenue and EPS, strong confidence in double-digit growth for 2026 across key segments, and a clear strategy to manage project execution and margin expansion. While isolated permitting delays and investment-related margin pressure were acknowledged, management expressed high confidence in both the near- and long-term growth trajectory, supported by strong customer demand and a diversified business model.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/mtz/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

Vanacker, CEO, reported \"very high cash conversion of 135% in the third quarter,\" highlighting ongoing progress on the company’s cash improvement plan, which is \"well on our way to delivering on our $600 million target by year-end\" and targeting \"at least $1.1 billion by the end of 2026.\"</li>\n<li>Vanacker described improving polyethylene demand in both North America and Europe, noting \"2025 domestic demand for polyethylene is the strongest we have seen since the start of the downturn in the third quarter of 2022,\" and that \"North American demand is up by 2.5% relative to 2024.\"</li>\n<li>The CEO cautioned, \"these are not yet green shoots for our financial results,\" and stated that \"markets will need to absorb new capacity and operating rates will need further improvement before suppliers develop meaningful pricing power.\"</li>\n<li>Vanacker also emphasized accelerating global ethylene capacity rationalization, with \"announced and anticipated closures and idling from 2020 through 2028 add up to more than 21 million tonnes of ethylene capacity, representing roughly 10% of global supply,\" especially in Asia and Europe.</li>\n<li>CFO Agustin Izquierdo stated, \"We generated $983 million of cash from operating activities, an improvement of over 2.5x relative to the prior quarter... and returned $443 million through dividends while funding $406 million of capital investment.\"</li>\n<li>Izquierdo announced a reduction in 2026 capital expenditures to \"$1.2 billion,\" and confirmed \"year-to-date, we have achieved $150 million in fixed cost reductions.\"</li>\n<li>Kimberly Foley, EVP of Global Olefins &amp; Polyolefins, detailed that \"O&amp;P Americas EBITDA was $428 million, an improvement of 35% quarter-on-quarter,\" and said \"our third quarter operating rates for the segment was approximately 85% with our crackers running at approximately 95%.\"</li>\n<li>Foley highlighted a \"major milestone with the signing of the sales and purchase agreement\" for select European assets, expecting to close the transaction in the first half of 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The company reiterated its target to achieve \"$600 million of incremental cash flow in 2025\" and at least \"$1.1 billion of improvement by the end of next year.\"</li>\n<li>For the fourth quarter, management anticipates \"typical seasonal trends of softer demand and customers' desire to minimize year-end inventories will pressure sales volumes,\" with further reductions in segment operating rates and cost mitigation from fixed cost reduction initiatives.</li>\n<li>Foley noted, \"We expect to reduce our operating rates by 5% and are targeting 80% utilization across the segment during the fourth quarter.\"</li>\n<li>In Europe, LYB intends to \"idle the larger of the 2 crackers in Wessling, Germany... for at least 40 days during November and December,\" targeting \"operating rates for approximately 60% across the segment during the fourth quarter.\"</li>\n<li>The Technology segment is expected to see \"improved profitability as previously sold licenses achieve revenue milestones\" in Q4.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Earnings for the third quarter were reported as \"$1.01 per share with EBITDA of $835 million and $983 million of cash from operating activities.\"</li>\n<li>The company returned \"$443 million to shareholders in the form of dividends.\"</li>\n<li>Cash balance increased to \"$1.8 billion\" during the quarter.</li>\n<li>Fixed cost reductions year-to-date were reported at \"$150 million relative to our 2025 plan.\"</li>\n<li>The quarter included identified items of \"$1.2 billion net of tax, primarily associated with asset write-downs.\"</li>\n<li>O&amp;P Americas EBITDA improved by 35% quarter-on-quarter, with integrated polyethylene margins up \"by approximately 23%.\"</li>\n<li>O&amp;P Europe, Asia &amp; International segment generated EBITDA of \"$48 million,\" and APS segment EBITDA was \"$47 million.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Patrick Cunningham, Citigroup, asked about the likelihood of an inflection point in supply and demand for polyethylene. Vanacker responded, \"21 million tonnes of ethylene capacity is about to disappear... that will be a good balancing out of the overcapacity,\" while Foley added that \"you're going to see a tightening in the ethylene market, and that's going to likely improve chain margins as we think about '26.\"</li>\n<li>David Begleiter, Deutsche Bank, questioned the situation in China. Vanacker said, \"licensing activities... have dropped about 80% from its peak in 2019,\" and that Chinese capacity closures are expected due to anti-involution policies, stating \"our level of confidence from quarter-to-quarter is increasing that there will be capacity shutdowns in China.\"</li>\n<li>Matthew Blair, Tudor, Pickering, Holt, inquired about the dividend's security. Vanacker emphasized, \"we started 2025 with a cash balance that provides us a cushion... $3.4 billion,\" and confirmed a \"balanced approach to capital allocation.\"</li>\n<li>Jeffrey Zekauskas, JPMorgan, asked about growth projects in the capital budget. Vanacker outlined ongoing investments, including the Hyperzone PE plant and MoReTec-1 in Germany, noting that \"we have quite some impressive growth opportunities as the market continues.\"</li>\n<li>Frank Mitsch, Fermium Research, summarized the dividend discussion, to which Vanacker reaffirmed a \"sharp focus on cash conversion\" and deliberate turnaround scheduling for Q4.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts expressed concerns about market overcapacity, dividend coverage, and China’s supply actions, with a slightly negative to cautious tone, especially regarding market recovery timelines and cash flow sustainability.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a tone of cautious optimism in prepared remarks, emphasizing discipline, cash improvement, and strategic asset management, while addressing risks directly: \"Let me highlight... we were very careful in how we were managing our cash during the last couple of years.\"</li>\n<li>During Q&amp;A, management was generally confident but careful, often reiterating previous guidance and strategy, with some defensive clarifications: \"As I said before... focus on the execution and make sure that we continue to make progress.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone remains disciplined and pragmatic, while analysts' skepticism has deepened regarding dividend sustainability and macro headwinds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Q3 saw a significant increase in cash from operating activities and EBITDA compared to Q2.</li>\n<li>The company reduced its 2026 CapEx guidance further to $1.2 billion in Q3, down from $1.4 billion previously.</li>\n<li>Fixed cost reduction progress advanced, with $150 million achieved year-to-date versus ongoing targets.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus shifted further toward cash flow, cost discipline, and asset sales, as demonstrated by the signed sale agreement for European assets (closing expected in H1 2026).</li>\n<li>Both quarters saw management emphasize portfolio transformation and navigating the cycle, but Q3 reflected more concrete asset rationalization actions and a sharper focus on cash generation.</li>\n<li>Analyst tone has become more pointed on dividend and market risk questions, while management continues to convey stability and defensiveness.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management identified headwinds from global overcapacity, particularly in Asia, and continued volatility in trade and tariff policies.</li>\n<li>The company faces margin pressures from rising feedstock costs in Europe and seasonally lower demand in Q4.</li>\n<li>Third quarter included $1.2 billion in asset write-downs related to the prolonged downturn in the European petrochemical and global automotive industries.</li>\n<li>Management is mitigating risks through fixed cost reductions, working capital management, CapEx deferrals, and asset sales.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns over the sustainability of the dividend given free cash flow constraints, and management stressed its balanced capital allocation and robust cash position.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>LyondellBasell’s management underscored strong progress on cash conversion and fixed cost reductions in Q3 2025, with a sharpened focus on disciplined capital allocation and asset portfolio transformation. Despite persistent market headwinds, including overcapacity and weak margins in key regions, the company continues to advance its $600 million 2025 cash flow improvement target and now aims for at least $1.1 billion by the end of 2026. Strategic asset sales and reduced CapEx further strengthen the balance sheet, while management remains confident in the company’s resilience and ability to capitalize on the next market upturn.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/lyb/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

But once the federal government shut down on October 1, the USDA warned states that it would not be able to transfer funds for SNAP in November unless Congress approved new funding. While some states can cover the shortfall for a limited time, most states are unable to fund distributions and have resorted to suing the federal government to force the release of funds.</p>\n<p>While the 2024 and 2025 appropriation bills allocate reserve funds of ~$5B to $6B to the SNAP program, the contingency fund can only be used if the underlying plan is funded.</p>\n<p>“We don’t believe we have the legal authority to distribute that $5 billion in funding…we’re trying to follow the law,” Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in an interview earlier this week.</p>\n<p>On Friday, shares of Albertsons (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACI\" title=\"Albertsons Companies, Inc.\">ACI</a>) are lower for a fourth straight day for a total loss of 5.5%, Kroger (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KR\" title=\"The Kroger Co.\">KR</a>) shares are down another 3.3% to their lowest level in 8 months, while Grocery Outlet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GO\" title=\"Grocery Outlet Holding Corp.\">GO</a>) is in the red three days in a row and in the red for a fourth consecutive week.</p>\n<p><strong>Dear readers:</strong> We recognize that politics often intersects with the financial news of the day, so we invite you to click <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831697-politics-and-the-markets-103125\" target=\"_blank\" title=\" here \"> here </a>to join the separate political discussion</p>\n</body></html>",
