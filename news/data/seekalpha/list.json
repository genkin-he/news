            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Algoma Steel Group Inc. (ASTL) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Michael Garcia opened by emphasizing Algoma's ongoing commitment to workplace safety and highlighted three central themes for the quarter: \"The U.S. 50% tariffs have effectively closed that market to us, driving lower shipments and higher production costs as we've pivoted our entire go-to-market strategy.\" Garcia detailed the company's capital strengthening through $500 million in government support and an expanded USD 375 million ABL facility, stating, \"We have embarked on an operational pivot, accelerating our EAF transformation and focusing on products for the domestic market with the goal of significantly reducing our cash burn.\"</li>\n<li>Garcia described the industry as facing \"significant disruption\" due to U.S. tariffs, leading to lower shipment volumes and elevated cost pressures. He also noted the plate mill as a bright spot, reporting plate shipments of approximately 97,000 tons in the quarter, and anticipated increased Q4 plate production.</li>\n<li>Regarding the electric arc furnace (EAF) project, Garcia reported that \"commissioning and ramp-up activities for Unit 1 have progressed in line with expectations,\" with a cumulative investment of $910 million by September 30, 2025, and a final projected cost of $987 million.</li>\n<li>Garcia announced his retirement at year-end, with CFO Rajat Marwah appointed as the next CEO effective January 1, 2026, and Michael Moraca promoted to CFO.</li>\n<li>CFO Rajat Marwah stated, \"Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $87.1 million. For the quarter, tariffs expense totaled $90 million, and we estimate Canadian sales prices were approximately 40% lower on account of tariffs, resulting in lower revenue of approximately $32 million.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management expects a \"significant inventory drawdown beginning in the fourth quarter and accelerating through 2026 as we exit the blast furnace and coke oven operations and transition to a far more efficient EAF-based supply chain.\"</li>\n<li>Marwah explained, \"A combination of our strategic operational pivot, liquidity support, working capital efficiency improvements and continued effort on driving down cost is expected to extend our liquidity runway well into the future as we look to capture opportunities and diversify the business.\"</li>\n<li>The company is focusing on completing the EAF ramp-up, pursuing diversification, and further aligning with domestic infrastructure, construction, and renewable energy sectors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 was a loss of $87.1 million.</li>\n<li>Tariffs costs for the quarter were $90 million.</li>\n<li>Cash used in operating activities was $117.3 million, with quarter-end liquidity at $337 million.</li>\n<li>Steel revenue reached $473 million, with shipment volumes at 419,000 net tons.</li>\n<li>Net sales realization averaged $1,129 per ton, while cost per ton sold averaged $1,282.</li>\n<li>Net loss was $485.1 million, primarily due to a $503 million noncash impairment loss triggered by market capitalization falling below net asset value and the impact of U.S. tariffs.</li>\n<li>Inventories stood at $790 million, up $54 million from Q2, partly due to a $14.8 million noncash write-down.</li>\n<li>The company secured $500 million in government liquidity support and expanded its ABL facility to USD 375 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ian Gillies, Stifel: Asked about production profile for 2026 and EBITDA breakeven given continued tariffs. Garcia responded that the company is \"accelerating...transition to full EAF production basically a year early,\" and Marwah indicated volumes could be \"as close as 1 million to 1.2 million tons for the year\" with EBITDA approaching breakeven after the transition.</li>\n<li>Gillies: Questioned sequential plate production. Marwah attributed lower Q3 plate output to maintenance outages but stated, \"We're running our plate mill at full production other than the days we need to take for maintenance.\"</li>\n<li>Gillies: Asked about expected capital infusions from insurance, government grants, and tax refunds. Moraca estimated \"somewhere between $30 million and $50 million more to come\" from insurance, and a \"significant working capital release over the next 12 months...north of $100 million, $150 million.\"</li>\n<li>James McGarragle, RBC: Inquired about updated CapEx and working capital for Q4. Marwah said CapEx would decline as blast furnace operations wind down and highlighted an expected working capital release.</li>\n<li>McGarragle: Queried EAF cost targets. Marwah stated initial cost would be \"scrap plus USD 220 to 250,\" declining as production scales.</li>\n<li>McGarragle: Asked if Canadian market could support 2.5 million tonnes. Garcia said the market \"has not -- is not yet fully developed,\" but expects future demand from national projects.</li>\n<li>Gillies: Asked about trade barriers' impact. Garcia stated, \"We've shared our frank views...there's more that they could do,\" noting strong national interest in Algoma's capabilities.</li>\n<li>Gillies: Asked about plate demand from new initiatives. Garcia said the plate market is roughly 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes, with Algoma capturing about 50%.</li>\n<li>Gillies: Sought clarity on credit facility usage. Marwah explained the company would draw on secured lines first to manage dilution and interest.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts expressed concern over cash burn, EBITDA trajectory, market demand, and the sustainability of the company’s strategic pivot, with a neutral to slightly negative tone focused on risks posed by tariffs and market development.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone on transformation and liquidity, with phrases such as \"We are building a company that is leaner, more focused and more competitive\" and \"we are creating a stronger, more resilient enterprise.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, the current call featured more defensive responses and a heightened sense of urgency, especially regarding the impact of tariffs and the operational pivot.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance shifted from exploring scenarios for prolonged tariffs and seeking government support in Q2 to securing $500 million in government liquidity and accelerating the EAF transition by a year in Q3.</li>\n<li>Key metrics deteriorated, with higher adjusted EBITDA loss, increased cash burn, and a substantial noncash impairment loss in Q3 versus Q2.</li>\n<li>Management tone became more urgent and focused on domestic realignment, while analysts sustained a cautious stance.</li>\n<li>Strategic priorities evolved from managing through uncertainty to executing a decisive operational pivot and leadership transition.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited the U.S. 50% tariffs as a primary risk, leading to lower shipments, higher costs, and the closure of cross-border business.</li>\n<li>The company is exposed to oversupply and depressed pricing in the Canadian market.</li>\n<li>Cash burn and a significant noncash impairment loss were highlighted.</li>\n<li>Mitigation strategies include government liquidity support, accelerated EAF transition, and a focus on domestic market alignment.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about market demand, cost targets, working capital, and credit facility usage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Algoma Steel is navigating a period of major disruption by accelerating its transition to electric arc furnace production, pivoting toward high-value domestic products, and securing $500 million in government support to strengthen liquidity. Management is confident that these strategic changes, coupled with a leadership transition and renewed operational discipline, will position the company for long-term resilience and relevance in Canada's industrial landscape, despite ongoing trade uncertainty and near-term financial headwinds.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/astl/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Columbia Sportswear Company (COLM) Q3 2025  </p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Timothy Boyle, Chairman, CEO &amp; President, stated that \"third quarter results reflect sustained momentum in international markets, led by double-digit percent sales growth in our Europe direct business.\" He highlighted the launch of the new global brand platform, Engineered for Whatever, and the positive early response from consumers. Boyle noted that the U.S. business is being revitalized through the ACCELERATE Growth Strategy and emphasized the importance of the new campaign: \"The early response to this campaign has been overwhelmingly positive with millions of consumers already engaged since the launch.\" He also discussed the direct impact of incremental tariff rates, estimating a $35 million to $40 million effect for 2025, with an annualized unmitigated impact of $160 million, and outlined steps to mitigate these effects in 2026, including price increases and vendor negotiations.</li>\n<li>Jim Swanson, Executive VP &amp; CFO, stated, \"SG&amp;A expense increased 5%, including investments in demand creation to launch Columbia's new brand platform Engineered for Whatever. During the third quarter, we incurred $29 million in noncash impairment charges related to prAna and Mountain Hardwear. Including the impairments, which impacted earnings by $0.46, third quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.95.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Boyle provided guidance for the fourth quarter, stating, \"we expect net sales to decline 5% to 8% year-over-year and diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.34. This brings our full year net sales outlook to $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion or flat to down 1% year-over-year. Full year diluted earnings per share is expected to be $2.55 to $2.85, including the $0.46 impact from impairments in this quarter.\" He reiterated that the forecast for spring 2026 is for flat to low single-digit wholesale growth in the first half, unchanged from the previous call.</li>\n<li>Management maintained their strategy of offsetting higher tariffs through a combination of price increases, vendor negotiations, and resourcing production, aiming to restore product margin percentages to historic levels.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Boyle reported that \"Net sales increased 1% year-over-year to $943 million. This was ahead of our outlook, driven by earlier-than-planned shipments of fall '25 wholesale orders. Overall, wholesale net sales increased 5%, while direct-to-consumer was down 5%. Gross margin declined 20 basis points to 50%.\" He also noted $29 million in noncash impairment charges, primarily related to tariffs.</li>\n<li>U.S. net sales decreased 4%, with U.S. wholesale flat and U.S. DTC net sales down high single-digit percent, attributed to the closure of temporary clearance locations and declining sales productivity. E-commerce saw a low double-digit percent decline.</li>\n<li>International growth was led by LAAP net sales up 6%, China up mid-single digits, EMEA up 10%, and Canada up 7%. Japan experienced a low single-digit decrease, and Korea was flat.</li>\n<li>Among brands, Columbia net sales increased 1%, SOREL rose 10%, prAna grew 6%, and Mountain Hardwear declined 5%.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Robert Drbul, BTIG: Asked about product differentiation and the product pipeline. Boyle: Confirmed strong velocity for the Amaze Puff and upcoming launches, including men's versions and additional footwear from the archives.</li>\n<li>John Kernan, TD Cowen: Inquired about tariff mitigation and pricing power. Boyle: \"We are quite good at it. I mean this is a daunting task, But we think we're up for it...we think we'll be able to navigate it.\"</li>\n<li>Kernan also questioned SG&amp;A deleverage. Swanson: \"...our marketing spend last year was just under 6% and will probably be at or just above 6.5% this year.\"</li>\n<li>Paul Lejuez, Citigroup: Queried about lower promotions and order books. Swanson: Cited lapping last year's heavy liquidation and emphasized ongoing healthy dealer margins. Boyle affirmed that price increases are included in the U.S. order books.</li>\n<li>Peter McGoldrick, Stifel: Asked about U.S. performance and SOREL's growth outlook. Boyle: Plans for SOREL to become year-round and grow non-winter product lines.</li>\n<li>Laurent Vasilescu, BNP Paribas: Questioned the guidance cut and U.S. performance. Swanson: Attributed adjustment to softness in U.S. DTC, with China expected to rebound.</li>\n<li>Tom Nikic, Needham: Asked about gross margin headwinds. Swanson: Projected gross margin down slightly more in Q4 due to tariffs, offset partly by lower liquidation.</li>\n<li>Jonathan Komp, Baird: Inquired about inventory and margin recovery. Boyle: Channel inventories are healthy, with specific products performing well.</li>\n<li>Mitchel Kummetz, Seaport: Questioned DTC trends and the ACCELERATE strategy's product progress. Boyle: Attributed DTC decline primarily to fewer clearance stores and highlighted successful higher-priced products.</li>\n<li>Mauricio Serna, UBS: Asked about price increases and SG&amp;A trends. Boyle: High single-digit price increases for spring and fall; Swanson: SG&amp;A up low to mid-single digits in Q4, with half of Q3's increase due to demand creation investment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed on tariff mitigation, U.S. DTC challenges, margin recovery, and promotional activity, with a neutral to slightly negative tone and recurring concerns about SG&amp;A deleverage and order book health.</li>\n<li>Management maintained confidence in tariff navigation and brand revitalization, frequently emphasizing strengths: \"We are quite good at it...we think we'll be able to navigate it,\" and optimism about the ACCELERATE strategy and new product launches.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, analyst tone remains cautious, while management continues to project confidence in strategic initiatives and mitigation plans.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance for full-year net sales and EPS was reiterated at $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion and $2.55 to $2.85, respectively, consistent with prior outlooks but with more explicit absorption of impairment charges.</li>\n<li>The ACCELERATE strategy and Engineered for Whatever campaign moved from planning to active rollout, with early positive consumer engagement reported.</li>\n<li>International growth momentum persisted, but U.S. DTC trends deteriorated further, with continued downsizing of clearance locations and more pronounced e-commerce weakness.</li>\n<li>Management tone remained confident in prepared remarks, but the Q&amp;A reflected persistent analyst skepticism on key issues, especially tariffs and expense leverage.</li>\n<li>Analysts continue to focus on U.S. weakness and margin pressures, mirroring concerns from the previous quarter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management highlighted the direct impact of incremental tariffs, estimating $35 million to $40 million for 2025 and up to $160 million annualized without mitigation.</li>\n<li>The company is absorbing much of the 2025 tariff impact and plans to offset the 2026 effect through price increases, vendor negotiations, and production resourcing.</li>\n<li>U.S. DTC softness, closure of clearance stores, and e-commerce declines remain headwinds.</li>\n<li>SG&amp;A deleverage persists due to increased marketing investments, with mitigation targeted through profit improvement plans and cost reductions.</li>\n<li>Weather-related demand volatility and uncertain consumer response to price increases were cited as ongoing risks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Columbia Sportswear management emphasized the early momentum of its ACCELERATE Growth Strategy and Engineered for Whatever campaign, citing international strength and positive product launches as key drivers. Despite ongoing U.S. challenges and material tariff headwinds, the company reiterated its commitment to restoring growth and profitability through targeted mitigation efforts, new marketing strategies, and continued investment in brand and product innovation. Full-year guidance was reaffirmed, and management remains confident in its ability to navigate the evolving tariff landscape and unlock long-term growth opportunities.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/colm/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

Moss said, \"CORDStrom is our most advanced program as we are now in the process of preparing for submission for marketing approval to the regulatory bodies in both the U.K. and the U.S.\" He highlighted CORDStrom's potential as \"one of the first systemic treatments for RDEB\" and described ongoing work on platform expansion into other indications and possible genetic modifications for cancer.</li>\n<li>Moss provided updates on the XPro platform, noting management is \"actively pursuing an accelerated regulatory pathway and preparing for our end of Phase II meeting with the FDA.\" He emphasized that defining the next steps for XPro is a top priority and important for future funding and partnership discussions.</li>\n<li>Moss referenced the completion of the Phase II trial of INKmune in prostate cancer, with the primary endpoint and 2 of 3 secondary endpoints met.</li>\n<li>Dr. Mark Lowdell, Chief Scientific Officer &amp; Chief Manufacturing Officer, reported CORDStrom is now in CGMP manufacturing space and technology transfer was completed, putting the company \"on track to be ready for U.K. filing at the end of Q2 next year.\" Lowdell also discussed ongoing statistical data analysis for the MissionEB trial and progress in INKmune's development.</li>\n<li>Dr. CJ Barnum, Head of Neuroscience, outlined four priorities for XPro: regulatory alignment, accelerated approval, publishing insights from Phase II MINDFuL trial, and advancing partnership discussions. Barnum stated, \"The findings demonstrate that longer treatment durations with XPro are associated with greater improvements in neuropsychiatric symptoms and biomarkers, including pTau217 and GFAP.\"</li>\n<li>Cory Ellspermann, Interim CFO, said, \"Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, was approximately $6.5 million compared with approximately $12.1 million for the comparable period in 2024.\" Ellspermann added, \"At September 30, 2025, the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $27.7 million... sufficient to fund our operations into Q4 2026.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Moss stated, \"For our CORDStrom program, we have a number of significant events in front of us. In Q4, we'll present additional data from the trial. In mid-'26, we expect to file a marketing authorization application in the U.K. A few months after... we expect to file a BLA, biologics licensing application with the FDA. We'd expect to hear back from the FDA sometime by the middle of '27 or later.\"</li>\n<li>Moss indicated that for XPro, further MRI data from the MINDFuL trial is expected in Q4, and feedback from the FDA on accelerated pathway and end of Phase II meeting minutes are anticipated in Q1 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ellspermann reported, \"Research and development expenses totaled approximately $4.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, compared with approximately $10.1 million for the comparable period in 2024. General and administrative expenses were approximately $2.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, compared with approximately $2.2 million for the comparable period in 2024.\"</li>\n<li>Ellspermann stated the company's cash position at $27.7 million as of September 30, 2025, with a runway into Q4 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Denis Reznik, Raymond James Ltd., asked about the timeline for the end of Phase II FDA meeting for XPro and reasons for any delay. Moss responded the delay was due to not having \"enough of the data in time to really get it to the FDA,\" but \"we're very close.\"</li>\n<li>Reznik asked about partnership discussions for XPro and INKmune's future. Moss said, \"Before we really have aggressive partnering discussions... they want to see what the regulatory feedback and alignment looks like\" and more data. Lowdell added, \"I'm always very keen to talk to potential partners and others that would want to invest in or buy the asset.\"</li>\n<li>Jason McCarthy, Maxim Group, inquired about regulatory feedback for CORDStrom's MAA filing. Lowdell replied, \"We are waiting for our scientific meeting with the MHRA... I'm expecting early next month to submit the data to the agency for a scientific advice meeting.\" He also noted the aim to file the MAA by Q2 next year.</li>\n<li>McCarthy also asked about CORDStrom's mechanism and platform potential. Lowdell described the unique donor selection and pooling process, making CORDStrom \"a platform for multiple different indications.\"</li>\n<li>An unknown analyst (Matt for Jim Molloy, AGP) questioned CORDStrom's place in the U.K. treatment paradigm. Lowdell confirmed there is demand, with no RDEB-specific treatment reimbursed by NHS, and emphasized cost competitiveness and systemic benefit.</li>\n<li>The same analyst asked about cash runway. Moss stated, \"Our cash runway, as we've reported in the quarter is really to the end of next year in Q4.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts focused on regulatory timelines, partnership prospects, and clarity on data, with a neutral tone and some slight skepticism regarding timing and partnerships.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone in prepared remarks and Q&amp;A, emphasizing readiness, progress, and the strength of ongoing data, but showed minor defensiveness regarding regulatory timing: \"we're being relatively conservative saying in Q1\" (Moss).</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management’s confidence remains steady but with more specific references to regulatory steps and manufacturing progress. Analysts' tone has not significantly shifted, remaining focused on practical next steps and key data.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance on regulatory filings remains consistent, with both quarters targeting mid-2026 for CORDStrom filings in the U.K. and U.S., and a focus on completing the end of Phase II meeting for XPro.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus has shifted from discussing the broader platform potential and partnership hopes to more concrete details about manufacturing, regulatory submissions, and cash runway.</li>\n<li>Management’s tone in the current quarter is slightly more detailed on operational execution, with continued confidence in the company’s pipeline and milestones.</li>\n<li>Analysts’ focus continues to be on regulatory clarity, partnerships, and cash, with similar themes as last quarter.</li>\n<li>Key metric changes include reduced net loss and lower R&amp;D expenses in Q3 2025 vs. Q2 2025, and a confirmed cash runway into Q4 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management discussed the ongoing need for regulatory feedback and successful data analysis for CORDStrom’s MAA and BLA filings.</li>\n<li>There is recognition of the importance of securing partnerships to support late-stage development, particularly for XPro and INKmune.</li>\n<li>Moss acknowledged the risk of not having data ready for regulatory meetings as scheduled, which could impact timelines.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about potential delays, clarity on regulatory pathways, and the need for more data to drive partnerships.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>INmune Bio’s management conveyed optimism about upcoming regulatory milestones, with CORDStrom approaching marketing applications in the U.K. and U.S. and XPro moving toward an end of Phase II meeting and potential accelerated pathway with the FDA. The company highlighted operational progress, notably in manufacturing readiness and data analysis, and reported a strengthened cash position supporting operations into Q4 2026. Ongoing partnership discussions remain dependent on further regulatory clarity and data readouts, with multiple clinical and regulatory milestones anticipated through 2026.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/inmb/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Republic Services (RSG) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Jon Vander Ark, President, CEO &amp; Director, stated that \"we delivered strong third quarter results, which highlight the consistency of our business model, disciplined operational execution and power of our portfolio. Even with persistent headwinds in construction and manufacturing end markets, we generated solid earnings growth and margin expansion.\" He cited revenue growth of 3.3%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 6.1%, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion by 80 basis points, adjusted earnings per share of $1.90, and $2.19 billion of adjusted free cash flow year-to-date.</li>\n<li>Vander Ark highlighted customer retention at 94% and credited strong pricing for organic revenue growth, with average yield on total revenue at 4% and on related revenue at 4.9%.</li>\n<li>He noted event-driven volumes, including hurricane recovery in the Carolinas, as well as continued softness in construction and manufacturing end markets. The Environmental Solutions business faced a 140 basis point headwind to total company revenue due to declines in manufacturing activity and lower event-driven landfill volumes.</li>\n<li>Vander Ark reported, \"commercial production at our Indianapolis Polymer Center\" began in July, with Blue Polymers facility production expected late in Q4. He also referenced progress on renewable natural gas (RNG) projects, with six commencing operation year-to-date and seven expected for 2025.</li>\n<li>The company had 137 electric vehicles in operation by quarter-end and expects to exceed 150 by year-end, with 32 facilities supporting commercial-scale EV charging.</li>\n<li>Republic invested over $1 billion in acquisitions year-to-date and returned $1.13 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.</li>\n<li>Brian Delghiaccio, Executive VP &amp; CFO, stated, \"Core price on total revenue was 5.9%. Core price on related revenue was 7.2%, which included open market pricing of 8.6% and restricted pricing of 4.8%.\" He added that landfill C&amp;D volume increased 45% and landfill special waste revenue rose 18% due to event-driven activity, with approximately $100 million of event-driven revenue from hurricane and wildfire cleanups year-to-date.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Vander Ark maintained that \"through the cycle, we believe our business can consistently deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth and grow EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow even faster. This generally produces 30 to 50 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion per year.\" He warned that about $100 million of event-driven revenue in 2025 at an 80% incremental margin will not repeat in 2026, which should be considered for year-over-year growth assumptions.</li>\n<li>He stated that full year 2026 guidance will be provided on the February earnings call, and the long-term growth algorithm remains intact.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The company reported revenue growth of 3.3% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 6.1% for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.90.</li>\n<li>Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 80 basis points to 32.8%, including a 40 basis point increase from event-driven landfill volumes. Recycling &amp; Waste business adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.3%.</li>\n<li>Environmental Solutions revenue decreased $32 million year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA margin in this segment at 20.3%.</li>\n<li>Commodity prices for recycling averaged $126 per ton in the quarter, down from $177 per ton in the prior year.</li>\n<li>Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $2.19 billion, with capital expenditures of $1.18 billion representing 62% of projected full year spend.</li>\n<li>Total debt at quarter-end was $13.4 billion, with total liquidity of $2.7 billion and a leverage ratio of approximately 2.5x.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Patrick Brown, Raymond James: Asked about the 2026 outlook and headwinds from event-driven volumes and commodities. CEO Vander Ark responded that \"the long-term growth algorithm ... holds. We're coming over a tougher comp. So that probably just takes each of those down a click going into '26,\" and acknowledged overcoming commodity headwinds.</li>\n<li>Brown: Inquired about event-driven revenue by quarter. CFO Delghiaccio confirmed, \"it was $12 million of revenue in Q1, $53 million Q2, $36 million in Q3, total of $100 million.\"</li>\n<li>Brown: Asked about slow Environmental Solutions (ES) volume. Vander Ark attributed it to macro manufacturing weakness and delayed project work, and stated, \"good news is those come back, those will get delayed forever.\"</li>\n<li>Noah Kaye, Oppenheimer: Queried about price/cost spread and Polymer Centers' returns. Vander Ark said yield will be \"75, 100 basis points above\" cost inflation and expressed confidence in Polymer Centers' long-term assumptions despite a slower ramp-up.</li>\n<li>Sabahat Khan, RBC Capital Markets: Asked about the M&amp;A pipeline. Vander Ark said, \"pipeline looks very strong. We expect to finish the year strong and start out next year strong,\" with a balance across recycling, waste, and ES.</li>\n<li>Bryan Burgmeier, Citi: Inquired about ES Q4 expectations. Vander Ark replied, \"we think we've kind of found the bottom on this thing ... margin performance that kind of looks in the same ZIP code, and then we build up from that in 2026.\"</li>\n<li>Kevin Chiang, CIBC: Asked about labor disruption costs. CFO Delghiaccio responded, \"the $56 million that we recorded in the third quarter will be it at this point.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed for clarity on the impact of event-driven volatility, margin sustainability, and pricing power, displaying a neutral to slightly negative tone as they questioned future growth headwinds and the ES business outlook.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, emphasizing operational discipline and pricing power, but acknowledged macro uncertainty and one-off event revenue fading. During Q&amp;A, management was candid about headwinds and challenges, using phrases such as \"we think we've kind of found the bottom\" and \"we feel really good about our partners,\" indicating tempered confidence.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, analyst tone shifted from cautious to more probing on event-driven sustainability and ES recovery. Management’s tone remained steady but increasingly transparent about non-recurring benefits and the need to recalibrate expectations for 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance language shifted to highlight the non-repeatability of $100 million in event-driven revenue for 2026, a change from last quarter’s broader optimism on multi-year growth.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus expanded on Polymer Centers ramp-up and EV infrastructure growth, while ES business headwinds became more pronounced.</li>\n<li>Analysts focused more on sustainability of margins, the impact of one-time events, and the volume outlook in ES, compared to the prior quarter’s focus on resilience and capital allocation.</li>\n<li>Key metric changes included a deceleration in revenue growth from 4.6% to 3.3%, decline in recycling commodity prices, and a reduction in ES revenue and margins.</li>\n<li>Management’s confidence in long-term growth remained, but the commentary became more nuanced regarding volatility and macro headwinds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management identified continued softness in construction and manufacturing as a challenge, with ES business down both sequentially and year-over-year.</li>\n<li>Declining recycling commodity prices and non-repeatability of event-driven landfill volumes were highlighted as risks to future margin expansion.</li>\n<li>Analysts questioned exposure to labor disruption costs, with management stating the $56 million impact is fully accounted for.</li>\n<li>Macro uncertainty, particularly related to manufacturing demand, pricing dynamics in ES, and future event-driven revenues, were noted as ongoing risks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Republic Services delivered another quarter of earnings and margin growth, driven by disciplined pricing and event-driven landfill activity. Management emphasized that significant non-recurring revenue in 2025 will not repeat next year and flagged continued softness in Environmental Solutions and commodity prices. The company’s outlook for steady mid-single-digit revenue growth and ongoing margin expansion remains, though expectations are recalibrated to reflect one-time benefits and persistent macro headwinds. Investors should note the company’s strong capital return, acquisition activity, and ongoing strategic investments in recycling and fleet electrification, all while management prepares for a more challenging comparative environment in 2026.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/rsg/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

Raab announced a raised guidance, stating, \"we expect to generate between $270 million and $275 million in IBSRELA revenue this year.\" XPHOZAH generated $27.4 million, up 9% from Q2.</li>\n<li>Raab introduced ARDX-10531, described as \"the next-generation NHE3 inhibitor and marks an important milestone for Ardelyx as we reinvigorate our pipeline,\" with preclinical and manufacturing activities underway before a Phase 1 study. He also welcomed Sue Hohenleitner as the new Chief Financial Officer, emphasizing her \"deep financial and strategic expertise.\"</li>\n<li>Eric Foster, Chief Commercial Officer, described the commercial team as operating at an \"exceptionally high level\" and credited targeted sales and marketing for record highs in IBSRELA revenue, new writers, and refill prescriptions.

Raab responded that organic growth for first-line use is occurring but the focus remains on second- and third-line positioning due to formulary economics. He said, \"our target and our commitment to $1 billion or more is based upon second-line therapy with the established patients.\"</li>\n<li>Joohwan Kim, Citi: Inquired about ARDX-10531's differentiation from tenapanor and potential sales force expansion. Raab explained, \"When you have highly soluble gut-restricted drugs, you may have better penetration into the target of NHE3. Potency will bring you lower doses or better efficacy,\" but said it was premature to specify indications. Foster confirmed confidence in the current team while always evaluating expansion.</li>\n<li>Roanna Ruiz, Leerink Partners: Asked what could impact achieving the high vs. low end of guidance.

CEO Shipchandler explained Stytch \"helps us do is to expand our capabilities to ensure that there's trust between businesses and consumers,\" and called the financial impact \"immaterial.\" Fish also asked about net customer additions and price increase impact. Viggiano said the quarter saw a \"big quarter for us\" in net adds, mainly from ending free tiers for APIs, and noted \"we haven't seen churn associated with [the price increase].\"</li>\n<li>Sitikantha Panigrahi, Mizuho: Asked about voice AI adoption trends. Viggiano reiterated \"voice grew mid-teens, which is our fastest growth rate in over three years,\" and the top 10 voice AI start-ups \"were up 10x.\"</li>\n<li>Aleksandr Zukin, Wolfe Research: Inquired about sequential customer adds and gross margin.

Questions were focused on growth sustainability and new product traction, with little skepticism or pressing on negative issues.</li>\n<li>Management’s tone was confident and upbeat throughout both prepared remarks and Q&amp;A, repeatedly using language such as \"record-breaking,\" \"encouraging traction,\" and \"excited about the trends.\" The tone remained similar to the previous quarter but with greater emphasis on accelerating growth and raised outlook.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The current quarter featured raised full-year revenue, income, and free cash flow guidance, compared to the previous quarter's more conservative guidance and focus on cost discipline.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus shifted further toward high-margin products, voice AI, and ISVs, with specific large deal wins and product launches highlighted in the current quarter.</li>\n<li>Management's confidence increased, particularly about cross-sell traction, AI-driven product adoption, and the durability of growth, as shown by more assertive language and raised targets. Analyst tone was consistently positive across both quarters, but Q3 saw more questions regarding the scaling of new product areas and sustainability of recent growth.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management acknowledged carrier pass-through fees as a headwind, with Viggiano citing $20 million in Q3 and anticipating $22 million in Q4 from incremental U.S. carrier fees.</li>\n<li>In response to questions about future carrier fee increases, Viggiano said, \"there could be a day when... AT&amp;T and T-Mobile follow the Verizon action. And that would present an additional pressure to... our gross margins.\" </li>\n<li>No material churn was observed from recent price increases, and contraction and churn remained stable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Twilio’s third quarter showcased record revenue and profitability, driven by broad-based growth across customer segments, particularly in high-margin products, voice AI, and ISV channels. The company raised its full-year guidance for reported and organic revenue growth, income from operations, and free cash flow. Management highlighted accelerating adoption of AI-powered solutions and bundled offerings, with large new deals and continued strength in self-serve and ISV channels. While carrier fee increases remain a watch point, Twilio’s operational rigor, expanding product portfolio, and robust customer engagement position the company to close 2025 with strong momentum and growth potential.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/twlo/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

Lesinski emphasized that NCM delivered \"results in line with our expectations, achieving top line growth despite a softer late summer box office and industry-wide decline in attendance.\" He noted a quarterly audience of 109 million, down 11% compared to Q3 2024, but stated, \"attendance trends improved toward the back half of September, finishing on par with 2024 strong performance, which was the highest level since 2019.\"</li>\n<li>Lesinski outlined key growth initiatives, stating, \"this quarter, we delivered approximately 4x the Programmatic revenue compared to last year, achieving our strongest Programmatic quarter ever.\" The self-serve platform also saw third quarter revenue up 23% quarter-over-quarter.

Ng stated, \"we anticipate a strong holiday box office slate with optimism that greater consistency in film release cadence and performance will continue to attract advertisers to NCM's platform.\" The fiscal fourth quarter includes an extra week compared to the prior year, which management expects will result in \"total attendance growth to outpace industry trends and lead to a correspondingly lower revenue per attendee.\"</li>\n<li>Lesinski commented on advertiser demand for upcoming releases, stating, \"demand for Wicked for Good has been exceptionally strong with inventory approaching sellout levels a month ahead of the film's upcoming release date.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>NCM reported total revenue of $63.4 million and adjusted OIBDA of $10.2 million for Q3 2025.

Ng responded that the extra week in Q4 will increase attendance and theater access fees, noting, \"the margins will reflect that.\"</li>\n<li>Eric Wold, Texas Capital Securities: Inquired about the value of incremental attendance during the extra week in Q4. Ng explained, \"after Christmas holiday season, that demand tends to soften...the demand is not...anywhere near the same as the weeks leading up to the holidays.\"</li>\n<li>Wold asked if advertisers are waiting to see new IP performance before committing. Ng replied, \"people are buying impressions and they're buying forecasts and estimates...people are buying the entire flight across a variety of movies.\"</li>\n<li>Michael Hickey, The Benchmark Company: Asked about growth prospects for 2026 and catalysts. Lesinski said, \"the fourth quarter is pacing very well...momentum from Q3 going into Q4...we expect that to follow in through '26.\"</li>\n<li>Hickey asked about capital allocation between dividends and buybacks. Ng explained, \"we're committed to our dividend...we were doing [buybacks] fairly aggressively in the first half of the year...we slowed down here, but that's really in cadence with the negative unlevered free cash flow.\"</li>\n<li>Hickey inquired about cost structure and AI opportunities.

Guidance for Q4 projects a significant revenue increase, supported by an expanded box office slate and steady improvements in advertiser demand.
