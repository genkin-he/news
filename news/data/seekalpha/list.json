            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">How's that for an encore?</p>\n<p>Nvidia (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a></span>) not only <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556780-nvidia-pops-q4-results-guidance-blow-past-wall-streets-forecast\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"topped\">topped</a> fourth-quarter estimates by a wide margin, but its guidance surprised even the most bullish analysts. The Jensen Huang-led company expects sales for the next quarter to be $78B, plus or minus 2%, well above Wall Street's forecast of $72.8B. </p>\n<p>Nonetheless, shares only rose roughly 1% in premarket trading on Thursday. Wall Street analysts believe there's more where that came from: it will just take more time.</p>\n<p>“NVDA is clearly firing on all cylinders, both internally and across its vast supply chain, as it continues to ramp Blackwell production (GB200+GB300) while simultaneously preparing for the imminent ramp of its Vera Rubin platform (on track for C2H26),” J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur wrote in a note to clients. “Even so, the stock response suggests investors were left wanting more, which we think is tied to continued uncertainty around the growth trajectory for NVDA’s Data Center business in CY27, given massively expanded capex budgets for key customers (aggregate capex for the top 5 US hyperscalers is now forecast to grow ~70% Y/Y to $650B+ in CY26) alongside significantly compressed FCF profiles. Taking a step back though, with the stock trading at ~19x pre-call Street CY27E EPS, NVDA to us looks like a coiled spring that has been tightened even further post this set of results.”</p>\n<p>Sur has an Overweight rating on Nvidia and upped his price target to $265 from $250 after the results. </p>\n<p>Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore had a similar take, in that he was “surprised” by the muted reaction to the stock, given that the results were the “largest, cleanest beat and raise in the history of the semis industry.” Moore has an Overweight rating on Nvidia and raised his price target to $260 from $250.</p>\n<p>“We would continue to argue that the long term also looks pretty good, while conceding that the growth next year will still be somewhat capital markets driven,” Moore wrote in a note to clients. He added that the questions about the hyperscalers free cash flow generation may be part of the reason for the muted reaction, but that could be alleviated by increased token monetization. </p>\n<p>“LLM frontier model developers are calling for hundreds of gigawatts of compute capacity by 2029,” Moore continued. “Paying for all of that will be challenging, but we continue to point out that the compute demand is needed to manage inference/token growth, not aspirational training clusters, for the most part. NVIDIA believes that the cash issues will be resolved by the cash flows of AI factories being much better than expected - but that in turn requires token monetization that is also better than expected. While we would stop short of believing the most bullish 5-year views, we do continue to think that there is no visibility to any pause in the current levels of strong demand.”</p>\n<p>RBC Capital Markets analyst Srini Pajjuri said the muted reaction suggests a concern from the market about “peaking revenue momentum,” but it's unlikely to slow down massively.</p>\n<p>“While y/y growth should eventually moderate from current (70%+) levels, we expect strong double-digit growth to sustain well into CY27,” Pajjuri wrote. “Our base case is for a gradual slowdown in hyperscaler capex, which we believe valuation is already discounting to a large extent.” He reiterated his Outperform rating on Nvidia and raised his price target to $250 from $240.</p>\n<p>Others, including Seeking Alpha analyst <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/semiconductor-analyst\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Semiconductor Analyst\">Semiconductor Analyst</a>, had similar takes. “The level of capex growth left a strong chance of another round of positive surprises in NVDA’s earnings,” Seeking Alpha analyst <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/semiconductor-analyst\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Semiconductor Analyst\">Semiconductor Analyst</a> said in an email. “I think this quarter showed exactly that. Big techs are now slightly above 50% of the data center revenue mix (taking a bit of share), which also suggests other revenue sources remain healthy. Agentic AI adoption is accelerating fast, and it is the most tangible driver of hardware demand in this stage of the AI rollout.” </p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
