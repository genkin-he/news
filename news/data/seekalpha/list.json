            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Koppers Holdings Inc. (KOP) Q4 2025 </p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Leroy M. Ball stated the company achieved adjusted EBITDA of $256.7 million and a 13.7% adjusted EBITDA margin for 2025, describing it as the second highest year on record, and highlighted $4.07 in adjusted EPS, marking the sixth consecutive year above $4. Ball emphasized, “operating cash flow of $122.5 million for the seventh straight year of more than $100 million in that category.” He noted capital expenditures had returned to a normalized $55 million, enabling $38.2 million in share repurchases and $6.4 million in dividends. </li>\n<li>Ball reported, “In early 2025, we launched our transformation process named Catalyst, which delivered $46 million in benefits during the year.” He outlined the exit from the phthalic anhydride business and the sale of the railroad structures business as major strategic moves, as well as reducing adjusted SG&amp;A by 15% and employee count by 11%. </li>\n<li>Ball shared that the Board approved a long-term incentive program aligned with goals such as double-digit adjusted EPS growth over three years, $300 million of cumulative free cash flow, and a mid-teens margin run rate by 2028. </li>\n<li>Ball also announced the retirement of CFO Jimmi Sue Smith, commending her role in capital deployment and share repurchases. Bradley Pearce is serving as Interim CFO during the search for a successor.</li>\n<li>Interim CFO Bradley Pearce reported, “we reported consolidated fourth quarter sales of $433 million, down $44 million or 9% from the prior year.” He detailed segment decreases: RUPS down $7 million, PC down $20 million, CM&amp;C down $17 million. Pearce noted, “adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $53 million, which represents a 12.3% EBITDA margin on sales.” </li>\n<li>Pearce highlighted share buybacks totaling $38 million in 2025, and an increased quarterly dividend to $0.09 per share for 2026, a 13% rise. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ball projected, “a top line increase of approximately 11% in 2026, driven entirely by market share expansion in both our residential and industrial product lines” for the Performance Chemicals (PC) segment. He cautioned, “we're expecting a mix of increases and decreases in our raw materials to mostly balance out and have little impact,” but noted copper prices are “25% higher than average prices for 2025.”</li>\n<li>For Utility and Industrial Products (UIP), Ball expects further top line performance in 2026, underpinned by regional expansion, the utility pole procurement acquisition, and modest organic growth. </li>\n<li>Regarding RUPS, Ball stated, “our piece of it is expected to grow to volumes that we haven't seen since 2017,” despite industry consolidation and volume pullbacks from Class 1 railroad customers. </li>\n<li>Consolidated sales guidance for 2026 is $1.9 billion to $2 billion, with adjusted EBITDA forecast between $250 million and $270 million. Adjusted EPS is guided to a range of $4.20 to $5 per share in 2026, compared to $4.07 in 2025. Ball added, “we are expecting to see a sizable jump in both operating cash flow and free cash flow this year.” </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fourth quarter consolidated sales were $433 million, with full year sales at $1.9 billion, compared to $2.1 billion in the prior year. </li>\n<li>PC segment delivered adjusted EBITDA of $28 million for Q4, RUPS $22 million, and CM&amp;C $4 million. </li>\n<li>Full year adjusted EBITDA was $257 million, with segment contributions of $108 million for RUPS, $103 million for PC, and $46 million for CM&amp;C. </li>\n<li>Share buybacks amounted to $38 million for 2025, with $67 million remaining on the repurchase authorization. </li>\n<li>Net debt at year-end was $881 million, with a net leverage ratio of 3.4x. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Gary Prestopino, Barrington Research, asked about PC market share recovery and price dynamics. Ball responded, “We did take a market share hit in 2025…there was some business that was available to potentially recapture in -- heading into 2026, and we were able to convert on a portion of that. But… the bulk of the business that we're adding in 2026 is unrelated to that market share loss.”</li>\n<li>Prestopino asked about Catalyst benefits for 2026. Ball replied, “we're targeting somewhere between $20 million and $40 million of Catalyst benefits in 2026.”</li>\n<li>Prestopino queried the rationale for retaining CM&amp;C. Ball said, “it is a significant component of our supply chain…there's a whole host of constraints…we continue to look at our business portfolio actively. Nothing is off the table.”</li>\n<li>David Marsh, Singular Research, questioned D&amp;A increases and their outlook. Pearce responded, “D&amp;A obviously is going to change as we close projects and begin to depreciate them.” Ball added, “we are expecting D&amp;A to drop by a couple of million, I think, in 2026.”</li>\n<li>Marsh asked about the split of Catalyst benefits. Ball replied, “It will be heavier on the COGS side…there's pieces to it…most of our Catalyst initiatives were centered around commercial, and it was about being able to win additional business, take some additional market share.”</li>\n<li>Michael Mathison, Sidoti &amp; Company, queried PC adjusted EBITDA margin sustainability. Ball explained, “We did have a benefit of an asset sale that I think helped their results for the quarter and probably added a little bit of that, that is something that is not repeatable. But overall, I'd say the margin profile…I think with what we're doing moving forward, we certainly expect that we're going to be able to generate margins that are in that range.”</li>\n<li>Mathison also asked about the Douglas Fir acquisition. Ball specified, “small business…out in Oregon. It really secures up a Doug Fir supply chain for us…helps improve our opportunities in some of our traditional markets.”</li>\n<li>Liam Burke, B. Riley Securities, inquired about PC commercial segment growth. Ball confirmed, “we're happy with the commercial wins that the team generated in the back half of '25 that will carry into this year.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analyst sentiment was cautiously optimistic, with persistent questions on margin durability, strategic direction for CM&amp;C, and the sustainability of cost reduction efforts. Analysts pressed for clarity on segment performance, the future of underperforming units, and structural benefits from new initiatives.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone about the trajectory of Catalyst, the ability to generate higher free cash flow, and structural improvements, but was measured and transparent about ongoing industry and market headwinds. Ball used language such as, “we're targeting…,” “we believe…,” and “we expect…,” reflecting a blend of confidence and caution. In Q&amp;A, management demonstrated openness to strategic change, especially regarding the CM&amp;C segment.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management’s prepared remarks were more forward-looking and detailed in guidance; the tone shifted from defensive to proactive, emphasizing execution and transformation. Analyst tone remained probing but acknowledged management’s achievements on margin and cost controls.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management in Q4 provided more granular guidance for 2026, including explicit sales, EBITDA, and EPS ranges, compared to more cautious language in Q3. The Q4 call highlighted a step-up in free cash flow expectations and outlined $20 million to $40 million in Catalyst benefits for 2026, while Q3 deferred specifics on Catalyst impact for the next year.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus shifted further toward growing PC and RUPS, with CM&amp;C confirmed as a shrinking portfolio component. The Douglas Fir acquisition and sales team investments in UIP were new developments absent from Q3.</li>\n<li>Analysts continued to focus on margin sustainability, cost reduction, and the future of CM&amp;C, but asked more about execution and less about macro concerns relative to Q3.</li>\n<li>There was a clearer articulation of the business mix shift and more detail on the rationale for portfolio retention and divestiture in Q4.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited tariff uncertainty, especially with the Supreme Court ruling and ongoing investigations into refined copper imports, as an ongoing risk that could influence PC costs.</li>\n<li>Ball highlighted risks including “realizing the lower end of our Catalyst capture rate and seeing further end market softness,” as well as “higher costs driven by tariffs or other factors and extended operational disruptions.”</li>\n<li>For CM&amp;C, structural improvements are being offset by “higher net global coal tar costs, reduced throughput as a result of a key raw material supplier exiting the market and pricing pressure.”</li>\n<li>Sawmill closures and reduced hardwood availability were noted as near-term risks for RUPS.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Koppers Holdings outlined a strategy focused on accelerating cost transformation through its Catalyst program, aiming for double-digit EPS growth, $300 million in cumulative free cash flow, and a mid-teens margin run rate by 2028. Management underscored its commitment to expanding PC and RUPS as core earnings drivers while actively evaluating the future of CM&amp;C. With an improved sales outlook in key segments and reinforced cost discipline, Koppers expects to capitalize on operational efficiencies and strategic market expansion to drive shareholder value in the coming years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/kop/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

These defining milestones reinforce our confidence in our growth trajectory and our market leadership position.” <span> </span></p>\n<p>The results also reflect the company’s use of AI to assist in identifying the highest value supply opportunities and for more accurate valuation estimates. This provides consignors with a more realistic expectation of earnings and strengthens the company’s position as a “trusted advisor.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the company transitioned buyers into sellers more effectively.</p>\n<p>“By turning buyers into sellers, we're acquiring supply more cost effectively while deepening the loyalty of our community. We accelerated new buyer growth in Q4, and we believe it's a positive catalyst for future supply,” Levesque said on the company’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4876029-the-realreal-inc-real-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"earnings call.\">earnings call.</a></p>\n<p>Despite efforts by luxury brands to limit what can and cannot be sold on resellers’ websites and strict limitations how these brands can be advertised, The RealReal (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/REAL\" title=\"The RealReal, Inc.\">REAL</a>) generated 18% more sales in the<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558232-the-realreal-non-gaap-eps-of-0_06-beats-by-0_02-revenue-of-194_05m-beats-by-3_33m\" target=\"_blank\" title=\" final quarter of the year, \"> final quarter of the year, </a> as GMV increased 22%, contributing to a profit of $0.06 per share from a loss of $0.01 in the same quarter last year. This was 2 cents better than anticipated and demonstrates the appeal of second-hand – and more affordable — luxury items. <span>  </span></p>\n<p>Stripping out depreciation, amortization, interest expenses and taxes, The RealReal (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/REAL\" title=\"The RealReal, Inc.\">REAL</a>) earned a profit of $22M, doubling from a year earlier and resulting in a margin of 11.3% versus 6.7% in the same quarter last year.</p>\n<p>For the current quarter, the company expects sales to be between $185M and $189M versus $188.7M estimates, and expects revenue of $765M and $780M for the year compared to $768.5M estimates.</p>\n<p>For Q1, GMV is seen between $585M and $600M and adjusted EBITDA of $11M to $13M. This compares to $490M and $4.1M in the same quarter last year, respectively.</p>\n<p>For FY26, GMV is expected to be within a range of $2.39B and $2.45B and adjusted EBITDA between $57M and $65M, both of which are seen increasing from $2.13B and $42M in FY25, respectively.</p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
