The research firm said the company's significant investment in its AI superintelligence unit, despite the unknown revenue opportunity, mirrors 2021/2022 Metaverse spending.</p>\n<p><strong>Bernstein </strong>praised Meta's revenue growth driven by AI execution but said it was reminded of the \"Metaverse days\" after the company warned of climbing investment levels. Ad impressions were the primary revenue growth driver in Q3, though pricing growth was also strong; paid messaging revenue growth remains strong but small, the research firm said. The rating was maintained at \"buy,\" but the PT was cut by $30 to $870, a 15.7% upside.</p>\n<p><strong>Citigroup </strong>maintained its rating at \"buy\" but lowered its price target to $850 (13.1% upside), from $915. The research firm now expects lower profitability for 2026 due to the company's aggressive spending and investments next year. They also acknowledged that the magnitude of investments is greater than what most expected.</p>\n<p><strong>Truist Securities </strong>said it remained constructive on Meta and believes the company continues to earn the right to invest as long as it delivers faster top-line growth and FCFs in the near term. They also noted that Q3 results reflected robust ad share gains fueled by AI improvements across ad recommendations, monetization, and user growth/engagement. The rating was unchanged at \"buy,\" but the PT was lowered by $15 to $875, a 16.4% upside.</p>\n<p><strong>Piper Sandler </strong>called the results \"very impressive\" and said the pressure on shares from the expense commentary for 2026 is a buying opportunity. The research firm projected flat operating income for next year and said FCF will likely be down. They remain bullish on ad model investments like GEM, Lattice, and Andromeda. The rating was maintained at \"overweight,\" but PT was cut by $40 to $840, an 11.8% upside.</p>\n<p><strong>Bank of America</strong> said they expect Meta's stock to be controversial given a limited EPS growth outlook and y/y FCF pressure in 2026. However, they see the company in a position of strength with its massive user network and the opportunity to integrate compelling AI products, including content creation tools, over the next two years. </p>\n<p>\"We believe the bad news on expenses is now mostly in the stock, while product catalysts, including a new LLM and content creation tools, can drive upside engagement and revenue in 2026,\" the research firm said. The rating was maintained at \"buy,\" but the PT was cut by $90 to $810, a 7.8% upside. </p>\n<p><strong>Seeking Alpha analyst Ahan Vashi </strong>upgraded Meta to \"buy\" and said <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835045-meta-buy-the-q3-earnings-dip-rating-upgrade#scroll_comments\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the company's Q3 revenue and core KPIs were strong</a>, but a one-time ~$16B tax charge caused a sharp EPS drop and triggered a stock decline. </p>\n<p>Despite rising expenses and CAPEX, META's valuation is now attractive, with a 5-year CAGR return estimate of ~16%. Technical and fundamental analysis support a bullish outlook for META, with a target range of $850-1075 per share, Vashi said.</p>\n<p><strong>Seeking Alpha analyst Kenio Fontes </strong>also upgraded the company to a \"buy\" rating after the Q3 report and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835059-meta-q3-selloff-looks-like-a-gift-for-long-term-investors-upgrade\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">blamed the market overreaction</a> for the stock price decline stemming from the non-recurring tax charge. Fontes noted that Meta's core business remains strong, with 26% YoY revenue growth, robust ad impressions, and expanding AI and Reality Labs initiatives. </p>\n<p>He also highlighted that the stock now trades at a 2026 P/E of 23x, making the company the cheapest among the \"Magnificent Seven,\" enhancing its margin of safety. While ad dependence remains a concern, META's solid fundamentals and discounted valuation present a compelling medium- and long-term opportunity, Fontes said.</p>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent commended the Federal Reserve for cutting its benchmark rate <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510518-federal-reserve-cuts-by-another-25-basis-points\" target=\"_blank\" title=\" by 25 basis points \">by 25 basis points </a>on Wednesday, but insists that the central bank's processes needs to be revamped, he said in a televised interview on Thursday.</p>\n<p>\"The language that went with it (the rate decision) tells me that this Fed is stuck in the past. Their inflation estimates have been terrible so far this year,\" he said in an interview on Fox Business's \"Mornings with Maria.\" \"Inflation keeps coming down.\"</p>\n<p>Bessent contends that the Fed's economic models are broken. \"And I'm just not sure what they're thinking here in terms of signaling that they may not want to cut rates at their December meeting,\" he said. At Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference after the FOMC meeting, he said a December rate cut is \"<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510526-another-rate-cut-in-december-is-not-a-foregone-conclusion-powell-says-at-press-conference\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"not a foregone conclusion\">not a foregone conclusion</a>\" due to the differing views of the committee's members and the halt of government data during the federal shutdown.</p>\n<p>To be sure, the most recent data shows inflation holding above the Fed's 2% goal. The September Consumer Price Index, excluding food and energy,<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4508175-consumer-price-index-shows-slightly-cooler-than-expected-inflation-in-september\" target=\"_blank\" title=\" rose 3.0% Y/Y, \"> rose 3.0% Y/Y, </a>down from 3.1% in August, but still elevated. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4499459-feds-preferred-inflation-gauge-stays-elevated-yy-as-expected\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Core PCE for August\">Core PCE for August</a>, its most recent report, increased to 2.9% Y/Y, the same rise as in July.</p>\n<p>\"They have a lot to answer for, not only for this year but for many years past, both in their GDP estimates and their inflation estimate, which are consistently wrong,\" Bessent said.</p>\n<p>\"We're going to find a leader who is going to revamp the entire institution in terms of process and inner workings,\" he added. As reported previously, the Treasury Secretary, who is leading the interview process for the next Fed chair, has narrowed the list of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4508484-bessent-unveils-fed-chair-finalists-before-year-end-decision\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"candidates to five people\">candidates to five people</a>. He expects to hold a second round of interviews in early December, and anticipates that President Donald Trump will choose a nominee by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>When asked how he assesses the current economy, given the lack of federal government data due to the shutdown, Bessent pivoted to his outlook for next year.</p>\n<p>\"I'm very optimistic for 2026, both in terms of growth and the inflation levels. I think we're going to go back to the same levels that we had under Trump's 1.0 where we had high growth and low inflation,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Trillions of dollars of investment are coming into the U.S., and productivity is increasing, he said. \"I think the job growth will rebound very strongly, and, more importantly, I think the real after-tax wages for working Americans are going to go up.\"</p>\n<p>He expects that Americans will see larger tax rebates next year due to tax policy changes, such as no tax on tips and overtime pay.</p>\n<p><strong>Dear readers: </strong>We recognize that politics often intersects with the financial news of the day, so we invite you to click<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831696-politics-and-the-markets-103025\" target=\"_blank\" title=\" here to join the separate political discussion.\"> here to join the separate political discussion.</a></p>\n</body></html>",

(MBUU) Q1 2026</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Steve Menneto, CEO, reported \"a solid start to the fiscal year with revenue growth above our expectations despite what remains a soft retail backdrop.\" Net sales increased approximately 13% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA margins were in line with plan.

He stated, \"Early feedback from our financing partner has been extremely positive, describing MBI Acceptance as one of the strongest programs they have seen, noting exceptional dealer engagement and early success in the rollout.\"</li>\n<li>The CEO showcased new product launches, including the Malibu 21 LX, X-axis A200, Cobalt R31 outboard, and the debut of the Pathfinder 2600, all receiving positive feedback. Pursuit was recognized for the National Boating Safety Award, highlighting Malibu's leadership in owner education and safety.</li>\n<li>Menneto concluded, \"We are maintaining our full-year guidance and remain confident in our ability to outperform the market while continuing to build for the next up cycle.\"</li>\n<li>CFO Bruce Beckman stated, \"Net sales increased 13.5% to $194.7 million, and unit volume increased 10.3% to 1,129 units.\" He explained, \"Gross profit decreased 1% to $27.9 million, and gross margin as a percent of sales was 14.3%. This represents a decrease of 210 basis points compared to the prior year period.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Beckman reiterated, \"We continue to anchor our outlook with the expectation that our markets will decline in the range of mid- to high single digits for the year, with a continuation of the high single-digit to low double-digit decline through the second quarter.\"</li>\n<li>The company maintained its fiscal year 2026 guidance, expecting sales to be flat to down mid-single-digit percentage points. For Q2, sales are expected between $175 million to $185 million, with adjusted EBITDA margins ranging from 3% to 5%. Full-year adjusted EBITDA margin guidance remains 8% to 9%.</li>\n<li>Menneto reaffirmed, \"Our focus remains unchanged: protect dealer health, manage production with precision, and continue to push the pace of innovation and execute on our strategic growth priorities.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Beckman reported, \"Net sales increased 13.5% to $194.7 million, and unit volume increased 10.3% to 1,129 units.\"</li>\n<li>The Malibu and Axis brands represented approximately 47.7% of unit sales, Saltwater Fishing 25.5%, and Cobalt 26.8%.</li>\n<li>Consolidated net sales per unit increased 2.9% to $172,500 per unit.</li>\n<li>Gross profit fell to $27.9 million, with gross margin at 14.3%.

Menneto responded, \"Consumer gets encouraged, the dealer gets encouraged. But when you're looking at what will it do to retail finance rates, that will take a little bit of time to manifest itself into the marketplace.\"</li>\n<li>Mitela also queried higher dealer incentives for the Malibu brand. Beckman explained, \"We expect it to continue to be a competitive promotional environment, but not anything like we've seen here recently.\"</li>\n<li>Kevin Condon, Robert W. Baird: Asked about inventory management and retail decline shape. Beckman stated, \"We're expecting the markets to be down, and we're going to pace our production kind of in line with those expectations.\"</li>\n<li>Anna Glaessgen, B. Riley: Requested details on Q2 margin and inventory balancing. Beckman noted, \"There's a modest amount of deleverage that you can expect, and that's embedded in that guidance.\"</li>\n<li>Eric Wold, Texas Capital: Inquired about the MBI Acceptance rollout and discounting. Menneto said, \"We're excited about the overall adoption from our dealer base.\" Beckman added, \"It remains competitive. I mean it is still a soft retail environment.\"</li>\n<li>Noah Zatzkin, KeyBanc: Sought color on ASPs and M&amp;A strategy. Beckman pointed to \"modest year-over-year price increases,\" while Menneto confirmed, \"No changes on that front to announce there.\"</li>\n<li>Jaime Katz, Morningstar: Probed expense leverage and gross margin resilience. Beckman highlighted, \"To get real leverage, you have to see the markets turn… we are expecting higher margins in the second half embedded in our guidance.\"</li>\n<li>Michael Albanese, Benchmark: Asked about consumer behavior. Menneto responded, \"No change from what we were talking about earlier about where that cash buyer, payment buyer dynamic has landed over the last few quarters.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed on inventory, promotional activity, and the impact of interest rates, reflecting a slightly negative to neutral sentiment as they sought clarity on margin pressures and consumer trends.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and realistic tone, often referencing discipline and readiness—\"We remain focused on working closely with our dealer partners to support rightsized inventory levels,\" and \"We are confident in our ability to deliver on our strategic objectives.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone was similarly pragmatic and forward-looking, though current sentiment reflected slightly more optimism in the adoption of new financing programs and product launches.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance language and market expectations were consistent with the previous quarter, reiterating a mid- to high-single-digit market decline and flat to down sales outlook.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus remained on dealer health, inventory alignment, and innovation, with the new MBI Acceptance program as a notable addition.</li>\n<li>Analysts again focused on inventory, dealer incentives, and margin resilience, but current discussion included more detail on early results from new financing initiatives.</li>\n<li>Key metrics changed: net sales and unit volumes were lower than in Q4 2025, gross margin declined, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased slightly compared to Q1 of the previous year.</li>\n<li>Management’s confidence in innovation and retail tools was more pronounced this quarter, while analysts continued to express caution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited continued softness in retail demand and elevated inventories entering the quarter.</li>\n<li>Increased unit labor and material costs, along with higher dealer incentive costs, pressured gross margins.</li>\n<li>Tariff-related cost headwinds of 1.5% to 3% of cost of sales were incorporated into guidance, with active mitigation strategies through supply chain management and vertical integration.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about the competitive promotional environment, the timing and impact of interest rate changes, and the outlook for margin leverage in a declining market.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Malibu Boats, Inc. delivered a solid first quarter with revenue growth above expectations and maintained its fiscal 2026 guidance despite ongoing softness in the marine retail environment. The company highlighted continued innovation, disciplined management of dealer health, and early positive adoption of its new MBI Acceptance financing platform.
