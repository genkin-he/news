            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (XRAY) Q4 2025  </p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Daniel Scavilla highlighted 2025 as an \"important year for DENTSPLY SIRONA,\" emphasizing the launch of a world-class board and leadership team, enhanced discipline and execution, and progress on the Return to Growth action plan. He stated, \"We ended the year with strong momentum underfoot and financial results in line with our expectations.\"</li>\n<li>Scavilla announced a 24-month Return to Growth plan built on five pillars: customer-centric mindset, sustainable growth, empowered performance, scalability, and financial strength. The company is increasing R&amp;D investment by double digits, reorganizing its U.S. commercial teams, hiring Mark Bezjak as North America sales lead, and signing or expanding key partnerships with Benco, Patterson, Burkhart, and A-dec.</li>\n<li>Scavilla disclosed the elimination of the dividend, noting, \"These funds will be reallocated to our debt retirement and share repurchases.\" He explained this as a shift to optimize capital allocation.</li>\n<li>CFO Michael Pomeroy reported, \"Our fourth quarter revenue was $961 million, representing a reported sales increase of 6.2% and constant currency growth of 2.5%.\" Pomeroy further stated, \"Adjusted EBITDA margins declined 10 basis points to 14.1%, resulting from a 300 basis point decline in gross profit, driven by lower volume, change in sales mix and tariff impacts.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Scavilla said for 2026, \"We expect net sales to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion, reflecting a negative 3% to negative 1% operational growth.\"</li>\n<li>2026 adjusted EPS guidance is $1.40 to $1.50. Scavilla explained, \"We anticipate positive sequential sales momentum in the second half of this year.\"</li>\n<li>The company expects approximately $120 million annual savings from a restructuring program, to be reinvested in growth initiatives.</li>\n<li>Dividend elimination was confirmed, with capital reallocated to debt reduction and share repurchases.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fourth quarter revenue was $961 million. Adjusted EPS was $0.27.</li>\n<li>Operating cash flow in the quarter was $101 million, and free cash flow was $60 million. Cash and cash equivalents at quarter end were $326 million, with net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.0.</li>\n<li>The company recorded a $144 million noncash net of tax charge for goodwill and intangible asset impairment in CTS and OIS segments, primarily due to tariffs and volume declines.</li>\n<li>Segment performance included a 1.9% constant currency sales decline in CTS, 4% constant currency sales growth in EDS, 6.9% constant currency sales growth in OIS, and 1.9% constant currency sales growth in Wellspect HealthCare.</li>\n<li>Full year sales were $3.68 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.1% and adjusted EPS of $1.60.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Vikramjeet Chopra, Wells Fargo: Asked about capital deployment after dividend elimination and views on share price. Scavilla responded that debt control is the first priority, with share buybacks to follow, stating, \"At these prices, I want to move into next year to really remove shares at what I consider a bargain price.\"</li>\n<li>Chopra also inquired about the new dealer inventory model and its revenue impact. Scavilla estimated a $30 million inventory sell-through in the first half of 2026, shifting to a drop-ship model by Q4.</li>\n<li>Allen Lutz, BofA: Asked about timing and impact of new dealer agreements. Scavilla said the benefit will likely materialize in late Q3 or early Q4, not in the first half.</li>\n<li>Lutz followed up on the EPS guidance and investment cadence. Scavilla expects similar investment levels in 2027 before self-funding growth takes over.</li>\n<li>Elizabeth Anderson, Evercore: Asked about R&amp;D cadence and product launches. Scavilla described a mix of acceleration, pull-forward, and new projects, with timing dependent on regulatory approvals.</li>\n<li>Anderson also asked about commercial team reorganization. Scavilla confirmed it is complete, with new structures active by March and April.</li>\n<li>Several other analysts focused on segment growth priorities, DSO strategy, and free cash flow, with management emphasizing a primary focus on the U.S. market, reinvestment, and cash flow improvements over time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts asked direct and at times pressing questions about capital deployment, investment timing, and execution risks, reflecting a neutral to slightly skeptical tone, especially on turnaround timing and growth visibility.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and constructive tone, emphasizing urgency, decisive action, and a multi-year transformation. Phrases such as \"I am confident in the path we've set\" and \"This is a moment for bold change and decisive action\" were used, though some hesitancy was noted regarding timing of growth and product launches.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone has shifted to more decisive language around restructuring and capital allocation, while analysts remain focused on execution details and risk.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The new quarter saw the formal announcement of dividend elimination and a restructuring targeting $120 million in annual savings, compared to ongoing discussions about capital allocation in Q3.</li>\n<li>Management introduced new board members and clarified leadership changes, whereas last quarter focused on CFO transition and transformation office setup.</li>\n<li>Guidance for 2026 was provided, with net sales and EPS targets, while Q3 only revised 2025 outlook and deferred 2026 detail.</li>\n<li>R&amp;D investment acceleration and commercial team reorganization advanced from planning in Q3 to implementation in Q4.</li>\n<li>Analysts' questions this quarter centered more around timing and execution of new initiatives, reflecting cautious optimism but persistent scrutiny.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited ongoing volume declines in key segments, competitive pressures, and a $144 million goodwill impairment as significant challenges.</li>\n<li>Tariffs continued to impact gross profit, with $15 million headwind in Q4 and $23 million for the year.</li>\n<li>The wind down of Byte was identified as a headwind for future EPS.</li>\n<li>Analysts highlighted risks related to execution of the drop-ship dealer inventory model, timing of new product launches, and realization of restructuring savings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>DENTSPLY SIRONA outlined a comprehensive transformation plan for 2026, highlighted by a $120 million cost savings target, elimination of its dividend in favor of debt reduction and share repurchases, and a focus on accelerating R&amp;D and commercial execution. Management provided clear guidance for 2026, with net sales expected between $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion and adjusted EPS between $1.40 and $1.50, while emphasizing the company's readiness for bold action and structural change to drive long-term profitable growth.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/xray/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
