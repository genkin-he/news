Greenstreet described this as \"an increase of $275 million or 10% at the midpoint, underscoring our confidence in the AMVUTTRA ATTR-CM launch and our other commercial products for the remainder of the year.\"</li>\n<li>The TTR franchise guidance was increased to $2.475 billion to $2.525 billion. The rare franchise guidance remains at $475 million to $525 million.</li>\n<li>Poulton added, \"we are also narrowing the range of our non-GAAP operating expense guidance to $2.15 billion to $2.2 billion as we expect to end the year at the upper end of our original 2025 operating expense guidance.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Total net product revenues for Q3 2025 were $851 million, reflecting 103% year-over-year growth. TTR franchise revenues reached $724 million, up 135% year-over-year. U.S. TTR net product revenues were $543 million, representing 194% year-over-year growth.</li>\n<li>Collaboration revenue was $352 million, driven by $300 million in milestone revenue from the Roche partnership related to the ZENITH Phase III trial.</li>\n<li>Royalty revenue doubled to $46 million, attributed to higher LEQVIO sales.</li>\n<li>Gross margin on product sales was 77%, down from 80% in Q3 2024, with the decrease driven by increased royalties on AMVUTTRA. Non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses rose to $310 million, while non-GAAP SG&amp;A expenses increased to $263 million.</li>\n<li>Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $2.7 billion at quarter-end. The company raised over $600 million via new convertible notes and entered a $500 million revolving credit facility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Salveen Richter, Goldman Sachs, asked about AMVUTTRA adoption among first-line versus switchers and ex-U.S. pricing. Tolga Tanguler responded, \"our first-line share continues to grow quarter-over-quarter. And we're obviously maintaining a clear leadership in second-line among those patients that are progressing or not responding to a stabilizer.\" On ex-U.S. pricing, Tanguler said, \"really compelling pricing profile in Japan. We're also launched in Germany, but we're actually in the early stages of pricing and reimbursement negotiations.\"</li>\n<li>Julian Pino, Stifel, questioned momentum and ONPATTRO contribution. Tanguler replied, \"ONPATTRO declined from the prior quarter, and that really was driven by the ONPATTRO's favorability from last quarter's onetime Medicaid adjustment, which didn't repeat.\"</li>\n<li>Tazeen Ahmad, BofA Securities, sought clarity on payer dynamics. Tanguler stated, \"we're seeing is really no headwinds in terms of every actually payer piece, whether it's fee-for-service, Medicare Advantage or even in the commercial setting.\"</li>\n<li>Maurice Raycroft, Jefferies, asked about inventory, gross to net, and EU ramp. Poulton explained, \"days on hand stayed pretty constant for the quarter, but there was growth in inventory in the channel...That was more than offset in the quarter by an increase in gross to net.\" Tanguler added, \"contribution of ex U.S. market is going to remain relatively modest, especially for fourth quarter...ex U.S. market is going to be mainly 2026, mid- to late '26 story.\"</li>\n<li>Jessica Fye, JPMorgan, asked about TTR franchise guidance approach. Poulton stated, \"we're continuing to learn. As Tolga said, we're 2 quarters in. I think our understanding of the business and the ability to forecast it is improving as we get more data points.\"</li>\n<li>Luca Issi, RBC, inquired about CMS reimbursement and legal matters. Tanguler said, \"we actually anticipate more diagnosis and more scanning. We need to really fully understand how that reimbursement is actually going to play out.\"</li>\n<li>Huidong Wang, Barclays, questioned U.S. and EU pricing and first-line versus second-line split. Tanguler replied, \"we would actually anticipate our net price to be gradually going down over time...so far, what we've been seeing is, we are increasingly getting more competitive in first-line.\"</li>\n<li>Ritu Baral, TD Cowen, asked about European commercial investment and center type impact. Tanguler said, \"we actually have quite an effective team that has been able to establish a market leadership versus tafamidis in the polyneuropathy organization...cardiomyopathy patients are actually mostly treated in these centers as well.\"</li>\n<li>Adithya Jayaraman, Evercore, asked about seasonality and category growth. Tanguler responded, \"the category growth in ATTR-CM is accelerating...we are exceptionally well positioned.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts focused on sustainability of launch momentum, payer dynamics, and pricing, with a generally positive and congratulatory tone across exchanges.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone in prepared remarks and Q&amp;A, expressing certainty in the durability of growth and guidance. Greenstreet and Tanguler repeatedly referenced strong momentum and minimal payer headwinds. Phrases such as \"we're really pleased,\" \"demand doubled in cardiomyopathy,\" and \"we're only 2 quarters into this launch. And we've already raised guidance twice\" reflected confidence.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both analyst and management sentiment remained positive, with increased emphasis on guidance credibility and sustainability of growth in the current call.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance was raised again, from $2.65–$2.8 billion in Q2 to $2.95–$3.05 billion in Q3, reflecting increased confidence in AMVUTTRA ATTR-CM's trajectory.</li>\n<li>Revenue growth accelerated, with TTR franchise revenues growing from $544 million in Q2 to $724 million in Q3 and overall net product revenues increasing from $672 million to $851 million.</li>\n<li>Management's tone remained confident but was more assertive in discussing the durability of growth and expanding first-line presence for AMVUTTRA.</li>\n<li>Analysts shifted focus from initial launch execution to sustainability, pricing, payer feedback, and ex-U.S. expansion, reflecting the evolving business stage.</li>\n<li>Strategic themes advanced from health system setup (Q2) to global launch momentum, access, and pipeline breadth (Q3).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited ongoing reimbursement negotiations in Europe and the early stage of launch in Germany as areas of uncertainty.</li>\n<li>Tanguler noted, \"we need to really fully understand how that reimbursement is actually going to play out\" with CMS PYP scintigraphy cuts.</li>\n<li>Greenstreet briefly addressed a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's office regarding government price reporting, stating, \"we intend to work with the U.S. Attorney's office to produce the documents that have been requested by the subpoena and to understand and address any potential concerns.\"</li>\n<li>Analysts asked about payer preference risk, inventory dynamics, and net price trends, but management reported minimal headwinds and ongoing broad access.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Alnylam management emphasized the strong commercial execution and accelerating momentum of the AMVUTTRA ATTR-CM launch, driving significant increases in revenue and upgraded guidance for 2025. Leadership highlighted continued robust adoption in both first-line and second-line settings, advancing pipeline developments, and expanding global reach as foundations for sustained growth, while also noting a stable pricing environment and minimal payer resistance.

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Franklin BSP Realty Trust (FBRT) Q3 2025  </p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Richard Byrne, Chairman and CEO, highlighted the successful closing and integration of the NewPoint acquisition, stating the third quarter was \"a transitional period for FBRT\" and emphasizing that \"NewPoint had a record volume quarter...with $2.2 billion of originations\" contributing $9.3 million to distributable earnings in its first full quarter. Byrne also noted, \"Our distributable earnings were $0.22 per fully converted share.\"</li>\n<li>Byrne reported that liquidity for the acquisition limited new loan originations early in the quarter, which led to a slight decline in core portfolio size. \"We originated approximately $304 million in new loan commitments...funded $196 million...and received $275 million in loan repayments,\" with the expectation that \"our core portfolio [will] return to its target size of at least $5 billion over the next few quarters.\"</li>\n<li>Byrne announced, \"We have resumed share repurchases in Q4,\" with 540,000 shares repurchased for $6 million through October 24 and $25.6 million remaining on the buyback allocation. The Board expanded authorization through December of next year.</li>\n<li>CFO, COO &amp; Treasurer Jerome Baglien stated, \"FBRT reported GAAP net income of $17.6 million or $0.13 per fully converted common share. Distributable earnings for the quarter were $26.7 million or $0.22 per fully converted share.\"</li>\n<li>Baglien explained that the new $1.1 billion CRE CLO will \"add an incremental $0.05 to $0.07 per share of quarterly earnings once this cash is deployed into new assets,\" and asset sales from the REO portfolio \"can contribute approximately $0.08 to $0.12 per share per quarter to distributable earnings over time.\"</li>\n<li>President Michael Comparato described the acquisition of NewPoint as making FBRT \"one of, if not the largest middle market lenders in the country with over 300 employees,\" highlighting strong origination activity and ongoing cross-selling opportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management expects the core portfolio to reach at least $5 billion over the next few quarters. Baglien detailed that the new CLO transaction \"should be an accretive liability for us for 3 to 5 years.\"</li>\n<li>Full year agency originations are expected to come in toward the upper end of initial guidance. Baglien also indicated, \"We continue to expect NewPoint to be accretive to GAAP earnings and book value per share in the first half of 2026 and accretive to distributable earnings in the second half of 2026.\"</li>\n<li>Comparato signaled an ongoing focus on integrating NewPoint and deploying capital, stating, \"We are now highly focused on playing offense. Our integration plan with NewPoint is on track, and we firmly believe FBRT has more tailwinds than headwinds.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>GAAP net income was $17.6 million or $0.13 per fully converted share. Distributable earnings reached $26.7 million or $0.22 per fully converted share, including $1.7 million of realized losses from a REO sale. Excluding this loss, distributable earnings were $0.23 per share.</li>\n<li>Book value at quarter end was $14.29 per fully converted share, with the decrease attributed to dividend under coverage and the NewPoint acquisition.</li>\n<li>NewPoint contributed $9.3 million to distributable earnings, with $19.7 million of MSR income and a servicing portfolio of $47.3 billion at quarter end.</li>\n<li>Core portfolio ended at $4.4 billion across 147 loans. Multifamily assets comprised 75% of the portfolio.</li>\n<li>Available liquidity was $522 million at quarter end, and net leverage was 2.55x.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Matthew Erdner, JonesTrading: Asked about origination volumes and drivers for higher volume in Q4. President Comparato responded that cross-selling and converting floating rate loans to CMBS contributed, and \"if we can execute where we stand today...Q4 will be a monster quarter for us in the CMBS group.\"</li>\n<li>Erdner also asked about alternative investments amid tight spreads. Comparato clarified, \"We are actively, actively originating in our core business...If we can find better returns with the same or better overall credit and liquidity profile, we're going to explore those things.\"</li>\n<li>Erdner asked Baglien about compensation and benefits expense. Baglien explained it will \"trend with volume...you might scale into a greater share in the second half of the year than the first half.\"</li>\n<li>Timothy D'Agostino, B. Riley Securities: Inquired about repayment pace. Baglien said repayments are \"relatively in line with what we've seen throughout the year.\"</li>\n<li>D'Agostino also asked about core portfolio target size. Comparato stated, \"We're targeting a stabilized portfolio...of between $5 billion and $5.5 billion.\"</li>\n<li>Christopher Muller, Citizens JMP Securities: Queried if NewPoint’s record quarter is repeatable. Comparato replied, \"I wouldn't use 1 quarter to extrapolate forward...this is probably a bit of an outlier.\"</li>\n<li>Muller followed up on GSE conservatorship and market impact. Comparato said, \"I'm still sceptical that this happens or happens quickly because I do think it's a very, very complicated web to untangle.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts focused on origination volumes, expense variability, and the sustainability of NewPoint's outperformance, with a generally neutral to slightly positive tone. They sought clarification on growth prospects, margin trends, and repayment pacing.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone in prepared remarks, emphasizing future growth, integration progress, and new capital deployment. In Q&amp;A, responses remained detailed and constructive, with Comparato reiterating confidence: \"We're just waking up every day, looking to find what we think are the best risk-adjusted returns.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone remained confident but more forward-looking, while analysts’ tone shifted from cautious to more constructive, especially regarding integration and growth projections.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The current quarter saw the completion and integration of the NewPoint acquisition, with a record origination quarter for NewPoint and a strong initial earnings contribution, compared to Q2 when the acquisition had just closed and integration was starting.</li>\n<li>Management resumed share repurchases and expanded the buyback authorization, a new development this quarter.</li>\n<li>Core portfolio size declined slightly in Q3 due to limited new originations, but management reaffirmed a $5 billion target, consistent with Q2 guidance.</li>\n<li>Both quarters highlighted a focus on reducing REO exposure, but Q3 included explicit details about realized losses and future contribution estimates from asset sales.</li>\n<li>Analyst questions in Q3 revolved around sustainability of origination volumes, expense variability, and the impact of the NewPoint acquisition, while Q2 focused more on initial integration steps, market spreads, and capital redeployment strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management noted that maintaining liquidity for the NewPoint acquisition limited new loan originations early in the quarter.</li>\n<li>Three new loans were added to the watch list, with one removed following full repayment.</li>\n<li>One multifamily watch list asset is expected to be a short sale, and the position was marked down by $2.3 million during the quarter.</li>\n<li>President Comparato acknowledged challenging market spreads and stated, \"Spreads on whole loan origination have tightened to levels that are less than compelling at the moment.\"</li>\n<li>Office loan exposure was reduced to $70 million, now only 1.6% of the portfolio, and management expects further reductions in Q4.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Franklin BSP Realty Trust delivered a transitional third quarter marked by strong NewPoint performance and initial integration benefits, modest core portfolio contraction, and a renewed focus on capital deployment and portfolio growth. Management outlined a clear path to expanding the core portfolio to at least $5 billion, enhanced by new financing capacity and disciplined risk management, while emphasizing ongoing share repurchases and expectations for further earnings contributions from both the NewPoint platform and legacy asset resolution in the coming quarters.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/fbrt/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

Clearly, having that growth to the north will continue to add value to this property.\"</li>\n<li>Analyst: \"Has management identified or received interest on additional opportunities to monetize some of the assets within the hospitality or leasing segments?\" Gonzalez: \"We're constantly evaluating all of our assets...it's an evaluation that's ongoing.\"</li>\n<li>Analyst: \"Significant uptick in lot sales at WindMark Beach...Is there an ability to expand the scale of the community in the future?\" Gonzalez: \"We have been selling a lot of home sites and our builder in WindMark has been selling a lot of homes. We still have quite a few to go in WindMark, and we also own surrounding properties that if the trend continues, we'll have opportunities to expand the program.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts focused on capital allocation, asset monetization, cash deployment, and recurring revenue sustainability, with a neutral to slightly positive tone and frequent requests for more aggressive buybacks.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident but measured tone, emphasizing discipline and flexibility, with Gonzalez stating, \"Having cash is a high-class problem.\" The tone was consistent with prior quarters, expressing optimism while reiterating caution regarding market conditions and capital allocation.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management showed continued confidence, with analysts pressing more for buyback acceleration and monetization of assets, while management sustained a steady and transparent tone.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue and net income growth rates accelerated in Q3, with specific emphasis on a \"63% growth in revenue and 130% growth in net income\" versus the prior year’s third quarter, compared to 16% revenue and 20% net income growth highlighted in Q2.</li>\n<li>Share repurchases increased to $24.9 million in the first 9 months versus $16.2 million through the first half, with 0 in the prior year.</li>\n<li>Dividend increase of 14% in Q3, whereas Q2 maintained prior dividend levels.</li>\n<li>Management’s tone remained steady, with a continued focus on recurring revenue streams and capital allocation flexibility.</li>\n<li>Analysts in Q3 were more focused on the pace of buybacks and asset sales, compared to Q2’s emphasis on growth and in-migration trends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited operational intensity and longer leasing cycles as reasons for not expanding in senior living assets.</li>\n<li>Asset sales will only occur at acceptable valuations, with Gonzalez stating, \"What we're not going to do is sell assets at a discount.\"</li>\n<li>Liquidity management and capital allocation will continue to be tailored to prevailing market and company conditions.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns around the pace of cash deployment and sustainability of high margins, but management reiterated a disciplined, flexible approach.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>The St. Joe Company reported substantial year-over-year growth in revenue and net income, driven by robust residential sales, record leasing and hospitality revenues, and successful asset monetization.

Third-quarter revenue came in at RMB 19.98 billion, translating to a 3% drop compared to the year-ago period.</p>\n<p>BYD has scaled up to become the world’s largest and fastest-growing producer of EVs, competing with Elon Musk’s Tesla.
