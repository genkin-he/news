Interim CEO Jacob Leach said that the top end of its growth range for 2026 \"is probably slightly below where the Street is today for our base case. Certainly, there are opportunities for us to outperform should they happen, things like expanded access and our ability to take share based on our innovation pipeline.\"</p>\n<p>Leach also addressed reported problems with the D7 product, which include the unit not working after setup, as well as Bluetooth connectivity and adhesive issues.</p>\n<p>He noted that the problems have been addressed, the number of complaints have stabilized, and he expects them to decrease. Resolving the problems is critical as DexCom will soon be doing a broad rollout of the latest model, the D7 15 Day. </p>\n<p>\"I've actually been out in the field recently talking to customers, spending quite a bit of time with both prescribers and those using our products and really listening and making sure that we're addressing all their concerns and understanding what they're experiencing,\" he said. \"And I am hearing from all of them that things have improved since those deployment challenges we experienced in the front half of the year. So we feel really good about where we're headed.\"</p>\n<p>DexCom boosted its 2025 revenue guidance to 4.630B-$4.650B from $4.6B-$4.625B prior.

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Charter Communications (CHTR) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Christopher Winfrey highlighted that \"we remained the fastest-growing mobile provider in the United States. We added nearly 500,000 Spectrum Mobile lines in the quarter and 2 million lines over the last 12 months, over 20% growth.\" Video customer losses improved to 70,000, described as \"less than 1/4 of last year's third quarter losses.\" He noted that third quarter Internet customer losses were in line with last year and that revenue was down about 1% year-over-year, driven by customer losses and a challenging political advertising comparison. \"Third quarter EBITDA declined by 1.5% year-over-year, essentially flat when excluding advertising,\" Winfrey added.</li>\n<li>Winfrey stated, \"We're leaving no stone unturned to drive customer and financial growth, including improved customer perception of our brand and products, growing mobile profitability and driving streaming video growth, all with the focus to drive connectivity revenue growth.\" He emphasized service and technology investments, including AI, and described new marketing approaches and offer expressions within the company's national pricing and packaging structure.</li>\n<li>Winfrey detailed product advancements, including the upcoming launch of Advanced WiFi Complete in early 2026 and the Spectrum App Store. He also announced partnerships with Amazon and Nexar and a new immersive video partnership with Apple for Lakers games via the Apple Vision Pro.</li>\n<li>CFO Jessica Fischer reported, \"Including residential and small business, we lost 109,000 Internet customers in the third quarter, in line with last year's results, but lower when adjusted to remove last year's impact from ACP-related disconnects.\" Fischer noted, \"In mobile, we added 493,000 lines with higher gross additions year-over-year, offset by disconnects on a larger base. Video customers declined by 70,000 versus a loss of 294,000 in 3Q of '24, with the improvement primarily driven by better connects year-over-year.\" She confirmed 52,000 net customer additions in the subsidized rural footprint, ongoing rural expansion, and the near completion of the BEAD bidding process.</li>\n<li>Fischer stated, \"Adjusted EBITDA declined by 1.5% year-over-year in the quarter and was essentially flat when excluding advertising.\" She also confirmed a decrease in programming costs by 6.5% and a 0.5% reduction in total operating expenses year-over-year.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fischer stated, \"We expect 2025 full year EBITDA growth to be flat or marginally positive year-over-year with higher underlying growth absent the impact of political advertising.\" She added, \"EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter will be pressured by at least as much as it was in the third quarter, given last year's political advertising strength and the same macro pressures we saw in the third quarter.\"</li>\n<li>Capital expenditures for 2025 are expected to reach approximately $11.5 billion, which Fischer said is \"lower than our original outlook of $12 billion, primarily as a result of some network evolution capital pushed into 2026.\" She affirmed that \"2025 is the peak capital year, even if by a small margin.\"</li>\n<li>Fischer reiterated, \"even including the impact of the Cox transaction and associated integration capital, we expect total combined company capital expenditures to decline in the first full calendar year post close.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fischer reported, \"Third quarter free cash flow totaled $1.6 billion, in line with prior year, given higher CapEx offset by lower cash taxes and a more favorable change in cable working capital tied to CPE spend, some of which will reverse in 4Q.\"</li>\n<li>Fischer stated, \"Third quarter cash taxes totaled $53 million, and we expect full year cash tax payments to total approximately $1 billion.\"</li>\n<li>The company finished the quarter with $95 billion in debt principal, a weighted average cost of debt at 5.2%, and annualized cash interest of $4.9 billion. Fischer disclosed, \"During the quarter, we repurchased 7.6 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units, totaling $2.2 billion at an average price of $292 per share.\"</li>\n<li>Fischer noted, \"As of the end of the third quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA increased sequentially to 4.15x and stood at 4.23x pro forma for the pending Liberty Broadband transaction.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Craig Moffett, MoffettNathanson LLC: Asked about broadband trends and improvement drivers. Winfrey replied that churn is better where there's a mobile relationship and more mobile lines per customer, and bundling reduces churn. He added, \"The challenge that we're facing right now isn't so much on the churn side... The challenge we have is the operating environment remains competitive with new competitors and the macro environment that hasn't gotten better.\"</li>\n<li>Benjamin Swinburne, Morgan Stanley: Asked about fourth quarter EBITDA guidance and competitive pricing. Fischer responded, \"A few of those offers impacted ARPU a bit more than we had anticipated without driving the additional sales that we expected. We're pulling them from the market as of the beginning of November.\" Winfrey said, \"Given this macro environment, we're not in a position to not pass through cost increases as they occur,\" and noted pricing discipline provides cushion.</li>\n<li>Vikash Harlalka, New Street Research: Asked about marketing strategies. Winfrey explained, \"These are just different marketing offer expressions to get to higher ARPU and higher margin per household, at the same time saving customers lots of money.\"</li>\n<li>Jessica Reif Cohen, BofA Securities: Asked about the Cox acquisition and improvements in video conversion and retention. Winfrey said, \"Our focus right now from a Cox perspective is a fewfold... Our goal here, it isn't to have positive video ads... but our goal is to make sure that we have a unique and differentiated product.\"</li>\n<li>Michael Rollins, Citi: Asked about cost savings and expanding the addressable market. Winfrey highlighted an $8 billion annual cost to serve and described significant ongoing investments in AI and new B2B partnerships.</li>\n<li>Peter Supino, Wolfe Research: Asked about debt structure and deleveraging. Fischer confirmed plans to move long-term target leverage to 3.5x to 4.0x post-Cox close, and said, \"If it's prudent for us to make a move, we will.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed on growth outlook, competitive pressures, and capital allocation, with a slightly negative tone focused on revenue and EBITDA headwinds, as well as the impact of new competitors.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident but cautious tone in prepared remarks, turning more defensive in Q&amp;A, especially around sales trends and pricing. Winfrey said, \"We're leaving no stone unturned to drive customer and financial growth,\" and \"we're not standing still.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, current management sentiment was more cautious, especially regarding near-term growth and competitive headwinds. Analyst skepticism increased, with more probing on macro challenges and execution risk.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Internet customer losses remained comparable quarter-over-quarter, while video losses improved from 80,000 in Q2 to 70,000 in Q3.</li>\n<li>Revenue shifted from slight growth in Q2 to a 1% year-over-year decline in Q3, with EBITDA moving from a 0.5% increase to a 1.5% decline. Free cash flow increased from $1 billion in Q2 to $1.6 billion in Q3.</li>\n<li>The company reiterated its commitment to capital discipline, but acknowledged tougher EBITDA growth prospects in Q4 versus earlier indications.</li>\n<li>Strategic priorities shifted slightly, with a greater emphasis on product bundling, digital marketing, and AI-driven cost efficiencies.</li>\n<li>Management struck a more cautious tone, particularly around macroeconomic pressures and competitive dynamics, while analysts intensified their focus on operational risks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited high competition for Internet customers, low move rates, increased mobile substitution, and expanded cellphone and fiber competition as risks.</li>\n<li>Fischer mentioned pressure on ARPU growth and the negative impact of certain promotional offers.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about growth sustainability, EBITDA pressure, and deleveraging in a challenging operating environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Charter Communications underscored its strategy of leveraging advanced products, improved marketing, and technology investments to offset a competitive and challenging macro environment. Management signaled that 2025 will be the peak year for capital spending and reaffirmed a shift toward free cash flow growth, even as near-term EBITDA and revenue face continued headwinds. The company remains focused on operational improvements, product innovation, and disciplined capital allocation to drive long-term shareholder value, with a particular emphasis on integrating the pending Cox transaction and scaling new service offerings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/chtr/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Arcosa, Inc. (ACA) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Antonio Carrillo, President and CEO, opened by highlighting \"Q3 was a record quarter for Arcosa. We delivered double-digit revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth with all 3 segments contributing to our strong results. Revenue increased 27% and adjusted EBITDA grew 51%, both excluding the impact of the divested steel components business.\" He attributed this performance to the ongoing portfolio optimization strategy and the contribution of the $1.2 billion Stavola acquisition, reporting, \"our record adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.8% was a 340 basis points improvement over the same period last year.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Carrillo emphasized the company's accelerated debt reduction, stating, \"we ended the quarter with a leverage ratio of 2.4x, putting us 2 quarters ahead of our stated plan to return to our 2 to 2.5x leverage target within 18 months of the Stavola acquisition.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Gail Peck, Chief Financial Officer, reported, \"third quarter revenues increased 46% and adjusted segment EBITDA increased 62%, which reflects record quarterly performance for the segment. Margin expanded by 300 basis points to 29.7%.\" She detailed that the aggregates business saw \"freight-adjusted revenues increased 28% and adjusted cash gross profit increased 38% during the quarter, expanding margin by 330 basis points.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Peck also noted, \"third quarter operating cash flow was $161 million, an increase of 19% year-over-year and up more than 150% sequentially,\" with free cash flow for the quarter at $134 million, up 25% year-over-year.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Carrillo stated, \"we have increased the midpoint of our 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance range and anticipated 32% year-over-year growth, reflecting strong accretion from Stavola as well as double-digit organic expansion.\" He added full-year 2025 revenue guidance has been tightened to a range of $2.86 billion to $2.91 billion and adjusted EBITDA to a range of $575 million to $585 million.</p></li>\n<li><p>For Construction Products, management \"remain[s] on track for high single-digit pricing growth in aggregates.\" While year-to-date volumes were up 7%, the company \"now expect[s] high single-digit volume growth, a slight step down from our prior guidance.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>In Engineered Structures, \"production in this facility is scheduled to begin in the second half of 2026. We expect our new galvanizing facility in Mexico to complete its first dip in the first quarter of 2026, which will improve our cost structure and enhance margin.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Revenue increased 27% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA grew 51%, both excluding divested steel components. Adjusted EBITDA margin reached 21.8%, an improvement of 340 basis points over last year.</p></li>\n<li><p>Free cash flow for the quarter was $134 million, with operating cash flow at $161 million, and leverage ratio at 2.4x net debt to adjusted EBITDA.</p></li>\n<li><p>Construction Products segment reported adjusted segment EBITDA of $150 million, with margin at 29.7%.

Barge backlog rose 16% year-to-date to $326 million.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Trey Grooms, Stephens: Asked for more detail on \"puts and takes around the full year revenue and EBITDA guidance adjustments\". Peck responded that the guidance adjustment reflects strong year-to-date performance and a \"very small slight step down\" in revenue due to softer organic construction volumes, while \"we did raise the midpoint about $10 million. We now see $580 million of EBITDA for the year.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Grooms followed up on production downtime in legacy aggregates. Carrillo replied, \"I think that's largely behind us,\" attributing past issues to unplanned equipment repairs.</p></li>\n<li><p>Julio Romero, Sidoti: Asked about aggregate pricing outlook for 2026. Carrillo indicated optimism, \"we're positive about where we're seeing demand, especially on the infrastructure side... Now that volume seems to be recovering, I think pricing should be something that we can continue to pass through to our customers.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Romero also asked about capital allocation. Carrillo said, \"my goal would be to try to get lower in the range of 2 to 2.5x leverage,\" while also focusing on bolt-on acquisitions and organic investments.</p></li>\n<li><p>Ian Zaffino, Oppenheimer: Inquired about wind tower orders and backlog acceleration. Carrillo explained, \"our base case scenario is that these 2 years will accelerate as we get closer to end of 2027,\" and discussed the strategic move to bring backlog forward to capture customer demand before tax credits expire.</p></li>\n<li><p>Garik Shmois, Loop Capital: Queried about barge replacement cycle. Carrillo asserted, \"barges need to be replaced, both tank and hopper... we are pricing our barges like that.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Analysts maintained a positive to slightly positive tone, focusing on guidance, capital allocation, and segment performance, often congratulating management on execution and inquiring about sustainability.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management's tone was confident and occasionally defensive when discussing production issues, but overall optimistic about end market trends and strategic positioning, using phrases such as, \"we are very good at building wind towers when we have a continued -- a very, very steady production cycle.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management expressed increased confidence, with fewer concerns about weather and more focus on growth and capital deployment.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Guidance language shifted from maintaining the midpoint to raising the midpoint of adjusted EBITDA guidance and tightening the revenue range.</p></li>\n<li><p>Strategic focus moved towards leveraging a stronger balance sheet for both organic and inorganic growth, while the previous quarter focused on integration and weather-related impacts.</p></li>\n<li><p>Analysts' questions evolved from weather and pricing headwinds to demand drivers, capital deployment, and sustainability of new margin levels.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management's sentiment improved, emphasizing execution, backlog visibility, and readiness for potential M&amp;A.</p></li>\n<li><p>Key metrics such as adjusted EBITDA growth, cash flow, and backlog all showed sequential improvements and heightened targets.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Management identified production downtime in the aggregates business due to unplanned equipment repairs but stated these issues have been addressed.</p></li>\n<li><p>Seasonal factors and weather dependency, especially in the Construction Products segment, remain a risk for fourth quarter performance.</p></li>\n<li><p>The company is monitoring the transition of industry tax credits in wind towers, with Carrillo describing the next two years as a period that could \"accelerate as we get closer to end of 2027.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Arcosa's third quarter results demonstrated strong revenue and EBITDA growth across all business segments, supported by portfolio optimization and the Stavola acquisition. Management raised the midpoint for 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $580 million, targeting 32% growth, while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation and expressing confidence in end market demand, backlog visibility, and long-term growth potential for core businesses.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/aca/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",
