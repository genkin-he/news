Under the deal, Plug expects to receive at least $132.5M from the sale of its interest in the Project Gateway site in New York, including land, infrastructure, and related assets, allowing it to unlock value while sharpening its focus on hydrogen production and fuel cell deployment.

Liquidity has improved following an equity raise and expected monetization of electricity rights, potentially extending the runway up to two years. While the electrolyzer segment is showing 30%–40% incremental contribution margins, the current scale remains insufficient to offset overall losses, keeping profitability and execution firmly in focus.</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Consensus EPS Estimates: -$0.10</li>\n<li>Consensus Revenue Estimates: $217.38M</li>\n<li>Earnings Insight: Plug Power has missed EPS estimates in 8 consecutive reports, exceeding revenue forecasts in just 3 of those quarters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Also reporting</strong>: Plug Power (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLUG\" title=\"Plug Power Inc.\">PLUG</a>), Riot Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RIOT\" title=\"Riot Platforms, Inc.\">RIOT</a>), Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NCLH\" title=\"Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\">NCLH</a>), MongoDB (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDB\" title=\"MongoDB, Inc.\">MDB</a>), Uniti Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UNIT\" title=\"Uniti Group Inc.\">UNIT</a>), StoneCo (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STNE\" title=\"StoneCo Ltd.\">STNE</a>), Senseonics Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SENS\" title=\"Senseonics Holdings, Inc.\">SENS</a>), Asana (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASAN\" title=\"Asana, Inc.\">ASAN</a>), Sturm Ruger &amp; Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RGR\" title=\"Sturm, Ruger &amp; Company, Inc.\">RGR</a>), AST SpaceMobile (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASTS\" title=\"AST SpaceMobile, Inc.\">ASTS</a>), and more.</p>\n<h2>Tuesday, March 3</h2>\n<h3>CrowdStrike (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD\" title=\"CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\">CRWD</a>)</h3>\n<p>Austin-based cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD\" title=\"CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\">CRWD</a>) is due to post its Q4 financial update after the bell on Tuesday, with investor focus squarely on growth durability and valuation. </p>\n<p>The company recently expanded its partnership with Microsoft ((MSFT)), enabling organizations to purchase CrowdStrike’s Falcon platform through the Microsoft Marketplace using existing Azure consumption commitments - a move that broadens distribution and deepens enterprise integration.</p>\n<p>Channel checks from Oppenheimer <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4552513-crowdstrike-reigns-among-security-vendors-as-palo-alto-sentinelone-improve-oppenheimer\">suggest</a> CrowdStrike continues to stand out, with strong partner sentiment and positive revisions to 2026 expectations.

He flagged concern around management’s guided 67% adjusted EBITDA margin for Q1, particularly given rising memory prices, and questioned whether the full-cost impact was reflected in guidance.

While Anthropic’s new AI tool threatens to steal a chunk of IBM’s $21.1B consulting revenue by automating the mapping of old COBOL code, it doesn’t look like this translated code will be able to run outside the mainframe or that someone will try to risk it and transition to the cloud. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>With features like internal redundancy and shared-everything memory, the z17 mainframe remains the only machine banks trust for zero-downtime transactions. Financially, IBM is a “cash cow” with a record $14.7B in free cash flow, but with $61.3B in debt and a modest 5% growth forecast, the jury is still out on whether its $12.5B GenAI business can progress fast enough to keep Anthropic away. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/the-techie\"><span>The Techie</span></a><span>: The market's visceral reaction to IBM (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM\" title=\"International Business Machines Corporation\">IBM</a>) this week is a classic case of shooting first and asking questions later, triggered by the realization that AI is accelerating faster than even the most aggressive forecasts. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>I don’t think the sudden panic over Anthropic’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANTHRO\" title=\"Anthropic\">ANTHRO</a>) ability to automate COBOL modernization is an overnight kill switch for a company deeply embedded in global financial infrastructure. Instead, it serves as a wake-up call that the traditional high-margin consulting model is being permanently repriced. IBM isn't necessarily obsolete, but it is now in a high-stakes race to prove it can be the architect of this new automated world rather than its first major casualty.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The most important trend for the rest of 2026 is the democratization of software. As tools like Anthropic’s Claude Code become more capable, the moat for legacy software companies is shrinking. We are moving into an era where the value isn't in writing the code but in owning the data and the client relationship.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/joseph-parrish\"><span>Joseph Parrish</span></a><span>: IBM (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM\" title=\"International Business Machines Corporation\">IBM</a>) will continue to innovate, which recent years have already proved. Generating $15B in cash now, they can just buy back shares easily on the downside. I don't give much credence to speculative AI doom and gloom.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>IBM works with big customers who are risk-averse and will not lightly drop a working product. Anthropic (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANTHRO\" title=\"Anthropic\">ANTHRO</a>) merely highlights the same path that IBM can take as they are already evolving their own products with AI.</span><strong></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/screeners/9409aed046-Top-IT-Consulting-and-Other-Services-Stocks\"><span>Top IT Consulting &amp; Other Services Stocks</span></a></li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/screeners/9409aed042-Top-Systems-Software-Stocks\"><span>Top Systems Software Stocks</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
