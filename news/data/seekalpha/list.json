Discovery (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBD\" title=\"Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.\">WBD</a>)</strong> after the media giant's board deemed a sweetened, all<span>‑</span>company takeover offer from <strong>Paramount Skydance (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSKY\" title=\"Paramount Skydance Corporation\">PSKY</a>) </strong>as \"superior.\" The streaming company said a higher price for Warner Bros. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBD\" title=\"Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.\">WBD</a>) was no longer financially attractive. The revised Paramount (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSKY\" title=\"Paramount Skydance Corporation\">PSKY</a>) offer was at a purchase price of $31.00 per share in cash, a one-dollar increase from its earlier bid, which valued the company at around $108B.</p>\n<p><strong>Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>)</strong> shares fell nearly 5.5% Thursday, their worst day since April 16, despite posting blowout earnings. The performance highlights the market’s heightened sensitivity to earnings from large-cap technology companies, particularly those tied to artificial intelligence and data center demand.</p>\n<p><strong>Block (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XYZ\" title=\"Block, Inc.\">XYZ</a>)</strong> announced on Thursday that it's slashing its headcount by more than 40% because intelligent technology means fewer people can do more. The company's stock jumped 24% with the news. Meanwhile, the company issued strong guidance for 2026 and the first quarter of the year, and Q4 earnings merely matched the Wall Street consensus.</p>\n<p><strong>IBM (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM\" title=\"International Business Machines Corporation\">IBM</a>)</strong> plunged more than 13% in a single session on Monday, marking the company’s largest one<span>‑</span>day percentage drop since October 2000. The sharp sell<span>‑</span>off was triggered by investor concerns that Anthropic<span>’</span>s Claude Code tool can automate modernization of COBOL, a legacy programming language heavily tied to IBM<span>’</span>s mainframe business.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Micro Devices (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>)</strong> announced a deal with <strong>Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>)</strong> to deploy up to 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct chips to power Meta’s next generation of AI infrastructure. The companies said the multi-year, multi-generation agreement expands their existing strategic partnership and aligns roadmaps across silicon, systems, and software to deliver AI platforms purpose-built for Meta’s workloads.</p>\n<p><strong>Novo Nordisk (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVO\" title=\"Novo Nordisk A/S\">NVO</a>)</strong> shares fell over 15% on Monday after the company’s next-generation obesity drug CagriSema delivered less weight loss than Eli Lilly’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY\" title=\"Eli Lilly and Company\">LLY</a>) competing treatment in a phase 3 trial, raising new concerns about its sales potential. Patients taking a standard dose of CagriSema lost 20.2% of their body weight after 84 weeks, compared with 23.6% for Lilly’s tirzepatide.</p>\n<p><strong>Hims &amp; Hers Health (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HIMS\" title=\"Hims &amp; Hers Health, Inc.\">HIMS</a>)</strong> fell after the telehealth company’s guidance fell below the consensus. The telemedicine provider sees Q1 revenue of $600-$625M. Consensus is $652.59M. For full-year 2026, revenue is projected at $2.7B-$2.9B. Consensus is $2.71B.</p>\n<p><strong>First Solar (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FSLR\" title=\"First Solar, Inc.\">FSLR</a>)</strong> fell after the company reported a 2026 net sales forecast which missed the average analyst estimate. The company projected full-year revenues of $4.9B-$5.2B, likely below the $5.2B total for 2025 and far below the $6.16B FactSet analyst consensus estimate, on a volume of 17.0-18.2 GW of modules sold after selling 17.5 GW of modules in FY 2025.</p>\n<p><strong>IonQ (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IONQ\" title=\"IonQ, Inc.\">IONQ</a>) </strong>shares rose after the quantum computing company reported fourth-quarter results that were above Wall Street's estimates. For the period ending Dec. 31, IonQ said it lost an adjusted $0.20 per share as revenue soared 429% to come in at $61.89M. Analysts had expected the company to lose an adjusted $0.23 per share on $40.3M in revenue.</p>\n<p><strong>CoreWeave (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWV\" title=\"CoreWeave, Inc.\">CRWV</a>)</strong> fell after the AI infrastructure software company reported a bigger-than-expected loss and boosted capital expenditures. For the quarter ended December 31, the hyperscaler reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.89 versus<span> the consensus estimate loss per share of $0.72. For 2026, CapEx is expected in the range of $30B to $35B, with the company planning to double active power capacity to more than 1.7 gigawatts by year-end.</span><span></span></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Throughout his <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558958-berkshire-hathaways-abel-commits-to-uphold-unique-culture-buffett-munger-built\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"first annual letter\">first annual letter</a> to shareholders, Berkshire Hathaway (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.B\" title=\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\">BRK.B</a></span>) (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.A\" title=\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\">BRK.A</a></span>) CEO Greg Abel reinforced the company's long-standing culture of making investment decisions wisely. Examples include reining back growth in insurance underwriting to maintain profit margins and refraining from expanding its utilities business to meet AI demand if it's not going to provide the appropriate payoff to shareholders. He also highlighted the need to improve operating margins at its BNSF rail operations. Here are the main takeaways in Abel's discussion of the company's businesses.</p>\n<h2>Insurance</h2>\n<p>Geico: The company's rate increases from late 2022 through 2024 have restored margins but have led to lower retention, Abel pointed out. \"Restoring retention while maintaining underwriting discipline will take time,\" he said. The division is also investing in technology to improve efficiency and service while keeping its position as the industry's low-cost provider, he added.</p>\n<p>Other primary property &amp; casualty business: Additional capital entering the market has led to lower pricing or decelerating rate increases in some important lines. \"We have always prioritized underwriting discipline over volume, and as pricing became less attractive, our premium growth plateaued,\" Abel said. Those headwinds are expected to continue in 2026 \"and potentially beyond.\"</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.B\" title=\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\">BRK.B</a>) reinsurance operations are expected to write less reinsurance premium, primarily due to similar headwinds as the primary P&amp;C business. Increased capital flowing into the market, along with a more benign reinsured catastrophe loss burden in 2025, has led to significant price declines in property reinsurance, he said. </p>\n<p>The company's insurance business will remain patient because of Berkshire's structural strengths, he added. The company's insurance float — the capital it holds to pay future losses and is invested for Berkshire's benefit — was at $176B at the end of 2025, up from $171B at the end of 2024.</p>\n<h3>Other operating businesses</h3>\n<p>BNSF: The rail division is focusing on improving its operating margin. In 2025, it widened to 34.5% from 32.0% in 2024 and is modestly above its five-year average. Each one percentage point improvement in operating margin equals ~$230M of incremental operating cash flow to its owners. \"More progress is needed to translate operational improvements into stronger financial results,\" Abel said in the letter. \"The team recognizes the significance of this opportunity, and we will be disappointed if we do not deliver a substantial improvement over the next few years.\"</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway Energy ((BHE)): The company prides itself on offering value to customers in the markets it serves, averaging 24% below the national retail electric rate level. Abel points out that infrastructure built for hyperscalers and data centers, alluding to burgeoning energy demand for AI, must be paid for by customers and reflects risk to step-changes in long-term demand. But, like Berkshire's other businesses, BHE won't focus on growth for growth's sake alone. \"BHE will pursue this incremental growth and invest our shareholders’ capital only when those risks and rewards are appropriately balanced,\" Abel wrote.</p>\n<p>He also said BHE is working on programs to mitigate wildfire risk and is taking responsibility when warranted. \"When a BHE utility is responsible for a wildfire, it has acknowledged that responsibility, including PacifiCorp’s settlements related primarily to the 2020 Labor Day fires,\" he said. At the same time, it won't allow the company to be used as “deep pockets” to pay for damage that it didn't cause. \"Where responsibility does not exist, it ((BHE)) will continue to seek judicial relief,\" Abel said.</p>\n<h3><strong>Equity portfolio</strong></h3>\n<p>Some 65% of Berkshire's equity portfolio is in five companies —  Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), American Express (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXP\" title=\"American Express Company\">AXP</a>), Coca-Cola (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO\" title=\"The Coca-Cola Company\">KO</a>),  Bank of America (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAC\" title=\"Bank of America Corporation\">BAC</a>), and Chevron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX\" title=\"Chevron Corporation\">CVX</a>) — down from 71% in 2024. \"This concentrated approach will continue, with limited activity in these holdings, though we may significantly adjust a holding if we see fundamental changes in its long-term economic prospects,\" Abel wrote. Its criteria for its investments in Japan are comparable to its major U.S. holdings \"in importance and long-term value creation opportunity.\" </p>\n<p>Together, those positions at year-end totaled $194B in market value, or almost two-thirds of its $297.8B equity securities portfolio, providing combined dividends of $2.5B and yielding 10% on their original cost basis of $24.5B, Abel pointed out.</p>\n<p>Abel also called out Berkshire's investment in Kraft Heinz (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KHC\" title=\"The Kraft Heinz Company\">KHC</a>) as disappointing. \"Even after considering the preferred equity component in our original Heinz investment, our return has been well short of adequate,\" he <a href=\"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2025ltr.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"wrote\">wrote</a>.</p>\n<p>Responsibility for the equity portfolio's performance ultimately lies with Abel. But he noted that Ted Wechsler manages ~6% of Berkshire's investments, including a portion of the portfolio formerly managed by Todd Combs. \"Ted’s impact extends beyond these investments, as he continues to play a broader role in assessing significant opportunities, providing valuable input on our businesses, and supporting Berkshire in various other ways,\" Abel wrote.</p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
