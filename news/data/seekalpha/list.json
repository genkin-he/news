            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Ingram Micro Holding Corporation (INGM) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>CEO Paul Bay highlighted that \"the third quarter was strong with revenues of $12.6 billion, up 7.2% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.72, at the high end of our guidance despite a small impact from the ransomware incident in July.\" He emphasized rapid recovery from the incident and pointed to market share gains and expanding momentum for the Xvantage digital platform, which is being deployed globally.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bay stated, \"Enterprise sales remained strong and our SMB customer category achieved a third straight quarter of sequential growth, which is encouraging.\" He noted that client and endpoint solutions delivered another solid quarter, while advanced solutions were down slightly year-over-year, but servers and storage posted strong double-digit gains. Networking growth was modest, driven by increased AI proof-of-concept activity.</p></li>\n<li><p>The CEO discussed the company's multiyear plan to build an AI ecosystem, emphasizing investments in the Xvantage platform and the Enable AI program. He said, \"In the third quarter, IDA contributed hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental revenue. We also had rapid international adoption of IDA with IDA-driven revenue with non-U.S. operations growing by more than 100% in the quarter.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Bay announced the launch of their first enterprise-grade AI agent, Sales Briefing Assistant, built with the Xvantage AI Factory and powered by Google's Gemini large language model, describing it as \"a new standard for intelligence: scalable sales enablement in the enterprise.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>CFO Michael Zilis stated, \"We had a strong third quarter with results that either exceeded or hit the top end of each of our guidance ranges despite the impact of the July ransomware incident.\" Zilis detailed that the incident's total impact was within a tighter range of 1% to 1.5% of net sales and $0.02 to $0.03 per share.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Zilis provided Q4 2025 guidance: \"We are guiding net sales of $14 billion to $14.35 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of more than 6% at the midpoint. We expect fourth quarter gross profit of $935 million to $990 million, which would represent gross margins of roughly 6.8% at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.95 per diluted share.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>The guidance reflects consistent trends in sales mix across products, customers, and geographies, with expectations of continued SMB strength and robust cloud growth.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Q3 net sales were $12.60 billion, up 7.2% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Client and endpoint solutions grew nearly 13% on an FX-neutral basis. Advanced solutions sales declined by 4.5%, while cloud revenues dropped 4%, but excluding divestitures, cloud net revenues increased low single digits year-over-year.</p></li>\n<li><p>Gross profit was $870 million compared to $845 million last year, and gross margins improved sequentially by 34 basis points. Operating expenses were $646 million, or 5.13% of net sales, with $5.5 million in divestiture-related losses and $3.5 million in restructuring costs.</p></li>\n<li><p>Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $342 million. Non-GAAP net income rose 6% year-over-year to $169 million. Net working capital was $4.9 billion, and adjusted free cash flow was an outflow of $110 million, which Zilis noted was better than typical Q3 seasonal norms.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Ruplu Bhattacharya, BofA Securities: Asked about margin trends and the impact of SMB versus large enterprise mix. Zilis answered, \"what's implied in our guidance from a growth perspective is client and endpoint probably more in the mid-single digits... advanced solutions growing in the lower single digits and cloud growing mid- to upper single digits.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Bhattacharya followed up on inventory and free cash flow. Zilis responded, \"we should see a solid cash flow quarter in Q4.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Maya Neuman, Morgan Stanley: Inquired about the hardware cycle for PCs and servers. Bay said, \"we're in the back half or the later innings of the PC refresh. And if you look at server, that was a very good performance for us in the quarter within our advanced solutions.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Neuman also asked about pull-forward spend amid component cost inflation. Bay replied, \"No, we haven't had any of those conversations at this point in time in terms of pull forwards or from a pricing perspective.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>David Paige Papadogonas, RBC Capital Markets: Asked about Xvantage benefits. Bay explained, \"Enterprise is using it for different reasons than SMB. SMB Is where they can really manage their whole business.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Papadogonas questioned AI-powered PCs extending the cycle. Bay said, \"probably 25% of our PC shipments today, refresh, is an AI PC. So that's still a low percentage... we'll know more kind of at the beginning of next year.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Logan Katzman, Raymond James: Queried about a potential budget flush at year-end. Zilis said, \"that is part of the reason we typically see a seasonal pop in revenues is budgeting cycles in Q4.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Alek Valero, Loop Capital: Asked about catalysts over the next 4 to 6 quarters. Bay highlighted, \"it's around services that the partners are continuing to build out... it's around AI... and then security kind of wrapped around everything.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Analysts focused on margin sustainability, hardware cycle timing, Xvantage's impact, and AI-driven opportunities, with a generally positive but probing tone.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management maintained a confident tone, frequently reinforcing guidance and the positive impact of strategic initiatives, with Bay stating, \"we are set up for a solid Q4.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Compared to the previous quarter, both management and analysts displayed increased confidence, especially regarding SMB growth and AI initiatives.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The current quarter saw a more confident outlook, with guidance for net sales and EPS higher than previous ranges. Management emphasized the AI ecosystem, the global scaling of Xvantage, and accelerating SMB growth as new highlights.</p></li>\n<li><p>Analysts shifted focus from recovery post-ransomware in Q2 to structural growth drivers in Q3, particularly AI, Xvantage, and SMB momentum.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management tone was more upbeat, referencing successful mitigation of the ransomware impact and the tangible benefits of strategic investments.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Management discussed the July ransomware incident, quantifying its impact and highlighting rapid operational recovery.</p></li>\n<li><p>Zilis noted that advanced solutions and cloud segments had some softness or mixed results, attributing some to noncore divestitures or project timing.</p></li>\n<li><p>Analysts raised questions about margin mix, inventory management, and potential for pull-forward demand, with management offering clear responses and mitigation strategies.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Ingram Micro's Q3 2025 performance reflected strong revenue growth and robust execution in the face of disruption, supported by continued investment in digital and AI-driven platforms such as Xvantage. The company enters Q4 with upgraded guidance and high confidence, citing expanding SMB momentum, ongoing AI ecosystem development, and effective cost management as key drivers for future growth.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ingm/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p>Stock futures saw modest gains early Friday, on the last trading day of October, driven by investor enthusiasm over generally positive earnings reports from big tech companies.</p>\n<p>Here are some of Friday's biggest stock movers:</p>\n<h2>Biggest stock gainers</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Amazon (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a></span>)<span style=\"color: green;\"> +13%</span></strong><span style=\"color: green;\"> </span>- Shares advanced after delivering a strong Q3 beat, with EPS of $1.95 topping estimates by $0.37 and revenue rising 13% Y/Y to $180.2B, driven by solid growth across online and physical stores, third-party seller services, subscription revenue, and a standout 20% Y/Y increase in AWS sales to $33.01B; ad services also exceeded expectations at $17.7B. While operating income of $17.42B and a 9.7% operating margin missed forecasts due to heavier spending, management emphasized an aggressive ramp-up in AWS and AI capacity, noting AWS power capacity has doubled since 2022 and is set to double again by 2027, with full-year cash CapEx expected to be ~$125B in 2025 and rising further in 2026.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Western Digital (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WDC\" title=\"Western Digital Corporation\">WDC</a></span>) <span style=\"color: green;\">+10%</span></strong><span style=\"color: green;\"> </span>- Shares jumped after the storage company posted strong FQ1 results with revenue up 27% Y/Y and issued guidance well ahead of expectations, driven by ongoing demand for AI-related storage solutions. For FQ2, WDC expects adjusted EPS of ~$1.88 plus or minus $0.15 (vs. $1.74 est.) and revenue of $2.8B–$3.0B (midpoint $2.9B vs. $2.83B est.), with gross margins projected at 44%–45%. The company also raised its quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.125 per share, payable Dec. 18.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Twilio (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TWLO\" title=\"Twilio Inc.\">TWLO</a></span>) <span style=\"color: green;\">+7%</span></strong> - Shares popped after reporting Q3 results and guidance that exceeded expectations. The company repurchased $349.8M of stock in the quarter as part of its $2B buyback program, with ~$1.3B remaining. For Q4, Twilio guided adjusted EPS to $1.17–$1.22 (vs. $1.14 est.) and revenue to $1.31B–$1.32B (vs. $1.28B est.), implying ~9.5%–10.5% Y/Y growth. It also raised its full-year outlook, now expecting FY2025 revenue growth of 12.4%–12.6% (previously 10%–11%) and higher free cash flow of $920M–$930M. However, adjusted operating income guidance was lowered to $400M–$410M (from $850M–$875M), suggesting continued reinvestment and margin pressures.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Coinbase (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COIN\" title=\"Coinbase Global, Inc.\">COIN</a></span>)<span style=\"color: green;\"> +6%</span></strong> - Shares gained after the firm reported Q3 results that topped expectations, driven by a rebound in trading volumes and lower sequential expenses. The company also guided Q4 subscription and services revenue to $710M–$790M (midpoint ~$750M vs. ~$767M est.), expects transaction expenses to run in the mid-teens as a percentage of net revenue, and projects tech &amp; development plus G&amp;A expenses of $925M–$975M (midpoint ~$950M).</li>\n<li>Apple (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a></span>) +3% - Shares soared after delivering better-than-expected FQ4 results, even though iPhone revenue ($49.0B vs. $50.3B est.) and Greater China sales ($14.5B vs. $16.4B est.) came in light. CEO Tim Cook said FQ1 revenue is expected to increase 10%–12%, translating to $136.7B to $139.2B, above the $131.82B consensus, with iPhone returning to double-digit growth and China expected to rebound. He also reiterated that Apple will roll out its AI-enhanced Siri next year, with broader AI integration to follow.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Biggest stock losers</h2>\n<ul><li>\n<strong>Roku (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROKU\" title=\"Roku, Inc.\">ROKU</a></span>) <span style=\"color: red;\">-6%</span></strong> - Shares plunged after the company reported a mixed Q3 and issued guidance that only slightly topped expectations. For Q4, the company forecast revenue of ~$1.35B and gross profit of ~$575M, both just above consensus, while adjusted EBITDA guidance of ~$395M also came in modestly higher.</li></ul>\n</body></html>",
