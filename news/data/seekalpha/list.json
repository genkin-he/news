            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Hudson Pacific Properties (HPP) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Victor Coleman, Chairman &amp; CEO, shared that \"2025 was a breakthrough year for Hudson Pacific. We didn't just position the company for a return to earnings growth. We fundamentally transformed our capital structure and significantly enhanced our operating efficiency.\" He highlighted nearly $330 million in strategic asset sales and over $2 billion in capital transactions, which extended the maturity runway and doubled liquidity. The company delivered $26 million in G&amp;A and interest expense savings and locked in $25 million of annualized expense savings at Quixote. Coleman emphasized, \"We delivered our strongest leasing performance since 2019, signing more than 2.2 million square feet of office leases across our West Coast portfolio.\"</li>\n<li>Strategic priorities for 2026 include driving occupancy growth, eliminating Quixote's earnings drag by year-end, and maintaining capital discipline. Asset sales are set to continue with a target of $200 million to $300 million in 2026, focusing on FFO-accretive transactions and de-leveraging. \"We are sharpening our focus on what we do better than anyone else: owning and operating highly selective office and studio assets in only the best locations,\" said Coleman.</li>\n<li>Mark Lammas, President, reported, \"We signed 518,000 square feet of leases, driving our Office portfolio occupancy to 76.3%, up 40 basis points sequentially.\" The office leasing pipeline increased to 2.3 million square feet, up 15% year-over-year, and tours rose more than 50%.</li>\n<li>Harout Diramerian, Chief Financial Officer, noted, \"Total revenues were $256 million compared to $209.7 million in the prior year, driven by Element LA lease termination fee.\" G&amp;A declined by 33% to $13 million, and FFO excluding specified items was $13.6 million or $0.21 per diluted share. He stated, \"We reduced our share of net debt by 22% and debt to undepreciated book value improved 680 basis points to 31.9%. Cash more than doubled to $138 million and undrawn revolver capacity increased to $795 million, giving us total liquidity of $934 million.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Full-year FFO guidance for 2026 is set at $0.96 to $1.06 per diluted share. Diramerian projected, \"We anticipate slightly lower FFO in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter 2025, followed by steady sequential growth throughout the year as our leasing pipeline converts to cash flow.\"</li>\n<li>Annual average in-service office occupancy guidance is between 80% and 82%, with expectations that year-end occupancy will exceed this range. Guidance assumes completion of a third lease with the City and County of San Francisco at 1455 Market by midyear, with further occupancy gains weighted to the fourth quarter.</li>\n<li>Same-store property cash NOI growth is forecasted at negative 1.75% to negative 0.75%, reflecting improvement versus 2025 as office occupancy ramps up and studio NOI growth offsets near-term pressure.</li>\n<li>Asset sales of $200 million to $300 million are targeted for 2026, prioritizing FFO-accretive transactions and further deleveraging.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Total revenues reached $256 million, up from $209.7 million in the prior year, primarily due to the Element LA lease termination fee.</li>\n<li>G&amp;A expenses were reduced to $13 million from $19.5 million, reflecting substantial cost improvements.</li>\n<li>FFO excluding specified items was $13.6 million or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to $15.5 million or $0.74 per diluted share in the prior year, impacted by noncash Quixote impairment and the Element LA lease termination fee net of transaction costs.</li>\n<li>Same-store cash NOI was $84.8 million compared to $94.3 million in the prior year, due to lower average office occupancy.</li>\n<li>Cash position more than doubled to $138 million, with total liquidity at $934 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Blaine Heck, Wells Fargo, asked about the Quixote write-down and potential sale. Coleman responded, \"Quixote, we're looking to manage that business down. So it will be a flat business by the end of the year...we'll evaluate what our alternatives are going to be with that asset.\"</li>\n<li>Heck also inquired about the Hollywood Media Portfolio CMBS maturity. Coleman stated, \"We're unable to just discuss specifics over our loan extension negotiations because currently today, there's ongoing dialogue, and we're focused on the best outcome for us and our shareholders.\"</li>\n<li>Alexander Goldfarb, Piper Sandler, asked about leasing costs and liquidity; Lammas responded, \"What you see is you peak out on the line balance at about $160 million...and that's without assuming any asset sales of any kind. So we never even get sort of -- we have more than ample liquidity to just get the portfolio into the low 90s.\"</li>\n<li>Richard Anderson, Cantor Fitzgerald, questioned the Quixote wind down and office expiration retention. Coleman said, \"We're evaluating which are the obligations that we want to get out of,\" and Suazo added, \"tenants are engaging much earlier and with more conviction and more confidence in what the requirement is.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts focused on liquidity, asset sales, Quixote's future, leasing pipelines, and the timing of occupancy gains. The tone was probing but generally constructive, seeking clarity on execution and future risks.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and direct tone, especially in prepared remarks, with statements such as \"we're not hoping for a recovery. We're already capturing it.\" Some defensiveness appeared in Q&amp;A around Quixote and asset sale specifics.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both management and analysts showed increased confidence, with management emphasizing execution and analysts probing for deeper details on strategic moves and risk mitigation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The current quarter introduced reinstated full-year FFO guidance, a return not seen in recent quarters, reflecting increased management confidence in forecasting.</li>\n<li>A shift was observed in capital structure focus, with substantial disposals and capital transactions nearly doubling liquidity and materially reducing debt.</li>\n<li>Leasing activity and tours accelerated, with a 15% year-over-year increase in the pipeline and a 50% increase in tours, compared to steady but lower growth last quarter.</li>\n<li>Management's tone was more assertive on capturing market recovery, while analysts remained focused on execution, risk, and valuation, especially regarding Quixote and asset sales.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The noncash impairment write-down of Quixote and its ongoing earnings drag remain key concerns, with management planning to \"eliminate Quixote's earnings drag by year-end.\"</li>\n<li>Potential asset sales and their impact on FFO and leverage are being closely watched, as are negotiations regarding the Hollywood Media Portfolio loan maturity in August 2026.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised questions about office leasing retention, the impact of AI on tenant demand, and the ongoing uncertainty in studio operations.</li>\n<li>Exposure to software tenants potentially affected by AI is estimated at 1.5 to 2.5% of ABR, with ongoing monitoring by management.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Hudson Pacific Properties emphasized the transformation of its capital structure, a substantial increase in liquidity, and enhanced operating efficiency in 2025. With reinstated full-year FFO guidance, targeted asset sales, and a focus on driving occupancy and NOI growth, the company signaled confidence in its ability to realize sequential earnings growth through 2026 and beyond. The strategic wind-down of Quixote and the prioritization of FFO-accretive transactions stand out as pivotal moves as management aims to solidify a best-in-class office and studio portfolio in premier West Coast locations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/hpp/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Playtika Holding Corp. (PLTK) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Robert Antokol, Co-Founder and CEO, highlighted a strong Q4 finish and ongoing strategic shift: \"In Q4, we delivered $678.8 million of revenue and $201.4 million of adjusted EBITDA, driven by D2C growth, our pivot to casual and super player results. Here is the main point. We are building a balanced set of assets. Every year, more revenues comes from long-life casual games with broad reach. And D2C is now core to how we run the business.\" </li>\n<li>Antokol indicated SuperPlay's rapid growth, stating: \"SuperPlay delivered record revenues in Q4 with Disney Solitaire up 21.4% quarter-over-quarter and now our second largest game in the portfolio. We see improvements in Dice Dreams and continuous growth in Domino's Dreams. SuperPlay's growth this year is nothing short of amazing.\"</li>\n<li>He emphasized a disciplined capital allocation approach: \"We act from position of strength. We focus on returns, relocating spend and generating cash.\"</li>\n<li>Craig Abrahams, President &amp; CFO, remarked: \"Q4 reflects the strength of our model and a mix shift that is now clear in the results. We came in ahead of our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance, set another D2C record and saw outstanding momentum from SuperPlay. This is now the third straight year we have met or exceeded our adjusted EBITDA guidance, reflecting the strength and consistency of our operating model.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Abrahams detailed 2026 guidance: \"Our guidance for full year 2026 is as follows. Revenue of $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $730 million to $770 million, capital expenditures of $80 million and an effective tax rate of 30%. We also expect our marketing spend to be weighted toward the first half of the year, particularly the first quarter, which we expect to result in lower adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter and higher adjusted EBITDA in subsequent quarters.\"</li>\n<li>The company is suspending its quarterly dividend to preserve flexibility and direct capital to the highest return uses, while keeping share repurchases available within the capital allocation framework.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Q4 revenue was $678.8 million, up 0.6% sequentially and up 4.4% year-over-year.</li>\n<li>Net loss was $309.3 million compared to net income of $39.1 million in Q3 and a $16.7 million loss in Q4 2024, primarily due to the noncash impact of remeasuring contingent consideration related to the SuperPlay earn-out.</li>\n<li>Adjusted net income was $89 million, compared to $65.8 million in Q3 and $27 million in Q4 2024.</li>\n<li>Adjusted EBITDA was $201.4 million, down 7.4% sequentially and up 9.5% year-over-year.</li>\n<li>D2C revenue reached $250.1 million, growing 19.5% sequentially and 43.2% year-over-year, representing 36.8% of total revenues in Q4.</li>\n<li>SuperPlay generated about $573 million of revenue for the full year, a 67.5% increase from the $342 million baseline tied to the earnout.</li>\n<li>Cash, cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits stood at $820.2 million at year-end.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Aaron Lee, Macquarie Research: Asked about AI's role in the business and workforce reduction. Antokol responded, \"We see the AI opportunity as a new platform. We see something that can grow our business. We are very excited.\"</li>\n<li>Lee then inquired about M&amp;A appetite. Abrahams answered, \"M&amp;A has always been a core part of our growth strategy. SuperPlay has been a tremendous transaction for us. We plan to continue to invest aggressively in growing that within the constraints of the earn-out.\"</li>\n<li>Eric Handler, ROTH Capital: Queried about incentives for D2C transition. Antokol replied, \"The D2C become one of our biggest part of growth, cash flow growth in the last few years... we're giving a better experience to the users.\"</li>\n<li>Christopher Schoell, UBS: Asked about 2026 guidance assumptions for Slotomania and social casino, and D2C mix target. Abrahams explained, \"Our business is now 74% casual, and that continues to be the fastest growth part of the business driven by SuperPlay... Our previous long-term target was 40% of revenue. We'll continue to keep that just given all of the various policy changes in the background.\"</li>\n<li>Matthew Cost, Morgan Stanley: Asked about Disney Solitaire's trajectory and D2C's impact on gross margins. Abrahams noted, \"Disney Solitaire is off to a great start to 2026. There's a meaningful investment in marketing dollars in the first quarter... it's one of the best ROIs we have within the portfolio.\" Tae Lee added, \"You're seeing the benefit in lower platform fees in revenue from an increased DTC mix, but that is offset by increased amortization coming from past acquisition.\"</li>\n<li>Jason Bazinet, Citigroup: Asked about contingent consideration and SuperPlay earn-out triggers. Abrahams clarified, \"The EBITDA is in line with -- in order to pay the earn-out in year 1 was less than $10 million.\"</li>\n<li>William Lampen, BTIG: Asked about D2C penetration and marketing budget flexibility. Abrahams stated, \"We have broad penetration of DTC across the portfolio. There are constraints around super play in that they're under an earn-out... at some point, that will have to moderate to ensure that they're able to drive margins into that 5% or 10% or greater from an EBITDA perspective.\"</li>\n<li>Douglas Creutz, TD Cowen: Asked about Jackpot Tour's status. Antokol responded, \"We are still checking the KPIs. I can say that we are not sure 100%. We're going to open it strongly in the coming few weeks.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed management on forward growth drivers, D2C transition, and the impact of AI and capital allocation, with a neutral to slightly positive tone, focusing on specifics of execution and future growth levers.</li>\n<li>Management's sentiment was confident in prepared remarks and maintained composure during Q&amp;A, emphasizing discipline and strategic clarity. Phrases such as \"We are very excited\" and \"We plan to continue to invest aggressively\" signal confidence, while responses around Jackpot Tour and marketing flexibility were more measured, indicating some caution.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone remained confident but was more assertive about the business mix shift and capital allocation discipline, while the analysts' tone stayed focused on execution and strategic priorities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The company increased full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2026, with more detail on mix shift toward casual games and D2C.</li>\n<li>Dividend suspension marks a strategic shift to prioritize flexibility for investments and obligations such as SuperPlay's earn-out.</li>\n<li>D2C revenue and penetration saw significant sequential and year-over-year gains, now approaching 40% of total revenue, a target reiterated from the prior quarter.</li>\n<li>SuperPlay's contribution to revenue growth and portfolio diversification was emphasized more strongly this quarter.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone, more explicitly focused on returns and portfolio optimization, while analysts maintained a focus on growth levers and risk management.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Contingent consideration related to the SuperPlay earn-out significantly impacted net loss due to noncash GAAP adjustments.</li>\n<li>The social casino segment, especially Slotomania, operates in a challenging, crowded market, with management focused on slowing decline and extracting value.</li>\n<li>Management noted, \"We fund where returns make sense, extend the life of older titles and step back where the bar is not met.\"</li>\n<li>Capital allocation remains a risk factor as priorities shift and dividend suspension is implemented to preserve flexibility.</li>\n<li>Jackpot Tour's unclear KPIs and pending performance underscore ongoing risks in new title launches.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Playtika's Q4 2025 results underscore a strategic transformation toward casual games and direct-to-consumer channels, with SuperPlay serving as a primary growth engine. Management is emphasizing portfolio balance, disciplined capital allocation, and operational resilience, while suspending the dividend to prioritize flexibility for growth investments and obligations. The company is targeting $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion in revenue for 2026, supported by record D2C contributions and a renewed focus on high-return opportunities, setting the stage for continued evolution and potential long-term value creation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/pltk/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

Analyst sentiment was consistently positive across both quarters, with ongoing interest in margin expansion and growth drivers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance for 2026 is more ambitious, with a higher revenue range and targets for adjusted EPS and EBITDA reflecting expected 25%+ year-over-year growth in key metrics.</li>\n<li>Management's tone remains confident, with a greater emphasis on multiyear visibility, geographic expansion (notably Texas and the Pacific Northwest), and the size of upcoming projects.</li>\n<li>Analysts continued to focus on growth drivers, backlog conversion, and capital allocation, with new questions centered on modular construction and scalability.</li>\n<li>Key metrics such as backlog, E-Infrastructure and Transportation Solutions revenue, and margins all showed substantial increases compared to Q3, while Building Solutions remained challenged.</li>\n<li>Strategic priorities shifted towards integrating acquisitions, expanding modular capabilities, and leveraging the CEC platform for growth.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited ongoing softness in Building Solutions, with revenue anticipated to decline further in 2026.</li>\n<li>There are challenges ramping up new geographies, with management stating that margins in new markets may initially be lower but are expected to improve with scale and integration.</li>\n<li>Execution risk remains around integrating acquisitions and scaling modular construction.</li>\n<li>Some margin pressure may be present in early phases of large projects, as noted in management's remarks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Management expressed confidence in Sterling's ability to capture multiyear growth opportunities driven by a record backlog, robust demand in E-Infrastructure and Transportation Solutions, and expanding capabilities through acquisitions and modular construction. The company targets significant revenue and margin growth in 2026, underpinned by visibility into a substantial pipeline of high-probability future work, geographic expansion, and strategic investments in both organic and inorganic growth.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/strl/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Phathom Pharmaceuticals (PHAT) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Steven Basta highlighted that \"we had a successful Q4. We delivered on expectations for both revenue and cash operating expense levels, coming in at the better end of our guided ranges.\" Basta explained that key steps were taken to enhance the capital structure, including reducing interest expense and modifying outstanding term loan obligations. The company believes that \"our cash on hand, along with anticipated future cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy all obligations under both our term debt and our revenue interest financing agreements.\"</li>\n<li>Basta indicated confidence in reaching operating profitability beginning in Q3 2026 and for the full year, with $320 million to $345 million revenue guidance for 2026. He added, \"Our sales organization is positioned to deliver, and we're seeing clear signs that our GI strategy is working.\"</li>\n<li>The CEO reported that over 1.1 million VOQUEZNA total prescriptions have been filled to more than 230,000 patients, and 273,000 prescriptions were filled in Q4 alone. Covered prescriptions grew 21% quarter-over-quarter to 174,000 in Q4.</li>\n<li>Basta emphasized recent capital structure improvements, including a successful equity offering in January and renegotiation of debt terms that extended the term loan maturity to February 2029 and reduced interest rates.</li>\n<li>CFO Sanjeev Narula stated, \"Our revenues for Q4 of $57.6 million were consistent with pre-release and demonstrated 16% sequential quarterly growth.\" Narula described the gross to net for Q4 as at the high end of the 55% to 60% range, with gross margin at approximately 87%. He added, \"After accounting for quarterly cash expenses, we reported a loss from operations, excluding stock-based compensation of approximately $320,000, a 95% improvement compared to Q3.\"</li>\n<li>Narula noted the completion of an oversubscribed equity offering in January, raising $130 million, and a term facility modification reducing principal to $175 million and lowering the interest rate from 12% to 9.85%.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Narula provided 2026 net revenue guidance of $320 million to $345 million, incorporating an accounting-related shift of $17 million to $20 million from gross to net adjustments to cost of goods sold. Gross margin for 2026 is anticipated at approximately 80%. Cash operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, are projected at $235 million to $255 million, reflecting a 14% decrease at midpoint versus 2025.</li>\n<li>Revenue is expected to follow a similar cadence to last year, with approximately 40% in the first half and 60% in the second half, and Q1 flagged as the slow quarter due to seasonality. Management anticipates achieving operational profitability, excluding stock-based compensation, by Q3 and for the full year 2026, and expects to achieve cash flow positivity in 2027.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Full year 2025 net revenues were $175.1 million, representing 217% year-over-year growth, with Q4 revenue of $57.6 million. Cash operating expenses for Q4 were $50.3 million, better than the less than $55 million target. Net cash usage for Q4 was approximately $5 million, down 64% from Q3.</li>\n<li>Full year cash operating expenses were approximately $284 million. The company ended 2025 with about $130 million in cash and cash equivalents, and following the term debt modification, cash on hand was approximately $190 million.</li>\n<li>Narula explained, \"Our financial profile has transitioned meaningfully, and I'm excited for this next phase.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Kristen Kluska, Cantor Fitzgerald: Asked about early signals from the strengthened sales force and strategy. Basta responded that the focus on the GI call point is key and \"we are seeing consistent signs of momentum,\" including an increase in adoption rates among gastroenterologists and a growth in the number of high-frequency writers.</li>\n<li>Annabel Samimy, Stifel: Inquired about patient transition to primary care and sales inflection points. Basta noted uplift in primary care prescribing and expects steady growth, stating, \"2026 is just going to be a year of heads down execution.\"</li>\n<li>Anthea Li, Jefferies: Asked about Q1 growth and Medicare coverage.

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Thryv Holdings, Inc. (THRY) Q4 2025  </p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Joe Walsh, Chairman &amp; CEO, highlighted that \"2025 was a solid year, and our team accomplished a lot. SaaS revenues grew 34% year-over-year, and SaaS adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 16.8%. We are accelerating on the AI front. It is advancing our product road map, and we are well-positioned as a leading SaaS platform for small businesses.\" He announced a strategic shift: \"Going forward, our entire strategy centers on one powerful offering, the Thryv platform, powered by AI, we'll be launching later in 2026.\" Walsh addressed the transition from legacy print and marketing services to SaaS, emphasizing growth in high-value customers and integration of Keap’s platform and engineering talent. He stated, \"Growth in quality customers spending $400 a month or more is 18-plus percent in the fourth quarter of last year. We’ve had steady growth in that segment. Quality customers now account for 69% of our revenue in Q4 compared to 60% in the prior year.\"</li>\n<li>Sean Wechter, Chief Technology Officer, explained, \"The first 2 levers I pulled when I arrived was to amp up our AI efforts and our data assets, get them cleaned up…our strategy is to adopt the latest and greatest AI tools and partners…we want to bring AI down market to small businesses in an ambient way, meaning ideally, AI does the intended task for you, hopefully, proactively.\"</li>\n<li>Paul Rouse, CFO, stated, \"SaaS revenue increased 14.1% to $119 million in the fourth quarter and was within guidance. Keap contributed $16.2 million in the fourth quarter…SaaS ARPU reached $373, representing a 15% increase year-over-year. Seasoned NRR stayed flat at 94% for the quarter. Growth in quality customers spending $400 a month or more grew by 3,000 or 18% year-over-year and now represents more than 20% of our client base.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Paul Rouse provided guidance for 2026: \"For the first quarter, we expect SaaS revenue in the range of $114 million to $115 million. For the full year, we expect SaaS revenue in the range of $461 million to $471 million…For the first quarter, we expect SaaS adjusted EBITDA in the range of $12 million to $13 million. For the full year, we expect SaaS adjusted EBITDA in the range of $70 million to $75 million.\"</li>\n<li>Walsh added, \"You will have noticed in Paul's guidance that's a little bit conservative on the quarterly guide and the guide for the year for SaaS…we expect slower growth for a few quarters, reaccelerating later in the year, and going strong into next year.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul><li>SaaS revenue for the fourth quarter was $119 million. Full-year SaaS revenue was $461 million. SaaS adjusted gross margin was 70.4% in the fourth quarter and 72.7% for the full year. SaaS adjusted EBITDA reached $20 million in Q4 and $73.8 million for the full year, with ARPU at $373.

Free cash flow was $31.1 million for 2025, and net debt was reduced to $251 million.</li></ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Arjun Bhatia, William Blair: Asked about the adoption curve of the new platform and migration impacts. Walsh responded, \"We’ve engineered everything together into one platform…there’s a little bit of cannibalization where it’s eating up some of business center customers…But it doesn’t have the heat and light that it had before because the market sell grow platform has really captured everyone’s imagination.\"</li>\n<li>Bhatia followed up on retention and overlap with seasoned customers. Walsh explained, \"There are definitely some new customers that are coming in right away…69% of our clients are this quality metric, where we make good margins.\"</li>\n<li>Zach Cummins, B. Riley Securities: Asked about go-to-market strategy for quality customers. Walsh said, \"We pretty much have decided that our phenomenal in-person sales organization should really spend its time with the larger businesses…we’ve been building this sort of product-led growth approach where for a smaller business that wants to come in, we’re going to have products that they can buy, and they’ll be able to do that.\"</li>\n<li>Cummins followed up on development and rollout of the new platform. Walsh replied, \"We have a trial version out and a small beta that will be expanding more broadly fairly soon…we’re selling it right now. But there’s dramatically improved versions…we plan over the course of the year.\"</li>\n<li>Matthew Swanson, RBC: Asked about pricing and migration impacts. Walsh stated, \"We’re going to have a product for them…there’ll be a higher tier…we’re coming up with this more streamlined, simple approach.\"</li>\n<li>Swanson inquired about legacy product end-of-life. Walsh responded, \"I think it’s too early to think about that…we’ve more cleaned up and segregated that.\"</li>\n<li>Jason Kreyer, Craig-Hallum Capital Group: Asked about embedded AI value. Walsh shared, \"There’s just a long list of different things that AI can do…we’re organizing and pulling it all together and making everything in a complete package to help you accomplish growing your business.\"</li>\n<li>Kreyer also asked about churn during migration. Walsh said, \"We’re seeing churn overall gently trend down…as we move upmarket, I think we’ll get lower churn.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed on platform migration, retention, and the development roadmap, showing a neutral to slightly positive tone as they acknowledged progress but probed for clarity on execution, churn, and product differentiation.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident tone in prepared remarks, particularly Walsh’s statements on the future direction and platform integration. During Q&amp;A, Walsh was detailed and transparent about platform cannibalization and strategy, using phrases like \"we’ve just captured lightning in a bottle\" and \"we have a tremendous right to win in.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone shifted from focusing on partner integration and verticals to emphasizing unified platform strategy and quality customer growth, while analysts’ tone remained probing but constructive.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance language shifted from emphasizing partner performance and vertical expansion in Q3 to a unified platform launch and quality customer focus in Q4, with full-year SaaS revenue guidance moving from $460–$463 million in Q3 to $461–$471 million in Q4.</li>\n<li>Management’s confidence increased around AI initiatives and the new product-led growth model, while acknowledging near-term growth moderation due to transition effects and cannibalization of legacy products.</li>\n<li>Key metrics such as quality customer revenue share (69% in Q4 vs. 60% prior year) and multiproduct adoption (19,000 clients with two or more SaaS products) showed continued improvement.</li>\n<li>Analysts’ focus shifted from execution against guidance and partner integration to the mechanics and timing of platform migration and upmarket strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Walsh noted cannibalization of existing Business Center customers and a managed decline in Marketing Services revenue as the company transitions to SaaS.</li>\n<li>Management highlighted that the upgrade pool from legacy platforms is largely behind, with future growth to be driven more by organic acquisition, expansion, and retention.</li>\n<li>Churn among smaller, lower-value customers was acknowledged, but management stated, \"while it creates some pressure on our aggregate retention metrics, it does have minimal impact on our overall revenue.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Thryv’s Q4 2025 call emphasized a strategic evolution to a unified, AI-powered SaaS platform targeting higher-value small businesses, with quality customers now accounting for a greater share of revenue and multiproduct adoption accelerating. Management outlined conservative near-term guidance as the company navigates product transitions and cannibalization, but projects a return to stronger growth as the new platform, enhanced by AI and the Keap acquisition, launches in 2026 and drives increased retention and expansion among established small business clients.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/thry/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
