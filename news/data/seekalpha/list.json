            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Columbia Banking System, Inc. (COLB) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>President and CEO Clint Stein emphasized the successful closing of the Pacific Premier acquisition on August 31, noting, \"This milestone completes our 8-state Western footprint and bolsters our position as the preeminent regional bank in the Northwest with approximately $68 billion in assets.\" Stein highlighted expanded market share and described the bank as uniquely positioned for organic growth in dynamic Western markets, with a sharpened focus on \"optimization, generating new business, supporting the growing needs of existing customers and delivering superior results for all of our shareholders, even as we look to complete the integration of Pac Premier.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Stein outlined a strategic shift toward organic growth, supported by a \"disciplined cost-conscious culture\" and a commitment to \"generating positive economic impact.\" He also announced a management transition: \"This will be Ron's last earnings call with Columbia as he is stepping down following a very successful tenure as our CFO.\" Ivan Seda was named as the new CFO.</p></li>\n<li><p>CFO Ron Farnsworth stated, \"We reported second quarter EPS of $0.40 and operating EPS of $0.85. Operating excludes merger and restructuring expense, along with other fair value and hedging items detailed in our non-GAAP disclosures, which I encourage you to review.\" Farnsworth highlighted that operating PPNR increased 12% from the second quarter to $270 million and discussed the $1.9 billion reduction in broker deposits and term debt during the quarter, which \"drove net interest margin expansion.\" He also noted the realization of $48 million of the targeted $127 million in expected annualized cost savings as of September 30.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Stein announced, \"I'm pleased to announce our Board of Directors authorized a $700 million share repurchase program, reflecting our confidence in the strength of Columbia's balance sheet.\" He cited \"roughly 110 basis points or approximately $550 million of excess capital above our long-term target today.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Management expects to \"organically manage down roughly $8 billion of inherited transactional loans\" over the next several years, with a focus on remixing the portfolio to drive profitability.</p></li>\n<li><p>Seda indicated that the pace of share repurchases in the remainder of this year will be \"modestly lower than the average quarter before we look to ramp it back up into 2026,\" dependent on market conditions.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management expects \"exceptional profitability, which will result in meaningful capital generation over the coming quarters.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Columbia reported operating EPS of $0.85 and operating PPNR of $270 million, reflecting 12% sequential growth. Net interest margin increased 9 basis points to 3.84%.</p></li>\n<li><p>The company reduced broker deposits and term debt by $1.9 billion, contributing to margin expansion. Tangible book value per share rose to $18.57, and regulatory capital ratios expanded, with Tier 1 common at 11.6% and total risk-based capital ratio at 13.4%.</p></li>\n<li><p>Noninterest income was $77 million for the quarter, with operating noninterest income at $72 million. Operating expense was $307 million, while $48 million of the planned $127 million in cost synergies from the Pacific Premier acquisition were achieved.</p></li>\n<li><p>On the lending side, \"New loan originations of $1.2 billion is up 36% quarter, while year-to-date volume is up 21% from last year.\" Organic commercial portfolio growth was 5% annualized.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Christopher McGratty, KBW: Questioned the rationale and pacing for the $700 million buyback. Stein responded the program spans 12 months with flexibility for market conditions, and Seda clarified, \"It's presumable that we could go through the entire authorization over the course of the next 12 months.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>David Feaster, Raymond James: Asked about the recent activist investor presentation. Stein replied, \"Our priorities in no particular order are consistent, repeatable top-tier quarterly performance... we've been focused on and preparing for additional capital returns... Pac Premier... was the missing piece to our franchise... I have 0 interest in M&amp;A for the foreseeable future.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Jeff Rulis, D.A. Davidson: Inquired about loan growth outlook. Nixon replied, \"New originations on the lending side are roughly between 6.5% and 8%. I think probably a weighted average this past quarter was in the low 7s.\" Nixon added, \"5% annual loan growth... is definitely our target.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Matthew Clark, Piper Sandler: Asked about margin expectations. Seda projected net interest margin \"just north of 3.90%\" for Q4, with a similar range for Q1 2026.</p></li>\n<li><p>Jared Shaw, Barclays: Queried about allowance levels and merger charges. Merrywell said allowance should \"kind of a slow kind of upward migration,\" and Farnsworth confirmed merger cost expectations are \"unchanged.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Analysts pressed management on the buyback pace, activist investor influence, loan growth, margin sustainability, and integration costs, reflecting a neutral to slightly positive but vigilant tone.</p></li>\n<li><p>Management exhibited a confident tone during prepared remarks, especially regarding capital strength, profitability outlook, and integration of Pac Premier. In the Q&amp;A, the tone remained confident and occasionally emphasized focus, with Stein stating, \"I have 0 interest in M&amp;A for the foreseeable future.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Compared to Q2, both analysts and management showed more direct focus on capital return, integration benefits, and organic growth, with management expressing increased confidence in the franchise's trajectory.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Management's strategic focus shifted from anticipation of the Pac Premier acquisition to post-integration execution, with a significant new focus on capital return through the $700 million buyback.</p></li>\n<li><p>Capital ratios have increased from the previous quarter, and the tangible book value dilution from the acquisition came in well below initial expectations.</p></li>\n<li><p>The prior quarter emphasized operational efficiency and preparation for acquisition, while this quarter highlighted realized cost synergies, expanded markets, and new capital allocation strategies.</p></li>\n<li><p>Analyst questions have shifted from integration planning to execution, capital deployment, and sustainability of profitability amid balance sheet remixing.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Management cited the need to \"organically manage down roughly $8 billion of inherited transactional loans\" as a critical ongoing process.</p></li>\n<li><p>There is sensitivity to macroeconomic volatility, with share repurchase pacing subject to market conditions.</p></li>\n<li><p>Integration of Pac Premier, while progressing, still involves ongoing system conversions and realization of full cost synergies.</p></li>\n<li><p>Seasonality in deposits, potential deposit outflows, and the impact of interest rate movements were noted as factors to monitor.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Columbia Banking System underscored the completion and integration of the Pacific Premier acquisition as a catalyst for expanded market reach, enhanced profitability, and capital strength. The company launched a $700 million share repurchase program, signaling confidence in the franchise and prioritizing shareholder returns. Management remains focused on remixing the loan portfolio for higher earnings quality, prudent expense management, and disciplined organic growth, with no plans for further M&amp;A. The outlook reflects strong capital generation, robust loan pipelines, and ongoing optimization to deliver long-term shareholder value.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/colb/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Tenaris S.A. (TS) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Paolo Rocca, Chairman &amp; CEO, emphasized Tenaris's continued industrial and commercial strength, stating, “Our results in third quarter once again highlight the unique industrial and commercial position. We have built around the world with competitive differentiation in key markets as well as an efficient industrial performance.” He outlined stable sales in North America despite slowed drilling activity, attributing this to the strength of the customer portfolio and operational efficiency. Rocca highlighted record production at mills in Bay City, Hickman, and Sault Ste. Marie, with 90% of U.S. OCTG sales produced domestically.</li>\n<li>Rocca described ongoing expansion in Canada, referencing a new service yard in British Columbia and increased production at Sault Ste. Marie to support Montney shale and LNG export projects.</li>\n<li>On the offshore front, Rocca noted a growing order backlog for projects like TPAO Sakarya in the Black Sea, with “deliveries from the middle of next year as we look forward to the confirmation of other major offshore process FID.”</li>\n<li>Rocca discussed improved investment conditions in Argentina post-election, increased energy production with a new 95-megawatt wind farm, and full power self-sufficiency at Campana operations.</li>\n<li>Carlos Gomez Alzaga, Chief Financial Officer, reported, “Our third quarter sales reached $3 billion, up 2% year-on-year, but down 3% sequentially, mainly reflecting lower sales to the North Sea and lower shipments for offshore line pipe projects in the Middle East, partially offset by a resilient level of sales to our rig direct customers in the U.S. and Canada.” He noted EBITDA of $753 million, which included a $34 million one-off gain, with a margin of 25%.</li>\n<li>The Board approved an interim dividend of $0.29 per share, a 7% increase compared to last year.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management expects Q4 sales to be “close or in line with the third quarter,” with Rocca stating, “we also expect for the next quarter to have a level of sales close or in line with the third quarter.”</li>\n<li>EBITDA is projected to be lower, with a “range of single digit because of the impact of the tariff in our cost of sales,” as Rocca explained. The company expects margins to remain “in the range between 20% and 25%, not far slightly lower than the one we had in the third quarter.”</li>\n<li>Rocca signaled potential changes to U.S. steel tariffs in 2026, mentioning ongoing negotiations and possible reductions.</li>\n<li>COO Gabriel Podskubka noted, “the Middle East, stable and resilient into next year,” with a strong pipeline business offsetting lower OCTG in Saudi Arabia and a constructive view on offshore activity into 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Q3 sales reached $3 billion, EBITDA was $753 million (including a $34 million gain), and free cash flow was $133 million after capital expenditures and share buybacks.</li>\n<li>Net cash position ended at $3.5 billion after share buybacks totaling $351 million.</li>\n<li>Interim dividend per share was raised to $0.29. The quarter included a one-off $34 million gain from the return of U.S. antidumping deposits.</li>\n<li>Capital expenditure was $185 million, and operating cash flow was $318 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Arun Jayaram, JPMorgan, asked about the impact of Argentina’s elections and Q4 margin trends. Rocca responded, highlighting improved financing and investor sentiment in Argentina post-election, expecting increased investment and gradual rig count growth. On margins, Rocca noted ongoing inventory pressure and anticipated “the impact of this situation and the level of price will start to recover.” Guillermo Moreno, President of U.S.A., added that inventories remain high but imports should decrease further, balancing the market.</li>\n<li>Matthew Smith, BofA Securities, inquired about sales mix and shareholder distributions. Rocca linked strong welded sales to U.S. product substitution and pipeline deliveries, expecting the mix to revert in Q4. On buybacks, Rocca stated, “we will execute the second tranche of the buyback… it will be up to the Board to decide what to do once we completed this second buyback.”</li>\n<li>Marc Bianchi, TD Cowen, questioned the impact of tariffs on EBITDA. Rocca clarified that adjusted EBITDA (excluding one-offs) will be lower due to tariffs, estimating a $40 million increase in cost of sales. CFO Alzaga confirmed incremental tariff effects next quarter.</li>\n<li>Alessandro Pozzi, Mediobanca, asked about Q1 2026 and Middle East tenders. Rocca cited possible tariff reductions via negotiations and described increased domestic production as a mitigating factor. Podskubka described the Middle East as stable, with potential rig rebound in 2026 and continued pipeline activity.</li>\n<li>Sebastian Erskine, Rothschild &amp; Co Redburn, discussed Mexico’s outlook. Rocca pointed to gradual drilling increases, improved PEMEX payment, and private sector activity, expecting more volume over time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts’ tone was neutral to slightly cautious, probing on tariffs, margins, and regional demand. Questions focused on sustainability of sales, margin impacts from tariffs, and regional growth trends. </li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident but measured tone, emphasizing resilience and adaptation to tariffs, with Rocca stating, “Tenaris continues to demonstrate the resilience of its operation and financial performance.” Slight defensiveness appeared in margin discussions and tariff impacts, but long-term confidence was consistent.</li>\n<li>Relative to the previous quarter, both analysts and management maintained a similar tone, with ongoing focus on tariffs and regional demand drivers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Q3 sales were $3 billion, down from $3.1 billion in Q2. EBITDA increased sequentially to $753 million (including a one-off gain).</li>\n<li>Margins remained strong, with a 25% EBITDA margin in Q3 versus close to 24% in Q2.</li>\n<li>Free cash flow declined from $538 million in Q2 to $133 million in Q3, reflecting increased capital expenditures and share buybacks.</li>\n<li>Net cash position decreased from $3.7 billion to $3.5 billion.</li>\n<li>Management reaffirmed guidance for sales and margins near current levels, with added caution on tariff-driven cost impacts in Q4 and 2026.</li>\n<li>Analysts’ questions remained focused on tariffs, regional performance, and shareholder returns. Management’s tone was steady, with ongoing confidence but heightened attention to cost management and inventory.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management repeatedly cited high U.S. and Canada tariffs as a key cost challenge, expecting further impact in Q4. Rocca estimated, “today, we are paying every quarter an amount in the range of $150 million this tariff.”</li>\n<li>Elevated inventories in North America were linked to price pressure, with Moreno noting inventories at about seven months of consumption and expecting reductions as imports decrease.</li>\n<li>Delayed PEMEX payments contributed to higher working capital; Rocca expects improvement in Q4.</li>\n<li>Market uncertainties include potential changes in U.S. steel tariffs and ongoing trade negotiations, as well as fluctuating regional demand dynamics.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Tenaris management conveyed that, despite ongoing headwinds from tariffs and inventory levels, the company expects stable sales and margins in Q4, with a resilient North America business, constructive outlook for offshore and Middle East markets, and improving conditions in Argentina and Mexico. The company continues to prioritize operational efficiency, regional adaptability, and shareholder returns, while closely monitoring tariff negotiations and cost management for 2026 and beyond.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ts/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",
