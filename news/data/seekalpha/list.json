North America comparable sales decreased 5.4% as domestic company-owned restaurants were down 6% and North America franchised restaurants were down 5%. The results in North America missed the consensus estimate of -4.3% and were said to reflect a weak consumer backdrop and elevated promotional environment. International comparable sales were up 6% during the quarter to mark five consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales. </p>\n<p>In Q4, Papa John's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PZZA\" title=\"Papa John's International, Inc.\">PZZA</a>) opened 142 new restaurants system-wide, comprised of 41 restaurant openings in North America and 101 restaurant openings in international markets.</p>\n<p>Adjusted EBITDA fell to $51M from $58M in the prior year quarter. EPS was reported at $0.34 vs. $0.33 consensus and $0.63 a year ago. </p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Papa Johns (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PZZA\" title=\"Papa John's International, Inc.\">PZZA</a>) said operational efficiency initiatives, including recently implemented programs, are expected to deliver at least $25M in corporate cost savings outside of marketing through 2027, with approximately $13M expected to be realized in 2026.</p>\n<p>At least $60M of previously identified supply chain cost savings is expected to deliver approximately 160 basis points of incremental restaurant-level profitability improvement across both franchise and Company-owned restaurants in North America by FY28.</p>\n<p>\"In 2026, we are focused on continuing our transformation work to best position Papa Johns to win in a dynamic QSR category. Our strong balance sheet is supporting investment in these initiatives, which we believe will deliver high returns. We look forward with confidence in our ability to generate sustainable, profitable growth and value creation,\" stated CEO Todd Penegor.</p>\n<p>Shares of Papa John's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PZZA\" title=\"Papa John's International, Inc.\">PZZA</a>) were down 5.1% in premarket trading to $32.09 vs. the 52-week range of $30.16 to $55.74.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
