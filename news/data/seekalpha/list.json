            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Murphy USA Inc. (MUSA) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Andrew Clyde, President and CEO, announced his intent to retire at the end of the year, stating this will be his last earnings call as CEO, and highlighted the company's commitment to continuity, resilience, and momentum. \"Yesterday's announcement signaled both continuity in Murphy USA's leadership and continuity in our long-term capital allocation strategy.\"</li>\n<li>Mindy West will become President immediately and CEO on January 1, 2026, while Clyde will remain as adviser through February 2027. Clyde emphasized, \"Mindy becomes President of Murphy USA immediately and will become CEO and a member of the Board of Directors on January 1, 2026.\"</li>\n<li>The Board authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program and renewed the dividend policy with a compounded annual growth rate of 20% since inception. Clyde stated, \"The Board took this opportunity to authorize a new $2 billion share repurchase program as we were about 80% through the existing $1.5 billion program.\"</li>\n<li>The company reaffirmed its commitment to new-to-industry store growth and reinvestments within the existing network, projecting over 45 new store openings in 2025 and a pipeline supporting 50-plus stores in 2026. \"Complementing our 50-50 approach is the Board's commitment to new-to-industry store growth and reinvestments within the existing network,\" said Clyde.</li>\n<li>Mindy West reported, \"Third quarter EBITDA was $285 million, virtually flat to the prior year despite all-in margins running about $0.02 lower.\"</li>\n<li>West also noted, \"Total margin contribution dollars were up $24.4 million or 11.2% in quarter 3. There are 2 key drivers of these exceptional results. First, nicotine categories are up over 20%, driven by strong promotional activity and center of the store categories grew approximately 5%.\"</li>\n<li>Donald Smith, Interim CFO, stated, \"During this quarter, we brought 8 new stores into service, along with another 11 raze-and-rebuilds, bringing the year-to-date total as of September 30 to 22 and 20, respectively.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Murphy USA updated its full year fuel volume guidance to between 235,000 to 237,000 gallons per store per month, revised from the original 240,000 to 245,000 gallons range, reflecting year-to-date trends and expectations for the remainder of the year.</li>\n<li>Full year merchandise contribution guidance was tightened to the upper end of the range, now between $870 million and $875 million, driven by strong Q3 performance and Q4 momentum.</li>\n<li>The company lowered its projected monthly per store operating expense range to $36,200 to $36,600, down from the original $36,500 to $37,000 range.</li>\n<li>SG&amp;A guidance for 2025 has been reduced to $230 million to $240 million, exclusive of restructuring charges.</li>\n<li>The effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be between 23.5% and 24.5%.</li>\n<li>Dividend payout is expected to continue to grow 10% annually, with an additional 10% increase or $0.63 per share for the dividend payable on December 1.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Third quarter EBITDA was reported at $285 million, matching the prior year despite lower all-in fuel margins.</li>\n<li>Average per store month fuel volumes declined by 1.8% in the third quarter but all-in margins of $0.307, including retail margins of $0.283, remained strong.</li>\n<li>Merchandise margin contribution increased by $24.4 million, or 11.2%, with nicotine categories up over 20% and center-of-store categories growing by approximately 5%.</li>\n<li>QuickChek reported its fourth successive quarter of same-store food and beverage sales growth, with total food and beverage sales up 2.7% for the quarter.</li>\n<li>Per store operating expenses rose 2.8% in the quarter, with two-thirds of the increase attributable to new and larger stores.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Edward Kelly, Wells Fargo, asked about fuel margin cadence and volume elasticity. Mindy West responded, \"Our margins are more a function of the low -- and our volume are really more a function of just this low price environment where our customers are just not as price sensitive.\"</li>\n<li>Kelly also inquired about the ZYN nicotine promotion. West explained, \"This is really more about a strategic partner investing to drive share, utilizing our large and very loyal nicotine customer base.\"</li>\n<li>Bonnie Herzog, Goldman Sachs, questioned whether the raised merchandise contribution guidance was driven primarily by the ZYN promotion. West replied, \"It does definitely include ZYN... Nicotine pouch volumes were growing around 45% in promotion. In October, we have seen that jump to 120% of prior year volumes.\"</li>\n<li>Herzog also asked about balancing shareholder returns and growth. Clyde stated, \"When we say our 50-50 capital allocation, I mean, we mean 50-50... we're really confident at that level of balanced capital allocation that makes sense.\"</li>\n<li>Irene Nattel, RBC Capital Markets, probed the halo effect of nicotine promotions and capital allocation discipline. West indicated the effect on center-of-store was small, and Clyde emphasized, \"We can see ourselves doing that quicker as well.\"</li>\n<li>Pooran Sharma, Stephens Inc., asked about West's preparedness for the CEO role and cost-control opportunities. West shared her experience across financial, commercial, and operations roles and noted, \"We're going to continue to optimize our business... So we've now made us leaner, but I think now we're uncovering opportunities... to streamline the workflow.\"</li>\n<li>Robert Griffin, Raymond James, focused on future nicotine promotional opportunities. West stated, \"We own that customer. We know that customer better than anyone.\"</li>\n<li>Jacob Aiken-Phillips, Melius Research, asked about the October fuel run-up and capital allocation. West clarified the temporary nature of the margin spike, and Clyde confirmed plans for further CapEx guidance in February.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts expressed positive sentiment regarding the leadership transition and capital returns, but were probing on the sustainability of fuel margins and the impact of promotional events, showing slight caution.</li>\n<li>Management’s tone was confident and forward-looking during prepared remarks, emphasizing resilience and continuity, while in Q&amp;A, West and Clyde provided detailed, candid responses, occasionally acknowledging uncertainty in the competitive and pricing environment.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, the tone was more positive regarding merchandise performance and capital allocation, while analysts maintained a constructive but probing stance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The current quarter featured the CEO succession announcement and a new $2 billion share repurchase program, compared to no such major leadership or capital return news in the previous quarter.</li>\n<li>Guidance for fuel volumes was revised downward, while merchandise contribution guidance was tightened to the upper end, reflecting stronger performance in nicotine and center-store categories versus cautious outlooks previously.</li>\n<li>Analysts this quarter focused more on promotional activity impacts, cost control, and capital allocation strategy, while last quarter saw more discussion on demand trends and new store pipeline execution.</li>\n<li>Management’s confidence appeared higher regarding merchandise momentum and cost structure improvements, while analysts’ tone remained consistently inquisitive.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management acknowledged the low price, low volatility environment as a challenge for fuel margins and volumes, but underscored the company’s resilience and ability to capture upside when the market normalizes.</li>\n<li>Cost pressures are being addressed through ongoing restructuring, labor model changes, and efficiency initiatives across OpEx and SG&amp;A.</li>\n<li>The company is vigilant about maintaining leverage at or below 2.5x, with flexibility to lean into the balance sheet for opportunistic investments or shareholder returns.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about the sustainability of promotional-driven growth and the potential impact of competitive dynamics and macroeconomic trends on store performance and margins.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Murphy USA’s third quarter 2025 call underscored a leadership transition, a significant new $2 billion share repurchase authorization, and robust momentum in merchandise and promotional performance, particularly in nicotine categories. The company is maintaining its 50-50 capital allocation strategy and strengthening shareholder distributions, while reaffirming a strong pipeline for new store growth and cost discipline. Management remains confident in the business’s resilience and readiness to capitalize on future market normalization, with a smooth CEO transition and ongoing focus on operational excellence and shareholder value.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/musa/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",

(UTZ) Q3 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Howard Friedman highlighted the company's continued outperformance against the category and emphasized the significance of the newly announced California route acquisition. He indicated, \"we feel very good about the top line momentum that we have and the opportunity to further accelerate it as we get into California in a more meaningful way in 2026. We've said 200 to 300 basis points ahead of the category and obviously, by entering into California and making some incremental investments there, we believe we should be at the higher end of that range.\" </li>\n<li>Friedman referenced the company's successful expansion strategy, citing Florida as a model. He noted, \"in Florida, where we had entered a couple of years ago... we were about a 2.5% market share. ...in 2022 was when we actually saw a meaningful -- first meaningful step change, which is about a 70 basis point improvement relative to that 2020 range. ...latest 52 weeks in Florida, we're at about 4.2%.\" </li>\n<li>CFO William Kelley stated, \"there's nothing structural preventing us from getting to 15% EBITDA...we will have -- continue to have best-in-class productivity activity coming through as our supply chain transformation that has been a heavy lift with potential CapEx, it kind of steps down. ...now the focus has started to -- not only are we able to expand margins and grow our top line, we can also drive free cash flow.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management reiterated confidence in top line momentum, with Friedman indicating the company expects to outperform the category by 200 to 300 basis points, aiming for the higher end with the California entry and related investments in 2026. Incremental margin expansion may be moderated to fuel growth, as \"some incremental investments in '26, particularly to support the California expansion,\" are anticipated.</li>\n<li>The company expects productivity programs and supply chain transformation to support margin and free cash flow improvements. Kelley explained, \"we are doing the things you would expect us to do at this point in time, having come off our peak CapEx and our key transformation cost elements.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Kelley specified, \"on the pricing piece, what you saw in the quarter was about a 1% drag, 1% drag is what we talked about and it played out how we anticipated.\" He attributed this slight negative pricing to promotional activities in expansion markets intended to drive trial.</li>\n<li>Management described strong volume gains and highlighted Boulder Canyon as a standout performer, driven by \"velocity in the natural channel about 35% in the conventional channel up almost 200%.\"</li>\n<li>Gross margins were pressured in the quarter due to weather-related crop issues impacting potato quality, but Kelley noted, \"that ended in the quarter. That's not something that is progressing. ...we don't think we have a systemic issue here at all.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Andrew Lazar, Barclays: Asked if EBITDA margin expansion could be less significant next year due to investments in California. Friedman responded that incremental investments would support accelerated top line momentum, and Kelley added, \"there's nothing structural preventing us from getting to 15% EBITDA.\"</li>\n<li>Michael Lavery, Piper Sandler: Inquired about the extent and cost of the acquired California network. Friedman explained the network provides a platform for broader product distribution in early 2026 and highlighted California's market opportunity.</li>\n<li>Peter Galbo, BofA: Questioned technical details about the California expansion, such as independent operator conversions and potential portfolio pruning. Friedman said the acquired network's mechanics differ from previous transitions and does not expect major historical conversion issues to resurface.</li>\n<li>Scott Marks, Jefferies: Sought color on On The Border brand softness. Friedman stated the issues are \"relatively short term in nature\" and corrective action is underway.</li>\n<li>James Salera, Stephens: Asked about market share gains in core markets. Friedman attributed gains to the breadth of the portfolio and improved performance in convenience stores.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts expressed cautious optimism, seeking clarity on margin guidance, brand performance, and technical execution of new acquisitions. Questions conveyed a slightly skeptical tone around margin expansion and operational headwinds.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and constructive tone, repeatedly expressing certainty in the company's growth playbook and ability to manage through short-term pressures. Friedman frequently referenced past successes and playbook consistency, while Kelley reiterated structural strengths.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone remains confident but includes more detailed discussion about the need for incremental investments potentially tempering margin expansion in the near term. Analysts were more persistent in probing about margin outlook and operational details, reflecting a slightly more cautious stance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The current quarter emphasized the California expansion and its expected role in driving accelerated top line growth in 2026, whereas the previous quarter focused more on the execution of ongoing productivity and distribution initiatives.</li>\n<li>There was a shift from confidence in sustaining margin expansion to a more nuanced discussion about balancing margin gains with growth investments, particularly related to California.</li>\n<li>Analysts in the current quarter concentrated more on the mechanics and costs associated with the California acquisition, as well as the impact of short-term input cost pressures on margins.</li>\n<li>Key performance themes remain: expansion market gains, productivity, and brand strength, but the narrative now includes more explicit consideration of investment tradeoffs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Short-term gross margin pressure from weather-related crop issues impacting potato quality was a notable challenge this quarter, though management indicated the issue has been resolved.</li>\n<li>On The Border brand softness was identified as a risk, but management emphasized it is not structural and expects correction to begin in Q4.</li>\n<li>The integration of the California route network presents execution risk, particularly in aligning product assortment and distribution.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about EBITDA margin expansion potentially being moderated by growth investments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Utz management underscores the company's robust top line trajectory and strategic focus on national expansion, with the California route acquisition positioned as a key growth catalyst for 2026. While incremental investments may temper EBITDA margin expansion next year, leadership maintains high confidence in both the playbook and ongoing productivity initiatives. The quarter also addressed short-term gross margin pressures and brand-specific softness, with corrective actions underway and a clear emphasis on maintaining outperformance versus the salty snacks category.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/utz/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n</body></html>",
