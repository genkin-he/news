However, there would be a bigger price spike and longer-lasting impact if oil infrastructure or supplies were interrupted, for instance because of disruption of tanker traffic through the Strait of Hormuz.</span></p>\n<p><span>Oil prices have already risen on war fears. International benchmark Brent crude closed at a seven-month high of $72.87 on Friday.</span></p>\n<p><span>Iran exports some 1.6 million barrels of oil a day, most of it going to China, where privately owned refineries are less concerned about the U.S. sanctions that prevent Iran from selling its oil elsewhere. If that supply is disrupted, Chinese customers would look elsewhere for oil on the global market, potentially driving up prices.</span></p>\n<p><span>Another question is around the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of global oil supply pass through each day. Middle East exporters Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates send most of their exports through the strait. However analysts say Iran has no incentive to try to close the strait because it would cut off its own exports and hurt its only big customer, China.</span></p>\n<p><span>Limited strikes on Iran’s nuclear program and the Revolutionary Guard that avoid regime change or all-out war could see prices jump $5-$10 based on fear alone, according to Rystad Energy in a prewar scenario.</span></p>\n<p><span>A wider war involving Iranian disruption of tanker traffic could see crude push past $90 per barrel and US gas prices “well above” $3 per gallon, according to another prewar scenario from Clayton Seigle at the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies.

The revised Paramount (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSKY\" title=\"Paramount Skydance Corporation\">PSKY</a>) offer was at a purchase price of $31.00 per share in cash, a one-dollar increase from its earlier bid, which valued the company at around $108B.</p>\n<p><strong>Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>)</strong> shares fell nearly 5.5% Thursday, their worst day since April 16, despite posting blowout earnings. The performance highlights the market’s heightened sensitivity to earnings from large-cap technology companies, particularly those tied to artificial intelligence and data center demand.</p>\n<p><strong>Block (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XYZ\" title=\"Block, Inc.\">XYZ</a>)</strong> announced on Thursday that it's slashing its headcount by more than 40% because intelligent technology means fewer people can do more. The company's stock jumped 24% with the news. Meanwhile, the company issued strong guidance for 2026 and the first quarter of the year, and Q4 earnings merely matched the Wall Street consensus.</p>\n<p><strong>IBM (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM\" title=\"International Business Machines Corporation\">IBM</a>)</strong> plunged more than 13% in a single session on Monday, marking the company’s largest one<span>‑</span>day percentage drop since October 2000. The sharp sell<span>‑</span>off was triggered by investor concerns that Anthropic<span>’</span>s Claude Code tool can automate modernization of COBOL, a legacy programming language heavily tied to IBM<span>’</span>s mainframe business.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Micro Devices (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>)</strong> announced a deal with <strong>Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>)</strong> to deploy up to 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct chips to power Meta’s next generation of AI infrastructure.

Patients taking a standard dose of CagriSema lost 20.2% of their body weight after 84 weeks, compared with 23.6% for Lilly’s tirzepatide.</p>\n<p><strong>Hims &amp; Hers Health (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HIMS\" title=\"Hims &amp; Hers Health, Inc.\">HIMS</a>)</strong> fell after the telehealth company’s guidance fell below the consensus. The telemedicine provider sees Q1 revenue of $600-$625M. Consensus is $652.59M. For full-year 2026, revenue is projected at $2.7B-$2.9B. Consensus is $2.71B.</p>\n<p><strong>First Solar (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FSLR\" title=\"First Solar, Inc.\">FSLR</a>)</strong> fell after the company reported a 2026 net sales forecast which missed the average analyst estimate. The company projected full-year revenues of $4.9B-$5.2B, likely below the $5.2B total for 2025 and far below the $6.16B FactSet analyst consensus estimate, on a volume of 17.0-18.2 GW of modules sold after selling 17.5 GW of modules in FY 2025.</p>\n<p><strong>IonQ (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IONQ\" title=\"IonQ, Inc.\">IONQ</a>) </strong>shares rose after the quantum computing company reported fourth-quarter results that were above Wall Street's estimates. For the period ending Dec. 31, IonQ said it lost an adjusted $0.20 per share as revenue soared 429% to come in at $61.89M.

For 2026, CapEx is expected in the range of $30B to $35B, with the company planning to double active power capacity to more than 1.7 gigawatts by year-end.</span><span></span></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
