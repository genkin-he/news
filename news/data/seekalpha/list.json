Mgmt. flagged that the beat was driven by stable growth in the core business and a step-up in growth contribution from AI workloads,\" said Materne and his team.</p>\n<p>The analysts see fiscal first quarter/ fiscal 2027 product revenue guidance of $1.262B to $1.267B (+27%)/ $5.660B (+27%) as solid. The analysts added that the guidance does not currently include much upside from AI products, and the Observe acquisition is expected to contribute about 1 point of growth to product revenue in fiscal 2027.</p>\n<p>\"Given SNOW’s history of beating by ~3pts, the guide essentially infers acceleration to ~30%,\" said Materne and his team.</p>\n<p>Morgan Stanley maintained its Overweight rating but reduced the price target on the stock to $245 from $270, noting that fourth quarter results showed unlocks from AI have set the stage for durable growth in fiscal 2027.</p>\n<p>\"Product rev growth improved to 30% in 4Q with 1Q27/FY27 guide of +27% coming ahead of expectations. With full year of Snowflake Intelligence, clear momentum with Cortex Code and a stable core, we see a path to 30% growth in FY27, which we think ultimately will get rewarded,\" said analysts led by Sanjit Singh.</p>\n<p>Wells Fargo kept its Overweight rating and cut the price target to $210 from $290, noting that AI can drive upside to fiscal 2027 guidance.</p>\n<p>\"SNOW has one of the best opportunities to capture AI usage in SW [software]. Cortex Code is an unlock for both migrations and non-technical users, and this larger TAM can drive more query volume. Core biz is strong and additional AI upside is worth waiting for,\" said analyst Ryan MacWilliams and his team.</p>\n<p>The analysts noted that the fourth quarter came in slightly below what investors hoped, but the fiscal 2027 and first quarter of fiscal 2027 guidance showed confidence in core business strength.</p>\n<p>In addition, MacWilliams and his team said that the fiscal 2027 outlook presents a path to about 30% exit revenue growth, and they think growing adoption of Cortex AI could be a key lever.</p>\n<p>\"We believe investors may not be appreciating the benefits Cortex Code brings to the broader Cortex AI suite, and how AI can drive data gravity and AI use cases towards SNOW,\" the analysts added.</p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">How's that for an encore?</p>\n<p>Nvidia (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a></span>) not only <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556780-nvidia-pops-q4-results-guidance-blow-past-wall-streets-forecast\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"topped\">topped</a> fourth-quarter estimates by a wide margin, but its guidance surprised even the most bullish analysts. The Jensen Huang-led company expects sales for the next quarter to be $78B, plus or minus 2%, well above Wall Street's forecast of $72.8B. </p>\n<p>Nonetheless, shares only rose roughly 1% in premarket trading on Thursday. Wall Street analysts believe there's more where that came from: it will just take more time.</p>\n<p>“NVDA is clearly firing on all cylinders, both internally and across its vast supply chain, as it continues to ramp Blackwell production (GB200+GB300) while simultaneously preparing for the imminent ramp of its Vera Rubin platform (on track for C2H26),” J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur wrote in a note to clients. “Even so, the stock response suggests investors were left wanting more, which we think is tied to continued uncertainty around the growth trajectory for NVDA’s Data Center business in CY27, given massively expanded capex budgets for key customers (aggregate capex for the top 5 US hyperscalers is now forecast to grow ~70% Y/Y to $650B+ in CY26) alongside significantly compressed FCF profiles. Taking a step back though, with the stock trading at ~19x pre-call Street CY27E EPS, NVDA to us looks like a coiled spring that has been tightened even further post this set of results.”</p>\n<p>Sur has an Overweight rating on Nvidia and upped his price target to $265 from $250 after the results. </p>\n<p>Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore had a similar take, in that he was “surprised” by the muted reaction to the stock, given that the results were the “largest, cleanest beat and raise in the history of the semis industry.” Moore has an Overweight rating on Nvidia and raised his price target to $260 from $250.</p>\n<p>“We would continue to argue that the long term also looks pretty good, while conceding that the growth next year will still be somewhat capital markets driven,” Moore wrote in a note to clients. He added that the questions about the hyperscalers free cash flow generation may be part of the reason for the muted reaction, but that could be alleviated by increased token monetization. </p>\n<p>“LLM frontier model developers are calling for hundreds of gigawatts of compute capacity by 2029,” Moore continued. “Paying for all of that will be challenging, but we continue to point out that the compute demand is needed to manage inference/token growth, not aspirational training clusters, for the most part. NVIDIA believes that the cash issues will be resolved by the cash flows of AI factories being much better than expected - but that in turn requires token monetization that is also better than expected. While we would stop short of believing the most bullish 5-year views, we do continue to think that there is no visibility to any pause in the current levels of strong demand.”</p>\n<p>RBC Capital Markets analyst Srini Pajjuri said the muted reaction suggests a concern from the market about “peaking revenue momentum,” but it's unlikely to slow down massively.</p>\n<p>“While y/y growth should eventually moderate from current (70%+) levels, we expect strong double-digit growth to sustain well into CY27,” Pajjuri wrote. “Our base case is for a gradual slowdown in hyperscaler capex, which we believe valuation is already discounting to a large extent.” He reiterated his Outperform rating on Nvidia and raised his price target to $250 from $240.</p>\n<p>Others, including Seeking Alpha analyst <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/semiconductor-analyst\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Semiconductor Analyst\">Semiconductor Analyst</a>, had similar takes. “The level of capex growth left a strong chance of another round of positive surprises in NVDA’s earnings,” Seeking Alpha analyst <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/semiconductor-analyst\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Semiconductor Analyst\">Semiconductor Analyst</a> said in an email. “I think this quarter showed exactly that. Big techs are now slightly above 50% of the data center revenue mix (taking a bit of share), which also suggests other revenue sources remain healthy. Agentic AI adoption is accelerating fast, and it is the most tangible driver of hardware demand in this stage of the AI rollout.” </p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
