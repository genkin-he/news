The company's 3Q revenue, 4Q guide, and initial outlook for 2026 came in below consensus, with management pointing to delayed Relationship Management campaigns with retailers, continued supplier challenges and spend scrutiny, and unforeseen seasonality in the newer Revenue Recovery space weighing on the near-term growth outlook,\" said analysts led by J. Parker Lane.</p>\n<p>The analysts added that the company's long-time Executive Vice president and Chief Revenue Officer Dan Juckniess is retiring at the end of the year, with Eduardo Rosini (former Sage, Intuit, and Microsoft) joining as executive vice president and chief commercial officer on Dec. 1.</p>\n<p>\"While we remain believers in the company's competitive positioning and the size of the addressable opportunity, we believe signs of stabilization/improvement in the end-market are needed for investors to gain confidence in the growth outlook,\" said Lane and his team.</p>\n<p>Cantor downgraded SPS's stock to Neutral from Overweight and reduced the price target to $80 from $135.</p>\n<p>\"SPSC reported mixed-to-negative 3Q results with Recurring revenue missing consensus (Visible Alpha) on myriad headwinds; profitability made up some of the shortfall, but ultimately FCF missed as well,\" said analysts led by Matthew VanVliet. \"Additionally, mgmt provided weaker 4Q guidance than was implied in the FY25 guide post-2Q, and its initial 2026 growth outlook also missed Street expectations.\"</p>\n<p>The analysts noted that this has led them to reduce their outlook and adjust their near-term thesis, which results in them downgrading the shares and cutting the price target.</p>\n<p>VanVliet and his team added that the headwinds experienced in the third quarter will persist into the fourth quarter. The new fourth quarter revenue guidance of $192.7M to $194.7M (+13% to 14% versus Street at 17%) is about $6M below the prior implied guidance.</p>\n<p>The analysts said that the initial 2026 growth outlook of 7% to 8% also underwhelmed (versus Street at about 9%) and is being negatively impacted by all the headwinds impacting the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>\"We have reservations on whether this outlook is conservative enough given the macro backdrop and apparent list of headwinds that are mostly out of the company's control. To that end, we remain cautious in the speed with which the company will be able to reaccelerate growth in the near term. Positively, despite the lower growth expected in 2026, management continues to expect to expand EBITDA margins by 200 bps,\" said VanVliet and his team.</p>\n</body></html>",
