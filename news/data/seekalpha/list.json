            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Starz Entertainment Corp. (STRZ) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Jeffrey Hirsch, President and CEO, stated that \"2025 was a very successful year, one in which we exceeded all of our financial guidance. It's a feat we're especially proud of amidst the pressures you see happening across the industry.\" He highlighted ending the year at an all-time high of 12.7 million OTT subscribers, representing a 7.6% year-over-year increase, and noted the addition of 370,000 OTT subscribers in the fourth quarter alone. Hirsch emphasized that Starz exceeded its $200 million adjusted OIBDA outlook by 2%, delivering $204 million, and finished the year with leverage at 2.9x versus a 3.1x guide.</li>\n<li>Hirsch reported that original programming such as Spartacus and Power Book IV: Force Season 3 fueled subscriber growth, with Power Book IV achieving a 57% increase in in-season viewership. He also detailed a slate of anticipated 2026 originals, including the conclusion of Outlander, Power Book III: Raising Kanan, Fightland, Blood of My Blood, and the return of P-Valley.</li>\n<li>The company restructured its Canadian business into a licensing revenue stream and completed production on Fightland, now with Sky as a co-commission partner. Hirsch announced, \"we will not be disclosing subscribers starting with the March 2026 quarter\" and will focus on OTT revenue growth, profitability, and deleveraging.</li>\n<li>Hirsch added that Starz is \"uniquely positioned to capitalize on potential M&amp;A opportunities\" due to its tech stack and digital conversion record.</li>\n<li>Scott MacDonald, Chief Financial Officer, stated, \"Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $56 million, up over 100% sequentially due to lower programming amortization, lower advertising marketing and higher revenue.\" MacDonald noted net debt of $589 million, total gross debt of $625 million, and cash of $36 million at quarter end.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hirsch reported, \"Our outlook for 2026 is strong. We expect OTT revenue to grow. We expect to deliver low single-digit percentage adjusted OIBDA growth versus 2025. We anticipate generating between $80 million to $120 million of positive unlevered free cash flow, converting the business to positive equity free cash flow. And we expect to end the year at approximately 2.7x leverage.\"</li>\n<li>MacDonald indicated that the improvement in cash flow is expected to come from \"lower cash content spend in 2026 versus 2025, which drives a closer alignment of cash content spend with the programming amortization expense reflected on our income statement.\"</li>\n<li>The company confirmed a strategic shift away from reporting quarterly subscriber counts, emphasizing revenue, cash flow, and margin expansion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>MacDonald reported, \"Total revenue in the quarter was $323 million, up 60 basis points on a sequential basis.\" The revenue increase was primarily driven by content licensing revenue from the restructured Canadian business.</li>\n<li>Adjusted OIBDA for the full year reached $204 million, surpassing the $200 million outlook, and leverage at year-end stood at 2.9x.</li>\n<li>The company ended the quarter with $589 million in net debt, $625 million in gross debt, and $36 million in cash, with no borrowings outstanding on its $150 million revolving credit facility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Brent Penter, Raymond James: Asked about drivers behind the 2026 margin target and revenue trajectory. Hirsch responded, \"You'll see a slight improvement in '26, but the lion's share of the improvement really comes in '27 and '28 when you start to see the Starz originals really become a lion's share of our programming slate.\"</li>\n<li>Penter also inquired about M&amp;A constraints. Hirsch explained that, \"any kind of deal that we do, we'd have to stick within that kind of leverage constraint to keep it around. We don't really want to operate in a business that's 4x, 5x, 6x levered.\"</li>\n<li>Thomas Yeh, Morgan Stanley: Sought insight on OTT subscriber retention. Hirsch indicated that a combination of a strong slate and longer-term annual offers is \"really lead[ing] us to push churn down over the next 12 to 18 months.\"</li>\n<li>Yeh asked about distribution partnerships. Alison Hoffman, President of STARZ Networks, stated, \"The bundles that we have in place are expanding our TAM... They're revenue accretive and then also ultimately are driving better retention for the business.\"</li>\n<li>David Joyce, Seaport Research Partners: Probed about OIBDA and free cash flow cadence. MacDonald replied, \"From a P&amp;L cadence, you'll see very consistent over the year, especially in the first 3 quarters. The fourth quarter in '26 will be a more positive quarter.\"</li>\n<li>Vikram Kesavabhotla, Baird: Asked about the Sky partnership and international content demand. Hirsch responded, \"the slate that we've designed, we've obviously designed it with international revenue in mind.\"</li>\n<li>Douglas Wardlaw, JPMorgan: Asked about the balance between spin-offs and new originals. Hoffman explained, \"what you'll see is you'll see us using these reliable franchises to launch new IP and establish new IPs with audiences.\"</li>\n<li>Matthew Harrigan, Benchmark: Inquired about AI and post-Lionsgate development. Hirsch stated, \"AI is a -- it's going to be a very powerful tool to enhance the business... but I think the business is really grown on the success of the uniqueness of our originals.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts expressed constructive, but probing interest in free cash flow, M&amp;A strategy, and international growth, occasionally pressing for greater detail on margin improvement and capital allocation priorities.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and forward-looking tone, repeatedly emphasizing strong guidance, cash flow improvements, and strategic discipline. Hirsch stated, \"We expect to deliver low single-digit percentage adjusted OIBDA growth versus 2025,\" and MacDonald described cash flow improvement as \"a significant improvement over the year.\"</li>\n<li>Compared with the previous quarter, management's tone was more assertive about the company's positioning, while analysts continued to focus on operational execution and long-term value.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance language shifted from affirming prior targets to outlining specific financial and operational milestones for 2026, including the move away from reporting subscriber counts.</li>\n<li>Strategic focus moved further toward owned content, international licensing, and bundling partnerships.</li>\n<li>Analysts in both quarters sought clarity on margin expansion and M&amp;A, but recent questions highlighted capital allocation as leverage approaches the 2.5x target.</li>\n<li>Key metrics showed sequential revenue and OIBDA growth and a reduction in leverage from 3.4x to 2.9x.</li>\n<li>Management's tone was more confident, underscoring the business's transformation and cash flow trajectory.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited ongoing declines in traditional linear customers and the impact of seasonal promotions on revenue.</li>\n<li>The transition from linear to digital continues to present operational and subscriber churn risks.</li>\n<li>The company acknowledged that content spend alignment and cash flow normalization are still in progress, especially in early 2026.</li>\n<li>Hirsch indicated that any M&amp;A activity would be managed conservatively to avoid over-leveraging the business.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Starz closed 2025 with all-time high OTT subscribers, exceeded its adjusted OIBDA outlook, and achieved sequential revenue growth, propelled by original programming and a restructured Canadian business. Looking ahead, the company targets $80 million to $120 million in unlevered free cash flow, low-single-digit OIBDA growth, and a further reduction in leverage to 2.7x by the end of 2026, all while shifting focus to revenue and cash flow rather than subscriber counts. Management points to continued content investment, international expansion, and disciplined capital allocation as drivers for future growth and profitability.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/strz/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Fox Factory Holding Corp. (FOXF) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CEO Michael Dennison stated the company is executing a comprehensive plan focused on improving profitability, shifting its guidance approach to lead with adjusted EBITDA. Dennison explained, “We have a comprehensive plan. We're executing against it, and we want to make sure you leave with a clear understanding of the building blocks and how they translate into meaningful improved margins.”</li>\n<li>Dennison highlighted the completion of Phase 1 of the profit optimization plan, delivering $25 million in savings through footprint optimization and supply chain improvements. He announced the start of Phase 2, which centers on business line rationalization, supply chain productivity, and significant reductions in operating expenses, targeting approximately $50 million of incremental savings in fiscal 2026.</li>\n<li>The CEO revealed the company is exiting non-accretive businesses, including the Phoenix, Arizona operations (Shock Therapy, Upfit UTV, Geiser), to improve margins and simplify the business model. “We are aggressively evaluating all noncore businesses and all product lines across the entire FOX portfolio and we'll pursue appropriate action where the return profile does not meet our expectations.”</li>\n<li>Dennison announced a reduction in CapEx spending, targeting approximately 2% of revenue in 2026, and the formation of a Board Transformation Committee to advise on further margin improvement opportunities.</li>\n<li>Regarding leadership, Dennison has assumed responsibility for AAG to drive critical actions as Dennis Schemm focuses on broader cost transformation as CFO.</li>\n<li>CFO Dennis Schemm stated, “Total consolidated net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 were $361.1 million, an increase of 2.3% versus the same quarter last year. Gross margin was 28.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 28.9% in the fourth quarter last year, with the decrease primarily driven by shifts in our product line mix and impact of tariffs.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The company introduced full year 2026 guidance reflecting a decline in top line expectation due to divestitures, product line rationalization, and a slightly down market while targeting meaningful margin expansion.</li>\n<li>Schemm outlined, “We expect full year 2026 net sales in the range of $1.328 billion to $1.416 billion, which at the midpoint represents a year-over-year decline of approximately 6.5% and is largely a combination of the divestitures, product line rationalization and a slightly down market that we mentioned. We are guiding to adjusted EBITDA in the range of $174 million to $203 million, which represents a margin of 13.7% at the midpoint or approximately 200 basis points of improvement relative to full year 2025.”</li>\n<li>First quarter 2026 net sales are expected in the range of $343 million to $369 million, with adjusted EBITDA of $27 million to $34 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjusted net income, normalizing for a $295.2 million noncash goodwill impairment, was $8.3 million or $0.20 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA was $35 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.7%.</li>\n<li>The company paid down $13 million of debt in the fourth quarter and $33 million for the year, bringing fiscal year-end debt to $673.5 million.</li>\n<li>CapEx was noted to have been over 3% of revenue but is projected to drop to about 2% in 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Peter McGoldrick, Stifel: Asked about the impact of divestitures on the organic business. Schemm responded that removing Geiser, Upfit UTV, and Shock Therapy will result in “a couple hundred basis points of improvement” in AAG margins and confirmed Marzocchi is not included in current divestiture plans.</li>\n<li>Anna Glaessgen, B. Riley Securities: Inquired about the rationale for divesting the Phoenix business. Dennison explained, “While they're great businesses, they are hard to own in our portfolio because of the draw on capital, the draw on SG&amp;A and the dilution in the margin for that time frame.”</li>\n<li>Glaessgen also asked for 2026 market expectations. Schemm clarified, “We are going to scale down the business through thoughtful divestitures and product line rationalization. That will be the bulk of that decrease of about 6.5% at the midpoint.”</li>\n<li>Scott Stember, ROTH Capital Partners: Asked about tariffs. Schemm stated, “In 2025 was $50 million of gross tariff impact. We were able to offset $25 million...going forward into 2026, we're estimating an additional $30 million of gross tariff impact, and we expect to mitigate about 50% of that.”</li>\n<li>Stember asked about leverage. Schemm said, “We are at 3.74 versus a covenant ratio of 4.5.”</li>\n<li>Craig Kennison, Baird: Asked about pursuing tariff refunds and divestiture proceeds. Dennison confirmed, “We will do everything possible to get a refund for sure” and proceeds will go to “debt reduction.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed for clarity on divestiture impacts, margin drivers, and tariff headwinds, reflecting a slightly negative to neutral tone. Questions focused on the rationale for business exits, the durability of cost savings, and market expectations.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and proactive tone, emphasizing execution and control. Dennison stated, “We're not simply managing through a cycle. We're fundamentally repositioning this company to deliver greater operating leverage.”</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management displayed increased urgency and detail regarding cost actions and margin improvement, with less emphasis on growth stories and more on restructuring.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The current quarter featured a significant strategic shift, with active divestitures and a focus on profitability versus the previous quarter’s emphasis on innovation and customer engagement.</li>\n<li>Guidance language changed from cautious optimism to explicit margin expansion targets and cost reduction commitments.</li>\n<li>Key metrics such as adjusted EBITDA margin are now central to the outlook, while top-line growth takes a secondary role.</li>\n<li>Analyst attention shifted from product launches and OEM partnerships to the implications of cost actions, divestitures, and tariff mitigation.</li>\n<li>Management’s tone moved from highlighting growth and operational improvements to a more urgent, action-oriented stance on profitability and portfolio optimization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited ongoing tariff impacts, projecting a $15 million net headwind in the first half of 2026 after mitigation efforts.</li>\n<li>Temporary aluminum supply disruptions impacted Q4 revenue by approximately $8 million, though these challenges are described as short term.</li>\n<li>The company faces ongoing margin pressures from tariffs, supply chain issues, and the complexities of business rationalization.</li>\n<li>Analysts questioned the sustainability of margin improvement and the risk of further divestitures affecting core business stability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Fox Factory is undertaking aggressive portfolio rationalization, cost-cutting, and margin expansion, targeting $50 million in cost reductions for 2026 and a 200 basis point increase in adjusted EBITDA margin. While the company expects a top-line decline due to divestitures and continued macro headwinds, management asserts these moves will provide a stronger foundation for future growth and improved leverage. The near-term focus is on profitability and operational efficiency, with leadership and the Board aligned on executing targeted actions and further evaluating noncore businesses.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/foxf/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
