Huang <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874926-nvidia-corporation-nvda-q4-2026-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"seemed\">seemed</a> to hint at a Groq-related announcement on the company's earnings call. “As we did with Mellanox, we will extend NVIDIA's architecture with Groq's innovations to enable new levels of AI infrastructure performance and value,” he explained. “We look forward to sharing more at GTC next month.”</p>\n<p>For the VR200 NVL72, Pu expects the Vera Rubin line of the GPU rack to “enhance” Nvidia's product leadership, given it is backed by the latest version of high-bandwidth memory, compared to Google's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) v8AX’s HBM3e.</p>\n<p>The scale-out of co-packaged optics announcements could precede higher volumes and predate an acceleration in the supply chain in the back half of 2026 and 2027, leading to higher estimates for Nvidia, Pu said.</p>\n<p>Other analysts have suggested that Nvidia could unveil the next-gen Feynman chips at GTC, as well as the latest 1.6-nanometer technology from Taiwan Semiconductor (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>).</p>\n<p>Nvidia GTC is set to run between March 16 and March 19, with Huang expected to provide a keynote address on March 16.</p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

Morgan estimates that Apple AI companion devices could reach up to 50M units and a $25B revenue opportunity by 2030. A $25B contribution would constitute more than two-thirds of Apple's annual revenue from its Wearables segment.

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">U.S. President Donald Trump said Saturday that the U.S. military has begun “<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558949-trump-confirms-us-began-major-combat-operation-against-iran\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"major combat operations\">major combat operations</a>” in Iran, confirming American participation in coordinated strikes after Israel launched attacks on Iranian targets.</p>\n<p>Here’s Trump’s address in full:</p>\n<p>\"A short time ago, the United States military began major combat operations in Iran. Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime. A vicious group of very hard, terrible people. Its menacing activities directly endanger the United States, our troops, our bases overseas, and our allies throughout the world.</p>\n<p>For 47 years, the Iranian regime has chanted Death to America and waged an unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder, targeting the United States, our troops and the innocent people in many, many countries. Among the regime’s very first acts was to back a violent takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, holding dozens of American hostages for 444 days. In 1983, Iran’s proxies carried out the marine barracks bombing in Beirut that killed 241 American military personnel.</p>\n<p>In 2000, they knew and were probably involved with the attack on the USS Cole. Many died. Iranian forces killed and maimed hundreds of American service members in Iraq. The regime’s proxies have continued to launch countless attacks against American forces stationed in the Middle East in recent years, as well as U.S. naval and commercial vessels and international shipping lines. It’s been mass terror, and we’re not going to put up with it any longer.</p>\n<p>From Lebanon to Yemen and Syria to Iraq, the regime has armed, trained and funded terrorist militias that have soaked the earth with blood and guts. And it was Iran’s proxy, Hamas, that launched the monstrous Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, slaughtering more than 1,000 innocent people, including 46 Americans, while taking 12 of our citizens hostage. It was brutal, something like the world has never seen before.</p>\n<p>Iran is the world’s number one state sponsor of terror, and just recently killed tens of thousands of its own citizens on the street as they protested. It has always been the policy of the United States, in particular my administration, that this terrorist regime can never have a nuclear weapon. I’ll say it again, they can never have a nuclear weapon. That is why in Operation Midnight Hammer last June, we obliterated the regime’s nuclear program at Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. After that attack, we warned them never to resume their malicious pursuit of nuclear weapons, and we sought repeatedly to make a deal. We tried. They wanted to do it. They didn’t want to do it. Again they wanted to do it. They didn’t want to do it. They didn’t know what was happening. They just wanted to practice evil. But Iran refused, just as it has for decades and decades.</p>\n<p>They’ve rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can’t take it anymore. Instead, they attempted to rebuild their nuclear program and to continue developing the long range missiles that can now threaten our very good friends and allies in Europe, our troops stationed overseas, and could soon reach the American homeland. Just imagine how emboldened this regime would be if they ever had, and actually were armed with nuclear weapons as a means to deliver their message.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, the United States military is undertaking a massive and ongoing operation to prevent this very wicked, radical dictatorship from threatening America and our core national security interests. We’re going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally again obliterated. We’re going to annihilate their navy. We’re going to ensure that the region’s terrorist proxies can no longer destabilize the region or the world and attack our forces, and no longer use their IEDs, or roadside bombs as they are sometimes called, to so gravely wound and kill thousands and thousands of people, including many Americans. And we will ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon. It’s a very simple message. They will never have a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>This regime will soon learn that no one should challenge the strength and might of the United States Armed Forces. I built and rebuilt our military in my first administration and there is no military on earth even close to its power, strength or sophistication. My administration is taking every possible step to minimize the risk to U.S. personnel in the region. Even so, and I do not make this statement lightly, the Iranian regime seeks to kill. The lives of courageous American heroes may be lost, and we may have casualties. That often happens in war. But we’re doing this not for now. We’re doing this for the future. And it is a noble mission. We pray for every service member as they selflessly risk their lives to ensure that Americans and our children will never be threatened by a nuclear-armed Iran. We ask God to protect all of our heroes in harm’s way. And we trust that with his help, the men and women of the armed forces will prevail. We have the greatest in the world, and they will prevail.</p>\n<p>To the members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, the armed forces and all of the police, I say tonight that you must lay down your weapons and have complete immunity. Or in the alternative, face certain death. So, lay down your arms. You will be treated fairly with total immunity, or you will face certain death. Finally, to the great proud people of Iran, I say tonight that the hour of your freedom is at hand. Stay sheltered. Don’t leave your home. It’s very dangerous outside. Bombs will be dropping everywhere. When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.</p>\n<p>For many years, you have asked for America’s help. But you never got it. No president was willing to do what I am willing to do tonight. Now you have a president who is giving you what you want. So let’s see how you respond. America is backing you with overwhelming strength and devastating force. Now is the time to seize control of your destiny, and to unleash the prosperous and glorious future that is close within your reach. This is the moment for action. Do not let it pass.</p>\n<p>May God bless the brave men and women of America’s armed forces. May God bless the United States of America. May God bless you all. Thank you.\"</p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

U.S. President Donald Trump has urged Iranians to take control of their government after the military campaign concluded.</p>\n<p>The attacks mark the first time Iran has targeted all major U.S. military sites in the region simultaneously. In previous flare-ups, Tehran had typically carried out what it described as “limited” retaliatory strikes. Last June, Iran targeted Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in response to earlier U.S. and Israeli operations.</p>\n<p><span>Iran, a founding member of OPEC, is a key global oil producer and controls territory along the strategically crucial Strait of Hormuz, a chokepoint that handles roughly 20% of the world’s oil supply. </span>Crude Oil Futures (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CL1:COM\" title=\"Crude Oil Futures\">CL1:COM</a>) were up +2.7% to $67.02/bbl at press time, while Brent Futures (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CO1:COM\" title=\"Brent Futures\">CO1:COM</a>) rose +2.8% to $72.87/bbl.

The company sought assurances that its systems would not be used for fully autonomous weapons or mass surveillance of Americans, while the DoD pushed for broad authority to use the models for all lawful military purposes.</p>\n<p>Anthropic (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANTHRO\" title=\"Anthropic\">ANTHRO</a>) on Thursday said that the company “<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558446-anthropic-ceo-rejects-pentagon-demand-for-unrestricted-model-access-says-threats-wont-sway-it\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"cannot in good conscience\">cannot in good conscience</a>” allow the Department of Defense to use its models in all lawful use cases without limitation, adding that the agency’s threats do not change its position.</p>\n<p>“Earlier today, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth shared on X that he is directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a supply chain risk. This action follows months of negotiations that reached an impasse over two exceptions we requested to the lawful use of our AI model, Claude: the mass domestic surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weapons. We have not yet received direct communication from the Department of War or the White House on the status of our negotiations,” Anthropic said in a <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-comments-secretary-war\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"statement\">statement.</a></p>\n<p>“We believe this designation would both be legally unsound and set a dangerous precedent for any American company that negotiates with the government.</p>\n<p>“No amount of intimidation or punishment from the Department of War will change our position on mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons.
