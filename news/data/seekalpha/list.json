Don’t expect any tectonic shifts in leadership, though. Abel has vowed to maintain Berkshire Hathaway’s unique culture. Both the Q4 earnings and the letter to shareholders will come out at 8:00 AM ET on Saturday.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>One thing that Buffett, who remains chairman, has promised is that Berkshire Hathaway will always have a large pile of cash. At Sept. 30, 2025, the stash stood at $381.7B. Any reduction in that amount signals that the company found compelling investment opportunities. Abel is likely to discuss where he sees investing opportunities in the current environment.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>\"The first year won't be easy, as all of his steps will be watched closely by the public and compared against the legend, Buffett,\" said SA Analyst<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4864771-berkshire-keeps-falling-and-we-keep-buying\" target=\"_blank\" title=\" Millennial Dividends\"> Millennial Dividends</a>. The first burning question, perhaps, is, what will he do with the $380B cash pile?</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The SA analyst also muses about the potential for Berkshire to issue a dividend, something Buffett allowed only once in his tenure.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>SA Analyst </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/bohdan-kucheriavyi\"><span>Bohdan Kucheriavyi</span></a><span> considers Berkshire’s shares to be undervalued. If Buffett and Abel agree, the company may have bought back some of its shares in Q4 after pausing buybacks for five quarters.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Another point of speculation is whether Abel will eventually divest Berkshire Hathaway's 27.5% stake in Kraft Heinz (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KHC\" title=\"The Kraft Heinz Company\">KHC</a>), which Buffett describes as one of his biggest blunders. Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4550181-kraft-heinz-pauses-separation-to-invest-in-growth-profitability\" target=\"_blank\" title=\" Kraft Heinz halted its plan \"> Kraft Heinz halted its plan </a>to split Kraft from Heinz to return the business to profitable growth.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The biggest part of Berkshire’s wholly owned operating business is insurance, which includes Geico and several others. The Visible Alpha consensus estimate for Q4 premium revenue is $22.6B, down 0.6% from a year ago. By contrast, premium revenue in Q3 2025 was $22.4B, up 0.2% Y/Y.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Also keep an eye on the company’s energy business, specifically PacifiCorp, which is under pressure due to lawsuits related to Pacific Northwest wildfires in 2020 that are blamed on its power lines. Earlier this week, a jury </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557819-berkshire-s-pacificorp-owes-another-305m-in-latest-oregon-wildfire-verdict\"><span>awarded $305M to wildfire </span></a><a href=\"https://survivors.in\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span>survivors</span></a><span> in a case against the company.

While that advance underscores bitcoin’s resilience following multiple boom-and-bust cycles, it falls short of the performance delivered by large-cap U.S. stocks. </p>\n<p>Over the same timeframe, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SP500</a>) — now hovering around 6,875—has climbed roughly 80%. The index’s return is nearly double that of bitcoin, reflecting sustained corporate earnings growth, strong participation from mega-cap technology firms, and continued investor appetite for equities despite intermittent volatility.</p>\n<p>The comparison may come as a surprise to some market participants, particularly given bitcoin’s outsized rallies during certain stretches. However, sharp drawdowns in 2022, 2026, and periods of consolidation have tempered its cumulative five-year performance.</p>\n<p>While bitcoin remains a highly watched asset within the digital currency ecosystem and a popular vehicle for speculative capital, recent data suggest that traditional equities have offered superior risk-adjusted returns over the medium term.</p>\n<p>The divergence

Hill stated, \"Our Q4 growth was 20%, which was sequential improvement from 18% in Q3 '25, with Caris Assure delivering 59% year-over-year growth in Q4 '25 and continuing to gain traction.\"</li>\n<li>President David Spetzler presented interim results for the ACHIEVE-1 study, supporting the upcoming launch of Caris Detect, reporting \"Stage I and II combined, ACHIEVE-1 reported 63.1% sensitivity… specificity in the screening population…99.1%.\"</li>\n<li>CFO Luke Power explained the strategic approach to investments: \"For the full year of 2026, we expect total revenue for existing solutions to be in the range of $1.0 billion to $1.02 billion, which represents growth of approximately 23% to 26% compared to 2025.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Caris projects 2026 total revenue in the range of $1.0 billion to $1.02 billion, anticipating molecular profiling growth of approximately 21% to 22%, and therapy selection volume growth of around 20% year-over-year.</li>\n<li>Power stated, \"Within the total revenue range, we expect molecular profiling to grow approximately 21% to 22% in 2026. But excluding prior year additional revenue from exceeding previous accruals, this implies a Molecular Profiling growth rate of approximately 26% to 28%.\"</li>\n<li>Tissue ASP is expected to reach approximately $4,000 per case in Q1 2026 and $4,200 for the full year, while blood ASP is guided to $2,400–$2,500.</li>\n<li>Pharma and research revenue is expected to be $75 million to $85 million for 2026.</li>\n<li>Operating expenses are expected between $590 million and $595 million, with CapEx rising to $60 million, primarily for early detection capacity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Q4 2025 total revenues reached $293 million, up 125% year-over-year, with molecular profiling revenue at $282 million and pharma R&amp;D services at $10.8 million.</li>\n<li>Annual molecular profiling revenues were $766.7 million, up 120%, with clinical case volumes rising 22% to approximately 199,300 profiles and an average sales price increase of 79%.</li>\n<li>Gross margins improved to 75% in Q4 2025, up from 54% in Q4 2024, and sequentially up from 68% in Q3 2025.</li>\n<li>Caris reported positive adjusted EBITDA of $138 million and free cash flow of $67 million for the full year.</li>\n<li>Cash on hand ended above $800 million, up $43 million in Q4.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Daniel Brennan, TD Cowen, asked about volume growth breakdowns and revenue pacing. Luke Power answered, \"The 20% is broken up very similar to Q4. So lower teens for tissue and then high 50s, lower 60s for blood from a growth standpoint.\"</li>\n<li>Subhalaxmi Nambi, Guggenheim, inquired about specificity data for MCED and the pharma R&amp;D environment. David Spetzler clarified the clinical context of specificity; Power explained, \"the $75 million to $85 million, it's based on looking at what we've been able to do historically from a base run rate, knowing that we signed the additional Genentech deal.\"</li>\n<li>Michael Ryskin, BofA, questioned ASP guidance. Power responded, \"the $4,200 is kind of where I want to guide to right now. And then we'll progress throughout the year. We'll get additional contracts.\"</li>\n<li>Vijay Kumar, Evercore, probed ASP assumptions and OpEx spending rationale. Power confirmed, \"on tissue, we put out the metrics that obviously, over 75% of our tissue volume is going to be under the PLA code.\"</li>\n<li>Colleen Babington, Wolfe Research, asked about CapEx allocation. Power explained, \"One of the key items from the CapEx standpoint is, obviously, our new Assure assay is going to be switched over to the Nova X.\"</li>\n<li>Patrick Donnelly, Citi, and others focused on MCED sales force buildout and MRD product timelines, with management indicating a phased hiring approach and data-driven launch timing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts pressed for specificity on volume growth, ASP sustainability, and investment returns, with a neutral to slightly positive tone regarding the outlook and company strategy.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident, measured tone during prepared remarks, frequently referencing the company's strong financial position and strategic flexibility. During Q&amp;A, responses reflected caution and discipline, especially regarding guidance and spending, as seen in Power's statement, \"But from a guidance standpoint, like the $4,200 feels really, really good right now, and that's what I want to stick with from the guidance standpoint.\"</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, management's confidence level rose, reflecting stronger margins and financial results. Analysts maintained a similar level of cautious optimism, shifting focus slightly more toward execution of growth investments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue growth accelerated to 125% in Q4 2025 from 113% in Q3, with gross margins increasing to 75% from 68%.</li>\n<li>Management shifted guidance language from cautious to more assertive, outlining a clear path to $1 billion revenue and expanded investments in early detection and commercial infrastructure.</li>\n<li>Analysts' focus moved from platform expansion and margin sustainability to execution of commercial scale and pipeline launches.</li>\n<li>Operating expenses are planned to rise more significantly in 2026, reflecting a transition toward investment-heavy growth.</li>\n<li>The tone from management is more assertive, highlighting strategic flexibility and a readiness to invest from a position of financial strength, while analysts continue to probe for clarity on the pace and impact of these investments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management acknowledged the need for measured investment in sales and R&amp;D, noting, \"we're taking a measured approach with our volume.\"</li>\n<li>The ramp-up in operating expenses and CapEx for early detection initiatives could pressure near-term profitability if returns on investment are delayed.</li>\n<li>Specificity and sensitivity data for Caris Detect, while promising, remain interim, with additional validation pending. Spetzler cautioned, \"These are interim results, which we are extremely excited about...that blinded validation is currently in process.\"</li>\n<li>Competitive landscape and reimbursement environment remain dynamic, requiring ongoing execution in payer contracting and commercial expansion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Caris Life Sciences management highlighted a record-breaking fourth quarter with strong revenue growth, robust margins, and sustained profitability, positioning the company for a 23–26% revenue increase in 2026. The company is investing aggressively in its early detection platform and expanding its commercial organization, while maintaining financial discipline and a positive cash flow profile. Interim results from the Caris Detect study indicate promising clinical performance, with further validation expected. Management is confident in leveraging its strengthened balance sheet and proprietary data set to capitalize on market opportunities in precision medicine and early cancer detection throughout 2026.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/cai/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Goldman Sachs BDC (GSBD) Q4 2025</p>\n<h3>Management View</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Vivek Bantwal, Global Head of Financing Group, emphasized GSBD's ongoing integration into the broader direct lending platform, reporting \"the proportion of our portfolio benefiting from the 2022 reorganization has grown to 57%, while 43% still reflects deals made prior to the integration, which we call the legacy portfolio.\"</li>\n<li>Bantwal stated, \"Our exposure to first lien investments increased to 97% of the portfolio from 89% during that same period,\" highlighting the platform's preference for senior secured debt.</li>\n<li>He noted an 84% increase in median EBITDA of the portfolio since year-end 2021, reaching $71.8 million at year-end 2025, and a significant reduction in PIK as a percentage of total investment income to 9% in Q4 2025 from 15.3% in Q4 2024.</li>\n<li>Bantwal addressed software sector risks, explaining that AI's impact is \"highly company-specific and nuanced,\" and described the firm's proactive AI risk framework incorporated since early 2025.</li>\n<li>David Miller, Co-CEO, reported net investment income per share of $0.37 and net asset value per share of $12.64, with a supplemental dividend of $0.03 per share and a base dividend for Q1 2026 of $0.32 per share. He stated, \"GSBD committed approximately $1.2 billion in new commitments throughout the year in 35 new deals.\"</li>\n<li>Tucker Greene, President &amp; COO, detailed the portfolio's weighted average yield of 9.9%, net debt-to-EBITDA of 5.9x, and interest coverage of 2x, and highlighted the proactive sale of a software loan at $0.99 due to anticipated AI risk.</li>\n<li>Stanley Matuszewski, CFO, stated, \"We ended the fourth quarter of 2025 with total portfolio investments at fair value of $3.3 billion, outstanding debt of $1.9 billion and net assets of $1.4 billion.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management expects continued momentum in M&amp;A to drive credit demand, with Bantwal stating, \"A more favorable M&amp;A environment should stimulate greater demand for credit financing.\"</li>\n<li>The company anticipates spreads to \"moderately widen during the market dynamics we've seen over the past month.\"</li>\n<li>Miller expressed comfort with the current dividend level: \"We feel very comfortable with the dividend as it sits today.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Financial Results</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Reported net investment income per share was $0.37 for Q4 2025, and net asset value per share was $12.64 at quarter end, down approximately 1% from Q3, largely due to net realized and unrealized losses.</li>\n<li>Total investment income for Q4 was $86.1 million, with GAAP and adjusted after-tax net investment income reported at $42.2 million and $41.8 million, respectively.</li>\n<li>The net debt-to-equity ratio increased to 1.27x from 1.17x in the prior quarter.</li>\n<li>Nonaccrual investments increased slightly to 2.8% and 1.9% of the portfolio at amortized cost and fair value, respectively, from 2.5% and 1.5% in Q3.</li>\n<li>Share repurchases totaled $15 million for the quarter, with $52.2 million repurchased since June 2025.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Finian O'Shea, Wells Fargo, asked about the distinct underwriting approach on the Clearwater deal. Bantwal responded that providing a \"100% solution\" for take-private transactions offers sponsors confidentiality and streamlined execution, and that in such cases, \"we get paid incremental economics for that.\"</li>\n<li>O'Shea inquired about semi-liquid structures and their risk, to which Bantwal explained, \"We don't have different standards for different vehicles or different types of investors. We have a single process that goes to a single investment committee.\"</li>\n<li>O'Shea questioned the dividend's sustainability; Miller replied, \"We feel very comfortable with the dividend as it sits today,\" noting optimism for spread widening.</li>\n<li>Heli Sheth, Raymond James, asked about spillover income strategy and deployment, with Matuszewski stating there are \"no current plans\" for a special distribution, but it remains an option.</li>\n<li>Sheth also asked about deal pipeline composition; Bantwal said, \"I wouldn't say the composition of the deal flow is changing.\"</li>\n<li>Ethan Kaye, Lucid Capital Markets, addressed AI risk framework application and legacy exposures. Miller admitted some legacy assets \"would be more point solutions,\" and noted proactive exits, stating, \"We sold it at $0.99 to other lenders that didn't have the same viewpoint.\"</li>\n<li>Kaye asked about share repurchases; Matuszewski indicated a measured approach, with $23 million of room remaining and decisions contingent on market opportunities and leverage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysts' tone was generally neutral, focused on clarity around underwriting, dividend sustainability, and risk management, with questions reflecting a search for transparency rather than skepticism.</li>\n<li>Management maintained a confident and measured tone in both prepared remarks and Q&amp;A, frequently emphasizing discipline, proactive risk management, and comfort with dividend and portfolio quality.</li>\n<li>Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management remained steady in sentiment, with slightly more emphasis on AI risk management and dividend sustainability this quarter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidance language shifted to emphasize AI risk and proactive portfolio management, with an increased focus on software sector diligence and legacy asset rotation.</li>\n<li>Net investment income per share decreased from $0.40 to $0.37, and net asset value per share declined from $12.75 to $12.64.</li>\n<li>The net debt-to-equity ratio rose from 1.17x to 1.27x.</li>\n<li>Share repurchases continued but at a reduced pace compared to the prior quarter.</li>\n<li>Management's confidence in underwriting and AI risk was more pronounced, while analysts continued to focus on dividend stability and risk exposures.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Management cited the potential impact of AI on software business models as a key risk, noting continued vigilance and use of a formal AI disruption risk framework.</li>\n<li>Nonaccrual investments increased slightly, though management highlighted proactive exits and ongoing monitoring.</li>\n<li>Analysts raised concerns about dividend coverage, legacy asset risk, and the pace of originations versus repayments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Final Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Goldman Sachs BDC management highlighted progress in portfolio rotation, a strong focus on first lien senior secured investments, and proactive risk mitigation, particularly around AI exposure in the software sector. The company reported disciplined origination, sustained share repurchases, and confidence in dividend coverage despite a modest decline in net investment income and an uptick in nonaccrual loans. Management remains focused on leveraging the Goldman Sachs platform to source quality opportunities and manage evolving market dynamics, with a clear process in place for handling legacy asset risks and AI-related disruptions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/gsbd/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p>\n<div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div>\n</body></html>",
