Three months ago, the company reported solid Q3 FY2026 earnings, significantly <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4524145-nvidia-non-gaap-eps-of-1_30-beats-by-0_04-revenue-of-57b-beats-by-1_91b\">beating all<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> estimates</span></a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">. However, the stock lost upside momentum and has remained flat. Before heading into Q4 FY2026, there were several concerns weighing on the stock's sentiment, including higher input costs, H200 sales in China, fears of AI overspending, increasing competition, and its premium multiple.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846090-nvidia-q3-the-flipside-of-everything-is-sold-out-is-concerning\">last 3Q FY2026 analysis</a>, I maintained a Hold rating on NVDA, citing that too much good news had been priced in. When everyone believes that NVDA is a \"no-brainer\" trade, that overexuberance can become a concern and the stock might take a breather. As we saw, a strong Q3 earnings failed to lift the stock, and a robust <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4524145-nvidia-non-gaap-eps-of-1_30-beats-by-0_04-revenue-of-57b-beats-by-1_91b\">Q4 earnings</a> also failed to reignite the hype. The stock briefly popped more than 3% but later reversed all the gains. Some argued that it could be due to higher inventory buildup, while others concern that hyperscalers are building out their own data centers, raising questions about NVDA's long-term growth sustainability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, the stock's 10 months range-bound move is a de-valuation process, and I believe this process is now complete. The non-GAAP P/E fwd has compressed to 24x, down from 41x in 10 months ago (because non-GAAP forward 12-month EPS consensus has improved significantly while the stock price remained flat). Most importantly, management guided that data center revenue will accelerate on a QoQ basis throughout FY2027, and gross margin will sustain in the mid-70s. Therefore, I believe this Q4 post-earnings pullback could be a buying opportunity.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"Sequential Revenue Growth Throughout Calendar 2026\" (FY2027)</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49592191-17720618828124783.png?io=w640\" alt=\"The company model\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"626\" height=\"398\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49592191-17720618828124783.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49592191-17720618828124783.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49592191-17720618828124783.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The company model</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20314563-nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-third-quarter-fiscal-2026#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">Q4 earnings</a>, NVDA had rallied 13% from the February low and is now hovering near all-time highs, so the technical resistance could be hard to break through. It was also likely that investors had already priced in robust Q4 results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Like prior quarters, the company once again topped all the estimates by a wide margin. As shown in the chart above, Datacenter revenue YoY growth has maintained a \"V-shaped\" rebound since 2Q FY2026. Considering the 1Q FY2027 midpoint revenue guidance, the total revenue growth will accelerate further to $78 billion, up 77% YoY. I assumed Datacenter revenue will be 90% of its total revenue in 1Q FY2027, which is 30 bps higher than the FY2025 level. This would imply $70.2 billion in Datacenter revenue in 1Q ($78 billion x 90%), or 79% YoY growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874926-nvidia-corporation-nvda-q4-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a>, CEO Jensen Huang reiterated robust chip demand. He highlighted that the agentic AI inflection has arrived. The company expects \"sequential revenue growth throughout calendar 2026, exceeding what was included in the $500 billion Blackwell and Rubin revenue opportunity we shared last year.\" The Q1 FY2027 revenue outlook suggests a 12.7% QoQ growth. Even assuming a flat 10% sequential growth momentum would imply 70% YoY Datacenter revenue growth for FY2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Keep in mind, forward revenue guidance does not assume any revenue from China. Although the U.S government has approved H200 products for China-based customers, the company hasn't generated any sales so far. They are also not sure when these products will be eventually shipped into China.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gross Margin Concern is Overblown</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49592191-17720640868036644.png?io=w640\" alt=\"The company model\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"571\" height=\"382\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49592191-17720640868036644.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49592191-17720640868036644.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49592191-17720640868036644.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The company model</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recently we've seen a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4871168-micron-stock-ddr5-prices-surge-since-september-could-rise-further-2026\">significant price squeeze</a> in HBM and DRAM, up 400% to 500% since September of last year. I was concerned that higher input costs could pressure NVDA's gross margin outlook. However, Q4 FY2026 gross margin continued to expand, driven by increasing Blackwell ramp. Moreover, Q1 FY2027 gross margin is also expected to be resilient at 75%. In the earnings call, management forecasted a \"mid-70s\" gross margin outlook for FY2027. Based on $7.5 billion non-GAAP operating expenses guidance, we can estimate non-GAAP operating margin will be at 65.4% in Q1, slightly down from 67.7% in the previous quarter.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Increasing Competition from Other Players</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, NVDA remains the top leader in the AI chip market in the near to medium term. with tremendous demand for its Blackwell and Rubin chips. However, investor sentiment could still be impacted by fears of increasing competition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earlier this week, Advanced Micro Devices (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>) <a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2026-2-24-amd-and-meta-announce-expanded-strategic-partnersh.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> that Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) will buy AMD Instinct GPUs to deploy 6 GW of data center begin in 2H 2026. This news initially sent AMD's stock 9% higher. The company also issued performance-based warrants to META for up to $160 million shares of AMD common stock. The AMD's CEO noted that these warrants would only vest if the stock price reaches $600. In addition, major hyperscalers are also aggressively expanding their data center and design their own AI chips. For example, Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) just raised $500 million to develop chips to directly challenge NVDA's dominance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The CEO Jensen warned,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>\"Our competitors in China bolstered by recent IPOs are making progress and have the potential to disrupt the structure of the global AI industry over the long term.\"</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If NVDA can generate additional revenue from H200 sales to China, it would add a revenue tailwind. However, it's unpredictable for now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trading at 24.7x of Non-GAAP Forward P/E Now</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49592191-17720708490801642_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1220\" data-height=\"615\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49592191-17720708490801642_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"The company model\" width=\"640\" height=\"323\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49592191-17720708490801642_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49592191-17720708490801642_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49592191-17720708490801642_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49592191-17720708490801642_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The company model</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Due to the relentless rally in 1H 2025, NVDA's valuation was one of my major concerns last year. Back in August 2025, non-GAAP P/E fwd was 41x. Since then, the stock has barely moved. I believe that the current 41x of non-GAAP fwd on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/valuation/metrics\">Valuation page</a> has a lag. Based on forward 12-month EPS consensus on the table above (from 1Q FY2027 to 4Q FY2027), NVDA's non-GAAP P/E fwd should be at 24.7x ($196/ $7.94), which justifies an upgrade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA generated $96.6 billion FCF in FY2026, indicating a 44.6% FCF margin. Assuming a flat FCF margin in FY2027, the company is expected to generate $149 billion in FCF in FY2027. So, its P/FCF fwd is at 31.5x. Compared to these hyperscalers that would have negative FCF next year, NVDA's stock demonstrates much better quality.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, the 4Q FY2026 earnings indicated that robust AI demand continues in CY2026. Datacenter revenue (excluding China) will accelerate further into FY2027. Despite higher input costs, gross margin remains resilient. Although I believe long-term growth sustainability remains a major concern for investors due to raising competition, NVDA's fundamentals show no signs of slowing at this stage. From the valuation perspective, the non-GAAP P/E fwd is at 24.7x, which is a bargain (assuming current forward EPS consensus is reliable). Therefore, I believe it's time to turn bullish on NVDA. and I've upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold.</p>",

Whether it was the investment itself or the managers of private equity, we never really saw the risk-reward as well aligned for our tastes. The main reason behind not wanting to chase either<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> class, came down to valuations. For private equity, it was fairly clear that marking these had usually diverged radically from reality. We saw that in 2022 where tech related private equity mark downs were minimal while the NASDAQ and Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 ETF (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ\" title=\"Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 ETF\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">QQQ</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) were down over 20%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, not all forms of private and exotic markets carry the same level of risk. There are some like CLO Equity, which have created the worst returns on the spectrum. Funds like Eagle Point Credit Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ECC\" title=\"Eagle Point Credit Company Inc\">ECC</a>) and Oxford Lane Capital (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OXLC\" title=\"Oxford Lane Capital Corporation\">OXLC</a>) have destroyed capital faster than you can say \"I am counting my income.\" On the other hand, Private Credit is generally a lot safer. The reason is that there is usually tons of Private Equity that is standing ahead in line of that same Private Credit.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Blue Owl Capital Inc. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OWL\" title=\"Blue Owl Capital Inc.\">OWL</a></span>)</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We touched upon the recent woes of these private equity/private credit managers in our article, \"<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4866668-ares-management-bonds-offer-interesting-7-percent-yields\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4866668-ares-management-bonds-offer-interesting-7-percent-yields\" target=\"_blank\">Bonds Offer Interesting 7.0% Plus Yields</a>\". We have also written about OWL and the BDCs it manages in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4667169-blue-owl-i-vs-iii-why-you-should-give-a-hoot\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4667169-blue-owl-i-vs-iii-why-you-should-give-a-hoot\" target=\"_blank\">\"Blue Owl I Vs. III: Why You Should Give A Hoot\". </a>Now, we will get straight into what the current concerns are and why you should still consider taking a position in this company.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">1) Data Center Exposure</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We have been warning on the ridiculous chase into data centers for some time. In fact, the numbers were so crazy from the perspective of Oracle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL\" title=\"Oracle Corporation\">ORCL</a>), that we titled that piece, \"<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4822995-oracle-suspension-of-disbelief\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4822995-oracle-suspension-of-disbelief\" target=\"_blank\">Suspension Of Disbelief</a>\". So if investors are anxious about data centers, we get it. What we don't get is this. </p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_28c0312c26962f18d9b77662f719ea1d.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_28c0312c26962f18d9b77662f719ea1d.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_28c0312c26962f18d9b77662f719ea1d.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_28c0312c26962f18d9b77662f719ea1d.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ORCL has absolutely become a conjoined twin with the fate of its data center bet. But OWL is a different beast (bird?) and has a very different level of exposure. Take for example its deal with (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>). The $27 billion LLM ( we refuse to use \"AI\" for regurgitating, hallucinating software) data center deal is where OWL put up $2.5 billion of equity (not debt) and that is where the angst comes from. This was a unique setup that made the debt of the project (backed by PIMCO and Blackstone) safe, while OWL stands first in line to deal with the bubble fallout. </p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>The debt priced at +225 bps over Treasuries, roughly double the spread on Meta’s own corporate bonds. Yet for insurance investors, the yield looks attractive. They get Meta’s implied credit strength thanks to the RVG, which guarantees the project’s residual value for 16 years without the correlation risk of owning Meta equity.</p> <p>That guarantee, according to S&amp;P, was “the linchpin” that earned the debt its A+ rating. It effectively transfers technology-obsolescence risk (the danger that AI chips age faster than the building) back to Meta.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3464663\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3464663\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P Global </a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason that the debt earns an A+ rating is because META can walk away 4 years after it is operational, but it guarantees a minimum residual value that makes the debt holders, whole. But OWL is not a debt holder here and there in lies the concern. All that said, we find this obsession with OWL's equity funding as rather strange. That is because OWL is NOT funding it. The funds underlying OWL's investment management arm are funding it. The $2.5 billion of equity should be compared to the total AUM, which is now over $300 billion ($185 billion if you count only fee bearing capital). In return for this, the funds likely earn mid-teens return on equity. OWL has other data center deals in place, but again, these are funded from the underlying funds and make up a fraction of the total AUM. Yes, losses can occur, but these deals are not exactly \"collecting pennies in front of a steamroller\". </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2) SAAS Exposure</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, that is not all there is to the OWL news. The SAAS (software as a stop-loss, or something like that) exposure has gotten the attention of the market as well. We discussed this more in depth with the members of our service, and we won't go into all the points here. But suffice to say, we believe the odds of Claude doing a massive software displacement line up with what everyone believed about Upstart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UPST\" title=\"Upstart Holdings, Inc.\">UPST</a>)'s \"AI\" and displacement of Fair Isaac Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FICO\" title=\"Fair Isaac Corporation\">FICO</a>) and their scores in 2021. From the peak of that insanity, here are the returns for both. </p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_997c79b956a00b2a987971f5a5761939.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_997c79b956a00b2a987971f5a5761939.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_997c79b956a00b2a987971f5a5761939.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_997c79b956a00b2a987971f5a5761939.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">3) Redemption Halt</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yes OWL did stop redemptions <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4553774-blue-owl-halts-redemptions-at-private-credit-fund-targeted-for-retail-investors\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4553774-blue-owl-halts-redemptions-at-private-credit-fund-targeted-for-retail-investors\" target=\"_blank\">on one of its funds. </a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While that may sound terrifying, not every asset has the liquidity of the US Treasury market. If you had a fund, which invested in Class A apartment buildings and you had to liquidate them, there is almost no way you could do that overnight without losing a lot of spread. Private credit is a far more complicated investment and anyone buying this debt of any single investment would have to do a lot of due diligence. It isn't really designed to be sold as needed for redemptions. Stopping the liquidation process is actually the best move and prevents unnecessary losses. If investors wanted the liquidity of public markets, well, they should have stayed in public markets. We think order will be restored down the line and let's keep in mind that even this fund makes up less than 1% of OWL's AUM.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Verdict</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yes, things might go bad for private credit at some point. If that is the argument and people want to stay away, that's ok. We think private credit is well-priced and designed for good returns. It is certainly beautifully priced relative to the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>). So we think this is a good time to invest a measured amount here. We did initiate OWL covered calls the other day and they have fairly attractive returns for a flattish price. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/47392447-17716019756624203.png?io=w640\" alt=\"-\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"1124\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/47392447-17716019756624203.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/47392447-17716019756624203.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/47392447-17716019756624203.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/47392447-17716019756624203.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's App</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We also pointed out to our subscribers that the solid debt of OWL was trading at a near 7% yield to maturity.

It is also introducing new technologies to replace older, land-based offerings that have seen declines along with the rig count.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company turned in a big beat on EPS of $0.13 vs. $0.10 for Q4 2026, while missing on the topline by $454K. Analysts rate the company as an <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/OIS/research-ratings?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfCGjeaEzMsD0GXGS7jbOJOrfFseaQGdiQQ2_379Znz3anqCoWXM_faIwyXjfE%3D&amp;gaa_ts=699d9bd4&amp;gaa_sig=CXNDdk7HhWH5bVdV-xmL4VAA1jVH6WB7d49HgFGTrk7Uuzne3mNJMUpuXc99a8UG-Mx5Z1wnyFu-XlpUHrpxdw%3D%3D\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/OIS/research-ratings?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfCGjeaEzMsD0GXGS7jbOJOrfFseaQGdiQQ2_379Znz3anqCoWXM_faIwyXjfE%3D&amp;gaa_ts=699d9bd4&amp;gaa_sig=CXNDdk7HhWH5bVdV-xmL4VAA1jVH6WB7d49HgFGTrk7Uuzne3mNJMUpuXc99a8UG-Mx5Z1wnyFu-XlpUHrpxdw%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\">overweight</a> with price targets as high as $15.00. The median is $13.50-where they trade now at the apogee of the parabola. This also constitutes a 5-year high for the stock, so we will tread carefully on this one.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The business case for Oil States</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One sign that an increase in offshore activity is coming is the book-to-bill ratio for OIS. At 1.3X, it has reached the highest level in a decade. Much of this is from offshore rig upgrades and reactivations, but also from newer product offerings like their Managed Pressure Drilling—MPD, Perforating, and Mineral Riser. The company is optimistic they have turned a corner, particularly as regards international and offshore-related projects. While we agree that the offshore industry is on an upswing, it should also be noted there are capacity limits to this increase on the deepwater side. We have what we have in floating inventory, and no one is building new units. So it's ok to be optimistic-I am—but let's keep our feet on the ground. This is not 2005. There is no oil boom coming.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OIS has three primary operating segments: Offshore Manufactured Products, Completion and Production Services, and Downhole Technologies.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719386394095056_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"OIS market offerings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"362\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719386394095056_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719386394095056_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719386394095056_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719386394095056_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">OIS market offerings <span>(OIS)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cindy Taylor, CEO, commented about the upgrade cycle now underway-</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We're beginning to see those white spaces, gaps be filled in. And so rig equipment will tend to lead the recovery, and that can be riser systems, MPD systems for us, the things that we offer as well as kind of the upgrade and service cycle around that equipment, but it all feeds deepwater infrastructure, which, again, that's kind of a bread and butter for us that plays into our more proprietary products.</p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Catalyst for Oil States</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Have you ever tried to use a long pole-something 12-15' long—to wash off a spot on the eaves of your house? If you have, you likely experienced a problem common to landing out a marine riser thousands of feet below the rig floor-getting the thing to be in the position you need it to be in. Once you've overcome mechanical flexing, submarine currents, and the occasional shark (<em>as you see below from a job I worked for BP in the GoM. Once we saw the shark, we suspended operations and allowed the critter to satisfy its curiosity. It took about half an hour, but he eventually swam away into the inky-it's really dark at 3,400 below MSL, depths and we got back to work</em>.) That's curious about what you're doing, and you have it in a stabbing position-verified by your robotic camera flyby controlled by a tether from the rig's deck.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719479657586558_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"shark swimming 3,400' BMSL\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"479\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719479657586558_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719479657586558_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719479657586558_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719479657586558_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">shark swimming 3,400' BMSL <span>(Author's files)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">You want it to snap in cleanly and make the connection. Making a long story short, it doesn't always happen, and non-productive time-NPT results. Oil companies hate this and will reward companies that enable smooth operations with contracts. That appears to be the case with the OIS Flexjoint connector. The Flexjoint enables the riser to withstand currents and maintain its connection to the subsea BOP by flexing with the force. (You do not want to imagine the misery that follows an unplanned disconnect-it's bad, really bad.) Having this leading position in Flexjoint connectors is a distinct advantage for OIS.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719456108050854_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"OIS leading market positions\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"354\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719456108050854_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719456108050854_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719456108050854_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719456108050854_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">OIS leading market positions <span>(OIS)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Managed Pressure Drilling-MPD is an interesting growth area for OIS. The segment is well covered by legacy multi-service OFS companies-Big Red. Big Blue. Big Aqua and others. They don't give a lot of information about it in the filing but commented favorably on the early results in the conference call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OIS also has offerings in perforating that appear to be gaining success-in a fairly crowded marketplace. Here again the big colors hold the biggest chunks of this business. The company cited international opportunities as driving their optimism in this area.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, OIS is a legacy supplier to the offshore industry with an excellent reputation in their core offerings. When companies like Transocean (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RIG\" title=\"Transocean Ltd.\">RIG</a>) talk about upgrade and reactivation capex, they very often are talking about money that will end up on OIS' income statement. From my experience, I can tell that when a client trusts your core offerings, it makes it much easier to get field trials for new technology.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">OIS Q4 Earning Call</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OIS reported revenues of $178 million, up 8% sequentially from the third quarter. Profitability also improved with adjusted EBITDA of $23 million, representing a 9% sequential increase. Non-cash impairments on long-lived assets led to a loss of $117 mm. This was related to valuation declared on the 2018 acquisition in their Downhole Technology segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OIS generated 63% greater positive cash flow of $50 mm for the quarter than previously and 129% greater $105 mm for the year. Free cash of $94 mm was reported, a 92% rise YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Their largest segment, Offshore Manufactured Products generated revenues of $123 million and EBITDA of $25 mm at a 20% margin. Backlog for this segment was reported at $435 mm. Completion Products turned in $23 mm in revenues and $7 mm in EBITDA with an operating margin of 32%. Restructuring charges of $5 mm were noted for the segment. Downhole Technologies reported revenues of $32 mm with EBITDA of $1.3 mm-impacted by segment impairments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OIS has a new 4-year cash flow-based credit agreement, which provides for borrowings of up to $75 million. This is under a revolving credit facility that replaced their asset-based lending credit agreement. OIS has $53 million of convertible senior notes outstanding at December 31. The plan is to use U.S. cash on hand and tap their new revolver to retire these notes prior to their maturity on April 1, 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At YE 2025, OIS had $15 mm in cash on hand, had retired $71 mm in senior notes during the year, and repurchased $17 mm in stock during 2025.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Guidance for 2026</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OIS expects 2026 full-year revenues to range between $680 million and $700 million, up about 5% YoY. Full-year EBITDA should range between $90 million and $95 million, nearly double 2025. Q-1 should see revenues in a range of $150 million to $155 million and EBITDA of $18 million to $19 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strong cash flows from operations are expected for the year. With a range of $60 million to $65 million, down from 2025 due to expected working capital builds. Investments in CapEx of $20 million to $25 million are planned for the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872971-oil-states-international-inc-ois-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872971-oil-states-international-inc-ois-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">Company filings</a></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The offshore comeback has been a bit of a 'fits and starts' operation over the past couple of years. Signs are that it is accelerating all around, but further delays could impact OIS revenues and cash flows. The parabolic move higher over the past few days is concerning, as it's related more to implied tariff relief than an improvement in core business fundamentals. We haven't had the last word on tariffs yet, so there may be other shoes to drop.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Your takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think a lot of near-term growth is priced into OIS at current levels. As shown below, the company is trading far in excess of its peer group's EV/EBITDA on a TTM basis. On an NTM basis, they are more reasonable at 7.77X if they hit their revenue and EBITDA targets of $700 mm and $95 mm respectively, so let's use those numbers to estimate a closer valuation for the shares. OIS has essentially no LT debt, so with 58 mm shares outstanding and $95 mm in EBITDA 7.77X, you get a share price of $12.72.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-1771965983260553_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Offshore equipment cohort\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"254\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-1771965983260553_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-1771965983260553_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-1771965983260553_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-1771965983260553_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Offshore equipment cohort <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure><div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If I were long, I would sell at current levels to protect the substantial gains made over a very short period of time. Accordingly, I rate OIS a sell at current levels, in spite of their excellent prospects in the year to come. If they revert to their January 2026 levels of $7-8.00 per share, I would look hard at taking a position for measured growth that will surely come if the offshore renaissance becomes a reality.</p>",

But now there is an <a href=\"https://crescentenergyco.com/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Crescent-Energy-Q4-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">obvious attempt to also gain royalty interest</a>s at a good price. Diversification into these two<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> areas can help with company performance during cyclical downturns. Creating a separate royalty company as others have done can also help to finance transactions. It is yet another interest in production profits that can aid a lower breakeven. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the meantime, the dominate upstream interests in the Eagle Ford and the Permian should provide above average profitability for a management that generally builds and sells companies. There are alot improvements to be made (as well be discussed in this article) that benefit royalties as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a management that pays a lot of attention to the cash flow statement. Not only should cash flow grow, but cash flow per share should grow as well. This company made 3 significant acquisitions in fiscal year 2025. That type of activity is going to make it very hard for investors to see the progress made for the properties already owned. It also makes the quarterly report next to useless.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, as the company grows larger, the acquisitions will become less significant (as a percentage of the company). What should happen over time is that operational improvements will dominate. This is a company that will very likely be concentrating on cash flow and free cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Professionals that build companies know that cash generation is the key to getting a good price when the right time comes to sell the company. Right now, this company is clearly in buying mode. That should tell investors, that the industry overall is likely cheap (and out of favor). When management like this one decides to sell the company, that will be the time for most of us to consider cutting back our presence investing in oil and gas to wait for the next favorable time to get in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last Article</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The last article noted that the company closed the acquisition of Vital Energy. The current announcement notes that Vital Energy was only part of the company for a few days of the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But that means that because of this rather significant acquisition, the company is going to be showing considerable production growth in the present fiscal year (2026).</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720768478465462_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cresent Energy Permian Strategy Summary\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"496\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720768478465462_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720768478465462_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720768478465462_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720768478465462_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cresent Energy Permian Strategy Summary <span>(Crescent Energy Fourth Quarter 2025, Corporate Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://crescentenergyco.com/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Crescent-Energy-Q4-2025-Earnings-Investor-Presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Now that the company</a> has acquired the assets, there is an update to the potential synergy savings. Fortunately, it is on the upward revisions side. More importantly, the rig activity has been sharply reduced.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As has been mentioned in many articles here, KKR is the manager of this company. Free cash flow is a very big deal to KKR. As the company gets larger and the financial statements are not clouded with lots of one-time items, this emphasis on free cash flow (growth) is likely to present itself first.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720771359191256_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Crescent Energy Permian Synergy Details Summarized\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"463\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720771359191256_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720771359191256_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720771359191256_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720771359191256_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Crescent Energy Permian Synergy Details Summarized <span>(Crescent Energy Fourth Quarter 2025, Corporate Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Vital Energy acquisition was by far the largest acquisition of the fiscal year. At issue here is things like stock dilution (and debt) come first with the benefits likely showing in fiscal year 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is showing investors where those benefits will come from. But this acquisition also provides the company with an entry into a second very low-cost basin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, as part of a larger company, \"in-housing\" some of the operations that were contracted out is a very big deal. Vital Energy had begun some of the operational improvements noted above before the acquisition. But it had not owned much of the Permian properties itself for all that long.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a much larger company (post combination) Crescent Energy is able to probably get better prices for the production than Vital could.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, both companies had to live with existing production costs to some extent because the previous operators were likely high cost. Those high costs can be dealt with to some extent. But largely, that older production simply declines in significance as production declines. It will be replaced by lower cost production. But in terms of operating costs declining, that is a weighted average process that will take some time for the new lower well costs to gain significance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Eagle Ford</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Eagle Ford assets have largely been a part of the company for a year. There was a large Eagle Ford acquisition of less than $1 billion that closed at the beginning of fiscal year 2025. That was really the only addition to these assets of a significant size.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720777754129007_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Crescent Energy Summary Of Eagle Ford Business\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"494\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720777754129007_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720777754129007_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720777754129007_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720777754129007_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Crescent Energy Summary Of Eagle Ford Business <span>(Crescent Energy Fourth Quarter 2025, Corporate Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is the place where the savings will become apparent first because these assets are the oldest assets (for the most part) in the portfolio. This is also where most of the company production is presently. Future acquisitions could change that now that the company has a presence in the Permian.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Probably the biggest surprise is the natural gas position that is so close to export capability and may also be sold in the future to data centers as well. This was an upside that many of us did not see on the horizon at the time this company began operations. Now it is a big deal.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Debt</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This company has received one debt rating upgrade since it went public. There is a goal here to get to investment grade.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-1772078089649364_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Crescent Energy Debt Summary\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-1772078089649364_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-1772078089649364_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-1772078089649364_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-1772078089649364_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Crescent Energy Debt Summary <span>(Crescent Energy Fourth Quarter 2025, Corporate Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As noted above, things are going to definitely improve because of that goal of an investment grade rating. If the improvements shown before (and probably a few more I did not show) actually materially improve things, then that will change the debt rating fraction numerator.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This company is also faster than most to sell noncore acreage to raise cash. Probably one of the best debt managers in the business is KKR. This is what is going to make the cash flow statement the most important statement in the future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Summary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Crescent Energy did post a loss for the quarter as there was an impairment charge combined with a lot of transaction costs that were a part of the Vital Energy acquisition closing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What as more important is that cash flow grew significantly for the fiscal year while the debt ratio stayed within range for the company to still go for an investment grade debt rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As long as this company is making acquisitions, that likely means that acquisition prices are attractive (and the industry remains relatively out of favor).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That makes this idea a long-term idea with the idea that the company will be built during times of attractive acquisition prices. It will be sold when prices are cyclically strong. But that means investors need to wait patiently for the time when selling prices are attractive enough to sell the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a strong buy idea in that rarely do investors get the chance to invest alongside KKR and John Goff. That does mean success is guaranteed. But it does put the odds in favor of the investment idea succeeding. This part has not changed since the company went public.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would probably hang on to this idea until the company gets sold.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even with investors like KKR and John Goff, an investment idea can fail to work out for any number of reasons. However, there is a safety factor here in that the debt ratio is within a reasonable range. Companies with relatively low debt rarely get into serious trouble. There is every chance here that with the project improvements to acquired properties, that debt ratio will decline even if no money was used to repay debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Any acquisition can fail to meet expectations. On the other side of that both John Goff and KKR have made many acquisitions (to have a whole lot of experience making acquisitions).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">KKR is used to building and selling companies. That lowers the risk of fast growth. Fast growth has the risk of losing quality control and cost overruns. So, the experience is needed to minimize some potentially serious issues.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is extremely difficult to tell much of anything from the financial statements when a company is constantly making acquisitions. But that makes the investor evaluation of management very important to the success of the investment. At this point we are very much dependent upon management representations to tell the progress made. Debt ratings help as well.</p>",

It is worth noting the company only recently reached operating profitability, so the metric remains volatile. Still, a trend toward faster growth in profitability is evident and is reflected in very robust FCF forecasts. FCF for 2025 totaled $530 mln, hitting the upper end of <a href=\"https://ir.ringcentral.com/news/press-release-details/2025/RingCentral-Announces-Third-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Free%20cash%20flow%20guidance%20of%20%24525%20to%20%24530%20million.\" rel=\"nofollow\">management guidance</a>. For 2026, the metric is projected to rise by another 12.2% at the midpoint.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48493874-17720289569402392_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1888\" data-height=\"1059\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48493874-17720289569402392_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"RingCentral Earnings slides\" width=\"640\" height=\"359\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48493874-17720289569402392_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48493874-17720289569402392_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48493874-17720289569402392_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48493874-17720289569402392_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>RingCentral Earnings Slides</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares shot up by 30%+ above $40 on the heels of the report (later correcting to $35). We believe this was likely driven by a faster-than-expected profitability growth and the fact that AI does not yet pose a critical threat to the business. These reasons probably triggered a short squeeze. Additionally, the company announced its first-ever quarterly dividend, set at $0.075 per share, translating into an annual yield of approximately 1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our take on the report is mixed. On one hand, we see a solid track record in FCF and net income, which is typically achieved through operating expense optimization.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, management’s revenue guidance came in lower than our <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4768988-ringcentral-stock-benefits-as-ai-technologies-get-less-expensive\">estimate</a>. We had projected an acceleration in 2026 on the back of higher ARR retention. To be fair, the 4Q retention rate technically outperformed our forecast (we had expected 99.3%, matching the prior quarter, while the actual figure was almost 100%). Therefore, there is a chance that RingCentral could still succeed in accelerating its revenue growth. There are several conditions for this:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">1) The combined ARR of new AI products reached $100 mln (~4% of total ARR), as the management expected previously;</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2) There’s continued rapid growth in new products. AIR (AI Receptionist) is the fastest-growing product with 8,300+ customers, up 40%+ q/q. The model is based on minute usage, which mitigates the impact from seat reductions. ACE <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872606-ringcentral-inc-rng-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">has 4,800+</a> customers, up 144% y/y. RingCX has 1,500+ customers, nearly doubling y/y. More than 50% of large deals ($1 mln+ TCV) include RingCX;</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">3) The proportion of ARR from customers that utilize at least one monetized AI product <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872606-ringcentral-inc-rng-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">reached</a> 10%. This is a new metric tracked by RingCentral. It is noted that the retention rate for these customers exceeds 100%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48493874-17720290594624348_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1883\" data-height=\"1064\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48493874-17720290594624348_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"RingCentral Earnings slides\" width=\"640\" height=\"362\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48493874-17720290594624348_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48493874-17720290594624348_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48493874-17720290594624348_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48493874-17720290594624348_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>RingCentral Earnings Slides</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given everything mentioned above, management’s revenue guidance feels like a fly in the ointment. In terms of profitability momentum, our assumptions remain intact. As for revenue, the projected 4.5%–5.5% for the subscription segment implies a midpoint of 5%. This is below the growth of the addressable market (5.3% annually <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4768988-ringcentral-stock-benefits-as-ai-technologies-get-less-expensive\">according</a> to our initial coverage statistics), which we track. Consequently, management’s outlook implies that the company could begin losing market share in 2026 and that AI products will not have a significant impact on the general momentum, which runs counter to our expectations. But so far, RingCentral’s subscription revenue has been rising with a positive beta to the market. Even so, we are not changing our expectations for the company at this time and are maintaining our existing 2026 forecasts, keeping both our target price and BUY rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>We are maintaining the EBITDA forecast for 2026 at $401 mln (+22.5% y/y).</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>We are maintaining the target price at $67. We are also maintaining the rating at BUY.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the coming quarters, we will also monitor subscription revenue and ARR to see if the market share shrinks. In the event that growth does slow, we will revise our forecast downward. However, the valuation has a wide margin of safety due to high profitability and FCF yield, which implies that a BUY rating will likely remain in place even if the valuation is revised downward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottomline</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">RingCentral continues to demonstrate strong profitability momentum and robust free cash flow generation, supporting our positive long-term view. However, management’s 2026 revenue guidance raises concerns about potential market share pressure and slower top-line acceleration than we had anticipated. But we still believe the company is capable of beating management's guidance. For now, we maintain our BUY rating and $67 target price, given the company’s solid FCF yield and improving operating leverage.</p>",

Another one!</p> <p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4873954-hubbell-small-picture-looks-ok-but-big-megatrend-picture-is-fantastic\">On 2/24/26, I published</a> a report on Hubbell (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUBB\" title=\"Hubbell Incorporated\">HUBB</a>). My “Buy” recommendation characterized it as a “strong capital allocator.” I even went so far as to suggest a Warren Buffett comparison.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">HUBB wasn’t a one-off. There are several great companies in this field. So, I’ve long been bullish on infrastructure stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But I haven’t been impressed with the portfolios of thematic ETFs like Global X US Infrastructure Development ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PAVE\" title=\"Global X US Infrastructure Development ETF\">PAVE</a>) that supposedly specialize in this area.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The funds performed well. But as I found too often with thematic ETFs, many of the names in the portfolios didn’t match the kinds I consider truly representative of the stated theme. For example…</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><span>The 1/31/26 top ten holdings of PAVE, the largest such ETF by assets, included Howmet Aerospace (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HWM\" title=\"Howmet Aerospace Inc.\">HWM</a>) and railroads Norfolk Southern (NS) and CSX (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSX\" title=\"CSX Corporation\">CSX</a>).</span></li> <li><span>The next largest peer (as per what’s shown as such on Seeking Alpha) is the FlexShares STOXX Global Broad Infrastructure Index ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFRA\" title=\"FlexShares STOXX Global Broad Infrastructure Index ETF\">NFRA</a>). Its 1/31/26 top ten included Deutsche Telekom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DTEGY\" title=\"Deutsche Telekom AG\">DTEGY</a>), Softbank (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SFTBY\" title=\"SoftBank Group Corp.\">SFTBY</a>), Verizon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VZ\" title=\"Verizon Communications Inc.\">VZ</a>), AT&amp;T (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/T\" title=\"AT&amp;T Inc.\">T</a>), Canadian Pacific Kansas City (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CP\" title=\"Canadian Pacific Kansas City Limited\">CP</a>), and Canadian National (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CNI\" title=\"Canadian National Railway Company\">CNI</a>).</span></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>I was similarly unhappy with other infrastructure ETFs. </span><span>I suppose everybody gets to define infrastructure their own way.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>But I wish I could find an ETF issuer that defines it as I wish—the physical plant of the U.S. To me, that includes industrial buildings, highways, government facilities, etc. Lately, tech-related facilities have become a larger part of the mix. I’m referring, here, to chip manufacturing and data centers.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>So, I’ve been ignoring the infrastructure ETFs. Instead, I’ve been finding and writing about individual companies that appeal to me.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>As a long-time devotee of fundamental stock screening, this turned out to have been an easy task. These companies often have excellent fundamentals. So, they’ve been bubbling up to the top of my screening/ranking results for the last several years.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Most have been in the </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/screeners/9409af1449-Top-Construction-and-Engineering-Stocks\"><span>Construction and Engineering</span></a><span> industry. A few, including HUBB, are classified as </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/screeners/9409af144a-Top-Electrical-Components-and-Equipment-Stocks\"><span>Electrical Components and Equipment</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>All such companies I profiled on Seeking Alpha (see below) have been pretty good capital allocators. But HUBB seemed to be a cut above this already strong group.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>And then, I studied up on Comfort Systems (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FIX\" title=\"Comfort Systems USA, Inc.\">FIX</a></span>). It beats HUBB.

Traditionally, it handled HVAC systems. Over time, FIX also added piping, plumbing, and electrical work.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cue, now, material I’ve added to some past reports discussing Peter Lynch extolling the virtues of being dull. In sum, boring companies attract little investment community attention or hype and, therefore, give investors opportunities to buy before the shares move up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To conserve word count, I’ll put on my legal hat and use some court lingo: With respect to dull stock content in this <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4858362-nvent-electric-from-behind-scenes-dull-to-behind-scenes-growing-cool\">write-up</a>, I repeat, reiterate, and re-allege all such verbiage as if set forth more fully herein.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, if this was really an adversarial court case, opposing counsel might object pointing out that FIX’s valuations (see below) don’t look like what we’d expect from a dull company that excites nobody.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The answer (ruling): Sometimes dull companies serve exciting customers, and this causes even Monotony Inc. to generate too much growth even for sexy-story-loving Mr. Market to completely ignore.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given FIX’s past share price performance and current valuation, I’d completely understand if one might say “the time to buy was back… whenever.” We can say likewise for many other stocks—Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>), Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>), etc., etc., etc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key to FIX, and all such situations, is how the company stands now. Does its present situation suggest better times ahead?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For FIX, I say “yes.” The factors that contributed to its past success remain active…</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><strong>Acquisitions</strong></em></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Like most of the infrastructure companies I favor, FIX has been a serial acquirer (and expects to remain so going forward). That’s definitely been a factor in its growth. And even though these acquisitions have largely been accretive, they have not been merely financial…</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They’ve been operationally strategic. And they’ve made FIX a more serious player in terms of electrical construction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FIX’s corporate evolution accomplished two things.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, it led to FIX dramatically boosting diversification. It now serves many different aspects of construction and engineering.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/192600-17720594496704473_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1464\" data-height=\"1106\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/192600-17720594496704473_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"rev breakdown\" width=\"640\" height=\"483\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"483\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/192600-17720594496704473_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/192600-17720594496704473_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/192600-17720594496704473_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/192600-17720594496704473_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FIX IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And areas into which FIX has been expanding have been faster growing.

So, let’s continue…</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><strong>People</strong></em></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Countless CEOs wax poetic about how great the company’s people are. I’ve heard enough of these praise orgies to brush most of them off as corporate puffery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But sometimes, it seems sensible to pay more attention.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FIX is a capital-light people business. Its so-called assets are the relationships it has with the many tradespeople craft professionals, who work on its projects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We often hear talk of <a href=\"https://www.uti.edu/blog/education/skilled-trades-shortage\" rel=\"nofollow\">shortages of skilled labor</a>, due to things like retirements of baby boomers, and fewer young people choosing to enter into the trades. So obviously, paying well will help FIX attracting a good workforce.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But more is needed. And indeed, we saw above in the Financial Statement Highlights that FIX isn’t exactly crushing its own margins by overpaying.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Work conditions and terms of employment are also important.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CFO Trent McKenna said at the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4852617-comfort-systems-usa-inc-fix-presents-at-sidoti-year-end-virtual-investor-conference\">12/11/25 Sidoti virtual conference</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>[L]ong-term thinking, as you think about, okay, the value of Comfort Systems, it really is embedded in its ability to be the place where we're the best place where a craft professional wants to build a career. And we have some advantages from that because of our scale and also our ability to kind of manage the locality and the localness of a business so that a craft professional wants to be part of that business, while at the same time benefiting from the scale of Comfort Systems.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Going further, he<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4852617-comfort-systems-usa-inc-fix-presents-at-sidoti-year-end-virtual-investor-conference\"> added</a>…</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>[I]n the craft professional world, you have a labor that wants to stay within about 100 miles of their home. And that's how they like to do it. And then you have a labor that wants to travel, wants to go somewhere and spend 4 to 6 months working on a project and then go back to where they call home. So those 2 people, we needed to supplement comfort systems on the traveler side. So that was why we brought in Kodiak, and they've been really helpful in helping us flex into all this demand and be able to meet the requirements that our customers have.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(Kodiak, a construction-oriented staffing company, is an interesting example of a FIX <em>strategic</em> acquisition!)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management pointed out that it usually gets so many job opportunities, it’s able to be picky, to choose those it deems the best.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That has a direct impact on its people. Later in the conference, Chief Accounting Officer Julie Shaeff <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4852617-comfort-systems-usa-inc-fix-presents-at-sidoti-year-end-virtual-investor-conference\">said…</a></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>[P]rice is an important factor when we look at projects, but it's not everything. And what we really are looking for is project work that's really good for our employees that our employees are happy to work on that they are -- it's going to be safe. It's in a good geography. It's easy to get to. It's -- the projects -- we think we'll have a good chance of being executed well…. But I also think it's been -- the fact that we've been able to pick the work we're on has contributed to those good outcomes.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, is this real or is it puffery? We can each form our own opinion. For me, based on financial performance that’s consistent with all this, I believe it’s real.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><strong>Margins</strong></em></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Look again at the above Financial Statement Highlights table.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">How ‘bout those margin trends!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As noted above, FIX isn’t likely overpaying to attract people.

Many companies would see that as the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. And every year brings FIX further along that path.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, let’s not forget acquisitions. FIX is likely to keep expanding this way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, there are good reasons to expect FIX to remain fundamentally strong in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And it seems that the 2027 estimates shown above are every bit as likely as past estimates to be revised upward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risk</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One form of risk is present not just for FIX but for all companies, especially those owned by growth investors. I’m referring to earnings-related sentiment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FIX has a track record of upward estimate revisions. But if FIX disappoints in the future, the stock could suffer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Remember, too, this could hit the stock even if FIX continues to perform great. What counts nowadays isn’t how well FIX does. It’s how well FIX performs relative to analyst expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And there’s the big business risk—data centers. Is there a building bubble? (There’s also risk pertaining to industrial construction in general.) But for now, that’s likely being dwarfed by data-center bubble risk.)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I disagree with the bubble talk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’ve extensively discussed this very recently in connection with some of FIX’s peers. I won’t repeat it all now. You can see my thoughts <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4863540-dycom-industries-and-me-to-the-aidata-centers-bubble-bears-just-saying-no\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4862449-afraid-of-data-center-bubble-not-sterling-infrastructure-not-me-still-buy\">here</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But today, I would like to bring in an intriguing new wrinkle—fears that AI will badly disrupt software, among other things.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4873384-ai-market-crash-just-got-a-lot-worse\">Here’s an interesting article</a> on the topic from Seeking Alpha REIT expert <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/jussi-askola-cfa\">Jussi Askola, CFA</a>. He discusses a wide range of endeavors. And he suggests how badly AI can hurt them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’m not suggesting you agree or disagree with him. Speaking for myself, I. think he’s partly right. I believe AI will change things, but not destroy them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consider software. Have you ever tried to program anything, even an Excel macro? If so, you know the make-or-break issue is in the logic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Professionals create flow charts. Dilettantes like me use pseudocode (plain-English statements in lieu of statements or commands that conform to a particular programming language).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI can and is creating the correct programming syntax. But where do you think the goals and logic come from? If you access Claude’s coding features, how do you start?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Somewhere along the line, a human has to prompt AI. And how much might that prompt engineering have to resemble what, say, a Python developer must do to get going?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you don’t believe me, open Claude (or Gemini or ChatGPT or Grok or anything) and consider what <em>you</em>, the human, must do before AI can do anything!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So again, I see AI as a catalyst for change, and possibly even disruption. But I don’t see it as a destroyer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, here’s the punch line…</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>How on earth can we even imagine anything remotely like AI eating software and other industries unless we wind up with a humongous amount of new data center capacity!</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Logic mandates that we can’t have it both ways.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One can’t dump data center plays because we won’t need all these facilities and, at the same time, dump software giants like Salesforce (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRM\" title=\"Salesforce, Inc.\">CRM</a>), CrowdStrike (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD\" title=\"CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\">CRWD</a>), etc., because AI will take over their businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At some point, we and Mr. Market will have to pick a lane.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I tend to do on wide highways, I prefer middle lane. (I shun the sloths who can drive you crazy in the right lane and the speed demons who terrorize the left lane.)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this context, it means seeing software and other companies as survivors, albeit after having evolved, and seeing AI and data centers as having long runways, as discussed <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4863540-dycom-industries-and-me-to-the-aidata-centers-bubble-bears-just-saying-no\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4862449-afraid-of-data-center-bubble-not-sterling-infrastructure-not-me-still-buy\">here</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In sum, the only bubble I see bursting is the excess of self-congratulatory and often mocking in tone bearish AI rhetoric.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>What To Do About FIX Stock</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here are FIX’s valuation ratios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/192600-1772060091387286_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"972\" data-height=\"376\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/192600-1772060091387286_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"val\" width=\"640\" height=\"248\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"248\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/192600-1772060091387286_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/192600-1772060091387286_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/192600-1772060091387286_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/192600-1772060091387286_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Analyst's computations and summary from data displayed in Seeking Alpha Portfolios</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yes, the P/E FWD and EV/S ratios are high.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Think of ratios like that as sticker prices like what you see everywhere else. How much you’re willing to pay depends on what you expect to get. Surely you can’t imagine you’d get a new Toll Brothers (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TOL\" title=\"Toll Brothers, Inc.\">TOL</a>) luxury home for the same price Cavco (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVCO\" title=\"Cavco Industries, Inc.\">CVCO</a>) charges for its factory-built homes!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the stock market, the what you expect to get is measured by expected future growth (EPS for P/E FWD and sales for EV/S), and by company quality.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The table shows us FIX offers prospects for ample growth. And FIX’s PEG FWD is low enough that it could still remain attractive relative to benchmarks even if the Proj. 3-5Y EPS GR doesn’t fully live up to the current expectation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And as I discussed in connection with HUBB <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4873954-hubbell-small-picture-looks-ok-but-big-megatrend-picture-is-fantastic\">on 2/24/26</a>, don’t forget to consider quality. (Many folks miss this element of valuation. If you’re into quant modeling, higher quality/lower business risk mandates the use of lower discount rates. That pushes P/E and EV/S upward—see <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4854961-reassessing-heico-perennially-high-pe-upgrading-to-neutral\">here</a>.) Now, look above at the FIX core fundamentals and financial statement highlights tables. Those show FIX as being a very high-quality company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, I believe FIX shares are well worth the current valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The price chart suggests Mr. Market agrees.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/192600-1772060156249104_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1502\" data-height=\"1142\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/192600-1772060156249104_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"pr chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"487\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"487\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/192600-1772060156249104_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/192600-1772060156249104_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/192600-1772060156249104_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/192600-1772060156249104_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>StockCharts.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That’s a great chart.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 10-day exponential moving average (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EMA\" title=\"Emera Incorporated\">EMA</a>) is above the 50-day EMA. And both are still climbing. We’re not looking at a rocket ship. I’d prefer to label this as gentle momentum.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consider, too, Chaikin Money Flow (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMF\" title=\"iShares California Muni Bond ETF\">CMF</a>) and the Chaikin Oscillator (CO). Both measure which party to trades is more motivated. CMF does it for institutional investors. CO does it for the market in general.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both indicators have been spending a lot of time comfortably ensconced in bullish territory.

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRCL\" title=\"Circle Internet Group, Inc.\">CRCL</a></span>) is back on the radar. </p> <p>I see a company at the intersection of two forces reshaping modern<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> finance. The bulls are looking at the migration of dollars into blockchains, with USDC seen as a main beneficiary. The bears are put off by the recurring swings in the crypto space between risk-on exuberance and risk-off deleveraging. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am in the middle of this spectrum. On one hand, I cannot ignore the 72% yoy jump in USDC circulation last year. On the other hand, I am concerned that the circulation of USDC is pegged to Bitcoin prices, as noted by the low single-digit sequential growth in Circle's reserve income in Q4 (vs double digit in Q3). </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other revenue segment is still small compared to the reserve income stream. This means that the top-line is highly exposed to the circulation of USDC and, to a lesser extent, interest rates. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am cautiously bullish on Circle considering a timeframe of 12-18 months. Anything less than that is too uncertain to predict. I explain below why. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 Overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Circle’s core product is USDC (USD Coin), a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin that moves on blockchains. As seen below, this stablecoin trails Tether in terms of market cap:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17720982932381673_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1574\" data-height=\"373\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17720982932381673_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Defillama\" width=\"640\" height=\"152\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17720982932381673_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17720982932381673_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17720982932381673_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17720982932381673_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Defillama</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the adoption of USDC last year was quite impressive. At the end of 2025, the USDC in circulation was <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874577-circle-internet-group-inc-crcl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">$75–75.3 billion</a>, up 72% yoy, outpacing the broader CFX stablecoin market. Given the decline in the overall crypto market in Q4, I found this growth rate quite impressive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of revenue generation, the main income stream comes from the interest on the reserve assets backing USDC. For reference, USDC is backed 1:1 by reserve assets. In Q4, the company reported $733 million in reserve income, up 69% yoy. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Wait a second, interest rates <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS\" rel=\"noopener\">came down</a> in the past year, from 4.48% in December 2024 down to 3.72% in Dec 2025. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17720988042513354_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1320\" data-height=\"465\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17720988042513354_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FRED\" width=\"640\" height=\"225\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"225\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17720988042513354_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17720988042513354_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17720988042513354_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17720988042513354_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FRED</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">How did revenue grow by 69% then?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The answer you’re looking for is volume.

In Q3, the company reported<a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260225882643/en/Circle-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Fiscal-Year-2025-Financial-Results\" rel=\"nofollow\"> $711M</a>. That means that Q4 reserve income was up by just 3%. Peanuts, when compared to the sequential growth in Q3 of 12.1%. I will discuss more in the risk section. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other revenue stream is grouped into the \"other revenue\" bucket in the company's <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1876042/000187604225000047/crcl-20250930.htm#:~:text=the%20declaration%20date.-,Other%20revenue,-Other%20revenue%20generally\" rel=\"nofollow\">financial reporting</a>. That includes subscription and services (which have a recurring nature) and transaction revenue (which are mainly usage-based). In the last quarter, the company reported $37M in other revenue, and they guided $150–$170M for FY26. I wasn't particularly impressed with this guidance. Why?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Annualized, the $37M in Q4 represents $148M. That's pretty much the lower end of the guidance for \"other revenue\" this year. At the midpoint, we're talking about 8.1% yoy growth (vs the $148M annualized value). Call me crazy, but that's not a compelling growth story. That said, if the crypto market bounces back, management may upgrade that guidance, which brings me to my next point.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Circle Is Still A Beta On Crypto</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock, along with the volume circulation of USDC, seems to correlate to the overall price swings of crypto, despite USDC being pegged to the dollar. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let me explain. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I said in the last section, the sequential growth between Q2 and Q3 last year was 12%. In comparison, the sequential growth between Q3 and Q4 was only 3%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am not surprised in the slightest. Take a look at the chart below showing the price change in Q4 of my favourite ETF proxy for Bitcoin: the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17721001180709453_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1910\" data-height=\"843\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17721001180709453_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Guidance Terminal\" width=\"640\" height=\"282\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17721001180709453_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17721001180709453_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17721001180709453_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17721001180709453_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Guidance Terminal</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Please note that since the end of Q4, there has been another 20% haircut in IBIT. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on the above, I can conclude with a relatively high level of certainty that the circulation of USDC depends on the crypto market, which is mainly driven by Bitcoin. In my view, the more excitement there is in the crypto space (i.e., \"investors\" bidding up Bitcoin's price), the more USDC transactions happen. I think I am not alone with my hypothesis. The IMF <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/-/media/files/publications/dp/2025/english/usea.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">states</a> stablecoins are \"currently mostly used for crypto trades.\" </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The question now is whether Bitcoin can turn around in the near term. If it does, that should push up USDC circulation, which will naturally push the reserve income of Circle. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, I don't think the lows in crypto are behind us. After Bitcoin's worst day since FTX earlier this month, the price failed to recover in a V-shaped style. In fact, just a few days back, Bitcoin was trading for $62k, confirming <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4866830-bitcoins-worst-day-since-ftx-is-this-the-start-of-a-crypto-death-spiral\">my thesis</a> that the bounce on February 6 was just a dead cat bounce. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, looking at a 12-18 month timeframe, I have little to no doubts that risk will be back in the markets and Bitcoin will retest new highs again. I have some skin in the game with my thesis on the recovery of crypto, as I own shares in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4871611-bitmine-immersion-ethereum-biggest-public-whale\">Ethereum's biggest public whale</a>, BMNR.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back to Circle and to my thesis that this stock is a beta on the overall crypto space, another point that favors my hypothesis is the post Q4 earnings rip. Some may think that the results were spectacular. For the argument I stated at the beginning of this section, I digress. Take a look at the crypto tape (1-D return) for February 25:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-1772098204445714_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1761\" data-height=\"466\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-1772098204445714_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Guidance Terminal\" width=\"640\" height=\"169\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-1772098204445714_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-1772098204445714_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-1772098204445714_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-1772098204445714_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Guidance Terminal</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Crypto was up yesterday, with Bitcoin having the best day since the Feb 6 dead cat bounce.

Overall, I don't think the lows in the crypto space are behind us, and I see further downside in H1 this year. I laid out the rationale in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4866830-bitcoins-worst-day-since-ftx-is-this-the-start-of-a-crypto-death-spiral\">this article</a>. That said, a broader <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4870222-a-near-term-correction-in-the-making\">market correction</a> could still pressure Bitcoin, as investors deleverage and reduce risk in their portfolios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why would this be bad for the owner of the second-largest stablecoin?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I've shown in this article, I strongly believe that the circulation of USDC is pegged to the overall crypto prices. This is reflected by the low single-digit sequential increase in reserve revenue in Q4 vs the double-digit qoq increase in Q3 last year. While some may believe this flatness is attributed to the 2 rate cuts in Q4, please be aware that the Q3 quarter was also pressured by a rate cut. Yet, it grew in the double digits. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, I think we may see a crypto recovery in the back half of the year, which should push up USDC circulation. In the near term, though, investor risk appetite in crypto is highly uncertain, which makes the outlook choppy. I think that's why management <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874577-circle-internet-group-inc-crcl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">guided </a>USDC to grow at 40% CAGR over a multi-year through-cycle (and not 40% this year):</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Let me conclude with comments on our guidance for FY 2026. We do not give guidance on USDC circulation or growth. We are at the beginning of meaningful shifts in the global markets for money, and we expect both long-term growth and quarter-on-quarter variability. As previously noted, we would anticipate USDC to grow at a 40% CAGR over a multiyear through cycle.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for the RLDC (Revenue Less Distribution Costs) margin, Q4 had a very decent 40% margin, after the company paid $461M in distribution, transaction, and other costs (up 52% yoy). It seems that the distribution costs scale with USDC circulation, which I believe is the main reason the guidance for FY26 assumes an RLDC margin between 38-40%. </p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I am cautiously bullish considering a multiyear timeframe, as I expect crypto prices to recover in the back half of the year. In the meantime, I would treat this stock with caution. </p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HPQ\" title=\"HP Inc.\">HPQ</a></span>), the diversified computer and related peripherals manufacturer, has been on my radar for quite some time now. I first wrote about it here on Seeking Alpha back in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4566187-top-reasons-buffett-chose-hp-over-dell\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">late 2022</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">. Quite understandably, I never found the company particularly exciting given its significant exposure to largely commoditized products, lacking meaningful unique selling propositions. However, after HP shares had declined—to some extent understandably—against the backdrop of the 2025 tariffs to a level reflecting what I considered a reasonable margin of safety from a long-term investor's perspective, I turned cautiously bullish.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I never intended to own HP stock as part of my high-quality core portfolio but figured that at a price in the mid-$20s, a small position to the tune of 0.5% could be justified for my speculative satellite portfolio. At a free cash flow yield of more than 10% at the time of my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4817348-hp-q3-earnings-solid-performance-difficult-environment-rating-upgrade\">last article</a>, the company was already priced for (slow) terminal decline. Despite the already convincing valuation, however, I noted that I intended to approach the stock rather cautiously via out-of-the-money put options.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">HP <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556212-hp-non-gaap-eps-of-0_81-beats-by-0_04-revenue-of-14_44b-beats-by-510m\">reported</a> its results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 on Tuesday after the bell. The shares <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556039-hp-slides-as-mixed-guidance-weighs-on-strong-q1-results\">reacted rather negatively</a> immediately after the announcement but traded more or less sideways during yesterday's market hours. Nevertheless, HP stock declined to well under $20 since my last article, justifying a fresh look at the company.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">HP's Q1 FY2026 Earnings: Operations Holding Up Well Despite Another Headwind</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, HP Inc. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20412147-hp-inc-reports-fiscal-2026-first-quarter-results\">reported</a> non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $0.81, well ahead of the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HPQ/earnings/eps-surprise-summary?period=quarterly\">latest consensus</a> of $0.77 and up almost 10% year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net revenues came in slightly better than expected at $14.44 billion, up almost 7% year-over-year. In my view, this kind of top-line growth is rather reassuring for a company that is known to offer largely commoditized products, which suggests no particular pricing power. As illustrated in Figure 1, the boom period of the early 2020s is well behind us now, but HP's revenues are recovering slowly from the fiscal 2024 low.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Segment-wise, personal systems surprised positively with reassuring revenue growth of 11% year-over-year. HP benefitted from the weak U.S. dollar in Q1 but, even adjusting for currency growth, remained very solid at 9%. Volume-wise, both the consumer and the commercial personal systems segments remained resilient, with 14% and 11% growth year-over-year, respectively. Printing revenues—which represented 29% of consolidated net revenues in Q1—were down 2% year-over-year, or -3% in constant currency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49694823-1772099143638355_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2332\" data-height=\"1277\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49694823-1772099143638355_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"HP Inc.

(HPQ): Quarterly net revenues since Q1 of fiscal 2020 <span>(own work, based on information from company filings)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Turning back to HP's reported EPS, the significant adjustments—as illustrated by GAAP EPS of just $0.58, 25% less—are worth taking a closer look.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Litigation and amortization of intangible assets were responsible for $0.12 per share, but these are adjustments that I consider appropriate. I am a bit on the fence with regard to the ongoing adjustment of restructuring charges, which were rather high in Q1 FY26 at $0.14 per share. By comparison, the company reported restructuring charges of $0.07 and $0.11 per share in Q3 and Q4 of FY25, respectively. In view of tariff-related adaptation of HP's manufacturing and assembling footprint, these additional expenditures make sense, of course, as does treating them as one-offs. However, I keep an eye on these costs and expect them to abate sooner rather than later. At the same time, I look at <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HPQ/valuation/metrics\">HP stock's valuation</a> mainly through the lens of free cash flow, which automatically considers such expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More importantly than earnings adjustments, let's take a look at HP's margin profile. The company was never particularly strong from a gross profitability standpoint, which itself is a key argument why I would never want to own a significant position in HP stock. Gross margin averaged 20.6% between Q1 of fiscal 2020 and Q4 of fiscal 2025, whereas in the recently concluded quarter, HP reported a margin of just 19.6%, down 140 bps year-over-year or down 60 bps sequentially:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49694823-17720991646828177_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2443\" data-height=\"1276\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49694823-17720991646828177_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"HP Inc.

However, HP's management is maintaining profitability as best it can, as evidenced by meaningful savings in other operating expenses (R&amp;D and selling, general, and administrative expenses), which declined by 61 basis points year-over-year in Q1.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, I would not go so far as to conclude that management is underinvesting in terms of R&amp;D and advertising: HP continues to invest approximately 2.5% to 3.0% of its net revenues in research and development. Advertising expenses aren't disclosed on a quarterly basis, but as per HP's <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000047217/000004721725000071/hpq-20251031.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">fiscal 2025 10-K</a> (p. 58), the company spent 1.2% of net revenues on advertising on average over the past three years. In fiscal 2025, related expenses were even slightly higher, at 1.3% of net revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49694823-17720991984010468_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2308\" data-height=\"1276\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49694823-17720991984010468_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"HP Inc.

In view of the current headwinds, I think that HP's profitability is holding up well and management was quite quick to implement the necessary mitigation steps. Of course, however, it will take time before they become fully effective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874214-hp-inc-hpq-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a>, management announced expanded pricing actions but also additional company-wide cost reductions, so it will be interesting to see how especially the former impacts demand going forward. While a near-term deceleration is a reasonable expectation, the company should benefit over the longer term as the pricing pressures abate eventually when memory supply ticks up and/or AI data center demand turns out to be weaker than currently anticipated. Shares of Samsung, SK hynix Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HXSC.F\" title=\"SK hynix Inc.\">HXSC.F</a>), Sandisk Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SNDK\" title=\"Sandisk Corporation\">SNDK</a>) and the like can be watched as a barometer of sorts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of operating cash flow, I was pleased to see HP having generated $383 million in Q1 of fiscal 2026, in line with the prior year period. Capital expenditures were down more than 20%, translating to reported free cash flow of $175 million. Of course, the timing of supplier and customer payments can throw off quarterly cash flows quite significantly. Hence, I prefer to look at free cash flow from a full-year perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For fiscal 2026, management expects free cash flow of around $2.8 billion to $3.0 billion, but this does not include stock-based compensation—a significant position in HP's cash flow statement. As the eventually issued performance shares must be repurchased with actual cash and HP remains committed to returning roughly all of its free cash flow to shareholders over time, I prefer to deduct stock-based compensation, or SBC, as if it were an immediate cash expense. After this adjustment, free cash flow should come in at roughly $2.4 billion.

Indeed, management noted on the earnings call that debt maturing in fiscal 2026 will be paid down and maturities in fiscal 2027 could be addressed as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Against this backdrop, and provided that demand does not deteriorate significantly, I see no reason why HP should not be able to maintain its favorable standing with the rating agencies. Moody's, for example, <a href=\"https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-Ratings-announces-completion-of-a-periodic-review-of-ratings-Announcement-of-Periodic-Review--PR_512856\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">last reviewed</a> HP's long-term rating in September 2025 and maintained its Baa2 rating with a stable outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, and striking a somewhat more opportunistic tone, in view of the investment-grade credit rating, a leverage ratio of well under 3x adjusted free cash flow, and the compelling valuation of HP shares, I am quite happy that management continues to repurchase stock while maintaining (and even growing) the dividend. Also worth noting is that, unlike some companies in the technology sector where performance shares issued are offsetting most (or even all) buybacks, the number of HP shares outstanding has declined significantly in recent years:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49694823-17720994019478805_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2241\" data-height=\"1277\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49694823-17720994019478805_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"HP Inc.

Demand for the company's AI PCs was strong, and the Windows 11 refresh cycle remains a tailwind worth highlighting. In my view, management continues to do a great job at maintaining core profitability while navigating what I view as a pretty challenging environment (tariffs, sharply risen memory prices). At the same time, the necessary investments in research and development as well as advertising are being maintained.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While management expects to hit full-year adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal 2026 near the low end, free cash flow guidance was maintained. Therefore, and despite the generous <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HPQ/dividends/scorecard\">dividend</a>, the company should still be in a position to buy back shares worth several hundred million dollars while also addressing upcoming maturities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the long term, demand in HP's Personal Systems division is likely to remain solid due to the expected significantly higher resource intensity of Windows 12 (<a href=\"https://www.technobezz.com/news/windows-12\" rel=\"nofollow\">rumored for 2027</a>). At the same time, I continue to anticipate a sustained decline in HP's printer segment revenues, coupled with a (slow) decline in profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taken together, the Q1 FY2026 earnings report left me rather positive, and my longer-term view on HP Inc. remains constructive as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, the valuation of HP shares based on a discounted cash flow sensitivity analysis (Figure 7) suggests that the market continues to view the company as being in terminal decline. With a discount rate (cost of equity) of 9%, HP could see its free cash flow decline by 3.5% per year for the company to be fairly valued at $18.2 today. In my view, this represents a rather meaningful margin of safety, at least from the perspective of an investor with a multi-year horizon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49694823-17720994476007411_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1640\" data-height=\"1112\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49694823-17720994476007411_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"HP Inc.

(HPQ): Discounted cash flow sensitivity analysis <span>(own work, based on information from company filings)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To further support my point, I'd like to draw your attention to Figure 8.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hypothetically, HP Inc. could go out of business in fiscal 2045, i.e., after 20 years. At the required rate of return mentioned above, but assuming a slightly slower decline rate of 2.5% per annum until the cessation of business operations in FY45, HP shares would be worth $19.5. In other words, with a current share price of $18.2, HP Inc. could cease operations after only 16 years to achieve the above-mentioned return of 9.0% per annum. This assumes, of course, that free cash flow—notably including stock-based compensation as a cash expense—is returned to shareholders via dividends or share buybacks. Debt is not taken into account in this highly simplified thought experiment, but bear in mind its significant decline in value over the years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49694823-17720994664917805_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2211\" data-height=\"1302\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49694823-17720994664917805_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"HP Inc.

(HPQ): Conservative discounted cash flow analysis – business termination after 20 years <span>(own work, based on information from company filings)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To end on a more optimistic note, if HP continues to navigate the current environment just reasonably well (as it currently does, in my view), it will likely be able to maintain free cash flow of at least $2.5 billion for the foreseeable future. Given that the shares are currently trading at an adjusted free cash flow yield of 14% and a forward P/E ratio of only 6.2, buybacks are very efficient. The market views the company as facing significant challenges, so returns should be very attractive if HP performs only slightly better than currently expected. I, therefore, remain constructive on HP stock and look forward to further increasing my recently initiated position.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thank you very much for reading my latest article.

The reason is much simpler: the market has decided it no longer wants to pay<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> up for a fintech story that gets financed on common equity. My </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4774872-sofi-technologies-stock-growth-engine-just-shifted-gears\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">buy rating on SoFi last year</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> outperformed the market, delivering a 68% return in under 12 months versus roughly 27% for the broader market over the same period.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When a company's stock declines from $33 to $19 in a matter of months, there is a natural temptation to point to macro forces, interest rates, rotation, short sellers, or some other vague risk-off market environment as the culprit. Those things matter too. The most straightforward explanation is simply that the company asked its shareholders to pay for the next phase of the company's growth, twice.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'm not dismissing the company's strategic decision to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4864400-sofi-technologies-inc-sofi-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">raise $3.2 billion in capital</a>. If you believe in SoFi's ability to compound into a scaled financial utility with tech-like margins, you want a balance sheet that can absorb a credit downturn and still have cash left over to sign partners. The problem is timing and messaging. Issuing a large equity offering after a massive run is a clear signal to investors that management is prioritizing optionality for the corporation, not scarcity of shares. That's rational. That's exactly how you destroy a company's ability to negotiate a high multiple for its equity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What’s more interesting to me than the drawdown itself is what it says about the market’s tolerance. SoFi can announce a strong execution in a post-record quarter scenario and still have the stock fall if investors believe the right story is being shared across a larger and larger share count. That’s the debate in a nutshell.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Real SoFi Story Is the Pivot From Balance Sheet Growth to Fee Compounding</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the Q4 numbers are legitimate. They beat. They crossed <a href=\"https://s27.q4cdn.com/749715820/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/2025-Q4-Earnings-Release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">$1 billion in quarterly adjusted net revenue</a>. They hit $174 million in GAAP net income. They extended the string of profitable quarters. They hit $318 million in adjusted EBITDA at a 31% margin. It looks like a classic inflection in an operating story. And in many ways it is. Except what interests me less than the first $1 billion quarterly story is more a function of what the composition of the growth looks like.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61094969-17720155393639157_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1043\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61094969-17720155393639157_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Investor Presentation Q4 2025\" width=\"640\" height=\"326\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61094969-17720155393639157_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61094969-17720155393639157_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61094969-17720155393639157_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61094969-17720155393639157_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Investor Presentation Q4 2025</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SoFi is trying to become a hybrid of a digital banking platform, a consumer finance product layer, and a third-party capital servicing and distribution platform. And the Loan Platform Business is a big part of that. It’s a way SoFi can grow in a big way while keeping risk optional. In the most recent quarter, it produced $194 million in adjusted revenue. That’s a number that will change what SoFi becomes in a credit downturn scenario.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other signal that I keep coming back to is deposits. If deposits go to $37.5 billion, the company is not just doing app growth. The company is replacing expensive funding with a real banking moat and reducing the cost of carrying those loans. That is important because it is one of the only things that a fintech company can achieve that an incumbent bank cannot easily replicate without repricing their entire deposit base.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, I’m not saying that this is sustainable in any given period of time. I’m saying that this is a real thing that you can do, not just marketing speak.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Still Needs to Prove Itself: Platform Credibility, Not Product Breadth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am not as concerned with SoFi delivering on launching more things. They can. The question is, can they deliver on making those non-lending engines predictable enough that investors stop treating the company as a sentiment stock? Financial Services revenue growth has been excellent. They are leaning into cross-buy, monetization per product, and the one-stop-shop positioning. It can work. It just needs to work like a compound interest annuity rather than a feature list.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The tech platform business is where I have my biggest concerns. Every tech platform business looks great until a large client leaves and shows how concentrated the business can be. SoFi can continue to grow this business. It just needs to grow it with cleaner net retention and less one-client-mattered variability before SoFi can receive a premium multiple. The commentary from the company about normalized growth is positive. I just want to see periods where growth is boring, consistent, and impossible to argue with.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And then there is crypto. I am not opposed to the business. A nationally chartered bank launching a crypto and stable coin framework is not a small thing. It is an option value. It can be a positive contributor. It can also be a negative contributor. SoFi needs less noise, not more.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">When 30x Earnings Becomes a Test of Execution</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At $18.70, it is no longer a stock that trades like a winner in a straight line, but it is a stock that trades like a company that must execute cleanly. Using <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/684/120684/original.pdf\">management's $0.60 adjusted EPS</a> forecast for 2026, this multiple works out to a low 30s multiple, and that is a whole different world from traditional banking and a very demanding world for a financial services company. What I’m being asked to buy at this price is a series of assumptions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61094969-1772015539080257_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1232\" data-height=\"408\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61094969-1772015539080257_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Investor Presentation Q4 2025\" width=\"640\" height=\"212\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61094969-1772015539080257_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61094969-1772015539080257_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61094969-1772015539080257_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61094969-1772015539080257_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Investor Presentation Q4 2025</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, if revenue compounds at ~30% and adjusted EPS compounds in the high 30% range through 2028, as the company is targeting, the current multiple rapidly compresses based on forward earnings power.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, even a slight increase in valuation to mid-30s multiples based on $0.90-$1 in medium-term EPS has substantial upside from current levels. However, the important point is that the quality of those earnings is rising as fee-based revenue and the Loan Platform Business grow, helping to take balance sheet intensity out of the model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, in short, I do not view 30x as expensive if the SoFi thesis plays out and the company continues to move towards a platform-like model. If the company continues to grow its earnings away from balance sheet risk and towards fee-based revenue with increasing margin expansion, the current valuation looks like a far cry from late-cycle valuation normalization.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_3e7fa770c0daf0a3899caac86a084035.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_3e7fa770c0daf0a3899caac86a084035.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_3e7fa770c0daf0a3899caac86a084035.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_3e7fa770c0daf0a3899caac86a084035.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">When the Cycle Turns: Rates, Credit, and the Fragility of the Platform Narrative</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What is most concerning to me is not rates but what rates do to demand, credit, and investor patience all at the same time. That is, if the easing doesn’t happen, SoFi is stuck in a world where demand is lower, and the market is even less friendly to a premium fintech multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Credit is the second breaker in the thesis. The emphasis is on the prime borrowers and the performance. The numbers are strong. However, if consumer credit takes off, it will challenge the assumption that SoFi’s advantage in underwriting and servicing will allow them to compound earnings growth while continuing to compound top-line growth. If the loss profiles materially shift, the market will start to view SoFi as a lender instead of a platform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly, there is a risk related to the capital. While the 2025 raises have provided SoFi with a stronger balance sheet, they have also altered the way investors view SoFi’s decisions. If SoFi needs to raise more equity in a big way, even if it makes sense from a business perspective, my view will likely get worse along with the stock price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I treat SoFi's reset like an opportunity, not deterioration but execution and capital allocation will be key to whether this is a powerful compounding story or just another fintech cycle.</p>",

Instead, it was about relative mispricing and unattractive P/NAV in the context of what was happening with the lion's share of other high-quality, externally managed BDCs such as Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSDL\" title=\"Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund\">MSDL</a>) and Kayne Anderson BDC, Inc.

Also, it has fallen short of the BDC index (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIZD\" title=\"VanEck BDC Income ETF\">BIZD</a>) performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another nuance that I articulated in the previous piece was that a dividend cut is something that we should not rule out of happening this year. Looking at the <a href=\"https://s29.q4cdn.com/231559957/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-2025-BXSL-Earnings-Presentation_vF.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q4 2025 data</a> points, I have to say that BXSL has marched one step closer to the cut taking place.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having said that, the Q4 report was very robust and strong across the board. This, in conjunction with the aforementioned price correction, has actually made the case more attractive than before (even with the likely dividend cut in mind).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let me explain.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I said, Q4 for BXSL was very strong, with almost no data point that could provide a ground for extra skepticism of fears about potential credit stress.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the net investment income declined from the previous quarter, the move downwards was generally consistent with what other peers have reported so far - i.e., driven by lower base rates and tighter spreads. More importantly, the NII per share landed at $0.80, which means that the base dividend coverage is 104%, above the <a href=\"https://www.raymondjames.com/-/media/rj/dotcom/files/corporations-and-institutions/investment-banking/industry-insight/bdc_update.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">sector average</a> of 99%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, the biggest strength of BXSL - portfolio quality - has manifested itself once again in this quarter. The non-accrual share of the total portfolio FV remained at an <a href=\"https://www.raymondjames.com/-/media/rj/dotcom/files/corporations-and-institutions/investment-banking/industry-insight/quarterly-bdc-market-update.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">industry-leading</a> 0.5%. The underlying portfolio company's LTM revenue and EBITDA generation levels are up by ~10%. The portfolio-wide LTV has also jumped to a healthy 50.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this context, I simply have to insert a direct quote of BXSL's Co-CEO, which provided a great perspective, helping frame the inherent defense that underpins the BDC:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>However, to provide some illustrative framing, if you take this bottom 10% and just punitively assume the company is all defaulted, which, again, we do not, I underscore, do not expect to see this happen, and BXSL recovers 65% over the next 4 years, in line with long-term recovery of first lien public loans, and based on where they are marked today, this would only impact the equity by approximately 100 basis points per year. I state these numbers just to reinforce what I mentioned earlier. BXSL's model was designed to be defensive by focusing on first lien larger private equity-owned businesses across a portfolio with diversified industries.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fact that the board approved a $250 million buyback package serves as a clear testament that, at least from the management's eyes, there is a disconnect between the portfolio value and the multiple that tries to reflect that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As discussed above, the registered price decline has sent BXSL from a slight premium level at which it entered 2026 into a discount zone, where it currently trades ~10% below NAV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, the P/NAV of 0.90x does, however, still translate to a relative premium in the BDC sector, where the average BDC is priced at P/NAV of 0.80x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So the question is whether it is worth paying extra to get access to a defensive BDC, which is conservatively structured and comes in handy in the prevailing environment, where many market participants are pricing in credit distress.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reading the article up until now, the logical conclusion should be probably yes. Yet, let me add several elements here that might balance out the case and actually render the decision a bit more difficult.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have two points to make here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, in my humble opinion, a dividend cut here is inevitable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The base dividend coverage looks good, but not enough to weather the following headwinds:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Lagged effects the recent base rate cuts.</li> <li>Pressures from new cuts that are <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDTARMD\" rel=\"nofollow\">likely to happe</a>n in 2026.</li> <li>Tighter spread pressures as BXSL's asset base continues to turn over.</li> <li>$1.4 billion of ~3.2% fixed-rate debt rollover, which, based on the most recent debt issuance, will likely lead to ~170 bps of incremental drag.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we read between the lines of what the management commented on its dividend, I think that it would be fair to conclude that it did leave some impression that the dividend is not entirely fixed:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We will continue to assess our dividend with our Board as we do every quarter as lower base rates flow through our portfolio.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What makes the dividend cut scenario even a higher probability is my second point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third, BXSL ended this quarter with a debt-to-equity of 1.30x, which exceeds its long-term (max) target of 1.25x. The management has also commented that going forward we should expect a 1.25x mark, which means that some deleveraging might take place.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If BXSL does indeed deliver, it will automatically squeeze the NII yield (margin) and damage the dividend coverage. The debt to equity of 1.30x also implies that BXSL has no spare capital to fund growth that could offset the headwinds, which I outlined in the bullets of the first point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, let's not forget that while BXSL's PIK of total income is relatively low, it is still around 8%, which in turn makes the dividend cash coverage negative - i.e., each quarter BXSL has to use slight amounts of leverage to redirect the repaid loan cash flow towards the dividend.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bottom line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other side of the story (the negative one) I presented here consists of points that were largely already present and known before. Hence, this was the reason for my previous skepticism, knowing that BXSL traded at NAV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the recent correction, the P/NAV component has, in my view, gravitated towards something, where we could once again explore BXSL as a solid vehicle for a buy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Keep in mind that the lagged effects from lower base rates, forthcoming base rate cuts, certain unfavorable debt refinancings, and largely exhausted balance sheet capacities are relevant for most peers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Granted, the leverage of 1.30x is a bit too high, higher than for others. Also, the P/NAV is 0.1x higher than for other high-quality peers. So, we have to contrast these items with BXSL's 104% (relatively strong) base dividend coverage and, more importantly, portfolio defense, which at the end of the day is what drives long-term NAV stability and dividend predictability (in a reasonable range or at a reasonable spread to the SOFR).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have to say that I have been lucky that my investment philosophy that fits my emotional profile is biased towards high quality and an extra margin of safety. Consequently, 90%+ of my BDC investments and buys are such that I can sleep well at night (or so-called SWAN picks) and are well-positioned to handle near-term volatility in credit markets.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that BXSL could now be included among such BDCs as well. So I'm setting buy now.</p>",
