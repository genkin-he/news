Stock and bond markets are falling.</p></li> <li><p>The Fed cut rates as expected by 25bp and also announced the<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> end of its balance sheet reduction also as expected. There was a surprise dissent to the cut by Jeffrey Schmid of the Kansas City Fed with an expected dissent favoring a 50bp cut by Stephen Miran. The statement was largely unchanged with no indication of future rate cuts. The bond market traded off slightly as the dissent was a negative, and the stock market was largely unchanged. We continue to expect a December rate cut and three more cuts in 2026 to get the Fed funds rate to the neutral rate of 2.75%. We project that core PCE will decline to the 2% area by the end of 2026 as the shelter component of CPI has finally started to reflect the decline in market rents. In fact, our real-time measure of inflation utilizing market rents has already declined to the 2% area for core PCE.</span></p></li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Friday’s inflation print was very bullish, as the critical owner’s equivalent rent component declined to only .1% vs. .4% in the prior month and 3.8% Y/Y. This decline is critical as it finally reflects market rent declines and implies that core PCE will decline to the Fed’s arbitrary 2% target by the end of 2026 as measured shelter inflation finally reflects the decline in market rents.</p></li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>The monetary base is the critical leading indicator of inflation and GDP growth. M1 and M2 have become outdated indicators after the GFC, as banks now have massive excess reserves, so the Fed can no longer control the size of bank balance sheets to restrict credit.

The Russell Midcap® Growth Index (up 2.78%) underperformed the Russell Midcap® Value Index (up 6.16%), losing some momentum after a notably strong second quarter. Materials (up 14.48%) led all sectors across both<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> style indices in relative and absolute terms. Communication services (up 10.72%) and real estate (up 9.64%) delivered solid returns, outperforming the broader index by a notable degree. Healthcare (up 8.15%) had the next-highest contribution to return ahead of larger-weighted sectors such as industrials (up 4.45%), information technology (up 1.58%), and consumer discretionary (up 1.24%), each of which lagged its respective value counterpart. Utilities (up 1.12%) underperformed the broader index and posted a lower return than its value peer. Consumer staples (down 2.37%) modestly detracted from performance but outperformed its value counterpart, unlike energy (down 4.19%) that recorded the weakest return relative to its value peers. Financials (down 4.72%) detracted the most from overall returns, notably trailing one of the largest sectors in the value index.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Investment Team</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Eric Mintz, CFA Managing Director and Portfolio Manager</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Christopher Sassouni, D.M.D., Portfolio Manager</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">David Cavanaugh, Portfolio Manager</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Characteristics</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Total Net Assets (billions): $5.86</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Number of holdings: 82</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Top 10 Holdings</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Royal Caribbean Cruises (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RCL\" title=\"Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\">RCL</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cencora (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COR\" title=\"Cencora, Inc.\">COR</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Roblox (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RBLX\" title=\"Roblox Corporation\">RBLX</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ares Management (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARES\" title=\"Ares Management Corporation\">ARES</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">RB Global (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RBA\" title=\"RB Global, Inc.\">RBA</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Axon Enterprise (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXON\" title=\"Axon Enterprise, Inc.\">AXON</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hilton Worldwide Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HLT\" title=\"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.\">HLT</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Carvana (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVNA\" title=\"Carvana Co.\">CVNA</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cloudflare (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NET\" title=\"Cloudflare, Inc.\">NET</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Vertiv (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VRT\" title=\"Vertiv Holdings Co\">VRT</a>)</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio Review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Top securities</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Monolithic Power Systems (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MPWR\" title=\"Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.\">MPWR</a>), a semiconductor company specializing in power management, delivered solid earnings results driven by diversified end markets, while the company’s outlook for market share in artificial intelligence (AI) data center applications improved during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Wynn Resorts (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WYNN\" title=\"Wynn Resorts, Limited\">WYNN</a>) is a global luxury resort and casino operator with flagship properties in Las Vegas, Macau, and other international markets. The company’s stock performed well during the quarter as gaming operations in Macau showed steady improvement each month. This marks the first sustained recovery in the Macau property in quite some time – a positive sign, as the region accounts for more than half of the company’s earnings. Moving forward, we expect continued improvement in Macau along with contributions from a new project in the United Arab Emirates to drive growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alnylam (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALNY\" title=\"Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\">ALNY</a>) is a leading company focused on developing gene-silencing technologies to address significant unmet medical needs. The launch of vutrisiran for transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis exceeded expectations, with second-quarter sales coming in well above consensus expectations. The company also substantially raised its TTR sales guidance, which drove the stock higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insmed (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INSM\" title=\"Insmed Incorporated\">INSM</a>) develops therapeutic products for patients with lung diseases. In the second quarter, the company received approval for its Brinsupri product to treat non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, making it the first therapy available for a condition that affects up to 500,000 people. This milestone, combined with the positive readout of a trial for another company’s treatment for pulmonary fibrosis, drove the stock’s performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MongoDB (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDB\" title=\"MongoDB, Inc.\">MDB</a>), a provider of database software, delivered strong earnings results with a positive outlook, driven by large U.S.-based enterprises choosing to build and expand applications on MongoDB’s modern, document-oriented database.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><strong>Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of any fund carefully before investing.

The company reported earnings below expectations due to internal execution issues and increasing competition. Management has since outlined clear strategies to address execution issues, but shareholders remain concerned. We continue to support the stock due to Trade Desk’s strong position in ad spending as the only independent player of scale that we believe can compete with large internet companies, along with its strong margins and cash flow, plus its attractive valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Axon Enterprise provides law enforcement and security technology solutions. After an impressive run of outperformance over the past few years, the company’s stock lagged despite posting another quarter of robust growth and positive momentum in its new product development. Axon remains intensely focused on the development of innovative solutions to address all aspects of the law enforcement process and has made significant strides recently in the emerging areas of drones and potentially transformational AI-enabled solutions. In addition, Axon continues to expand its offerings outside of its traditional law enforcement area and has recently highlighted the significant opportunity that could lie in these new markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Wingstop (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WING\" title=\"Wingstop Inc.\">WING</a>) is a franchisor and restaurant operator that specializes in cooked-to-order chicken wings in a fast-casual setting. The stock declined as its core lower-income consumer base remained under pressure. Against this backdrop, investors now expect a weaker upcoming quarterly report and a longer path before the company returns to positive comparable store sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fair Isaac (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FICO\" title=\"Fair Isaac Corporation\">FICO</a>) is a leading analytics and software company best known for its FICO credit score, widely used in consumer lending decisions. The stock sold off after the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced that lenders would be allowed to use competing credit-scoring products to determine a customer’s credit-worthiness. Despite the challenge to FICO’s longstanding dominance in mortgage credit scoring, management just made Fair Isaac’s largest single-quarter stock buyback in history and raised guidance. We remain optimistic about the value of the company’s data and its ability to monetize it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dexcom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DXCM\" title=\"DexCom, Inc.\">DXCM</a>) is a medical device company that helped pioneer the design and development of continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMs). The company has been under pressure since posting unexpectedly bad results in the second quarter of 2024, despite improving or at least stabilizing revenues and operating profits since then. Recently, there have been concerns over accuracy issues with Dexcom’s latest generation G7 continuous glucose monitor. The company is addressing the issue, but so far it’s unclear whether these issues have impaired the brand and caused a loss of market share.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the third quarter, the equity markets continued their historic rally from April’s lows. Three key factors drove the stock market’s rapid ascent:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>An acceleration in the AI investment cycle,</li> <li>limited evidence of inflationary impacts from tariffs, and</li> <li>the prospects for further interest rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed).</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite softer labor market conditions, the economic outlook appears constructive, bolstered by potential incoming tailwinds from both fiscal and monetary stimulus. We note that although investor sentiment has rebounded sharply from record low levels at the market bottom in April, it currently does not show signs of extreme optimism. However, the sharp outperformance of lower-quality and unprofitable stocks during the third quarter suggests that investors have become emboldened to chase riskier stocks into stratospheric valuations. These frothier areas of the market are clearly vulnerable to downside volatility. In our opinion, a selloff in highly speculative stocks would be a healthy event for the market. Historically, these drawdowns in speculative pockets of the market have led to a “flight to quality” into higher-quality stocks with solid growth prospects, many of which lagged during the market’s sharp rally in the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We believe the AI investment theme will remain intact into the end of the year as user adoption continues to accelerate and corporate implementations begin to bear fruit. On a cautious note, we recognize that the current lofty multiples of many “AI infrastructure” stocks imply a strong growth trajectory for the next several years and leave little margin for error. Given the longer- term uncertainty around the duration of the AI investment cycle, we are actively scouring our investment universe for “AI adopter” companies that trade at reasonable multiples and are well positioned to see a potential inflection in earnings growth fueled by AI-driven margin expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Cyclicals</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We continue to hold a constructive outlook for the cyclical areas of the portfolio. Within energy, we remain positive on natural gas; we expect that the commodity should see multi-year demand growth from both liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities and the new power generation required by data centers. On the supply side, we expect the pace of growth for “associated gas” volumes from oil wells in the Permian Basin to slow in response to weakening oil prices. While oil prices have succumbed to an abrupt policy shift by the producers in the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries (OPEC) to regain lost market share, we believe the removal of this excess supply in the market is potentially an intermediate-term positive. As the market absorbs increased OPEC volumes, North American shale producers, considered the marginal cost supplier, will be challenged to grow supply to meet expected demand in the years ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Within materials and industrials, companies with exposure to the buildout of AI data centers have performed remarkably well in 2025 as hyperscalers have revised capital expenditure (capex) plans significantly higher. While the risk of potential overcapacity looms, demand trends for computing power appear to support these plans for the foreseeable future. As such, we maintain a balanced view given the expectations for strong growth in the years ahead while also noting the risks associated with investors’ exuberance for many stocks across the AI infrastructure landscape.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outside of AI, we expect capital spending for manufacturing facilities to see strong tailwinds from both the tax benefits in recently passed legislation and tariff-driven reshoring initiatives. Although residential construction has weakened further in the second half of 2025, we note the recent downward trend in mortgage rates and the potential for legislative support could lay the groundwork for a possible recovery in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We also continue to see a favorable setup for the aerospace and defense industry. Aftermarket fundamentals remain healthy, particularly in commercial jet engines, as the aging global fleet continues to drive elevated servicing and parts demand. Commercial build rates at two major jet manufacturers appear to be inflecting higher after a prolonged period of softness, providing incremental volume tailwinds across the supply chain. In defense, robust spending growth in new and emerging areas, anchored by the strategic priorities of the U.S. Department of Defense and its partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), offers durable visibility and supports a resilient growth profile for the industry moving forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Healthcare</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The healthcare industry remains the largest sector in the United States, with total expenditures reaching $5 trillion and accounting for 17.7% of gross domestic product (GDP). This sector has been growing at an impressive rate of about 5% per year, driven by the aging population and the increasing prevalence of chronic conditions, which are responsible for 75% of healthcare costs. Most individuals over the age of 65 have two or more chronic conditions, and Western medicine often struggles to manage these effectively. Additionally, novel therapies can extend lifespans, allowing people to live well into their 80s, but these therapies are expensive and significantly contribute to rising healthcare costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the sector’s size and importance, healthcare has underperformed in recent years, generating lackluster returns compared with major benchmarks. The sector has been working off the excesses brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. The massive deceleration in demand for healthcare products and services after 2021 led to a significant decline in stock prices and, in turn, caused the sector to generate very poor returns on both an absolute and relative basis. The surge in initial public offerings (IPOs), particularly of biotechnology companies during 2020 and 2021, reduced the overall quality of drug candidates being developed, resulting in higher than normal negative clinical readouts and investor abandonment. This has caused volatility not only among biotech stocks, but also among healthcare stocks in general. Healthcare is a highly regulated industry, overseen by agencies such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Regulatory uncertainty, especially with new directors and commissioners being installed, has further deterred investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are, however, reasons for optimism. Recent merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity has picked up, though it remains below normal levels. Much of the M&amp;A activity has been focused on medical device and biotechnology companies, where large acquirers are looking to smaller, innovative companies with new products to enhance their own portfolios and market positions. From a valuation perspective, healthcare is generally more favorably priced than most sectors currently. We believe interest in healthcare stocks could see a resurgence once investors are comfortable with the impact of tariffs, as well as with other policy and regulatory overhangs. Until then, larger active bets are being placed on predictable, U.S.-centric businesses like major distributors, which have steady margins and generate substantial free cash flows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One final point: Biotechnology stocks are getting a boost from the downtick in interest rates. If interest rates continue to decline, we believe that could support a prolonged period of positive returns for the biotechnology industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Information technology</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Volatility began waning in the third quarter as markets digested the evolving news around the tariffs announced in April and as companies explained their exposures. Hardware and semiconductor sectors bounced back while software proved less defensive given fears of threats from artificial intelligence.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investor sentiment has returned with enthusiasm as the underlying macroeconomic data hasn’t deteriorated as many had forecast. Despite lingering uncertainty, inflation expectations have remained stable, and the prospect of further trade deals has provided additional support for risk assets. The Fed’s interest rate cut further helped sentiment late in the quarter. In this environment, technology companies with strong growth prospects, solid balance sheets and consistent cash flow generation continue to stand out as potentially attractive investment opportunities. The current administration is also expected to create a more constructive backdrop for a rebound in mergers and acquisitions, and we are already seeing a revival in IPO activity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Within the technology sector, we continue to seek durable, well-capitalized companies that are poised to benefit from long-term secular trends such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, mobility and telecommunications infrastructure, digital payments, the Internet of Things, smart homes, industrial automation, security software, e-gaming, and alternative energy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Financials</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The outlook for the financials sector remains constructive as economic growth has stayed resilient and interest rates have begun moving lower. In this environment, we see the most interesting opportunities outside of the typical banking space. Areas we remain excited about include boutique advisory firms poised to benefit from the increase in M&amp;A activity that followed the heightened tariff uncertainty earlier in the year. In addition, we see potential opportunities in the alternative asset space as those products continue to grow and become available in the wealth management and retail channels. Lastly, we see distinct potential opportunities in the transaction processor space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Consumer sectors</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The continued though slowing moderation in inflation and thus-far steady job market continue to provide support to the consumer. Tariffs so far appear manageable, but the consumer base remains bifurcated with the higher-end consumer faring much better than the low end. Against this backdrop, we find a few dynamics at play: Consumers broadly continue to prioritize travel and experiences over goods, and consumers remain discerning about where to spend discretionary funds. Some areas we remain excited about include:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Companies offering uncommon experiences, such as cruise vacations (and spa treatments while on cruises);</li> <li>Food delivery, which remains an area of growth; and</li> <li>Individual retailers offering distinctive products that we believe can weather the tariff storm.</li> </ul> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p><strong>Risk Considerations:</strong></p> <p>Investments in mid-cap and small-cap companies generally involve greater risks than investing in larger capitalization companies. Mid-cap companies often have narrower commercial markets, more limited managerial and financial resources, and more volatile trading than larger, more established companies.</p> <p>Growth companies are expected to increase their earnings at a certain rate. When these expectations are not met, investors may punish the stocks excessively, even if earnings showed an absolute increase. Growth company stocks also typically lack the dividend yield that can cushion stock prices in market downturns. The companies engaged in the technology industry are subject to fierce competition, and their products and services may be subject to rapid obsolescence.

This market is projected to reach USD 584.9 billion by 2032, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 11.7%.<sup>2</sup> Global electricity demand from data centers is expected to more than double by 2030, with U.S. data centers anticipated to account for nearly half of the growth in electricity demand, contributing over 20% to the overall growth.<sup>3</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To meet the growing energy demands of data centers and other technology-driven applications,<sup>4</sup> U.S. electricity demand is projected to increase by 25% by 2030 and by 78% by 2050, compared to 2023 levels.<sup>5</sup> This growth could have significant implications for the reliability and affordability of electricity, highlighting the urgency of building a robust power system. Research indicates that investments in U.S. power infrastructure are expected to total USD 1 trillion from 2025 through 2029.<sup>6</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The substantial capital flowing into these infrastructure segments has attracted market attention, as their utilization rate will likely be an early sign of the fortunes of AI and its impact on the global economy. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices aligns with this trend by offering two indices that track these areas: the <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/thematics/sp-data-center-tower-reit-and-communications-equipment-index\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener\">S&amp;P Data Center, Tower REIT and Communications Equipment Index</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/thematics/sp-us-power-infrastructure-select-index\" rel=\"nofollow\">S&amp;P U.S. Power Infrastructure Select Index</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>S&amp;P Data Center, Tower REIT and Communications Equipment Index</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The S&amp;P Data Center, Tower REIT and Communications Equipment Index measures the performance of developed market-domiciled, U.S.-listed organizations involved in the ownership and management of data centers, telecommunication towers and related equipment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This index employs FactSet’s Revere Business Industry Classification System (RBICS) Focus data to select relevant companies, which are organized into two tiers: Data Center and Tower REITs, accounting for approximately 53% of the index, and Communication Equipment, comprising about 47% as of Sept. 20, 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The index includes 25 constituents, with a substantial 94% weight attributed to U.S.-domiciled companies (see Exhibit 1).

I believe Arlo Technologies current momentum will continue as Service continues their rapid growth and expands overall margins. Now let's go through what has happened the past time.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Has Happened?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Arlo Technologies has shown good growth the past few years. Stable growth since 2019. However, from 2018 to 2019, Arlo experienced a huge decline in revenue from the retailer's excessive inventories. They overstated the demand for 2019, and the stock fell more than 70% from 2018 to 2019. The worst possible start for an IPO. There have been some fundamental changes for Arlo Technologies since 2018. They have gone from being a more hardware focused company to now being an SaaS company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Arlo's growth has not been explosive in the past years. Their 5Y average growth has been <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARLO/growth\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARLO/growth\" target=\"_blank\">7.35%</a>, and the growth last TTM is flat/slightly negative. Despite low overall growth, Arlo has seen strong improvements in margins in the past years. This is driven by stronger ARR growth from their subscription services. <a href=\"https://cdn.prod.nntech.io/fundamentals-file-proxy/quartr/pdf/08b8b5ea752c6afa4a30414197230b45.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://cdn.prod.nntech.io/fundamentals-file-proxy/quartr/pdf/08b8b5ea752c6afa4a30414197230b45.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">ARR is up 34% YoY,</a> with more than 5.1 million cumulative paid accounts, up 28.5% YoY. Service revenue represents 60% of total revenue, and was up 30% YoY to $78 million in revenue. Service revenue represented 47% of revenue in Q2 2024, and 44% in Q2 2023. Service revenue has a gross margin of 85%, significantly higher than their hardware segment. Service gross margin was up 850 bps YoY. The increase came from successful cost reductions.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615980635030427_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1098\" data-height=\"551\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615980635030427_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Key highlights\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"321\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615980635030427_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615980635030427_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615980635030427_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615980635030427_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615980635030427_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615980635030427_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615980635030427_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615980635030427_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Key highlights <span>(Arlo Q2)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As Arlo's service revenue continues to outpace Product sales, gross margin is increasing rapidly.

The CEO also mentioned more product launches are on the way, and a strategic partnership.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The company will be executing the largest product release in company history with more than 100 new SKUs launching throughout our channels this fall. This subscription momentum coupled with our Holiday product launches and announcement of ADT as a strategic partner positions Arlo for continuing success, and will give material upside to our subscriptions and services revenue starting in 2026.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at product sales, they will launch almost 100 new SKUs through this fall. These products have been specially produced and designed to reduce COGS up to 20-30%. This will give them flexibility towards tariff pressures, which they believe could impact product margin by 300-400 bps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notably, other improvements were FCF yield extending to 14%. That is a major improvement from last year's FCF yield of 10.2%. The improvements came from inventory turnover improving from 5.8x to 7.7x YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Arlo is releasing Q3 numbers on the 6th of November. I would pay attention to ARPU, service revenue momentum, margins, and any updates on the new SKUs. Analysts have an average Q3 revenue to<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARLO/earnings/estimates\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARLO/earnings/estimates\" target=\"_blank\"> hit $138.69 million,</a> which is in line with what analysts are expecting. High estimates are $139 million, whereas Arlo expects the high estimate to be closer to $143 million.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Arlo has announced new product releases, which they are very excited about. New products amplify new subscriptions from new units. Over 100 SKUs to launch during the fall, which will fuel new subscriptions. Looking closer, it is clear that paid accounts are increasing slower than ARR, which means prices are increasing also. This was documented as Arlo increased prices <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24335628/arlo-secure-plus-subscription-price-increase-ai-features-cloud-video-storage?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24335628/arlo-secure-plus-subscription-price-increase-ai-features-cloud-video-storage?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">throughout the year.</a> Paid accounts were up 29% <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"versus\" htloopnumber=\"877421393\">versus</em> ARR, which was up 34% YoY. The new subs came through from new unit sales, not conversion. This is a good sign, as unit sales drive subscription.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ARPU reached the highest recorded level this quarter, and is expected to continue to grow, but at a slower pace than last quarter. ARPU went to $15 in Q2 from $13.48 in Q1, driven by the full rollout of Arlo Secure 6 plans.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615981134581792_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1719\" data-height=\"942\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615981134581792_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Paid accounts and ARR\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"351\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615981134581792_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615981134581792_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615981134581792_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615981134581792_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615981134581792_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615981134581792_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615981134581792_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615981134581792_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Paid accounts and ARR <span>(Arlo Q2)</span></p></figcaption></figure> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my valuation, I use a <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"three\" htloopnumber=\"877421393\">three</em>-scenario discounted EPS valuation.

There are talks about the impact of tariffs on Arlo's gross margin in the next quarters. The potential impact of tariffs is being absorbed by cost savings. Therefore, margins will remain good despite tariff concerns. A major concern of mine is lower margin momentum. Margins are increasing at a fast pace, and a slowdown or decline could cause an overreaction. Tariffs could be one of the reasons margins slow down or, worse, decrease.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Subscriptions cancellations are another risk for Arlo. Cancellations can come from competition or, worse, lower disposable income. However, according to Arlo, security subscriptions rank highest for being least likely to be cancelled. Therefore, this eliminates this type of risk.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56844909-1761822261990024_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1391\" data-height=\"695\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56844909-1761822261990024_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Security ranks highest\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"320\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56844909-1761822261990024_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56844909-1761822261990024_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56844909-1761822261990024_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56844909-1761822261990024_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56844909-1761822261990024_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56844909-1761822261990024_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56844909-1761822261990024_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56844909-1761822261990024_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Security ranks highest <span>(Arlo technologies Q2)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk is competition.

They continue to improve margins due to Service segments rapid growth. With new SKUs launching, I believe they will continue to grow their subscription base and increase ARR. As long as Service segment outgrows Hardware sales, there will be strong margin improvements going forward. Tariffs impact on gross margin is a risk, but new cost reductions could absorb many of the tariff cost issues.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe Arlo is a good opportunity based on a strong growth outlook, limited risks, and still good upside potential. Therefore, I rate Arlo Technologies a <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"877421393\">BUY</em>!</p>",

Security selection in Communication Services, Health Care, and Consumer Discretionary detracted the most from performance, while selection in Consumer Staples added modest value. Although sector allocation effects are residual to Jennison's bottom-up process, they weighed on returns this period. The underweight to Information Technology was the largest detractor, while the overweight to Communication Services and the absence of exposure to Real Estate contributed positively.</li> <li>Ongoing enthusiasm for AI continued to propel both the Technology sector and the broader market during the quarter, with mega-cap tech leaders Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>), Meta, and Microsoft significantly increasing capital expenditures in an effort to secure leadership in the space. This unprecedented wave of investment has supported strong demand for specialized NVIDIA and Broadcom chips that power data centers, as well as for critical design and manufacturing companies such as Cadence Design Systems (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CDNS\" title=\"Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\">CDNS</a>) and Taiwan Semiconductor (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>).</li> <li>Throughout the year, Jennison added new holdings positioned to benefit from continued AI infrastructure spending, including Constellation Energy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CEG\" title=\"Constellation Energy Corporation\">CEG</a>), which is benefiting from higher electricity demand from data center growth and Amphenol (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APH\" title=\"Amphenol Corporation\">APH</a>), a global leader in high-speed connectors essential for advanced semiconductor and AI infrastructure.</li> <li>In contrast, Health Care remained challenging due to policy concerns around drug pricing and reimbursement rates, with the sector lagging the broader market despite some easing of regulatory overhang late in the quarter. Company-specific issues also weighed on results, including disappointing trial data from Vertex Pharmaceuticals (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VRTX\" title=\"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\">VRTX</a>) and a reduced sales outlook from Novo Nordisk (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVO\" title=\"Novo Nordisk A/S\">NVO</a>), prompting the team to exit the latter position.</li> <li>The top contributors to investment results included:<ul> <li> <strong>NVIDIA </strong>benefited from demand for advanced data center and AI computing platforms, unprecedented interest in its Hopper and Blackwell chip architectures, as well as successful execution of major strategic alliances.</li> <li> <strong>Apple's </strong>stock price benefited after the company launched a new, higher priced iPhone lineup that is generating strong early demand.</li> <li> <strong>Tesla (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA\" title=\"Tesla, Inc.\">TSLA</a>)'s </strong>share price increased due to elevated demand in the U.S. from consumers seeking to complete purchases ahead of the tax credit expiry and strong demand for a new Model Y in China.</li> <li> <strong>Broadcom's </strong>stock price benefited from record AI chip orders and rising demand for accelerators from new customers.</li> <li> <strong>AppLovin </strong>has experienced strong advertising revenue growth driven by its AI-powered platform,</li> </ul> </li> <li>The top detractors to investments results included:<ul> <li> <strong>Netflix </strong>experienced a modest pullback during the period, reflecting normal fluctuations following an extended period of outperformance.</li> <li> <strong>Trade Desk (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TTD\" title=\"The Trade Desk, Inc.\">TTD</a>)'s </strong>share price was pressured by advertiser pullbacks related to tariffs, slowing growth, intensifying competition, and a sudden CFO transition. In light of these challenges, Jennison has since removed the position from the Fund.</li> <li> <strong>Novo Nordisk </strong>shares declined after the company lowered its sales and profit outlook, citing intensifying competition in the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) segment and slower growth for key products. Given these headwinds, the team has since sold the position.</li> <li> <strong>Vertex Pharmaceuticals </strong>lost value following disappointing clinical trial results in one of their pain therapy programs.</li> <li> <strong>Intuitive Surgical (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ISRG\" title=\"Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\">ISRG</a>) </strong>was negatively impacted by margin pressures from higher costs and product mix shifts, alongside concerns about escalating U.S. tariffs and slower international growth.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top Five Contributors</h4> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th>Security</th> <th>Sector</th> <th>Average Weight</th> <th>Price Change</th> <th>Contribution to Return</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>NVIDIA</td> <td>Info Tech</td> <td>10.55</td> <td>18.10</td> <td>1.79</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Apple</td> <td>Info Tech</td> <td>4.98</td> <td>24.11</td> <td>1.11</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tesla</td> <td>Cons Disc</td> <td>2.57</td> <td>40.00</td> <td>1.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Broadcom</td> <td>Info Tech</td> <td>5.27</td> <td>19.68</td> <td>0.99</td> </tr> <tr> <td>AppLovin</td> <td>Info Tech</td> <td>0.99</td> <td>105.25</td> <td>0.84</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody><tr><td>Source for data: FactSet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FDS\" title=\"FactSet Research Systems Inc.\">FDS</a>) as of 9/30/2025.

The Fund's largest sector weightings are in Information Technology, Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, and Health Care.</li> <li>In the third quarter, Jennison sold Abbott Laboratories (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABT\" title=\"Abbott Laboratories\">ABT</a>), Airbnb (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABNB\" title=\"Airbnb, Inc.\">ABNB</a>), AstraZeneca (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AZN\" title=\"AstraZeneca PLC\">AZN</a>), CAVA (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAVA\" title=\"CAVA Group, Inc.\">CAVA</a>), HubSpot (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUBS\" title=\"HubSpot, Inc.\">HUBS</a>), Moody's Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCO\" title=\"Moody's Corporation\">MCO</a>), Novo Nordisk, Progressive (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PGR\" title=\"The Progressive Corporation\">PGR</a>), Salesforce (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRM\" title=\"Salesforce, Inc.\">CRM</a>), Starbucks (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBUX\" title=\"Starbucks Corporation\">SBUX</a>), Texas Instruments (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TXN\" title=\"Texas Instruments Incorporated\">TXN</a>) and Trade Desk. For the same period, the team initiated positions in Advanced Micro Devices (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>), Oracle Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL\" title=\"Oracle Corporation\">ORCL</a>) and Toast.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Outlook</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>As the final quarter of 2025 begins, the economy and markets have continued to demonstrate resilience despite lingering uncertainty. Many of the challenges that have emerged over the past nine months, including questions surrounding tariffs, fiscal policy, and geopolitical tensions, remain unresolved, yet the market has continued to advance in the face of them.</li> <li>While potential risks to revenue and earnings growth have not yet materialized, Jennison remains attentive to their possible effects. The market currently appears unconcerned about any significant dampening of consumer spending or broader economic activity. During the quarter, the United States extended a 90-day tariff truce with China, which reduced the immediate risk of broad-based tariff escalation; however, future developments in this area warrant close monitoring.</li> <li>In managing through these uncertainties, the team maintained its disciplined investment approach by focusing on high-quality companies with durable competitive advantages.

Source: Barron's, Feb. 27, 2025. Barron's rankings are based on asset-weighted returns in funds in five categories: U.S. Equity; World Equity; Mixed Asset; Taxable Bond; and Tax-Exempt (each a \"Barron's ranking category\"). Rankings also take into account an individual fund's performance within its Lipper peer universe. Lipper calculated each fund's net total return for the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, minus the effects of 12b-1 fees and sales charges. Each fund in the survey was given a percentile ranking, with 100 the highest and 1 the lowest in its category. That ranking measured how a fund compared with its peer \"universe,\" as tracked by Lipper, not just the funds in the survey. Individual fund scores were then multiplied by the 2024 weighting of their Barron's ranking category as determined by the entire Lipper universe of funds. Those fund scores were then totaled, creating an overall score and ranking for each fund family in the survey in each Barron's ranking category. To qualify for the ranking, firms must offer at least three active mutual funds or actively run ETFs in Lipper's general U.S. Stock category; one in World Equity; and one Mixed Asset. They also need to offer at least two taxable bond funds and one national tax-exempt bond fund. All funds must have a track record of at least one year.</p> <p><strong>Consider a fund's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses carefully before investing.

This structure can effectively minimize volatility in MLP cash flows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In past market downturns, this business model provided protection to midstream operators, helping to prevent a revenue collapse. As a result, that segment of the energy sector delivered robust free cash flow even at low commodity prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Critical pipeline and storage capacity has high average utilization. Regardless of short-term price movements. The demand for transporting energy products is relatively inelastic. Thanks to these defensive characteristics, midstream MLPs have proven comparatively resilient during periods of market stress, often serving as a stable income harbor within the energy sector.<sup>1</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"Midstream MLPs\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"369\" height=\"563\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Structurally, we believe that several tailwinds will shape the outlook for midstream performance. At the top of that list is a burgeoning demand for natural gas, both at home and around the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cleaner energy sources are replacing dirtier ones, and calls for electricity are increasing. U.S. natural gas consumption and exports continue to rise, fueled by volume growth to power-hungry data centers (for artificial intelligence), as well as liquid natural gas (LNG) shipments abroad.<sup>2</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, energy transitions such as switching from coal to gas for electric generation, and increased worldwide energy demand continue to underpin the growth prospects for natural gas infrastructure.<sup>3</sup> North American midstream operators could benefit from new LNG export capacity as well as additional terminals coming online. Volumes moving through pipelines face no shortage of potential tailwinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Similarly, the U.S. Energy Information Administration is forecasting all-time highs for U.S. natural gas production, as supply continues to ramp up to meet global demand.<sup>4</sup> Significant private capital investments in energy infrastructure and pro-infrastructure policies are opening additional growth opportunities for pipeline and export facilities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A number of midstream companies have also spent the past few years strengthening their balance sheets by paying down debt and practicing disciplined project spending, which positions them to ride these tailwinds without putting stability at risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the more remarkable aspects of the MLP rebound story is just how much cash these assets can generate.<sup>5</sup> Midstream MLPs normally come with a distribution yield similar to asset-intensive industries, such as real estate, utilities or fixed income investments.<sup>6</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently, the sector has been producing high single-digit yields - an attractive payout for investors. And remember that these distributions are typically supported by stable fee-based cash flows, adding potentially sustainable income streams over commodity price cycles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors interested in capitalizing on the potential MLP revival can consider a fund like the InfraCap MLP ETF (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZA\" title=\"InfraCap MLP ETF\">AMZA</a></span>). AMZA provides a diversified portfolio of 15–35 midstream MLPs with an emphasis on high current income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unlike passive index trackers, this actively managed ETF selectively overweights quality MLP names based on fundamental analysis, and uses modest leverage (typically 20–30%) and option writing to enhance income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This approach has paid off throughout past volatile conditions: AMZA outpaced the leading Alerian MLP Index through the challenging macro cycle over the five-year period ending September 30, 2025 (2020–2025).<sup>7</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Equally important for investors, AMZA offers the tax advantages of a C-Corp ETF (issuing a single Form 1099 instead of multiple K-1s), while preserving the high yields of the MLP structure.<sup>8</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The result is an accessible, one-ticket solution for those seeking to enjoy the stable cash flows and infrastructure growth prospects of midstream MLPs without the complexity of direct MLP ownership.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AMZA performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"625\" height=\"281\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AMZA fees and expenses\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"624\" height=\"77\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Midstream MLPs appear poised for a resurgence, with relatively stable, fee-based business models and supportive industry trends.

With investments<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> secured by tangible assets, it’s an exciting and growing sector for investors.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Kristofer Kraus: </strong>Asset-based finance at PIMCO refers to all forms of private market lending that exist outside of the more traditional parts of the market. So, as you think about corporate direct lending, as you think about commercial real estate, we're focused on the opportunity set that exists outside of those two areas of the market. Much of that relies on mortgage credit as part of the opportunity set as well as consumer credit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Daniel J. Ivascyn: </strong>This is the type of asset that throughout history and we have plenty of case studies here. You can get very, very attractive resiliency by taking on a little bit of complexity, a little bit of illiquidity, but being much more sheltered from economic shocks. This is one of the most attractive opportunities that we’ve seen in a long time, especially from a relative value perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Narrator: </strong>PIMCO is one of the most experienced investors in asset-based finance with a history that dates back to the launch of mortgage-backed securities more than 50 years ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong> Harin de Silva: </strong>We are not tourists in this market. We’ve been in these markets for a long period of time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Kristofer Kraus: </strong>We've been in business for 54 years. We've been a dominant participant in private markets for the last 15 years. And one of the benefits I think of working at PIMCO and for our clients too is the footprint that we have across markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Narrator: </strong>With more than $225B deployed in private asset-based finance markets, we are strategically positioned to pursue opportunities for our clients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our advantage comes down to three qualities – our distinct vantage point across public and private markets, our intelligence based on decades of data, and how we put our experience and ecosystem to work for our clients. Our dual-market lens allows us to cut through complexity and see relative value that others may not.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong> Harin de Silva: </strong>Our ability to navigate both public and private markets gives us a great edge because we look at the relative value between the two markets and we navigate towards the side that gives you better value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong> Kristofer Kraus: </strong>That interplay between private strategies as well as public strategies and the footprint that we have in public markets and the acumen and the experience that we have as it relates to securitization being an efficient form of term financing has proven to be very, very impactful in terms of driving returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Narrator: </strong>We ground this perspective in proprietary models built on millions of data points gathered over our 20 years of investing in private credit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong> Harin de Silva: </strong>We apply the same analytical rigor and a lot of the tools that we use in active fixed income in looking and assessing the risk in the private markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong> Kristofer Kraus: </strong>Consumer data has, you know, been an area of that similar to the approach that we've taken on the residential credit side, where there's just an enormous amount of data that allows us to take a very targeted approach to where we want to invest.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Narrator: </strong>This all then comes to life through our people and our ecosystem. Forged across market cycles, we’ve built the relationships and resources needed to access favorable lending terms, execute on opportunities and adeptly navigate even the most challenging market moments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong> Daniel J. Ivascyn:</strong> A lot of us have real-time experience going through multiple periods where there were various forms of shocks, rate shocks, economic shocks, shocks to the industry in other ways as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong> Kristofer Kraus: </strong>That experience, it’s sort of battle-tested investment team, allows us to get through your periods of time where I think the markets will certainly throw some challenges at us. But it’s a time-tested investment process with deep experience that allows us to navigate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Narrator: </strong>From origination to exit, we manage risk in asset-based finance with precision, offering our clients a steady hand and strategic edge in confidently pursuing long-term outcomes.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Disclosure</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This material is provided for information purposes and should not be construed as a solicitation or offer to buy or sell any securities or related financial instruments in any jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The investment strategies discussed herein are speculative and involve a high degree of risk, including a loss of some or all capital. Investments in any asset classes described herein may be volatile, and investors should have the financial ability and be willing to accept such risks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>All investments</strong> contain risk and may lose value. Investing in the <strong>bond market</strong> is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. Investments in <strong>asset-based lending</strong> and <strong>asset-backed instruments</strong> are subject to a variety of risks that may adversely affect the performance and value of the investment. These risks include, but are not limited to, credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, structural risk, sponsor risk, monoline wrapper risk, and other legal risks. Asset-backed securities across various asset classes may not achieve business objectives or generate returns, and their performance can be significantly impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. Investments in <strong>residential and commercial mortgage loans</strong>, as well as <strong>commercial real estate debt</strong>, are subject to risks that include prepayment, delinquency, foreclosure, risks of loss, servicing risks, and adverse regulatory developments. These risks may be heightened in the case of non-performing loans. Investments in <strong>mortgage and asset-backed securities</strong> are highly complex instruments that may be sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to early repayment risk. <strong>Structured products</strong>, such as collateralized debt obligations, are also highly complex instruments that typically involve a high degree of risk; the use of these instruments may involve derivative instruments that could result in losses exceeding the principal amount invested. <strong>Private credit</strong> involves investments in non-publicly traded securities, which may be subject to illiquidity risk. Portfolios that invest in private credit may be leveraged and may engage in speculative investment practices that increase the risk of investment loss. Additionally, investments in private credit may be subject to <strong>real estate-related risks</strong>, which include new regulatory or legislative developments, the attractiveness and location of properties, the financial condition of tenants, potential liability under environmental and other laws, as well as natural disasters and other factors beyond a manager’s control.<strong> Real asset investments </strong>including those in<strong> data centers </strong>are subject to a variety of inherent risks that may have an adverse impact on the values of, and returns (if any) from, such investments, including: changes in the general economic climate, local conditions (such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for space), the quality and philosophy of management, competition based on rental rates, attractiveness and location of the properties. Investing in <strong>banks and related entities</strong> is a highly complex field subject to extensive regulation, and investments in such entities may give rise to control person liability and other risks. Investing in <strong>distressed loans and bankrupt companies</strong> is speculative, and the repayment of default obligations contains significant uncertainties. <strong>High-yield, lower-rated securities</strong> involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. <strong>Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs)</strong> may involve a high degree of risk and are intended for sale to qualified investors only. Investors may lose some or all of their investment, and there may be periods during which no cash flow distributions are received. These investments are exposed to risks such as credit, default, liquidity, management, volatility, interest rate, and credit risk. <strong>Management risk</strong> is the risk that the investment techniques and risk analyses applied by an investment manager will not produce the desired results, and that certain policies or developments may affect the investment techniques available to the manager in connection with managing the strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results</strong>. Statements concerning financial market trends or portfolio strategies are based on current market conditions, which will fluctuate. There is no guarantee that these investment strategies will work under all market conditions or are appropriate for all investors and each investor should evaluate their ability to invest for the long term, especially during periods of downturn in the market. Outlook and strategies are subject to change without notice.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This material contains the opinions of the manager and such opinions are subject to change without notice.

Now, the specter of tariffs is adding to the inflationary brew.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Combine that with recent trends, and it is clear why candy makers are increasingly concerned about keeping costs under wraps. First, the producer price index for the chocolate made from cacao is up 23.6% year over year, following a 55.1% increase in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">How? A string of unseasonably bad weather in the regions where cocoa beans are grown has continued to push prices up. The last two years have seen speculation about future crop yields, which has helped push the producer price index even higher, up almost 175% since 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, the producer price index for sugar manufacturing is down 6.3% from a year ago, driven by the lower cost of importing raw sugar.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, labor costs continue to rise. Average hourly earnings for sugar and confectionery product manufacturing employees are up 4.2% year over year. While that represents a slowdown from the 13.5% jump seen in 2023 and the 5.0% rise in 2024, labor costs have more than recovered from an 8.1% decline in 2022 when rattled supply chains disrupted manufacturing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_MI_1025_candy_inflation.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"Average number of candy bars earned per hour worked\" width=\"1200\" height=\"627\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_MI_1025_candy_inflation.jpeg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_MI_1025_candy_inflation.jpeg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_MI_1025_candy_inflation.jpeg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_MI_1025_candy_inflation.jpeg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_MI_1025_candy_inflation.jpeg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_MI_1025_candy_inflation.jpeg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_MI_1025_candy_inflation.jpeg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_MI_1025_candy_inflation.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How are consumers, candy makers and retailers responding to higher candy costs?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We expect current-dollar spending on Halloween candy to grow 3.8% in 2025 to a record $4.2 billion - nearly double what consumers spent on candy a decade ago. This comes out to about $31.80 per household, and while growth is expected to be close to its pre-pandemic average, higher prices can be expected to take more than a fun-sized bite out of real sales this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In our forecast, there is no sugarcoating the fact that growth of current dollar spending on treats is expected to fall short of last year’s 4.4%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Through September, headline consumer price index prices are 3.0% higher, up from a 2.4% gain one year earlier, and earnings for all workers are 3.7% higher this year. As a result, consumers are again worried about shrinkflation when it comes to the size of their paydays.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">October’s final reading on consumer sentiment was the lowest since April and May. While consumers are less panicked about inflation, they are increasingly concerned about <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830006-economic-risks-of-prolonged-us-government-shutdown\" rel=\"noopener\">job prospects</a>. In such an environment, out-of-pocket items such as candy do okay, but big-ticket items - vehicles, homes, appliances, and 12-foot skeletons - can become deferred purchases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another bout of higher prices means confectionery makers will continue to face shrinking margins, and combined with slowing sales, those price increases explain two trends consumers can expect to see when shopping this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, the shift toward retailers offering more non-chocolate candies will continue, and second, seasonal sweets will appear on shelves even earlier. Both trends come as candy makers and retailers try to capitalize on solid demand for celebrating and shoppers’ renewed hunt for a good deal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The National Retail Federation expects a record percentage of people to engage in the festivities this year and reports that nearly half of those surveyed began shopping before October.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/research/2025/10/rising-prices-halloween-us-economic-analysis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Original Post</a></em></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

LNGX delivers targeted exposure to the domestic natural gas supply chain, spanning across upstream<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> production from America’s prolific basins and midstream services, which include processing, transportation, and exports. The fund seeks to offer exposure to the structural growth themes that exist across the U.S. natural gas industry.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">U.S. natural gas production represents the backbone of global energy supply, with strong tailwinds underpinning the sector’s recent expansion. Natural gas remains the largest source of U.S. energy production, and it has retained this title in every year since 2011.<sup>1</sup> At the same time, the U.S. has transitioned from being a net energy importer to the world’s largest energy exporter in just under a decade, with natural gas exports being a key contributor to that growth.<sup>2</sup> These changing dynamics present the U.S. with a significant opportunity when considering expectations around power consumption, AI leadership, and energy security.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our analysis suggests that natural gas may be optimally positioned to capitalize on these budding tailwinds in the near term. Furthermore, we believe the U.S. natural gas complex harbors unique characteristics that distinguish it from global competitors, including favorable export terms, permissive policy tailwinds, and advantageous costs of production. These factors have allowed the U.S. to lead the pipeline in global liquefaction capacity additions through 2030,<sup>3</sup> and we believe our targeted approach to investing in the U.S. natural gas supply chain presents a compelling vehicle for capturing these structural tailwinds. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The U.S. Has a Major Opportunity in Natural Gas</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Natural gas is an odorless hydrocarbon natural resource that is extracted directly through natural gas drilling. It’s also a by-product of oil drilling (“associated natural gas production”). Natural gas primarily consists of methane, but it also consists of ethane, butane, and propane (collectively, natural gas liquids, or “NGLs”), which are often separated during processing. It’s used in a variety of residential and commercial applications, which include industrial uses, power generation, heating, cooking, and even transportation. More recently, natural gas has gained importance in power generation as electricity demand continues to rise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The recent uptick in power demand has led both utilities and AI hyperscalers to seek scalable and reliable solutions for meeting expected demand growth. As a reliable source of baseload power, natural gas has been favored by data center operators for its ability to operate all hours of the day, a critical quality for powering essential tech infrastructure. Natural gas plants also encompass familiar designs that are relatively quick to deploy. This has led to an uptick in orders for gas turbines, with order backlogs that span years.<sup>4</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of August 2025, there are nearly 75 gigawatts (GW) of new gas plant projects in the U.S. that dot the roadmap out to 2030.<sup>5</sup> This is a function of surging worldwide demand for natural gas that is expected to rise to new heights in the coming decade. Current forecasts call for total U.S. natural gas consumption to rise by as much as 25 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) by 2030,<sup>6</sup> representing nearly a 27% increase from 90.3 bcf/d in 2024. Key drivers of demand growth include growing exports, rising power consumption, and budding energy themes like electrification and AI data center expansions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Data centers and energy exports have been meaningfully influential drivers of demand. At present, nearly 40% of data center power load is being fueled by natural gas.<sup>7</sup> Should gas plant deployments persist and natural gas gain a greater share in AI power demand, Bloomberg projects gas power consumption from AI and data centers could rise to as much as 6.8 bcf/d by 2030, which could boost total U.S. gas-powered consumption by nearly 14%.<sup>8</sup> The growth rates are even more stark when reviewing the roadmap for U.S. water-bound natural gas export capacity (“liquefaction capacity”), which is set to more than double to ~29 bcf/d by 2030.<sup>9</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_01.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6668\" data-height=\"4616\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_01.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251024 - LNGX Launch_01.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"886\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_01.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_01.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_01.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_01.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_01.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_01.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_01.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_01.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth in Exports Raises the Bar for Natural Gas Production</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global gas demand rose by 78 billion cubic meters in 2024 and is expected to see similar growth in 2025.<sup>10</sup> Asia is the key driver of global demand growth, driven by rising consumption in China and India. India alone is set to increase its LNG imports four-fold by 2030, while China continues to see its power needs grow.<sup>11</sup> We believe such trends are poised to persist over the coming decade, as global themes like electrification and AI growth migrate from developed to developing markets. We believe natural gas will be key to meeting the rise in consumption.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Case in point, natural gas exports represent the lion's share of demand growth within the U.S. and have exerted a powerful demand-pull pressure on U.S. gas production. At the forefront of this trend are U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, which are currently slated to grow 10% per year through the end of the decade.<sup>12</sup> LNG consists of methane, super-chilled to its liquid form at -260-degree Fahrenheit, compressed by a factor of 600 times.<sup>13</sup> While natural gas has historically been difficult to transport for technical and geographic reasons, LNG allows liquefied natural gas to be loaded onto specialized ships for transport and is the key link that makes the intercontinental gas trade possible.<sup>14</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the dominant source of LNG supply, the U.S. exhibits significant clout in global gas markets, which have taken on increasingly geopolitical characteristics in recent years. Europe, for instance, has sought to wean itself off Russian gas imports in the aftermath of the 2022 conflict in Ukraine. Between 2021 and 2024, the EU saw pipeline gas (generally from Russian supply) as a share of imports decline from 70% to 50%, while the share of LNG imports doubled from 20% to 40%. The U.S. has been the biggest benefactor of this shift, thanks to its proximity and status as a politically stable export market. We’ve continued to see this trend proliferate, with U.S. exports to the EU rising to ~$20 billion in 2024, supplying 55% of all EU LNG imports.<sup>15</sup> More recently, global trade partners have increasingly explored U.S. energy exports as a tool for reducing trade deficits. This was evident in trade deals signed with nations like Japan<sup>16</sup> and Korea.<sup>17</sup> Along these lines, the EU has committed to importing $750 billion worth of U.S. energy exports in exchange for lower levies on its exports in the coming years. We believe the bulk of such commitments are likely to be met via natural gas exports.<sup>18</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_02.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6668\" data-height=\"4022\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_02.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251024 - LNGX Launch_02.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"772\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_02.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_02.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_02.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_02.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_02.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_02.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_02.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_02.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Opportunity in Upstream Production</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">U.S. natural gas production benefits from an abundance of domestic supply, rising demand growth, and a network of natural gas pipelines that enable efficient offtake to demand centers. The United States is home to some of the most prolific shale gas basins in the world, including the Haynesville, Marcellus, and Permian Shales; such shale basins account for nearly 69% of the gas production within the United States and produced as much as 103.2 bcf/d of gas in 2024, more than enough to feed domestic demand.<sup>19</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Haynesville Shale in Northwest Louisiana benefits from export demand, given its proximity and midstream connections to the Gulf Coast. Demand for LNG is expected to drive production growth in Haynesville, following terminal expansions at the Golden Pass and Plaquemines LNG facilities in 2025, which could add as much as 5 bcf/d of incremental capacity by late 2026.<sup>20</sup> The Marcellus Shale in Western Pennsylvania is located close to demand sources in the Northeast and is well positioned to supply gas to Northern Virginia, the proclaimed “data center capital of the world.” PJM, the region’s main power utility, expects winter-peak power demand in the region to rise from 136 GW in 2024 to over 200 GW by the end of the 2030s, fueled by data center expansions.<sup>21</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Upstream drilling activity is typically price-driven, and natural gas producers could benefit should prices increase from rising demand growth. Natural gas prices averaged just $2.21 per million British Thermal Units (mmBtu) in 2024, following a period of high production from associated natural gas (a by-product of oil drilling) and relatively flat demand growth.<sup>22</sup> In 2025, natural gas prices are expected to rise again from $3.00 in September 2025 to $4.10 in 2026, thanks to the deployment of LNG export capacity and surprise demand growth linked to AI data center expansions.<sup>23</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Higher natural gas prices tend to benefit producers, thanks to their ability to raise output, and a period of steadily rising commodity prices could boost upstream valuations. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects dry gas production will rise to a record 107.4 bcf/d in 2026 from 103.2 bcf/d in 2024.<sup>24</sup> The majority of production growth is expected to come from the Haynesville and Marcellus Shales, which are expected to soar by 41% and 9%, respectively, as well as the Permian Basin, where gas production is expected to rise 21% by 2027, according to projections from Morgan Stanley.<sup>25</sup> In our view, this upward price trajectory could be persistent, given the LNG capacity growth that underpins it; this could bring U.S. natural gas prices structurally closer to international price benchmarks as LNG demand overtakes domestic household consumption.<sup>26</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_03.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6668\" data-height=\"4370\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_03.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251024 - LNGX Launch_03.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"839\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_03.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_03.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_03.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_03.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_03.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_03.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_03.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_03.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Midstream Opportunity for U.S. Natural Gas</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the upstream opportunity is rooted in raising production, the opportunity in U.S. midstream is in infrastructure expansion. Midstream refers to the segment of the supply chain that operates energy transmission facilities that connect our shale basins to end-users (homes, businesses, and export markets). It also encompasses the processing, storage, and compression services that prepare it for end markets, which includes the liquefaction process that converts raw natural gas into LNG. Consequently, midstream energy infrastructure is essential to growing upstream production because it allows for the unloading of gas that has been produced.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Shale Revolution unlocked vast reserves of natural gas, but until recently, infrastructure constraints kept gas production landlocked, leading to regional supply gluts and the capping of natural gas prices within the U.S. (Unlike crude oil, natural gas is not easily transported and must be pressurized or liquefied to move in large quantities across vast distances.) This has historically led to wide price disparities in global gas prices, and this is evidenced in the wide price differentials between U.S. gas benchmark prices and international trading hubs in Europe and Asia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The tide turned in 2016, when Cheniere Energy’s first shipment from its Sabine Pass terminal departed for foreign shores.<sup>27</sup> Since then, millions of tonnes of new capacity have come online as legacy import terminals were converted for export purposes, and new liquefaction trains were constructed to grow export capacity (liquefaction trains are the units that process and liquefy natural gas for export). This is what transformed the United States into the world’s largest gas supplier over the past decade,<sup>28</sup> a monumental pivot for the global energy trade. Today, the U.S. is able to capitalize on its ample supply as the world’s largest LNG exporter, while Europe and Asia remain “price-takers,” reliant on imports and compelled to compete for limited LNG cargos.<sup>29</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The United States is projected to lead global LNG capacity additions in nearly every year through 2030, accounting for ~48.3% of all liquefaction capacity additions beyond the Final Investment Decision (FID),<sup>30</sup> the stage at which firms officially commit to project development. These expansions align with the United States’ supportive energy policy, which lifted the previous administration’s pause on permitting and declared a national energy emergency to accelerate approvals for pending energy infrastructure projects.<sup>31</sup> This policy shift has already facilitated the approvals for several major LNG projects in 2025, including Sempra Energy’s Port Arthur Phase 2,<sup>32</sup> Commonwealth LNG,<sup>33</sup> Golden Pass LNG,<sup>34</sup> and a 13% capacity expansion at Venture Global’s Plaquemines LNG.<sup>35</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, the continued expansion of LNG export capacity could more closely integrate U.S. natural gas supplies with global markets, providing strong incentives and a clear roadmap for domestic producers to raise output. In our view, this creates an opportunity across the U.S. natural gas value chain where, as midstream export infrastructure expands, upstream production can scale, and both segments stand to benefit from the world’s growing demand for LNG.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_04.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6668\" data-height=\"4649\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_04.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251024 - LNGX Launch_04.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"892\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_04.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_04.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_04.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_04.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_04.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_04.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_04.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_251024_20-_20LNGX_20Launch_04.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">LNGX: Focuses on the U.S. Natural Gas Supply Chain</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Global X U.S. Natural Gas ETF is an index-based passive ETF that invests in U.S.-listed and domiciled upstream and midstream companies that derive at least 50% of their total proved reserves (for upstream) or revenues (for midstream) from natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs), based on the definitions below.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Upstream Significant-Play: </strong>Companies with Natural Gas and NGL proved reserves accounting for at least 75% of their total proved reserves, as per FactSet REVERE Fundamentals.</li> <li> <strong>Upstream Pure-Play: </strong>Companies with Natural Gas and NGL proved reserves accounting for at least 50% of their total proved reserves, as per FactSet REVERE Fundamentals (40% for existing index components).</li> <li> <strong>Midstream Pure-Play: </strong>Companies earning greater than or equal to 50% of revenue attributable to Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids businesses.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Global X U.S. Natural Gas Index, which LNGX tracks, employs a modified free-float market cap-weighted approach, which prioritizes upstream producers that hold significant natural gas reserves as a proportion of their proved reserves and includes midstream firms that attribute the majority of their revenues to natural gas and NGLs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We believe LNGX’s value chain approach grants exposure to natural gas producers, transporters, and exporters that allows investors to express a view on the structural growth themes underpinning expansion in this space. Its pure-play focus offers targeted natural gas exposure while limiting corresponding exposure to oil and refined petroleum businesses. Further, its domestic orientation attempts to isolate the tailwinds driving the U.S. natural gas industry amidst the global “winner-take-all” backdrop.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The U.S. natural gas industry has witnessed a surge in demand driven by a call for LNG by allies overseas and a sudden jump in power consumption, which demands multiples of the growth in power generation we’ve seen over previous decades. Such trends present opportunities for all segments of the natural gas supply chain, from our resource-rich shale basins to the industrializing export terminals on our shores, opportunities which we believe are characteristics of America’s exceptional resource base. The Global X U.S. Natural Gas ETF targets these trends by tracking an index of domestic firms with strong ties to the U.S. natural gas industry while avoiding potentially dilutive exposure in overseas names.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>U.S. Energy Information Administration (2025, June 9).
