Information technology stocks led the benchmark<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> 1000 Value Index in the fourth quarter, followed closely by communication services and health care, which saw positive performance thanks to lower policy uncertainty, improved earnings, attractive valuations and a pickup in M&amp;A (mergers and acquisitions) activity. Despite a 25-basis-point cut in the federal funds rate in December, elevated long-term yields weighed on two sectors: real estate and utilities—the latter also suffering as the artificial intelligence trade pulled back.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Contributors: </strong>Holdings in Micron Technology (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU\" title=\"Micron Technology, Inc.\">MU</a>), Freeport-McMoRan (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FCX\" title=\"Freeport-McMoRan Inc.\">FCX</a>) and OneMain (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OMF\" title=\"OneMain Holdings, Inc.\">OMF</a>). Stock selection in materials, IT and an overweight to health care.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Detractors: </strong>Holdings in Corcept Therapeutics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CORT\" title=\"Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated\">CORT</a>), Fiserv (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FISV\" title=\"Fiserv, Inc.\">FISV</a>) and Charter Communications (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CHTR\" title=\"Charter Communications, Inc.\">CHTR</a>). Stock selection in the health care, financials and communication services sector and an underweight to the IT sector.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Outlook: </strong>With value spreads near historic extremes and AI adoption poised to broaden economic benefits, we see an attractive probability gap that creates meaningful upside potential for valuation-driven investors.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance Review</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The Portfolios mildly underperformed their benchmark in a quarter that broadly favored value over growth, as declines in health care overcame strength from technology and materials stocks.</li> <li>Stock selection in the health care sector was the greatest detractor from relative returns in the fourth quarter, largely owing to the decline in drug developer Corcept Therapeutics, whose stock fell following the release of a FDA Response Letter for its relacorilant program, citing the need for additional evidence to support approval. With the prospect of the company having to lean more heavily on its legacy products, which are under pressure from greater generic competition, we elected to exit the position.</li> <li>Our top performer was Micron Technology, which continued to extend its strong 2025 performance following attractive earnings results and upbeat guidance due to accelerating AI-driven demand, tightening memory supply and improving pricing dynamics across DRAM and high-bandwidth memory markets. Performance was also bolstered by copper miner Freeport McMoRan, whose shares advanced alongside the commodity price on improving global growth expectations, a weaker U.S. dollar and continued optimism around long-term demand tied to electrification and energy transition trends.</li> <li>Newmont (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEM\" title=\"Newmont Corporation\">NEM</a>), in the materials sector, engages in the production and exploration of gold properties, as well as the exploration for copper, silver, zinc, lead, and other metals. The company's share price moved higher alongside gold prices during the quarter. Additionally, we believe that the market is beginning to recognize discount in the company's share price given the current price of gold and attractive free cash flow generation.</li> <li>Fiserv, in the information technology sector, provides payment and financial services technology. The company's stock declined after reporting disappointing third quarter results, missing earnings expectations, cutting full-year guidance and announcing a leadership shake-up, which raised investor concerns about growth and execution.</li> <li>Charter Communications, in the communication services sector, operates as a broadband connectivity and cable operator company serving residential and commercial customers. The company's stock declined after reporting weak third quarter results with subscriber losses, missing earnings expectations and announcing workforce reductions, which heightened investor concerns about growth and rising costs.</li> <li>In the fourth quarter, we made several changes within our financials holdings. For example, we swapped our exposure within regional banks by replacing M&amp;T Bank (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTB\" title=\"M&amp;T Bank Corporation\">MTB</a>) with Fifth Third Bancorp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FITB\" title=\"Fifth Third Bancorp\">FITB</a>). We believe that Fifth Third is poised to accelerate its growth by combining its best-in-class digital strengths with recently acquired AmeriCorps's middle-market franchise in fast-growing, attractive regions in the Southeast, Texas and California, ultimately upgrading our overall return profile.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>At a broad level we underestimated the resilience of the market and the economy to the year's two big volatility events: the reveal of Chinese AI model DeepSeek and President Trump's Liberation Day. Both caused volatility to spike and relative performance pain despite ultimately proving incredibly short lived. The commonality in both is that we underestimated the structural resilience of the U.S. economy and the operating leverage that continues to support best-in-the-world free cash flow (FCF) margins for U.S. companies.</li> <li>On a broad level, the market continues to price value stocks relative to growth at a level that implies value has little chance of leading. Despite a couple of good years, value spreads have remained trapped at the cheapest 10% of their history. We think the catalyst for value's escape will, ironically, come from AI adoption. 2026 will be the year that AI has to justify the immense and accelerating capital investment. To do this, it will need to be diffused more broadly across the economy, driving material productivity gains and higher profit margins. If this occurs, it could narrow the margin, return and earnings growth gap between tech stocks and AI adopters, including value stocks not priced for this structural upside.</li> <li>Ultimately, we believe that the crucible of 2025 has helped sharpen our positioning for 2026. We are actively focused on finding AI adoption in sectors and industries where it is not currently priced, giving us exposure to the upside scenarios as we compound higher growth in a value wrapper. For the downsides, we are focused on companies generating free cash flow and with strong balance sheets. We have also continued to decrease individual stock volatility where we cannot reduce it as part of our portfolio construction. Finally, we are overweight real asset sectors such as energy and materials, which should do well in an inflation scenario while also compounding business value from robust ongoing free cash flow generation.</li> </ul> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Our main goal is to get back to making active valuation-disciplined investing look simple again, even if it isn't easy. While we approach every new year with humility and a focus on process discipline, we think positioning for many possible futures is critical in a market priced for a narrow set of outcomes — especially when the alternatives have much higher probabilities than what the market has priced. In an increasingly passive world crowded into the same few stocks and sectors, we think that this is a key source of differentiated returns for active, probability-driven managers like us.</li></ul> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tr><td> <h4></h4> <h4>Top Equity Issuers (% of Total)</h4> <div class=\"table-responsive\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th>Holding</th> <th>Portfolio</th> </tr></thead> <tr> <td>Alphabet Inc</td> <td>4.42</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Bank of America Corp</td> <td>3.76</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd</td> <td>3.69</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Johnson &amp; Johnson</td> <td>2.95</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <a href=\"https://amazon.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon.com</a> Inc</td> <td>2.54</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Micron Technology Inc</td> <td>2.47</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Chevron Corp</td> <td>2.22</td> </tr> <tr> <td>EQT Corp</td> <td>2.21</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Walt Disney Co/The</td> <td>2.18</td> </tr> <tr> <td>CVS Health Corp</td> <td>2.04</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <h2><span>Average annual total returns (%) - as of December 31, 2025-Preliminary</span></h2> <div class=\"table-responsive\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th>Composite</th> <th>3-Mo*</th> <th>6-Mo*</th> <th>YTD*</th> <th>1-Yr</th> <th>3-Yr</th> <th>5-Yr</th> <th>10-Yr</th> <th>15-Yr</th> <th>20-Yr</th> <th>25-Yr</th> <th>Inception</th> <th>Inception Date</th> </tr></thead> <tr> <td>Net of Fees</td> <td>2.87</td> <td>6.41</td> <td>8.85</td> <td>8.85</td> <td>11.28</td> <td>8.95</td> <td>7.07</td> <td>6.32</td> <td>4.91</td> <td>3.82</td> <td>6.50</td> <td>12/31/1993</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Pure Gross of Fees</td> <td>3.62</td> <td>7.98</td> <td>12.10</td> <td>12.10</td> <td>14.59</td> <td>12.20</td> <td>10.27</td> <td>9.49</td> <td>8.05</td> <td>6.94</td> <td>9.68</td> <td>12/31/1993</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Benchmark</td> <td>3.81</td> <td>9.34</td> <td>15.91</td> <td>15.91</td> <td>13.90</td> <td>11.33</td> <td>10.53</td> <td>10.78</td> <td>8.32</td> <td>7.71</td> <td>9.63</td> <td>—</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p>*Cumulative total returns</p> <h4>Benchmark(s)</h4> <p>Benchmark = Russell 1000 Value Index</p> <p><strong>The strategy returns shown are preliminary composite returns, subject to future revision (downward or upward).</strong></p> <p><strong>Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

This led me to mark a Buy rating on IMPP stock. With a stock price of $4.3 and an<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> mCap of ~$177 million and a zero-debt balance sheet backed by $172 million in absolute cash base, the enterprise value [EV] is virtually minimal. The strategic locking of 75% of fleet days into time charters backs stable cash flow and insulates Imperial Petroleum against spot market volatility and organic cash funds for an expansion to 26 vessels. The rationale behind my Buy rating is the floor formed by the $9.21 fully diluted Net Asset Value [NAV] and the $6.3 institutional capital raise. However, there are speculative elements. The main risk involves Imperial Petroleum's pattern for value-destructive equity dilution and the looming operational downtime from 12 scheduled vessel drydockings in 2026 that will temporarily suppress Imperial Petroleum’s earnings.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Uncoupling IMPP’s EV From Its Unencumbered Liquidity Fortress And Counter-Cyclical Cash Flow</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The major long-term positive (catalyst) for Imperial Petroleum’s stock price-upside is the absolute uncoupling of its EV from its liquidity stronghold and counter-cyclical cash flow. To expand more here, Imperial Petroleum is shifting from a highly volatile pure-play spot tanker operator into a diversified maritime infrastructure asset. To answer how? There is a fleet operational utilization rate of 88.7% and a strategic development that locked 75% of Imperial Petroleum’s calendar days into predictable time charter contracts. This development insulates Imperial Petroleum from freight rate volatility and, at the same time, drives massive predictable cash flows (<a href=\"https://www.imperialpetro.com/index.php/investor-relations/press-releases/137-imperial-petroleum-inc-reports-third-quarter-and-nine-months-2025-financial-and-operating-results\" rel=\"nofollow\">$57 million in operating cash flow</a> derived in YTD-FY2025 (9M). However, the main upside catalyst is in Imperial Petroleum stock’s current valuation against its zero-debt capital structure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-1772009483886477_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1099\" data-height=\"621\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-1772009483886477_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"75% of Imperial Petroleum‘s calendar days into predictable time charter contracts\" width=\"640\" height=\"362\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"362\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-1772009483886477_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-1772009483886477_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-1772009483886477_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-1772009483886477_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Imperial Petroleum IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a current stock price of $4.3, yielding an mCap of ~$177 million, the EV is practically minimized by Imperial Petroleum's stated <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4852559-imperial-petroleum-inc-impp-q3-2025-earnings-call-prepared-remarks-transcript\">cash base of $172 million</a>. A long position in IMPP stock is like acquiring an expanding fleet of 19 vessels (soon to be 26 vessels, totaling 1.5 million deadweight tons) for minimal enterprise premium. This large liquidity pool acts as a counter-cyclical instrument in the capital-intensive maritime market. Instead of suffocating under high-interest-rate burdens and restrictive debt covenants, Imperial Petroleum’s balance sheet allows it to organically self-fund all forward growth. The scheduled delivery of an additional 5 handysize drybulk carriers, a post-Panamax drybulk carrier, and a massive 319,400 dwt product tanker will be capitalized through existing cash and internal cash flow. This factor is bypassing the prohibitive costs of maritime debt markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, this absolute removal of interest expense guarantees that every incremental dollar of EBITDA (that increased 46.7% Y/Y to $17.9 million in Q3-FY2025) drops directly to the bottom line.

Moreover, the $60 million registered direct equity offering priced at <a href=\"https://www.imperialpetro.com/index.php/investor-relations/press-releases/137-imperial-petroleum-inc-reports-third-quarter-and-nine-months-2025-financial-and-operating-results\" rel=\"nofollow\">$6.3 in December 2025 </a>forms a strong institutional cost basis that is higher than the current traded price. Once Wall Street prices in the fact that the $52 million CapEx for 2026 acquisitions can be easily absorbed without impacting the liquidity moat, the extreme dislocation between the $4.3 share price and the management-estimated fully diluted NAV of $9.21 per share can quickly correct upwards, in my opinion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To clarify more on this, my point is that through maintaining a strong balance sheet, Imperial Petroleum may have stripped away the traditional bankruptcy and refinancing risks (that plague shipping equities, in general). This strong architecture/financial state means that even in a recession where spot rates collapse, Imperial Petroleum’s locked-in time charter revenues and vast cash reserves can theoretically stabilize operations. All this backs a possible long-term upward re-rating of IMPP stock as the deep-value advantage simply becomes too obvious for institutional capital/smart money to ignore.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk Of Chronic Equity Dilution With A Highly Concentrated Operational Bottleneck</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the long term, I am not ignoring the overarching risk of chronic equity dilution along with a highly concentrated operational bottleneck in FY2026. Despite holding a zero-debt balance sheet and driving a strong operating cash flow YTD, Imperial Petroleum did a highly questionable $60 million registered direct equity offering in December 2025. Raising equity at $6.3 per share amid holding over $100 million in cash and a fully diluted NAV of $9.21 per share is a harsh signal (from my perspective) that management prioritizes fleet-building and raw asset accumulation over per-share value accretion. This capitalization risk forms a value trap. To clarify, on how? If Wall Street locks in a sentiment that any forward cash flow spikes will be utilized as a base for further dilutive equity raises instead of capital return (buybacks/dividends), IMPP stock can suffer from a multiple compression.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a forward-basis, this effect can keep the stock price permanently disconnected from Imperial Petroleum’s asset value. Compounding this governance discount is a brutal operational cliff. Imperial Petroleum has scheduled 12 of its vessels to undergo mandatory drydocking in 2026. This is a big disruption that is sidelining almost half of the expanded 26-vessel fleet. The direct CapEx required for these <a href=\"https://www.imperialpetro.com/images/IMPPQ325.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">drydockings is estimated at $14 million</a>. However, I am focusing on a far more destructive cost, which is the large opportunity cost of lost operational days. With a fleet that has an 88.7% operational utilization rate, removing 12 vessels from active service will eat up revenue and short-term operating income. When this loss of active charter days is happening with the $52 million in capital commitments needed to pay for the 3 Japanese-built drybulk vessels (scheduled for delivery between Q1-Q3-FY2026), Imperial Petroleum’s $172 million cash castle can be quickly drained out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720094558563485_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1085\" data-height=\"391\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720094558563485_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Imperial Petroleum 2026 Strategy\" width=\"640\" height=\"231\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"231\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720094558563485_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720094558563485_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720094558563485_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720094558563485_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Imperial Petroleum IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More so, if macro conditions deteriorate (like a reversal in Chinese iron ore demand and further OPEC+ production cuts that may be limiting Suezmax tanker demand), at the same time, when this operational downtime peaks, Imperial Petroleum can face a high cash burn cycle. The magnitude of this dual-risk case is big. All in all, Imperial Petroleum expands its physical footprint and erodes its outstanding share denominator that builds downward gravity on the stock price. Smart Money/Institutional investors observing this emergence of peak CapEx, halved operational fleet capacity, and an aggressive dilution may dump the stock irrespective of how theoretically cheap Imperial Petroleum’s EV appears.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Imperial Petroleum Stock Valuation (Marks 72% Upside) And Q4 Alpha Protocol</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Imperial Petroleum’s stock valuation needs an EV/EBITDA method focused on NAV and the enterprise liquidity base. As of now, Imperial Petroleum has a $172 million cash base with zero debt against an mCap of ~$177 million. This yields an EV of ~$5 million only for a fleet generating $49.6 million in EBITDA over YTD-FY2025 (9M). Imperial Petroleum’s pro forma fully diluted NAV is at $9.21 per share based on the assumption of all outstanding warrants after the December equity offering. To find a realistic target price, a governance and fleet age discount must be applied to Imperial Petroleum’s asset value. If I apply a current aggressive market discount [based on the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)] and use the forward 3.575x EV/EBITDA multiple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IMPP/valuation/metrics\">50% below the sector median</a>) on annualized 2025 EBITDA of $66 million, it yields an EV of ~$236 million. Adding the current $172 million cash base leads to an equity value of ~$408 million. Dividing this by an estimated 55.2 million (508.03 million net assets/$9.21 NAV per share) fully diluted shares gives a fair value of $7.4 per share. This target price holds a highly logical +72% upside from current levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Prior to the Q4 release, IMPP bulls can buy a baseline long-position. The current $4.3 stock price with post-Q3 swing prices-in the negativity of the December equity dilution and integrating the operating advantage (in my opinion). Q4 results will capture the full quarterly cash flow from the newly integrated 19-vessel fleet and the seasonal winter rate spikes in the product tanker market. These factors are backing a high probability for a strong earnings beat. After Q4, focus must shift to forward guidance. If Imperial Petroleum’s management provides a staggered timeline for the 12 scheduled FY2026 drydockings that protects baseline cash flow and confirms halting further stock dilution, bulls should aggressively scale long-side positions into the IMPP stock. On the negative, if earnings indicate unchecked CapEx and hints of further stock offerings, long-positions must be liquidated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720093894285793_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2000\" data-height=\"1281\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720093894285793_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Imperial Petroleum IMPP stock price recovery Post-Q3\" width=\"640\" height=\"410\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"410\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720093894285793_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720093894285793_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720093894285793_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720093894285793_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>YCharts</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">___</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, with all that, Imperial Petroleum stock ticks a Buy rating due to an extreme, unignorable valuation disconnect. Imperial Petroleum, driving high FCF, holding $172 million in cash base with zero debt, and expanding to 26 vessels, cannot logically trade at an EV near zero. Moreso, the upside potential eclipses the downside risks at the $4.3 entry point. On a forward basis, I will be tracking the outstanding share count to check on absolute zero further dilution, the execution efficiency of the $52 million CapEx for the three pending drybulk acquisitions, and the scheduling of the 12 upcoming 2026 drydockings. Any deviation that signals deteriorating governance and unmanaged operational off-hire days may invalidate my bullish thesis.</p>",

The article was triggered by ABBV’s dividend<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> declaration made for Q1 2026 and rated the stock as a hold. As for </span><strong class=\"paywall-full-content\">Merck &amp; Co., Inc.</strong><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> (</span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRK\" title=\"Merck &amp; Co., Inc.\">MRK</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), my last analysis dated further back to July 16, 2025. That article was triggered by the </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4446414-innovation-pharma-profits-wont-suffer-under-trump-prescription-drug-eo-white-house\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Executive Order</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> that President Trump announced to lower drug prices for American consumers at that time. It also rated MRK as a hold.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since then, there have been a few new catalysts evolving around both heath care stocks. The remainder sections of this article will focus on A) the updates they provided in their recent FQ4 2025 earnings reports (ER), and B) their latest dividend announcements. As to be elaborated, the latest financial changes in FQ4, when combined with their latest dividend declarations, have materially changed their dividend cushion ratio in our model. More specifically, my analysis shows the continued improvement in MRK’s cushion ratio in contrast continued weakening in ABBV’s. This divergence is substantial enough to lead to a rating upgrade for MRK to buy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let me start with a quick recap of the FQ4 ER for both companies to prime the rest of the discussion. Both MRK and ABBV released their ER in early February (on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup>, respectively). Both companies post robust results, both beating consensus estimates as shown in the snapshots below. AbbVie continued its upward momentum with a double digit YOY growth rate of 10.04% on the topline. In contrast, Merck demonstrated another quarter of earnings recovery following a weak start in the year. After suffering a YOY decline in Q1 and Q2, MRK’s revenue turned around and grew 3.72% and 4.97% in Q3 and Q4, respectively. These results suggest to me that the macroeconomic headwinds (such as the effects of drug pricing mentioned in my earlier articles) facing the health care sector are dissipating, supporting an overall favorable outlook for both stocks in my view.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029971493747_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1944\" data-height=\"300\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029971493747_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"99\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029971493747_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029971493747_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029971493747_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029971493747_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299721480277_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1941\" data-height=\"309\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299721480277_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"102\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299721480277_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299721480277_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299721480277_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299721480277_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">MRK and ABBV: Dividend cushion ratio in focus</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The updated earnings, when combined with their latest dividend declarations, have brought the payout ratios of both stocks closer as shown in the top panel of the next chart charts.

To start, they fluctuate quite a bit due to quarterly profit uncertainties, especially in terms of accounting EPS payout ratios as shown in the bottom panel in the chart above. More fundamentally, the also completely ignore other important factors such as the use of leverage and the status of the balance sheet. From years of experiences, an effective framework I found that can overcome these limitations is the dividend cushion ratio (“DCR”). Details of the DCR is provided in Brian M Nelson’s book entitled <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Value-Trap-Theory-Universal-Valuation/dp/0998038482\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Value Trap</em></a>. The key steps are quoted there to ease reference:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>The DCR is obtained by A) summing the existing net cash a company has on its balance sheet plus its expected future free cash flows over the next five years, and B) dividing that sum by future expected cash dividends (including expected growth in them, where applicable) over the same time period. If the ratio is significantly above 1, the company generally has sufficient financial capacity to pay out its expected future dividends. The higher the ratio, the better, all else equal. </em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before presenting my results (shown in the next two charts for those who cannot wait), let me first point out a few modification I made to Nelson’s above framework. In step A quote above, his original framework subtracted the total debt to obtain the net cash position on the balance sheet. In my calculations, I only subtracted the current liabilities and the interest expenses on the consideration of MRK and ABBV’s profit consistency and credit ratings. With these considerations, I see virtually zero possibility in any foreseeable future for MRK or ABBV to have the need of repaying all their debts all at once. Thus, I feel appropriate to assess their cushion ratio based on the assumption that both MRK and ABBV only need to repay the current portion of their debts and service the interest payments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bearing this modification in mind, let’s walk through the details of their DCRs now. The first observation that stands out is that both MRK and ABBV have been maintaining DCRs well above the 1x threshold. To wit, MRK’s DCR has been always above 2.0x since 2020 with a 6-year average of 2.29x as seen in the first chart. The same is true for ABBV’s DCR too as seen in the second chart, and its 6-year average reading is even better at 2.64x as shown.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715642717_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1026\" data-height=\"540\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715642717_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A yellow and red text on a white background AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"337\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715642717_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715642717_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715642717_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715642717_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029972459901_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1013\" data-height=\"531\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029972459901_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A yellow and red text on a white background AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"335\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029972459901_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029972459901_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029972459901_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029972459901_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">ABBV and MRK: CAPEX in focus</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 2<sup>nd</sup> observation that stands out is the divergence between MRK and ABBV’s cushion ratios. As seen, since 2021, MRK’s DRC has kept improving and my projected reading points to a further thickening to 2.57x in 2026, not only above its own historical average by a good margin but also exceeds my projected ratio for ABBV at 2.19x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Digging to the ER deeper, a key factor causing the divergence is their CAPEX plans. To wit, the next chart compares the Cash Flow (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CF\" title=\"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.\">CF</a>) to Capital Expenditure (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAPEX\" title=\"Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Growth Fund 1.0\">CAPEX</a>) ratio for ABBV and MRK in the past 5 years from 2021 to the present. This metric measures a company's ability to fund its physical asset investments using its operating cash flow, and a higher ratio is better with everything else being equal. As seen, AbbVie has significantly cranked up its CAPEX spendings in recent years. The company CF-CAPEX ratio was on average 25.59 in the past 5 years, which meant it spent on average about 3.9% (the inverse of 25.59) of its CF to fund its CAPEX in the past. The current reading is 15.86x per the FQ4 ER, which means it spent about 6.3% of its CF in the past quarter on CAPEX. Such a large increase in CF impacted its free cash flow, which in turn pressured its DCR. Judging by the guidance provided in its FQ4 ER, I expect ABBV’s CAPEX to remain alleviated in 2026 to support is various pipeline efforts. In contrast, MRK’s CF-CAPEX ratio has been on an upward trend in the past few quarters and sits above its long-term average as seen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029973771875_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1353\" data-height=\"423\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029973771875_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"200\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029973771875_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029973771875_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029973771875_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029973771875_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other risks and final thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, ABBV’s CF-CAPEX ratio of 15.86x is completely manageable and sustainable in my experience despite the substantial change relative to its historical norm. Furthermore, as shown in the chart above, ABBV’s current CF-CAPEX ratio of 15.86x is still about 2x higher than Merck’s ratio of 7.92x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of valuation, ABBV is trading at a larger P/E ratio discount relative to MRK. To wit, the following screenshot compares their FWD P/E ratios. Based on FY1 EPS projection, MRK’s P/E is 24.15x, a premium of more than 56% compared to ABBV's reading of only 15.73x. Although note that with MRK’s better growth projection, its P/E ratios would quickly approach ABBV’s in FY2 (12.6x vs. 14.2x) and become lower than ABBV’s ratio in FY3 (11.4x vs 12.9x). Finally, judging by their dividend yields, I believe the above FY1 P/E comparison overstates MRK’s P/E premium. As an example, MRK’s forward yield of 2.74% is about 8% below its 4-year average yield, while ABBV’s forward yield of 3.03% is about 15% below its own 4-year average yield (see the last chart). Such as contrast suggests that ABBV is actually trading at a higher valuation premium than MRK.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To close, this follow-up article on MRK and ABBV is largely promoted by 2 new developments since my last analyses: their latest FQ4 2025 ERs and their latest dividend declarations. A closer look at these developments suggests to me that the macroeconomic headwinds facing the sector are fading, which supports my overall positive view towards both ABBV and MRK. A look at their financials further shows their dividend safety with DCRs well above 1x. Although the divergence in their DCR, mostly due to their CAPEX plans, is substantial enough for me to upgrade MRK’s rating to buy.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715451105_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"913\" data-height=\"287\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715451105_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"201\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715451105_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715451105_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715451105_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715451105_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha data</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029978856417_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"943\" data-height=\"274\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029978856417_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"186\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029978856417_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029978856417_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029978856417_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029978856417_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p>",

He argued that “the risk of a substantial downturn in the labor market combined with a limited risk of higher inflation warranted another cut.” Mixed economic signals since that meeting are doing little to settle the debate, while </span><a href=\"https://www.schiffgold.com/friday-gold-wrap/gold-just-issued-a-warning-the-fed-cant-ignore\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">gold, ever the monetary barometer</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">, notched a fresh high of $5,236 per ounce on Monday.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Waller’s caution springs largely from the labor market. January’s headline payroll report showed a chunky 130,000 jobs gain—more than the previous nine months combined—and unemployment edging lower. Yet alternative trackers painted a far weaker picture: ADP recorded just 22,000 private positions, Revelio counted 3,000, and Challenger logged 108,000 <a href=\"https://www.schiffgold.com/peters-podcast/peter-schiff-jobs-vanished-no-surprise\" rel=\"nofollow\">layoff announcements</a>, the worst January since 2009. Official revisions already revealed that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4870386-only-181k-total-jobs-gained-for-all-2025-after-massive-revisions-lower\" rel=\"noopener\">only 181,000 jobs were created in all of 2025</a>—an anemic 15,000 per month—and Waller expects further downward tweaks that could turn last year negative. He called the latest print “noise more than signal,” noting that three-quarters of the additions came from health care and construction, which together make up roughly one-fifth of employment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth data complicate the narrative. Real GDP expanded at a 1.4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, but private domestic final purchases—a better gauge of underlying demand—rose 2.4 percent. Manufacturing output jumped 0.6 percent in January, its best showing in almost a year, and service-sector purchasing manager indexes have been in expansion territory for 19 consecutive months. Still, consumption is cooling: personal consumption expenditure (PCE) growth slid from 3.5 percent in the third quarter to 2.4 percent in the fourth as lower- and middle-income shoppers traded down or simply bought less.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On prices, core Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rose 0.3 percent in January, up 2.5 percent year over year. Waller pegs core PCE at roughly 3 percent and “underlying” inflation near the Fed’s 2 percent target once tariff effects are stripped out. The Supreme Court’s decision to overturn much of last year’s import-tariff package muddies that outlook; the Administration plans to reinstate some duties, leaving future price pressures uncertain but, in Waller’s view, temporary. Upcoming readings—producer prices on February 27th, February payrolls on March 6th, and CPI on March 11th—will drive his March vote.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, bullion’s record run suggests many savers aren’t banking on a quick return to monetary normalcy. With real yields still subdued and the Fed openly debating additional easing even as headline growth persists, gold’s appeal as a store of value remains strong, particularly for those wary of fiat-fuelled asset bubbles and shifting policy targets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.schiffgold.com/commentaries/waller-calls-march-rate-move-a-coin-flip-as-jobs-data-diverge\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

The valuation isn't that bad either, but still close to my last </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4812980-cava-group-stock-falls-after-despite-q2-eps-beat-but-still-only-a-hold-rating-upgrade\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">article</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">, where I assigned a hold rating precisely because of the price.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And now, <span></span>CAVA Group has just reported its Q4 earnings, which the market liked very much and made the stock jump about 8%. But even so, with this valuation, I would have liked to have seen a better result, especially regarding same-store sales for the quarter and for the outlook. So I'm downgrading CAVA stock to a sell rating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 Earnings: Not Worth 8% Gains</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span></span>CAVA's Q4 results were interesting, with non-GAAP EPS <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556209-cava-group-non-gaap-eps-of-0_04-beats-by-0_01-revenue-of-272_8m-beats-by-4_4m\">beating expectation</a>s by $0.01, which is very significant given that the market was only expecting $0.03, and the top line also positively exceeded market expectations by around $4.4 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The full year was also very solid. Same restaurant sales were up <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874157-cava-group-inc-2025-q4-results-earnings-call-presentation\">4%</a>, which is great considering that industry giants like Chipotle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMG\" title=\"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\">CMG</a>) are struggling. Over 70 new stores were opened, and restaurant margins also remained at an interesting level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733413418236_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"855\" data-height=\"753\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733413418236_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cava FY 2025 highlights\" width=\"640\" height=\"564\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733413418236_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733413418236_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733413418236_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733413418236_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>CAVA<span> Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But Q4, specifically, was not so interesting. Okay, revenue grew 21% with the new openings, but same restaurant sales were only 0.5%. Even though the other quarters had been suffering, this was a worse quarter than the average for the year. The company's explanation was mainly that there was a decrease in guest traffic, which seems quite negative to me, even though the <span></span>CAVA Group managed to sustain a higher price and better mix.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The same occurred with the profit margin at the restaurant level, which fell to 21.4%, and again, seasonally it is also a worse quarter, but note in the image below that in Q4 last year the margin was also slightly higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733412001095_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"964\" data-height=\"797\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733412001095_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q4 2025 Cava Group Highlights\" width=\"640\" height=\"529\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733412001095_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733412001095_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733412001095_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733412001095_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>CAVA<span> Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I did not find anything worrying in terms of margin. Basically, there was an increase in costs related to deliveries and technology, in addition to some costs related to tariffs. So, given the company's momentum, I do not think it is something structurally bad. In addition, moving from the restaurant level to <span></span>CAVA as a company, G&amp;A expenses decreased in relation to revenue, which is very good and shows that the company is able to capture this operational leverage that will be crucial to unlocking value in a few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would even say that this quarter was good for the <span></span>CAVA Group, but if the outlook had been a little better. Management mentioned that it expects to open about 75 stores in 2026, and the profit margin at the restaurant level also has a very reasonable expectation, but my problem was with same-restaurant sales. <span></span>CAVA mentioned that it expects something between 3% and 5%. I know that the momentum is not yet the best, but for the market to have given this “re-rating” to the stock, I expected a much clearer turning point, for example, some mention of a potential return to high single digits, especially since the company is still in a stage of maturation, has several initiatives to undertake, such as digitalization to grow even more, offering new items on the menu, increasing customer loyalty so that they order more often, etc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So overall, I found it to be a quarter that was just reasonable, far from me being sure that <span></span>CAVA will deliver super value to shareholders in the coming years, and as the market cap increased by ~8% in one day, it becomes more difficult to be bullish on the case.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <span></span>CAVA Group Valuation: Not Good Enough Anymore</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The way this quarter impacts valuation, in my view, is more negative than positive. My previous expectation was that <span></span>CAVA Group would reach ~1,000 units in 2032, and it should still achieve this, as it is opening ~75 per year, and if it accelerates to 80 halfway through, it can reach around 995 without too many problems.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But the problem was with revenue per restaurant. Before, I expected something closer to high single-digit growth per year, on average, so the bad momentum would pass and <span></span>CAVA would return to better numbers. But with an outlook between 3% and 5%, it is difficult to be convinced that revenue per restaurant will reach such a high CAGR.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So I changed my assumption to 5% per year revenue per restaurant, and that's considering that they will deliver the top of the guidance and the next few years will be stable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, we are talking about revenue of ~$3.8 billion in 2032. It seems quite feasible to me that <span></span>CAVA will be able to achieve this, but the market cap is at $8.4 billion after today's rise in CAVA stock. The price-to-sales ratio would be 2.2x, and that's after waiting until 2032. For comparison purposes, Dutch Bros (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BROS\" title=\"Dutch Bros Inc.\">BROS</a>), which is not exactly in the same sector but is also a company in the growth phase of the QSR industry, is currently trading at a P/S of 3.6x. Chipotle, which is already more mature, is also trading at a forward P/S of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMG/valuation/metrics\">3.6x</a>. So it seems like a very expensive multiple to me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But let's move on to net income, which is what really matters. If <span></span>CAVA continues to capture margin and reaches something closer to 13.5%, the same assumption as in the last article, we are talking about a net income of $513 million. The implied P/E is 16.4x, and that's after waiting until 2032.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733409797635_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"722\" data-height=\"297\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733409797635_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CAVA assumptions - 2032\" width=\"640\" height=\"263\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733409797635_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733409797635_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733409797635_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733409797635_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author (Kenio Fontes)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To illustrate how bad this could be, if the market assumes a fair forward P/E of 25x in 2032, we are talking about a total return of 53% in about 6 years. The total return per year would be ~7%, and that is considering that <span></span>CAVA would deliver all of this without many obstacles along the way. Of course, if the momentum is much better than expected and the market assigns some premium, then the valuation makes sense again with an implied total return closer to double digits.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main point for my downgrade is not because I think <span></span>CAVA Group is a bad company. In fact, I agree with the market on the qualitative side; it really is an interesting case. But the reason I see CAVA stock as a sell is mainly my disagreement with the market on valuation. I don't think there is a large margin of safety here, and Q4 earnings brought me more doubts than clarity in terms of revenue compounding over the next few years.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TREX\" title=\"Trex Company, Inc.\">TREX</a></span>) has already lost 27% of its value, justifying my hold and cautious stance before. Now, we are seeing some rebound attempts, driven by its better-than-expected Q4 2025 performance. Its fundamentals are<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> still intact, which ensures sustainability and longevity. However, valuation still shows little upside potential despite the selloff. Technicals have improved, but caution is still advised.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">TREX Q4 2025</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The combined effect of inflationary headwinds and housing market volatility continues to hammer housing-related industries like home furnishings and building products. Trex Company, Inc. is no exception as its sales contraction continues. Yet, its size and domestic market reach still help protect its profitability. This was evident in its most recent performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q4 2025, its sales amounted to <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260224569700/en/Trex-Company-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260224569700/en/Trex-Company-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results\" target=\"_blank\">$161.1M</a>, down by 3.9% YoY from $167.6M. This still spoke a lot about unfavorable market conditions amid weaker purchasing power and demand. It also halted the supposed comeback of the company. If you remember, its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TREX/income-statement\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TREX/income-statement\" target=\"_blank\">Q2 and Q3 2025 performance</a> showed sales recovery. With that, it may still take time to rebound. On a lighter note, TREX beat consensus expectations of $144.7M, which means that the actual sales were 11% higher than expected. It was even above the midpoint guidance range by the company of only $140-150M. It is also worth noting that the most recent YoY sales drop was already more manageable than in my previous coverage at 9.0%. This can tell us that TREX appears to be more adaptable to current market dynamics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But again, it is still having a hard time coping with inflation. Despite its sales contraction, mounting cost pressures continued to take their toll. The operating costs and expenses still increased. As a result, the operating margin was only 2.2%, which was far lower than 18.9% YoY. The only consolation is that TREX sales were still enough to cover all its costs and expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788043086615_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1358\" data-height=\"821\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788043086615_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Income Statement\" width=\"640\" height=\"387\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788043086615_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788043086615_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788043086615_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788043086615_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Income <span></span>Statement (TREX Q4 2025 Release<span></span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Challenges</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stubborn inflation remains a challenge for TREX. At <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi\" target=\"_blank\">2.7%</a>, it is still higher than the Fed's target of 2.0% and close to the 16-month high of 3.0%. We must also understand that positive inflation means rising prices. So, weaker purchasing power and higher cost pressures must also be considered. New tariffs may exacerbate this situation since they typically raise domestic prices. On top of that, TREX has some tariff exposure considering its raw materials for composite decking, like aluminum and steel, sourced outside the US.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Elevated house prices may also have negative spillovers into its business since lower housing demand may affect demand for its products and services. Currently, median prices are experiencing downward pressures. In Q4 2025, the median price was <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS\" target=\"_blank\">$405,300</a>. This was already 8.4% lower than its all-time high of $442,600 in Q4 2022. However, it remains above $400,000 and way higher than pre-pandemic levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788964015026_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1792\" data-height=\"672\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788964015026_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Median Home Price\" width=\"640\" height=\"240\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788964015026_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788964015026_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788964015026_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788964015026_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Median Home Price (ST.

Because its operations remain profitable, its operating cash flow remains enough to cover capex and buybacks. Its timely debt repayments and issuances also support its cash flow. With that, its cash and cash equivalents nearly tripled in just a year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772078934196727_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"774\" data-height=\"765\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772078934196727_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cash Flow\" width=\"640\" height=\"633\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772078934196727_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772078934196727_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772078934196727_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772078934196727_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cash Flo (TREX Q4 2025 Release<span></span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking into its balance sheet, you can see a little improvement in its inventory management. Meanwhile, borrowings appear to be a concern at first glance since the whole amount will mature within a year. But if you look at its Net Debt/EBITDA Ratio of 0.4x (($133.5M - $3.8M) / $336.0M), the company only needs 0.4x years, or about five months, to repay the whole amount even if it doesn't have to. Even if it uses only 50% of EBITDA, the ratio will still be low at 0.7x. Either way, it needs less than a year to cover the whole borrowing. Hence, its liquidity remains safe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790238457685_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"681\" data-height=\"738\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790238457685_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cash Flow\" width=\"640\" height=\"694\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790238457685_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790238457685_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790238457685_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790238457685_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cash Flow (Author's Computation<span></span>)</p></figcaption></figure> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790616203408_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"656\" data-height=\"731\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790616203408_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Balance Sheet\" width=\"640\" height=\"713\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790616203408_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790616203408_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790616203408_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790616203408_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Balance Sheet (TREX Q4 2025 Release<span></span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you look at external factors, there were some aspects to support TREX. For instance, existing home sales improved by <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/14/existing-home-sales-end-2025-stronger-than-expected.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/14/existing-home-sales-end-2025-stronger-than-expected.html\" target=\"_blank\">5.1%</a> YoY last December. This shows that consumer spending was still resilient despite skyrocketing prices. I think the decrease in the median price helped. More importantly, the recent policy easing cycle encouraged and would encourage more homebuyers. After all, this can also lower mortgage rates in the US. Moreover, lower interest rates can boost economic activity as well as employment and wages to support consumption. Loans and credit cards may become more affordable, so discretionary spending on composite decking may be supported.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To reassess its TREX's valuation, I made updates on the DCF model. As you can see, its FCFF increased a bit in line with the higher-than-expected revenues and earnings. This was crucial since I used the revenue model to estimate it. Meanwhile, I still set its perpetual growth rate at 2.0% to be consistent with the Fed's target inflation. Lastly, I estimated WACC using the capital asset pricing model. Note that I increased its risk premium to 6.0% to price in more risks. I just input 1.00 as its beta, assuming that it will be consistent with the S&amp;P 500. With that, I derived a TP or target price, of $46.47. If I add a 5% risk consideration, it will be $44.15. At its current price, TREX already has some upside potential. However, their actual gap remains narrow. Growth prospects are still too limited to justify any upside beyond my TP.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079140402062_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1343\" data-height=\"545\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079140402062_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DCF Model\" width=\"640\" height=\"260\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079140402062_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079140402062_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079140402062_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079140402062_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">DCF Model (Author's Computation<span></span>)</p></figcaption></figure> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079199485573.png?io=w640\" alt=\"WACC\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"372\" height=\"443\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079199485573.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079199485573.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">WACC (Authors Computation<span></span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Technicals</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TREX's technicals are starting to become bullish as the price increases with a more pronounced trend. It has also exceeded the 50-day SMA, showing that the current momentum is stronger than the average in the past 50 days. The 50-day SMA has also shifted upwards, which means that recent market sentiments have become more optimistic. The concern is that the most recent dip last Monday, broke below the dip last January 29.

But its sound and intact fundamentals allow it to sustain its operations and take advantage of the recent interest rate cuts. Still, valuation is still not attractive enough to require an upgrade due to limited upside. Technicals have improved but still warrant caution as some indicators remain unfavorable. With that, I'm reiterating my hold rating.</p>",

AI positioning remains crowded, rate<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> cycles are diverging across regions, and dispersion within cyclicals is increasing. At the same time, industrial capex is reaccelerating and fiscal measures are beginning to pull forward demand.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the first quarter progresses, we examine where active managers are expressing optimism, where they are reducing risk, and where they see new opportunity. The message is consistent: conviction in core themes remains intact, but implementation is more disciplined. Managers are refining exposures rather than expanding them.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI remains core, but exposure is shifting</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Managers remain comfortable underwriting a longer-duration AI investment cycle. Industrial and manufacturing spending continues to rise, supported by automation upgrades and deferred investment returning to the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positioning reflects a deliberate effort to manage crowding risk. Oversized positions in hyperscalers and some infrastructure names have been trimmed, alongside profit-taking in prior leaders. Early-stage AI and SaaS names that rallied sharply in 2025 remain underweight across many portfolios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capital is being redirected toward more targeted exposures:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Global memory producers, where allocations rose meaningfully into year-end</li> <li>Semiconductor and hardware supply chains in Asia, tied to processing, electrification, and advanced compute</li> <li>Enterprise adopters and service integrators with visible returns on AI spend</li> <li>Peripheral beneficiaries across electronic components, materials, machinery, and construction</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Among long-short managers, gross AI exposure was seasonally reduced into year-end, though net exposure remained constructive. Rotation, not broad deleveraging, marked the shift.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, managers remain committed to the AI cycle, but with tighter underwriting and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4868078-market-signals-separating-wheat-from-chaff\" rel=\"noopener\">greater sensitivity to earnings durability</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cyclicals advance with valuation discipline</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sentiment across financials and industrials continues to improve. Several value managers believe an upgrade and replacement cycle is forming after years of deferred capital spending. Still, valuation discipline remains central for such participants.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">European banks and U.S. industrial leaders that drove much of the rebound are being selectively trimmed as multiples approach upper ranges. Managers remain constructive on the cycle, though position sizes are being recalibrated, and capital is being recycled into less extended names.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Germany’s fiscal expansion is viewed as highly structural, driving allocations into defense, infrastructure, and niche industrial and technology firms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conversely, the UK has emerged as a contrarian opportunity. Wide valuation dispersion and limited mega-cap AI concentration are creating differentiated opportunities in domestic and SMID-cap stocks. Managers are seeking alternative ideas in a market less dominated by narrow technology stocks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revisiting quality and income</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After prolonged underperformance, selective bottom-up investors are quietly picking up <a href=\"https://russellinvestments.com/content/ri/us/en/insights/russell-research/2026/01/january-global-equity-brief.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">quality defensives</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These managers have added exposure to consumer staples, healthcare, and property and casualty insurers, many of which are trading near multi-year lows. Dividend support and lower-beta characteristics are attractive risk/rewards, playing a role as portfolios balance cyclical exposure with fundamental resilience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Durable growth franchises are also screening well. Diversified financials, niche equipment companies, and scaled consumer brands serving higher-income cohorts are favored for their earnings durability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Among those consumer names, exposure is becoming segmented. Companies tied to travel, retirement living, and premium brands are preferred. Businesses reliant on middle- and lower-income consumers require deeper valuation support before becoming more appealing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Emerging markets show clear divergence</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Emerging markets positioning has become more selective as dispersion widens.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Brazil has moved firmly into overweight territory following severe deratings. Both growth and value managers are adding exposure, favoring financials and industrials, supported by an easing rate cycle and improving real incomes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Asia, allocations to South Korea remain high as managers seek out critical AI bottlenecks, particularly in memory and advanced processing supply chains. Taiwan also has a central role here in terms of next-generation compute and electrification.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Managers remain highly selective on China, focusing on companies with earnings recovery or those with competitive strengths in automation and advanced manufacturing. However, property oversupply and fragmentation limit broader conviction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ASEAN markets face headwinds. Indonesia and the Philippines, for example, continue to struggle with high real rates and slow policy transmission, prompting managers to remain patient and valuation-sensitive.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investor implications</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we move deeper into 2026, equity managers are cautiously confident. Core themes remain intact, but implementation is more refined.

In fact, this story has continued as 2026 has gotten underway. Since my last <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855452-cef-another-fresh-high-and-further-gains-likely-to-follow\">review</a> a few months ago, CEF has performed strongly. It has outpaced equities and risen higher along with the surge in precious metals more broadly:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719472353862948.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Fund Performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"267\" height=\"205\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719472353862948.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Fund Performance <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rapid gains always make me a little hesitant, so I figured I should take another look at CEF as we push deeper into the new year. Of course, this rise is actually small compared to how well the fund has performed over a longer stretch. The fact is that precious metals (gold and especially silver) have been on a strong bull run, and this momentum has continued. There was a sharp sell-off a few weeks ago, but we have mostly seen a resumption in gains since then.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For multiple reasons, momentum being one of them, I still see a path higher for CEF. I think the fund's valuation, exposure to what central banks are buying, and the continued weakening of the USD are all supporting factors. I will take a turn discussing each in detail below and use them to support my \"buy\" rating on the fund.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Opportunity For Emerging Markets \"Catch-Up\"</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps the primary reason I started buying gold years ago - and continue to buy it today - has to do with my desire to \"copy\" the central banks. I believe retail investors can benefit from a similar \"don't fight the central banks\" mantra in the same way we used to say \"don't fight the Fed\".</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason I say this is because central banks have become large buyers of gold globally. This has been a consistent theme and has accelerated in the past couple of years. Notable reasons have to do with the Russian invasion of Ukraine (which resulted in Russian assets being frozen and prompted other nations to hedge against this through buying metals), the decline of the US dollar in value, and rising trade and geopolitical risks globally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of note, it isn't just developed nations buying gold either. China has become a major player, and so too have other emerging markets (EMs). This, to me, is really where the opportunity lies. If China and other EMs decide to mirror the developed world in terms of their percentage of gold as a reserve, that will mean a substantial amount of buying in the future:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-17718632620169106_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"689\" data-height=\"445\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-17718632620169106_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Gold Reserves (As A Percent of Total)\" width=\"640\" height=\"413\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-17718632620169106_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-17718632620169106_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-17718632620169106_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-17718632620169106_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Gold Reserves (As A Percent of Total) <span>(World Gold Council)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I emphasize this for two reasons. One, this is a tremendous amount of buying pressure that I think will set gold up nicely for a prolonged multi-year run. Two, central banks are largely price agnostic. What I mean is, they aren't necessarily buying gold to turn a profit. As I noted, their objectives could be to protect their government assets from seizure, to hedge against inflation, to use it as a bargaining tool against the US government, among other reasons.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is important because even as gold rises, I don't necessarily see demand slowing down the way it might if the demand was being driven by retail investors (think Bitcoin). While I recognize that CEF is both gold <em>and silver</em>, this is a bigger play on the yellow metal since it makes up almost 59% of total fund assets, as shown below:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-1771969279828551.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CEF's Gold &amp; Silver Holdings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"288\" height=\"160\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-1771969279828551.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">CEF's Gold &amp; Silver Holdings <span>(Sprott)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will get to why I like silver as well, but understand this is a big play on gold, and I view that positively. This supports my \"buy\" rating on CEF going forward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Discount Has Actually Widened</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A second attribute that supports a bull call for CEF in particular is the fund's valuation. Surprisingly, after a 14% pop in market price, CEF is actually <em>cheaper </em>than it was two months ago. Obviously the share price is higher, but in terms of paying below net asset value (NAV), that opportunity has persisted. Back in December, CEF sat with a discount around 3%. Today, that has widened to over 4.5%:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719693510302315_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"841\" data-height=\"108\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719693510302315_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CEF: Quick Stats\" width=\"640\" height=\"82\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719693510302315_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719693510302315_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719693510302315_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719693510302315_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">CEF: Quick Stats <span>(Sprott)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To be fair, that isn't a massive shift. But it is notable given how strongly CEF's market price has performed. This really speaks to the run in both gold and silver and tells me that those who may be lacking in this exposure can still find some relative value in this space by selecting this option.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Silver Demand Should Continue, But It Is More Volatile</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As noted above, CEF has a large exposure to silver. So being a gold bug isn't enough if one decides to buy this fund - you should be excited about silver exposure too!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I myself am in that camp. The reasons are multifold. The case as a hedge against the decline in the USD is intact because silver is indeed a precious metal, as good is. While different, they will both benefit as the USD declines (which I expect), and that suggests I want this exposure long-term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further, silver is also an industrial metal. The demand that comes from their inclusion in industrial applications sets them apart from gold to some degree. That is key to why I think owning <em>both </em>has plenty of merit. There is some overlap in this thesis, to be sure, but the industrial side of things for silver makes it a more diverse asset than gold. As solar panels, electric vehicles, personal electronics, and many other products continue to demand silver as an input, that is going to provide price support for years to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I could go on and on about this theme, but the truth is a photo is worth much more than my words:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719852960415702_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"650\" data-height=\"393\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719852960415702_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Silver Demand Has Been Rising (By Product / Industry)\" width=\"640\" height=\"387\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719852960415702_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719852960415702_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719852960415702_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719852960415702_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Silver Demand Has Been Rising (By Product / Industry) <span>(CME Group)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond just the demand story and the usefulness as a hedge, there is one other key reason I like silver right <strong>now</strong>. While this may sound counterintuitive, I view the sell-off we saw a few weeks back as a sign that a good bit of excess was taken out of the market. While painful in the short run, that can set the stage nicely for a more sustainable rally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But let me be clear. Silver is more volatile than gold (and plenty of other assets). So make sure you understand this and can handle it because it may not be for everyone. To emphasize this point, silver did drop roughly 30% in one day - and that is not something we should ignore:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719837100412354.png?io=w640\" alt=\"YTD Chart (&lt;a href='https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SLV' title='iShares Silver Trust ETF'&gt;SLV&lt;/a&gt;)\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"561\" height=\"351\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719837100412354.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719837100412354.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719837100412354.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">YTD Chart (SLV) <span>(Google Finance)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Many may not see this chart and think it is that great, but I would focus on the fact that silver is up 23% year-to-date, and, again, the shaking out of some loose hands can be a positive for a more stable rally going forward. I don't really want to see another 30% drop, but it has already happened, and I am looking to the future with brighter eyes.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bitcoin Losing Its Flare</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another reason I remain a buyer of CEF is because of what it <em>isn't. </em>What I mean by that is this is a hedge I use against volatility and equity drawdowns. But it didn't used to be my only hedge. A few years ago I had a position in Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC\" title=\"Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF\">BTC</a>) and the reason was I saw it becoming a momentum play; it was meant to be an inflation/currency hedge, and institutional interest was growing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, fast forward to today, and BTC is 50% off its high, and its popularity has begun to wane. I am not surprised by this, and I had exited my position in BTC a while back because it simply no longer met my objectives. It has begun to move with the market and other risk-on sectors so that it wasn't really protecting my portfolio in any way. I was fortunate to get out when I did, as many other retail investors have not been so lucky. At last check, quite a few BTC owners are in the red, and the path forward is murkier than it used to be:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-1771863420307838.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Many Retail Buyers Have Losses\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"525\" height=\"274\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-1771863420307838.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-1771863420307838.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-1771863420307838.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Many Retail Buyers Have Losses <span>(Bloomberg)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My point here is that I used to lump BTC along with my precious metals in terms of using them for a similar reason: to hedge against currency debasement and other geopolitical risks. This dynamic is not really the case anymore. Could that change for BTC in the future? Sure. But I'm simply not willing to bank on it for now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I put that money that used to be in BTC to work in precious metals over a year ago, and my fresh cash is going to go to precious metals and not BTC going forward. While this isn't directly tied to CEF, it hopefully explains my thought process and portfolio structure for my followers so they can understand where I am coming from here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CEF and my other metal holdings have been big winners thus far, and I see additional profits headed my way. I see industrial and investment demand remaining high for silver, and gold continues to be hoarded by central banks. Further, CEF has a nice discount to NAV and its stability compared to other options like BTC is exactly what I am looking for. I am therefore keeping my \"buy\" rating on this fund in place, and I would suggest my followers give the idea some consideration at this time.</p>",

Over the last year, it’s shifted into something broader, a business that’s making real money from AI, Cloud and subscriptions, not just clicks on Google. The company’s stock was at $241.03 when I last<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> called it a </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829304-alphabet-has-nailed-ai-but-investors-may-want-to-wait-for-a-pullback\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829304-alphabet-has-nailed-ai-but-investors-may-want-to-wait-for-a-pullback\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hold</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">. Now it’s at $311.7, after hitting $350.15, up more than 30% since the prior Hold rating. That jump was driven by faster growth in Cloud, actual dollars rolling in from AI and more people paying for subscriptions. But the fast run-up in the share price has already priced in a lot of the upside. The numbers now look fair, not cheap, the stock trades at roughly 27 times its expected earnings, putting it right in the middle of the big tech pack, not obviously undervalued, not outrageously expensive either.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If there’s anywhere the market might be missing something, it’s in how much investors assume the recent momentum in AI and Cloud can last, especially with how much Alphabet is spending on new tech and the ongoing risk of regulators stepping in. For 2025, Alphabet’s total revenue hit $403 billion, up 15% from last year. Search grew 17%. Cloud was up a massive 48%, now running at more than $70 billion a year. Net income in 2025 was $34.5 billion, with earnings per share at $2.82 for the quarter and an operating margin of 31.6%, even after taking a $2.1 billion hit from Waymo. The Cloud backlog has more than doubled from last year to $240 billion. Over 325 million people now pay for some Alphabet subscription. The Gemini AI app has north of 750 million monthly active users. These aren’t just flashy stats, they’re steady revenue and show people are actually using the products, with Gemini and other AI tools getting baked into how both consumers and businesses work.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-1771941564748133_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2335\" data-height=\"1205\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-1771941564748133_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Earnings Highlights: Annual revenues exceeded $400B for the first time\" width=\"640\" height=\"330\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"330\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-1771941564748133_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-1771941564748133_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-1771941564748133_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-1771941564748133_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>GOOG</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sundar Pichai’s comments back this up.

This quarter, Search continued to accelerate with revenues growing 17%. YouTube’s annual revenues surpassed $60 billion across ads and subscriptions. Cloud significantly accelerated with revenues growing 48%, now on an annual run rate of over $70 billion. Backlog grew by 55% quarter-over-quarter to $240 billion, representing a wide breadth of customers driven by demand for AI products. We have over 325 million paid subscriptions across consumer services with strong adoption for Google One and YouTube Premium. In addition, we have sold more than 8 million paid seats of Gemini Enterprise, which we launched just 4 months ago. And our Gemini app now has over 750 million monthly active users. We are also seeing significantly higher engagement per user, especially since the launch of Gemini 3 in December. Overall, we are seeing our AI investments and infrastructure drive revenue and growth across the board.”</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company isn’t flailing around trying to figure out how to make AI pay off. It’s already making serious money from it. Cloud operating income jumped to $5.3 billion, more than double what it was a year ago. Margins went up too, from 17.5% to 30.1%. So it looks like AI is starting to really change how Alphabet makes money. They’re not just spending to build stuff, they’re getting more out of what they’ve already set up, especially as they sell more higher-margin enterprise AI services on top of existing infrastructure. If Cloud margins keep inching up and Search profits don’t slip, then every extra dollar coming in should end up turning into more operating income and free cash flow. That could help balance out higher depreciation costs from all the AI infrastructure and backs up the idea that future free cash flow will have more to do with running things better, not just from big jumps in revenue.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719426095288694_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2335\" data-height=\"1204\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719426095288694_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Google Cloud Revenues and Operating Income\" width=\"640\" height=\"330\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"330\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719426095288694_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719426095288694_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719426095288694_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719426095288694_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>GOOG</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financial Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG/earnings/estimates\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG/earnings/estimates\" target=\"_blank\">Consensus</a> estimates call for EPS of $13.41 in 2027 and $15.48 in 2028, with revenue projected to reach $540.3 billion and $615.4 billion, respectively.

Search still brings in most of the cash, but YouTube’s pulling in $60 billion and Cloud is running at $70 billion a year. Both are big enough now to matter for profits, not just revenue. Cloud’s backlog has jumped to $240 billion, which is more than double last year, so that pipeline is looking solid. The Cloud segment is finally making good money too, operating margin is up to 30.1%. Paid subscriptions stand at 325 million and the new Gemini product is catching on quickly with both regular users and businesses. These help protect Alphabet from the ups and downs in ad spending and they give the company more predictable, recurring revenue.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719453838869302_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2335\" data-height=\"1206\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719453838869302_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Google Services Revenue Breakdown\" width=\"640\" height=\"331\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"331\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719453838869302_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719453838869302_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719453838869302_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719453838869302_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>GOOG</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cost Pressures</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But costs are climbing fast. R&amp;D spending jumped 42% in 2025. Depreciation shot up by almost $6 billion, or 38% more than last year, all because it takes a ton of money to build out the AI infrastructure. Management said, “The significant increase in our investments in technical infrastructure will continue to put pressure on the P&amp;L in the form of higher depreciation expense and related data centers operations costs such as energy.” That’s a real problem, not just a minor bump. If revenue growth slows down, margins could shrink quickly, especially with labor costs still climbing and the company spending big before it actually sees the returns.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719432834811184_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2335\" data-height=\"1206\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719432834811184_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Operating Expenses Breakdown\" width=\"640\" height=\"331\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"331\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719432834811184_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719432834811184_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719432834811184_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719432834811184_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>GOOG</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regulation is still the big thing hanging over Alphabet right now. In Search, the DOJ and state attorneys general already won a ruling and got a final judgment. That means Google has to change how it distributes its services, share some search data and offer syndication services to a few competitors. Both sides are now appealing. On the ad tech side, Alphabet is still waiting for a final judgment in the DOJ’s advertising tech case. The DOJ is talking about possible structural fixes and Alphabet says those could seriously hurt its business. Europe’s also on them. The Commission handed down a €3 billion ad tech decision over “self-preferencing” and told Alphabet to make changes. Alphabet’s appealing that too. With AI now getting pushed more into Search, ads and Cloud, Alphabet says the scrutiny is only going up especially around AI and competition and that regulators can force the company to change its products or business models.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alphabet’s stock sits at $311 now. Looking out to 2026, that puts the forward P/E at about 27. PEG ratio comes in around 1.75. Free cash flow yield is right at 2%. Not much of a bargain anymore. Microsoft’s forward P/E is about 23. Meta’s is around 21. Nvidia? Way up there at 41. So Alphabet is on the pricier side among the big tech names. Investors are already pricing in some AI upside for Alphabet. For the stock to move up a lot from here, Alphabet actually has to show real growth and get those margins higher. Just more excitement won’t cut it. If regulators get involved or if the AI hype drops off, the shares could take a big hit. On the flip side, if regulators step in or the AI story loses steam, the stock could fall a lot.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Take</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alphabet’s setup looks strong, just not without headaches. Their official forecasts and the numbers analysts expect seem fair and the company’s in a good spot to benefit as more businesses move to AI and Cloud. Key stuff to watch: is Cloud still signing up lots of new business; are more people actually using Gemini; and is all this spending on AI systems showing up in profits instead of just making depreciation go up? Regulation is still the wildcard. If things go Alphabet’s way, the stock could get a boost. If not, it could drop fast.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom line: I’m sticking with Hold. Alphabet is running well and the AI and Cloud businesses are making real progress, but the price already reflects most of that future growth. There’s not much room for mistakes, especially around regulation or costs. I’d need to see the stock fall closer to $250, which would imply a P/E multiple more in line with its five-year average, or see clear signs Alphabet’s making more money from AI than anyone expects, before calling it a Buy. Right now, the risk and reward are about even. It’s worth owning, but there’s no need to chase it at this price.</p>",
