Stock selection within IT and Financials contributed positively to performance during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF\" title=\"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\">SSNLF</a>) (South Korea, IT sector), a consumer and industrial electronic manufacturer, including products such as semiconductors, was the top contributor during the quarter after rising memory prices amid tight supply-demand conditions for memory products supported performance. We anticipate this environment to continue into 2026, with ongoing data center expansion contributing to sustained demand for memory products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nintendo Co. Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTDOY\" title=\"Nintendo Co., Ltd.\">NTDOY</a>) (Japan, Communication Services sector), a videogame hardware and software manufacturer, was the top detractor during the period. We believe shares traded lower following a recent period of strong console launches, with additional downward pressure attributed to concerns over rising memory prices, which may affect margins, and a temporary gap in new title releases. Component supply for the company is expected to be well managed in the near term, and incremental announcements for new games are anticipated to begin as early as February, which we believe will support growth for the business moving into the new year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Fund added a position in Erste Group Bank AG (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EBKDY\" title=\"Erste Group Bank AG\">EBKDY</a>) (Austria, Financials sector), an Austrian and Central Eastern European bank, as we believe the market is underappreciating the company's outsized loan growth, improving profitability prospects, and increasing capital generation potential. The strategy also initiated a position in Rolls-Royce Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RYCEY\" title=\"Rolls-Royce Holdings plc\">RYCEY</a>) (United Kingdom, Industrials sector), one of few engine manufacturers and servicers for the commercial aerospace industry. We believe the company has strong competitive positions in power generation equipment, defense, and small modular nuclear reactors. In our view, the current management team has demonstrated success with improving engine performance on their primary aerospace platforms while the air travel market recovers, leading to higher earnings and cash flow improvement. Further, emerging tailwinds such as robust data center spending, power grid constraints, and increasing defense spending should accelerate growth in their non-aerospace segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Fund exited its position in BNP Paribas S.A. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BNPQY\" title=\"BNP Paribas SA\">BNPQY</a>) (France, Financials sector), a French bank, following a U.S. jury verdict that we believe opens the way for the company to be required to pay compensation demands which we view will be an overhang on stock performance into 2026. The Fund also exited its position in Sony Financial Group Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SFGYY\" title=\"Sony Financial Group Inc.\">SFGYY</a>) (Japan, Financials sector), after the business was spun out into a separate unit away from the consumer products and gaming company. We remain invested in the part of the business that focuses on the consumer discretionary and gaming segments.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tr><td> <h4>A Word About Risk</h4> <p>The Fund invests in equities which are subject to market volatility and loss. The Fund invests in stocks of large-cap companies which may be unable to respond quickly to new competitive challenges. The Fund invests in stocks of small- and mid-cap companies, which may be subject to more erratic market movements than stocks of larger, more established companies. The Fund invests in preferred stocks which are relegated below bonds for payment should the issuer be liquidated. If interest rates rise, the fixed dividend on preferred stocks may be less attractive, causing their price to decline. The Fund invests in foreign, emerging and frontier markets securities, and depositary receipts, such as American Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts, and European Depositary Receipts, which carry the associated risks of economic and political instability, market liquidity, currency volatility and accounting standards that differ from those of U.S. markets and may offer less protection to investors. The risks associated with investing in foreign markets are magnified in emerging markets, and in frontier markets due to their smaller and less developed economies. The sub-advisor considers ESG factors that it deems relevant or additive along with other material factors. The ESG criteria may cause the Fund to forgo opportunities to buy certain securities and/or gain exposure to certain industries, sectors, regions and countries. The Fund may be required to sell a security when it could be disadvantageous to do so. Events in the U.S. and global financial markets, including actions taken to stimulate or stabilize economic growth may at times result in unusually high market volatility, which could negatively impact Fund performance and cause it to experience illiquidity, shareholder redemptions, or other potentially adverse effects. Banks and financial services companies could suffer losses if interest rates rise or economic conditions deteriorate. The Advisor engages a sub-advisor to make investment decisions for the Fund's portfolio; it may be unable to identify and retain a sub-advisor who achieves superior investment returns relative to other similar sub-advisors. The Fund invests in convertible securities which are subject to the risks of both debt securities and equity securities. The Fund's investments in other investment companies will be subject to substantially the same risks as those associated with the direct ownership of the securities comprising the portfolios of such investment companies, and the value of the Fund's investment will fluctuate in response to the performance of such portfolios. In addition, if the Fund acquires shares of investment companies, shareholders of the Fund will bear their proportionate share of the fees and expenses of the Fund and, indirectly, the fees and expenses of the investment companies or ETFs. Current and future portfolio holdings are subject to change.</p> </td></tr></table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The year 2026 may see growth in wireless pricing and subsequent sales growth. BCE's focus on premium wireless and fiber clients may pay off as these high-value customers become growth partners into 2026 and beyond. We are looking at targeted pricing that is directly proportional to revenue increase, roll-out of add-ons, and higher subscription services. BCE's gross profit <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BCE/profitability\">margin</a> over the last 12 months trailing (TTM) fell 17.52% below the sector median's average of 53.52%, indicative of the company's need to grow its topline. In the same space, Verizon, while releasing its FY 2025, <a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/about/sites/default/files/verizon-4Q25-earnings-press-release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">stated</a> that it was rising above the competition, supported by its premium clientele. Verizon registered 1 million net additions in 2026 in mobility and broadband, marking a significant shift in its portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then again, BCE attributed reduced market activity, such as in gross subscriber activations, that declined 9.7% (YoY) due to <a href=\"https://www.bce.ca/news-and-media/newsroom?article=bce-reports-2025-q4-and-full-year-results-announces-2026-financial-targets\" rel=\"nofollow\">immigration</a> policies by the Canadian government. The government recently <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/canada-revises-express-entry-immigration-rules-adds-military-roles-2026-02-18/\" rel=\"nofollow\">introduced</a> the immigration priority categories aimed at lowering the number of permanent residents while increasing skilled labor acquisition. Immigration pressures are seen to increase competition that forces the company to push down discounts. In Q4 2025, the average revenue from mobile phones declined 0.8% (YoY) per user to $56.72 (full-year 2025 decreased 0.9%, YoY), and BCE has had to align its focus towards premium wireless clients. For 2026, it remains to be seen if the company will grow its subscriber base, seeing that there was decreased outbound roaming revenue due to low Canada-US travel against high “Canada-US-Mexico international plans.”</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How Will BCE Navigate This Immigration Policy?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One important aspect to consider is the impact of the American pivot undertaken by BCE. So, BCE acquired Ziply Fiber for about $3.65 billion in August 2025 with the primary aim of dominating the US broadband service market. I believe that the growth of Ziply is commensurate with the cash flow and is part of the reason FCF was down 74.3% (YoY) in Q4 2025. In its recent press release, BCE stated that it had injected $260 million in capital investments tied to the “expansion of Ziply Fiber’s fiber-to-the-premise (FTTP) network.” For the 2026 forecast, BCE limited its FCF growth strategy to the range of 4% to 10%, and here the balance sheet pressure is clearly evident. It is likely that over the next 3 years (from 2026 to 2028), BCE’s annual revenue growth will rise from 2% to 4%, according to its previous guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main query here is how BCE’s profitability compares with its debt status, or is the business mix sustainable? For FY 2026, BCE is <a href=\"https://www.bce.ca/news-and-media/newsroom?page=4&amp;article=%2FBCE-outlines-strategic-plan-to-drive-sustainable-free-cash-flow-growth-and-long-term-shareholder-value\" rel=\"nofollow\">expected</a> to lower its capital intensity below 15% (the level it was back in 2025). Total CapEx in FY 2025 was C$3.7 billion, with BCE aiming to lock in a capital intensity of about 14% by 2028 to support a net debt leverage ratio of 3.0X by 2030. With the operating revenue for 2025 at C$24.47 billion and a guidance of +3% YoY (midpoint), BCE is likely to see its revenue reach about $25.20 billion by the end of FY 2025. To get the projected CapEx for FY 2026, I will multiply the forward revenue of C$25.20 billion by the capital intensity ratio of 14%, equaling C$3.53 billion, down almost 5% (YoY) from C$3.7 billion recorded in 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BCE recorded an EBITDA of C$10.66 billion in FY 2025 and is projecting a growth range of 0% to 4% (a midpoint of 2%), resulting in a guidance of $10.87 billion for FY 2026. To calculate the forward return on total capital invested, I will divide the projected EBITDA (C$10.87 billion) by the projected CapEx (C$3.53 billion), giving us a possible return of 3.08X. With the projected net debt leverage ratio at 3.0X, almost similar to a projected ROTC of 3.08X, it shows that BCE’s operating returns or profits will be sufficient to cover the company’s debt load, giving it a neutral risk profile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the dividend part, BCE is set to proceed with the 126% dividend rate cut in 2026 at a quarterly rate of $0.4375 against the earlier set rate of $0.99. I believe the company is now focusing on expanding its US profile, which may use up most of its resources. In its press <a href=\"https://www.bce.ca/news-and-media/newsroom?page=4&amp;article=%2FBCE-outlines-strategic-plan-to-drive-sustainable-free-cash-flow-growth-and-long-term-shareholder-value\" rel=\"nofollow\">release</a>, the company stated that it is working towards,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Strategic partnership with PSP Investments for the formation of Network FiberCo enables a long-term future potential fibre expansion of up to 8 million U.S. locations, increasing BCE's potential total fibre reach to up to 16+ million locations in North America.”</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BCE stated that it will set aside C$5 billion from 2026 through 2028 (an annual figure of C$1.7 billion) for dividend payments to shareholders, down 135% from an annual payment of C$4 billion in 2024. At the current share price, BCE’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BCE/dividends/yield\">forward</a> dividend yield stands at 4.91% but is still 56% higher than the sector’s median of 3.12%. This dividend cut is in line with its 3-year investment <a href=\"https://www.bce.ca/news-and-media/newsroom?article=bce-reports-2025-q4-and-full-year-results-announces-2026-financial-targets\" rel=\"nofollow\">strategy,</a> and I believe we may witness an increase in the yield by 2028.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will use the enterprise value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio in evaluating BCE, as it will compare the company’s market value and its profitability, including debt and cash levels. I believe this metric is appropriate for BCE, as it is capital-intensive and will provide the right picture of its cost against its power to generate cash.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BCE’s forward EV/EBITDA <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BCE/valuation/metrics\">metric</a> stands at 7.11X. To get the forward EV, I will multiply the EV/EBITDA metric (7.11) by the forward EBITDA (C$10.87 billion), giving us C$77.29 billion or about $56.35 billion. The market capitalization is calculated by subtracting the debt level ($29.914 billion) and adding the cash balance ($233.1 million), then dividing the result by the total shares outstanding, 932.5 million shares, resulting in $28.60. As of this writing, BCE’s share price was trading at $26.07, giving a difference of +9.7% (YoY). It shows that BCE is trading at its fair valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will compare the performance of BCE with some of its peers.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>Fwd.

BCE is trading at a fair valuation but may have an upside of almost 10% (YoY), trading at a forward EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.11X.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Failure to realize the expected revenue growth rate of between 2% and 4% (or higher) by the end of 2026 will negatively affect BCE’s present valuation. The company’s annual revenue growth in 2025 was 0.2% (YoY), while its adjusted EBITDA rose by 0.7% (YoY). These numbers are way below the valuation targets as seen in the analysis above.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have rated BCE Inc. as a hold in view of its modest guidance range for FY 2026, and from my analysis, which shows that it is trading at a fair valuation. My estimations show that the company has a possible upside of about 10%, and at this level, the upcycle, including higher profitability, may treat BCE better in the long run. However, I believe the projected discount may not suffice if the company's forecast revenue is not attained, as BCE is already working with very low projections, as shown in the analysis. CapEx may also be trimmed to C$3.53 billion in 2026 (according to my calculations), with the return on total capital almost at par with the net debt leverage ratio that is forecast at 3.0X, showing a sustainable business mix able to cater to the debt costs.</p>",

It has a new look today. In 2023, Fulcrum’s was evaluating losmapimod in a registrational-enabling study in Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy. I was not very<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> confident ahead of the readout given the drug’s past performance and recommended a \"</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4634235-fulcrum-therapeutics-balance-between-promise-uncertainty\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hold</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">.\". In 2024, Fulcrum announced that losmapimod </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4148936-fulcrum-stock-down-setback-gsk-partnered-drug\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">flunked</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the test and later suspended its development altogether. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, Fulcrum is heading another novel drug for another rare disease—pociredir in sickle cell. I see Fulcrum mentioned often when I am doomscrolling on social media. In my experience, sickle cell disease has always attracted retail biotechnology investors, as it exemplifies the high-risk/high-reward nature of the sector. Over the past couple of years, Fulcrum has trickled data from pociredir’s Phase 1 <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05169580?term=Pociredir&amp;rank=3\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">PIONEER</a> study. And, just recently, unveiled high dose data in 12 severe sickle cell disease patients that I believe merits a closer look.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sickle Cell Disease</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While functionally curative gene therapies are now available to patients, there is still an unmet need and plenty of room for innovation. When I come across sickle cell patients in practice, they are often admitted with a vasoocclusive pain crisis. Treatment compliance remains a <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jscd/article/2/1/yoaf038/8315152\" rel=\"nofollow\">major issue</a> as well and you can hardly blame the patients because the drugs that are available aren’t great.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hydroxyurea—the standard of care—is a prime example. In adults, the adherence rate has been cited between just 50%-60%. A contributor is likely hydroxyurea’s side effects, which can include diarrhea, bone marrow suppression, and hair loss. Despite its limitations, hydroxyurea is indispensable. Its cheap, convenient, prevents complications like stroke, and extends life expectancy. Still, there are a large subset of patients who either do not respond adequately to hydroxyurea or simply cannot tolerate it.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48050289-17721104367317975_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"912\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48050289-17721104367317975_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Author's Compilation\" width=\"640\" height=\"285\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48050289-17721104367317975_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48050289-17721104367317975_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48050289-17721104367317975_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48050289-17721104367317975_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's Compilation</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pociredir</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Like hydroxyruea, <a href=\"https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/146/Supplement%201/1157/554267/Pociredir-a-novel-oral-once-daily-fetal-hemoglobin\" rel=\"nofollow\">pociredir</a> induces expression of fetal hemoglobin (HbF). It achieves this by binding to the “embryonic ectoderm development (EED) subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), inhibiting trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), resulting in downregulation of BCL11A and MYB.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back in February 2023, pociredir was hit with a full <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1680581/000095017023006834/fulc-ex99_1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">clinical hold</a>. According to Fulcrum,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>The Agency noted preclinical data previously submitted in April, October and December 2022, and non-clinical and clinical evidence of hematological malignancies observed with other inhibitors of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2).</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The clinical hold was quickly resolved after Fulcrum defined the “population where the potential benefit of continued treatment with FTX-6058 outweighs potential risk.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I bring this up not because a risk for malignancy is unusual in biopharma (e.g., hydroxyurea, itself, includes a <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/016295s054lbl.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">label warning</a> for malignancy development), but because pociredir lives in this shadow. In other words, its risk profile is such that it merits testing only in severe, treatment-refractory cases. PIONEER was designed with this in mind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last December, Fulcrum <a href=\"https://www.fulcrumtx.com/wp-content/uploads/251206-PIONEER-PHASE-1B-ASH-POSTER-vF.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">presented</a> interim data from the high-dose cohort.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48050289-17721104367898607.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FULC\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Fulcrum</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So roughly half of the patients on 20mg reached the ≥20% threshold that is often regarded as “clinically significant.” But, follow-up was limited to 42 days in Cohort 4. So it was reasonable to believe that—with more time—patients could exceed a total HbF of ≥20%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fast forward to earlier this week, Fulcrum announced 12-week results from Cohort 4 (see <a href=\"https://ir.fulcrumtx.com/static-files/ad8b1e95-b4be-4100-9815-4a90e0b93327\" rel=\"nofollow\">deck</a>).</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48050289-17721104367162468.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FULC\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Fulcrum</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The mean absolute HbF level of 19.3% fell just a bit short of the 20% threshold. That said, 7/12 patients did reach this goal. The immediate market reaction to this release was negative, as many may have hoped that the mean HbF would cross 20%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another thing that sticks out to me when reviewing the slides is that there doesn’t appear to be much difference in efficacy between the 12mg and 20mg cohorts. Of course, this is just me glancing at the slides, but when you look over Slides 15-18—which cover hemolysis markers, blood cell morphology, and hemoglobin, the lines often intersect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Following the release, Fulcrum stated they intend to soon initiate an <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07401823?term=Pociredir&amp;rank=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">open-label extension study</a> to the PIONEER study and have a word with the FDA regarding pociredir’s path forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874115-fulcrum-therapeutics-inc-fulc-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">call</a>, management expressed hope that HbF could serve as a surrogate for accelerated approval—which would really lift the drug’s probability of success.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>Based on the strength and the consistency of the data that we've generated to date, with the robust induction of HbF and this progression towards a broader pancellular distribution along with the improvements of biomarkers of hemolysis and anemia, we really think that it's appropriate to advance into a study with the potential to be registration enabling. And that will certainly be a topic for our discussion with the FDA at the end of Phase meeting. Of course, there is substantial published literature that demonstrates an association between higher HbF levels and improved clinical outcomes in sickle cell disease. And that biological relationship is obviously a key part of the underlying rationale for our program.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As someone who has covered sickle cell plenty of times in the past, I can confirm that there is precedent for accelerated approval based on a biomarker endpoint. Pfizer’s OXBYRTA immediately comes to mind. This one was approved based on its effect on hemoglobin. Of course, Pfizer would later voluntarily <a href=\"https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-voluntarily-withdraws-all-lots-sickle-cell-disease\" rel=\"nofollow\">remove</a> OXBYRTA from the market after it became obvious that it can increase vasoocclusive crises.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps with this in mind—and the FDA’s everchanging stance depending on the day and its leader—Fulcrum was also careful to hedge this hope.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>And of course, whether HbF could play a role in an accelerated approval framework will ultimately be a regulatory determination, but we very much look forward to discussing the totality of the PIONEER data set with the FDA in order to understand their perspective on the appropriate path forward.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While very early, PIONEER data has been encouraging so far when it comes to more robust clinical endpoints like vasoocclusive crises (e.g., reductions in bilirubin, increases in hemoglobin). But as we witnessed with OXBRTA, improvements in hemolysis markers do not always translate to vasoocclusive crisis reduction.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pharma DCF Model</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, pociredir seems best positioned as a treatment option in severe sickle cell disease patients who—for one reason or another—cannot take HU. While the CDC cites ~100,000 sickle cell disease patients in the US, maybe 1 in 5 can be classified as “severe.” And about half of severe patients do not respond or cannot tolerate HU. Although its label may be inclusive of the entire sickle cell disease population, this subpopulation is pociredir’s actual TAM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I modeled for 33% peak share. This doesn’t sound like much, but it is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A probability of success of 26.3% is based on historical data for Phase 2-ready hematology drugs.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704449890115_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1336\" data-height=\"2048\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704449890115_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Author's Compilation\" width=\"640\" height=\"981\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704449890115_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704449890115_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704449890115_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704449890115_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's Compilation</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that Fulcrum’s remaining assets are in “discovery,” its valuation is overwhelmingly tied to pociredir in this one indication.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704448138947_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"685\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704448138947_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Author's Compilation\" width=\"640\" height=\"214\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704448138947_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704448138947_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704448138947_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704448138947_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's Compilation</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Words</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FULC looks aggressively priced, but not ridiculously so. With $352.3 million in cash and investments, Fulcrum is in a good spot to get pociredir to the finish line. And it would not surprise me to see investor excitement should pociredir be hastened to the market (e.g., if Fulcrum announces it needs just one pivotal trial to serve as the basis for approval and that HbF could serve as the primary endpoint).</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I can see the utility of FULC within a biotech-focused barbell portfolio, I don’t think the potential upside for pociredir (if everything goes perfect), given its actual TAM in sickle cell disease, justifies the risk. So I'm sticking with a \"Hold\" rating on FULC. </p>",

What is more, lower Fed interest rates should put further pressure on the U.S. dollar, providing a tailwind for non-U.S. issuers, as it will make servicing dollar-denominated debt easier.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A potential beneficiary of these developments may be the <strong>Invesco Global ex-US High Yield Corporate Bond ETF</strong> (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PGHY\" title=\"Invesco Global ex-US High Yield Corporate Bond ETF\">PGHY</a></span>). Indeed, PGHY invests exclusively in USD-denominated debt issued by corporates operating in countries outside the United States. I rank PGHY a Buy, as I believe it is an attractive income option for investors comfortable with some credit risk and potential drawdowns during economic downturns/financial market turmoil. My bullish outlook is underpinned by:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>A 6.50-7.00% total return outlook after accounting for the ETF's 0.35% expense ratio.</li> <li>A macroeconomic environment characterized by positive GDP growth in countries where PGHY invests, notwithstanding near-term pockets of weakness in 2026.</li> <li>Expectations for further U.S. dollar weakness in 2026-2027, allowing for easier servicing of USD debt by issuers operating in local currencies such as the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio characteristics and credit risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.invesco.com/us/en/financial-products/etfs/invesco-global-ex-us-high-yield-corporate-bond-etf.html\" rel=\"noopener\">PGHY's portfolio currently offers a yield to maturity of 7.2%</a>, achieved with an average maturity of 5.18 years. For comparison, risk-free 5-year U.S. treasuries (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US5Y\" class=\"ticker-link\">US5Y</a>) currently offer a yield of about 3.62%, indicating that PGHY's portfolio trades at a spread of about 3.6%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is somewhat justified as only 11.6% of the portfolio is rated investment-grade (credit rating of BBB), followed by a sizable 60.33% allocation to the first tier of the speculative/high-yield section of the bond market, namely issuers rated BB. Issuers with an eleven lower single B credit rating account for 24.05% of the portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, we see that the extra 3.6% in yield offered by PGHY comes with a circa 88% allocation to non-investment grade securities, indicating an elevated probability of losses during economic downturns. The chance of loss is further highlighted when we look at PGHY's sector allocation, with roughly 75% of the portfolio invested in issuers operating in cyclical sectors such as industrials and financials.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As an investor in fixed-income instruments, you only get a fixed return when business is booming for cyclical companies, thus missing out on the upside. However, when things go sour, the risk of losses becomes apparent, as non-investment-grade credit ratings suggest limited scope to absorb adverse operating conditions for a prolonged period of time.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Country allocation and macro outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While individual issuer credit risk largely stems from the company's capital structure and the prospects for the sector it is operating in, macroeconomic conditions can also impact company performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, examining the GDP growth outlook for countries where PGHY invests is helpful when we want to assess the probability of near-term losses associated with issuers experiencing difficulties making payments in full.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">PGHY's largest country allocation is to Brazil (11.9% of the portfolio), followed by Canada at 10.90%. No other single country accounts for more than 7.5% of the portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/countries/bra\" rel=\"noopener\">IMF projects Brazil's economy to expand at 1.6% in 2026</a>, a slowdown from the circa 2.5% growth in 2025, with <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/-/media/files/publications/weo/2026/january/english/text.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">an acceleration to 2.3% expected in 2027</a>. Canadian GDP growth dynamics should prove more resilient, with the IMF projecting 2026 GDP growth of 1.6%, in line with 2025, followed by acceleration to 1.9% in 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, notwithstanding the possibility for some near-term weakness in countries such as Brazil, from a macro standpoint, I see no immediate risk for a deterioration of credit quality. I should mention, however, that Mexico accounts for 3.85% of the portfolio, which <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20408255-mexican-army-kills-leader-of-powerful-jalisco-new-generation-cartel-during-operation-to\">could be a drag on returns if violence following the killing of El Mencho</a>, leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, continues.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rating and return potential</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In light of the outlook for somewhat lower USD rates, some loan prepayments to take advantage of refinancing possibilities cannot be ruled out. As such, a conservative approach would be to use PGHY's yield to worst (a metric assuming issuers take advantage of bond call options) of 6.88%. Coupled with the ETF's expense ratio of 0.35%, a return of around 6.5% is the baseline outlook investors can reasonably expect when investing in PGHY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">You will immediately notice that this is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PGHY/dividends/scorecard\">somewhat below the 7.12% dividend yield offered by PGHY</a>. Indeed the ETF has already cut dividends by 3.25% over the past year, reflecting prior Fed rate cuts. I expect this trend to continue in 2026 and 2027 as issuers take advantage of lower rates to refinance debt obligations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I should also mention the potential of capital gains on top of the attractive current income. Taking account of the 3.19 effective duration and my expectations for an incremental 0.1-0.15% decline in five-year risk-free interest rates, I would put the capital gain potential at below 0.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To conclude, I estimate PGHY should deliver a total return of about 6.5-7.00% over the next 12 months, making it an attractive income option for investors comfortable with credit risk and foreign market exposure. With these caveats in mind, I rate PGHY a Buy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Under baseline economic assumptions, I am quite comfortable with my 6.5-7.00% return outlook for PGHY. During periods of financial market turmoil and economic stress, however, PGHY will likely significantly underperform risk-free 5-year U.S. treasuries. This is exactly what happened in the first three months of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, when PGHY lost roughly 13% of its value even as 5-year treasury yields declined by roughly 1.2% (from 1.59% at the end of 2019 to about 0.42% in March 2020).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, when investing in PGHY, you should be comfortable with the current 3.6% yield premium (relative to 5-year treasuries) expanding quite significantly during adverse market conditions, thus leading to near-term capital losses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other key risk to mention would be a reversal of recent U.S. dollar weakness. This may put pressure on corporate earnings for issuers operating in local currencies such as the Brazilian real or Canadian dollar, but having to pay interest and principal in U.S. dollars. As things stand, my baseline outlook remains for a somewhat weaker USD in 2026-2027, impacted by anticipated future Fed rate cuts.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After slashing rates by 0.75% in late 2025, the Fed appears to be on pause, with markets pricing in the next 0.25% cut for July 2026. This should prove to be a tailwind for bond ETFs such as PGHY, which invest in securities issued by corporates outside the United States.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My baseline outlook is for PGHY to deliver a total return of 6.50-7.00% over the next year, making it an attractive income option for investors comfortable with bearing credit risk, which may principally materialize during periods of economic weakness and financial market turmoil.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A reversal of recent USD weakness may also weigh on PGHY as its issuers operating in non-USD currencies will find it harder to service debt issued in USD.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thank you for reading.</p>",

In the BNPL sector, we have ''Prime'' players like Affirm (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AFRM\" title=\"Affirm Holdings, Inc.\">AFRM</a>) and Klarna (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KLAR\" title=\"Klarna Group plc\">KLAR</a>), and the players in the ''Subprime'' vertical that serve<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the unbanked. Sezzle fits into this category. In this article, I will explore their business model, the successful pivot to subscription based revenue, and the trajectory of their credit losses. So far, I have watched Sezzle from the sidelines due to my concerns over rising credit losses as a percentage of GMV. But in the Q4 released February 25, 2026, we saw a significant YoY decline in provisions for credit losses, and consequently a rise in the stock price in the after hours trading. This data de-risks investing in the company, and therefore, I am initiating a Buy rating. In my opinion, this remains a high-risk, high-reward play due to the undeniable high growth, but subprime lending sector risk remains, although it seems management is successfully mitigating it.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Business Model</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For those unfamiliar with Sezzle, they are a Buy-now-Pay-later provider that is specifically targeting the customer with the lowest credit score, who is unable to access traditional credit cards. The company’s primary differentiator is the Sezzle Up credit-building platform. This allows the user to slowly build up their credit score while using the platform, since Sezzle reports to all three major bureaus - TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Users link their bank accounts via Plaid and agree to credit reporting, which allows Sezzle visibility into a user's bank balance and their income streams. This direct access to cash-flow data allows Sezzle to better estimate a user’s ability to repay, allowing them to filter out liabilities before they default.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that this feature creates high retention rates. A user that is actively building their credit score from, say, 500 to 600 using Sezzle is less likely to churn than, for example, a user that is using BNPL simply for a one-off purchase. Yet this creates a risk that once a user builds a sufficient credit score needed to get approved for a credit card, they are likely to churn simply because Sezzle is just too expensive compared to the $0 monthly fees of prime credit products. Note that Sezzle charges <a href=\"https://legal.sezzle.com/fees/en-us\" rel=\"nofollow\">$19.99 per month</a> for the Sezzle Anywhere service. As the name says, the subscription plan allows the subscriber to use Sezzle anywhere, not only at direct partnered merchants.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other option is Sezzle Premium which costs between <a href=\"https://legal.sezzle.com/fees/en-us\" rel=\"nofollow\">$13.99</a> per month, depending on the tier, but has fewer merchants available. More details can be found on their website. In my opinion, a user trying to build a credit score needs to be able to use BNPL anywhere, and most importantly at major retailers like Walmart or Target, because that is where, I believe, the low-income subscribers spend the majority of their money. This subscription thesis was, in my opinion, validated in the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20414069-sezzle-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025-results#source=section%3Aearnings_summary%7Csection_asset%3Aearnings_history%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3Apress-release\">Q4 earnings release</a>, as Monthly On-Demand &amp; Subscribers reached 918,000, with 134,000 new users being added in Q4. Such users will continue to provide predictable and stable revenue, as long as the company continues to keep provisions for credit losses low.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI Underwriting</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the Q3 2025 earnings call, CEO Charlie Youakim highlighted the use of AI as a tool for risk assessment and operational leverage. I believe this is an excellent choice; first, because of analyzing cash transactions in real time, which Sezzle has access to due to the Sezzle Up. As their AI gets better, the provisions for credit losses might go down as a percentage of GMV. Second is that Sezzle is growing fast. In Q3, Sezzle grew their revenues by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SEZL/income-statement\">approx. 66%</a> YoY. Normally, that would require hiring additional staff, but the CEO noted that its AI will likely allow them to keep the support team at the same size or that it could even shrink. In Q4 company reported that: ''Total Operating Expenses grew 10.8% YoY to $74.6 million, well below revenue growth of 32.2%.'' I regard this margin expansion as evidence that the AI strategy is working, and operating expenses as part of revenue should continue to decrease.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Provisions for Credit Losses</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One thing that worried me prior to initiating coverage were the rising provisions for credit losses as a % of GMV, as is evident from the Table 1. Until Q4 such losses kept increasing both YoY and QoQ, which was the main reason I avoided the company. Below is the table showing provisions for credit losses data for the last 8 quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/6455341-17721029402480273_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"847\" data-height=\"411\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/6455341-17721029402480273_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Provisions for credit losses\" width=\"640\" height=\"311\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/6455341-17721029402480273_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/6455341-17721029402480273_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/6455341-17721029402480273_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/6455341-17721029402480273_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Table 1 <span>(Author's work)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q4, we can clearly see a reversal of the metric that worried me most. Provisions for credit losses declined by 80 basis points to 2% of GMV. Management stated that this is due to ''Favorable repayment performance and conservative holiday season underwriting.'' I view this as a sign that management successfully tightened underwriting standards while maintaining high growth, which is the reason I turned bullish.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The improvement in this metric also impacted the bottom line, with adjusted EBITDA increasing 79.1% YoY to $58.3 million, and net income reaching $42.7 million, advancing 68.3% YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">An investor must continue to watch this metric closely. Management guided for provisions for credit losses to stay between 2.5% and 3% in FY2026. Note that this is still higher than in FY2025, as according to my calculations, they were at 2.27%, which is the main reason I am issuing a ''Bullish'' and not a ''Very Bullish'' rating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management guided FY2026 adjusted EPS to be $4.70 with revenue growth between 25% and 30%. At the current price of $72, the forward (adjusted) PE ratio would be approx. 15x. For a company with a projected growth of 27.5% at the midpoint, this is cheap, especially considering stable SaaS revenue. I believe the main reason that it is trading at this price is the past increase in the provisions for credit losses metric. Peers like Enova International (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ENVA\" title=\"Enova International, Inc.\">ENVA</a>) and Credit Acceptance (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CACC\" title=\"Credit Acceptance Corporation\">CACC</a>) are both trading at a 13x PE multiple. Both Enova and Credit Acceptance are in the subprime lending business, but are growing much more slowly. Affirm (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AFRM\" title=\"Affirm Holdings, Inc.\">AFRM</a>) is trading at a GAAP 61x PE multiple (although the forward PE multiple is around 29x).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see two scenarios that can happen here; the first is that management executes well and keeps credit losses between 2.5% and 3%. In such a case, we should see the PE multiple expand. For a company with a SaaS revenue model, although exposed to subprime lending, growing at 27.5%, I believe a fair PE multiple should be between 20 and 25x. This represents significant upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, if we see weakness in the economy, it is possible that provisions for credit losses to deteriorate. In such a case, I believe that the stock will decline to reach a valuation similar to the slow-growing subprime lenders like Enova and Credit Acceptance, which I mentioned earlier.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plan</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 earnings results significantly de-risked investing in the company. I am issuing a ''Buy'' rating, and I plan to open an initial position. I will also closely monitor provisions for credit losses in Q1 2026 and potential changes in guidance for FY2026.</p>",

In our last update, we increased our estimates for both top-line<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> sales and core operating profit margin; however, despite forecasts sitting above Wall Street consensus, valuation was largely reflected in the share price. Following the earnings release, the company's shares re-rated, although the current price remains within our valuation range.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our analysis also incorporates additional insight from Moncler's latest collection (happening nowadays in Milan with an exhibition <a href=\"https://www.voce.it/it/articolo/1/economia/al-via-da-oggi-la-milano-fashion-week-autunno-inverno-2026-2027\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.voce.it/it/articolo/1/economia/al-via-da-oggi-la-milano-fashion-week-autunno-inverno-2026-2027\" target=\"_blank\">called</a> 'The Beyond Performance Exhibit'), where management provided an update on the Grenoble line.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moncler Results and Our Neutral Take</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moncler delivered solid results in 2025, with sales acceleration in Q4. In numbers, the company reached top-line sales of €3.13 billion (<a href=\"https://www.monclergroup.com/v3/assets/blt61bda6b71f29a239/blt48f3ab2962e62ae4/69973d944147a5b95c8024f1/Moncler-Group-Press-Release-FY-2025.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fig. 1</a>), up 3%, while Q4 turnover increased by 7% compared to Q4 2024. On the company's margins, the company reported an EBIT of €913.4 million, down from €916.3 million in 2024. So, EBIT margin declined by 30 basis points to 29.2% from 29.5%. Looking at the Wall Street consensus, the company delivered a 5% beat on Fiscal Year EBIT, with clear acceleration in H2 performance. Both Moncler and Stone Island sales accelerated in Q4. In numbers, the Moncler brand grew retail sales by 7%, accelerating from Q3 flattish results, and Stone Island was impressively up by +16% ex-FX movement in the DTC segment. Going down to the P&amp;L, Moncler recorded higher interest payments (due to a higher net debt position), so net profit reached €626.7 million, down from €639.6 million in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720441614613917.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Moncler FY 2025 results in a Snap\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"632\" height=\"415\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720441614613917.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720441614613917.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720441614613917.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Moncler FY 2025 results in a Snap</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fig 1</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why are we still muted?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After this set of results, Moncler's post-earnings re-rating was expected; however, we believe much of the positive news flow is now reflected in the current valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Businesswise, there are at least four negative considerations to report:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Moncler management's tone was positive, flagging that Q4 sales acceleration has continued into Q1 so far, at both brands. In reality, Moncler exhibited higher winter seasonality in the last 2 years (72-73% of Fiscal Year revenue is concentrated in Q1 and Q4, compared to a pre-COVID-19 average of 69%.</li> <li>Moncler DTC channel was under pressure until Q3 with flattish to negative results. This was a meaningful slowdown compared to history, with seasonality improvement. Again, the company was back to growth in Q4, but we are not sure about 2026.</li> <li>China (and the APAC region) still represents a significant market for the company (Fig. 2), but competition from both local and international brands is heating up. We report the latest news on <a href=\"https://www.chinadailyhk.com/hk/article/599901?utm_source\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.chinadailyhk.com/hk/article/599901?utm_source\" target=\"_blank\">China Daily</a>: \"With sourcing of goose down from regions like Hungary and Canada, Guvet aims to rival luxury names like Moncler. <a href=\"https://www.suntzurecruit.com/2026/02/05/why-high-end-sports-brands-are-poaching-luxury-executives/?utm\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.suntzurecruit.com/2026/02/05/why-high-end-sports-brands-are-poaching-luxury-executives/?utm\" target=\"_blank\">Bosideng</a> is also a competitor with similar price points. As a reminder, 38% of Moncler sales are with Chinese consumers.</li> <li>Lastly, we had the chance to view the new Aspen collection. The new collection is priced 30% above the Grenoble line. The Moncler brand has benefited from a shift toward ski performance rather than fashion cycles. Moncler's marketing team has done a great job with experience-led activities (St Moritz and Courchevel) and strategic, disruptive partnerships (the latest Brazil Olympics sponsorship). Still, the company's pricing power has not been enough. Price power is expected to be +3% in 2026, compared to a high mid-single-digit level in the past. This suggests the customer base may be becoming more sensitive to further price increases, reinforcing our value-for-money thesis for Compagnie Financière Richemont.

Below, we <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872431-moncler-s-p-a-monry-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872431-moncler-s-p-a-monry-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> the UBS Q&amp;A session on the 2026 Moncler outlook and the responses from Roberto Eggs, Chief Business Strategy &amp; Global Market Officer and Executive Director at Moncler.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"<em>We see a business for Moncler that is going to stay flattish for 2026. And we see an improvement on the results for the wholesale with Stone Island. I'm not saying positive, but clearly an improvement compared to what we have had in 2025.</em>\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the FY presentation, Moncler did not provide a 2026 outlook. This is not positive. We still incorporated 2026 sales estimates at +4.5% to €3.2 billion, including 10/15 new store openings. Given limited margin visibility and the management team's tight cost control, we see good SG&amp;A control and the usual 7% in marketing expenses. This was also reported in the Q&amp;A analyst call. Therefore, we slightly reduce the core operating profit to 29%, resulting in an EBIT of €928 million. The company has minimal interest expenses, and with solid FCF generation, we believe interest expenses could also be lowered (from €26 million to €20 million). Considering a 29% tax rate, we derive a net income of €644.68 million. Given the <a href=\"https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=MONC:MIL\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=MONC:MIL\" target=\"_blank\">current outstanding shares</a>, we reached an EPS of €2.34. This represents a 1.5% increase in EPS compared to 2025. At this stage, Moncler trades at a P/E of 24.7x, in <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-global-luxury-index/#overview\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-global-luxury-index/#overview\" target=\"_blank\">line</a> with its peers' average. This is true not only at a P/E level but also on a Price-to-Sales basis. Even applying the projected P/E multiple to peers, the company's target price would have reached €59.78, with limited upside to the current €57.8 price. We remain neutral weighted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720462647492323_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"770\" data-height=\"111\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720462647492323_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Luxury P/E Multiple Valuation Data\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"92\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720462647492323_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720462647492323_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720462647492323_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720462647492323_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Luxury P/E Multiple Valuation Data</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fig 3</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We have long covered Moncler, and downside risks include lower winter sales (and high winter seasonality) and EBIT margin pressure from higher SG&amp;A and marketing costs. Increasing competition in China is a threat to consider. The company is exposed to FX changes. We are closely watching the evolution of DTC sales, and despite Stone Island's positive results, the brand still carries significant execution risk.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moncler reported very solid Fiscal Year 2025 results; that said, the company is well priced. This limited disclosure on the 2026 outlook is not a positive sign, and we prefer to wait for better entry points.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Fourth Quarter 2025 Presentation <span>(Evolent Health)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Evolent didn’t waste time. It ditched the old approach and swung to what it calls the Performance Suite model. By now, nearly all of the higher-margin business has been moved into that new structure. Under this updated model, payments are adjusted to account for outside medical cost factors. Also, there are built-in limits (called corridors) that cap how much money the company could lose if costs end up being higher than expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The renegotiation helped the company keep its most important existing customers and also bring in major new partners, using contract terms that offer better protection. In simple terms, the company gave up the chance to make the highest possible profits at times. But in return, it gained more stable and predictable results. It’s a sensible move, given the volatility in specialty trends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That tradeoff makes even more sense when you consider what’s powering the business today. Oncology is now responsible for most of the company’s growth. It’s a direct response to one of the biggest pain points in healthcare spending. Insurance companies are still dealing with consistently high and rising costs in cancer treatment. There's also a lot of variation in how doctors treat patients, which can affect both costs and outcomes. So Evolent’s edge here is that it can get physicians to stick to evidence-based pathways. Keep in mind, unfortunately, cancer care and high-cost specialty drugs are expected to keep pushing healthcare costs higher this year. According to an <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/health-industries/library/behind-the-numbers.html\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">analysis</a> from PricewaterhouseCoopers, medical costs in commercial insurance markets are projected to rise by about 8%, with oncology and specialty drugs being major reasons for that increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, rolling out several large new contracts this year is putting temporary pressure on profits. These new agreements are expected to generate significant revenue. However, in the first few months, the company has to set aside extra financial reserves as a precaution. That’s because the data doesn’t show up overnight. Claims have to trickle in, and only then do the spending patterns start to come into focus. But once the data stabilizes and trends are better understood, the financial impact should become more predictable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the revenue side, the company’s core specialty technology and services business is still performing well. Customer renewals remain very strong at over 98%, and the company's also winning some new business. However, these gains are more than canceled out by a decline in exchange membership, which is directly connected to the One Big Beautiful Bill.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Essentially, the law’s changes to subsidies and insurance risk pools have led companies to reduce how much they participate in the market. In turn, some of Evolent’s larger customers are experiencing membership declines of 40 to 60%. Early data from clients supports management’s cautious outlook on this issue. As the American Medical Association <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/health-care-advocacy/federal-advocacy/4-big-beautiful-bill-changes-will-reshape-care-2026\" rel=\"nofollow\">explained</a> in December, the bill makes the enrollment period shorter and increases costs for many people who buy insurance through the marketplace. This is causing more people to drop their coverage. At the same time, the types of patients and insurance plans remaining in the system are changing. Nevertheless, this shift is putting additional pressure on revenue stability in the near term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, careful cost control is helping to offset some of the pressure. Par for the course these days, the company has used AI-driven automation tools, including those gained from the <a href=\"https://ir.evolent.com/2024-06-04-Evolent-signs-agreement-to-acquire-artificial-intelligence-utilization-management-products-and-team-from-Machinify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Machinify acquisition</a>, and has made targeted workforce reductions. And it's performing as intended since it produced savings that were higher than originally expected. Those gains should show up more clearly as the year goes on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47303334-17721142206600053_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1954\" data-height=\"1080\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47303334-17721142206600053_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Evolent Health, Inc.

The company’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EVH/balance-sheet\">balance sheet</a> got stronger because it generated solid cash and previously sold off part of the business.

Consensus forecasts the forward P/E collapsing from 15.81 this year to 6.57 for the next and 4.26 by 2028 as EPS grows over 120% then 140%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regardless, the leverage leaves much to be desired. It remains high with long-term debt to capital at an uncomfortable 69% (per FG above) and EV is still $1.31 billion. Remember, cash flow stays limited this year while the business digests <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874213-evolent-health-inc-evh-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">$900 million</a> in new Performance Suite contracts and builds conservative reserves. And if the expected increase in EBITDA later in the year is delayed, or if exchange membership declines further because of the regulatory changes, the company’s financial position could become strained quickly.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Buy</em>. Evolent looks like an unusually attractive opportunity right now, significantly better than when I covered it over a year ago. If the expected second-half ramp happens and the MER (medical expense ratio) discipline holds, EPS should grow significantly. Because of that upside potential, aggressive growth investors may want to buy the stock here.</p>",

As per S&amp;P Capital IQ, that was 7.6% ahead of the consensus projection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was also better than 3Q2025's and 4Q2024's growth rates of +8.4% and +6.3%, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, margin expansion made a bigger contribution to CCC's outperformance than top-line increases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Turnover for the group rose 12.7% to $0.28 billion in the recent three-month period. This is on par with the preceding quarter's +12.0% rise. The revenue beat was also an insignificant 0.9%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see the company taking multiple actions to boost its operational profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It lifted the proportion of subscription-related sales from <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835449-ccc-intelligent-solutions-holdings-inc-cccs-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835449-ccc-intelligent-solutions-holdings-inc-cccs-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">\"80% plus\"</a> in 3Q25 to the mid-80s for 4Q25. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874211-ccc-intelligent-solutions-holdings-inc-ccc-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874211-ccc-intelligent-solutions-holdings-inc-ccc-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">analyst briefing</a>, CCC indicated that it has \"been moving clients from transactional-based arrangements to subscription contracts on renewal.\" The latter boasts \"strong EBITDA margins,\" according to management. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It has worked hard at enhancing its productivity. Staffing levels were held steady compared to a year ago despite increased revenues. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, the \"Stock Based Compensation/SBC\" to sales declined to a more comfortable 12% in 4Q2025. This metric was in the mid-to-high teens for the previous two quarters. CCC has become more efficient in executing on the employee compensation program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's progressing well with the assimilation of a key Jan '25 acquisition too. This helped to mitigate the post-transaction earnings drag.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The enterprise's earnings call commentary drew attention to the M&amp;A deal involving \"EvolutionIQ/EIQ, a pioneer in AI claims guidance and the leader in bodily injury claims resolution.\" It also emphasized that EIQ's losses \"will continue to moderate\" as \"we further integrate the business.\" </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that CCC's efforts have paid off. Its reported Q4 EBITDA-to-revenue of 42.7% was 270bps above the sell-side's estimate. The FY25 ratio excluding EIQ's effects expanded 2ppts on a YoY basis. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors clearly liked its strong quarterly showing. The stock price jumped 25% on Wednesday, the next trading day following its Q4 announcement.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Anticipating A Faster Pace Of Core Topline Expansion </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CCC has guided that its \"organic growth\" will improve from 4Q25's +8% to FY2026's +9% based on its results meeting disclosures. It explained that \"the acquisition of EvolutionIQ\" is \"anniversaried\" starting this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My take is that this encouraging full-year outlook is achievable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earlier, the group took part in Citigroup's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/C\" title=\"Citigroup Inc.\">C</a>) \"<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4819432-ccc-intelligent-solutions-holdings-inc-cccs-presents-at-citis-2025-global-technology-media\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4819432-ccc-intelligent-solutions-holdings-inc-cccs-presents-at-citis-2025-global-technology-media\" target=\"_blank\">Global TMT Conference</a>\" on Sep 4, 2025. At that event, it noted the addition of EIQ will enable it to penetrate \"new adjacent markets like workers' comp and disability.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A meaningful 5.5ppts of CCC's 4Q2025 turnover increase was driven by cross-selling. I expect this favorable momentum to be sustained thanks to its new acquiree. The quarterly call commentary revealed that it \"cross-sold EvolutionIQ's workers' compensation offering to an existing CCC customer for the first time.\" </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sector-specific headwinds appear to be receding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CCC shared at the earnings briefing that the \"industry claim volume decline continued to moderate throughout the year.\" It is consistent with management's view that the trend of a \"decline in claim frequency\" will eventually be offset by a higher degree of \"severity and complexity.\" This is also evidenced by a modest low-single-digit decrease in industry-wide claims for 4Q25 on a normalized basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking beyond '26, my bet is on its sales CAGR accelerating further to 11% in the long haul. I've identified indicators suggesting that CCC is still in the early innings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company defined its \"emerging solutions\" segment as one offering \"subrogation, diagnostics\" services at a Goldman Sachs (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GS\" title=\"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\">GS</a>) <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821742-ccc-intelligent-solutions-holdings-inc-cccs-presents-at-goldman-sachs-communacopia-technology\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821742-ccc-intelligent-solutions-holdings-inc-cccs-presents-at-goldman-sachs-communacopia-technology\" target=\"_blank\">investor event</a>. These ancillary revenues surged +75% YoY in 4Q2025. But that was just five percent of the group-wide figure. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Separately, CCC mentioned at Citi's TMT forum that \"a top 10 carrier has adopted and put about 20% of their claim volume\" through its \"flagship AI product Estimate-STP.\" You would think that the firm's 10% AI-related revenue share could increase going forward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">You Should Consider These Downside Factors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A failure to maintain cost discipline could lead to CCC's future margins missing the analysts' expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A lower-than-anticipated level of emerging/AI product penetration may pose risks to the company's long-term growth ambitions. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">My Closing Remarks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I've kept this stock as a \"Buy\"-rated name.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its listed comparables include SS&amp;C (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNC\" title=\"SS&amp;C Technologies Holdings, Inc.\">SSNC</a>), HealthEquity (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HQY\" title=\"HealthEquity, Inc.\">HQY</a>), nCino (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NCNO\" title=\"nCino, Inc.\">NCNO</a>), and Veeva (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VEEV\" title=\"Veeva Systems Inc.\">VEEV</a>). The mean EV/EBITDA for these equities is 12.2 times as per S&amp;P Capital IQ.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CCC's forward EBITDA multiple is 9.5x. This implies a re-rating potential of +28% (12.2/9.5) benchmarked with peers.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I take the view that a more rapid rate of turnover expansion will be the catalyst to justify a richer valuation.</p>",

This report was highly anticipated, as the company was expected to provide guidance for the current year—which it did, while also revealing plans to add a staggering nine<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> new data centers in the coming years.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this report, I was primarily focused on several key points:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>To what extent did the company beat (or miss) its 2025 ARR guidance?</p></li> <li><p>Would the 2026 ARR guidance change, and what would be the revenue outlook for 2026?</p></li> <li><p>Would the company provide capital expenditure guidance for 2026?</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I received answers to these questions and, as usual, updated my expectations for the company's future performance and valuation. Looking ahead, I must note that despite a slight reduction in my price target—largely due to my conservative valuation approach—I have become even more bullish on the company's prospects. But let’s take it step by step, starting with the Q4 2025 results.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Review of the Q4 '25 Results</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue and ARR</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Starting with revenue, it fell short of the consensus estimate. With actual Q4 25 revenue at $227.7 million and $529.8 million for the full year 2025, the company missed the consensus forecast of $242.8 million for Q4. However, as I have noted before, due to the small number of investment houses covering the company, the consensus remains unrepresentative and is best ignored for now. Contrary to my expectations, no major investment houses other than Morgan Stanley have initiated coverage since my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845220-nebius-valuation-update-after-q3-results-raising-price-target-to-147\">last column</a>. Furthermore, I have reservations regarding Morgan Stanley's report, particularly as it fails to account for Nebius's stakes in its portfolio companies. But let’s look at the hard numbers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nebius AI accounted for $214.2 million in revenue (94% of total Nebius Group revenue), up 800% year-over-year. For comparison, Nebius AI’s Q3 25 revenue was $131.1 million. The remaining 6% of Group revenue came from TripleTen, while Avride’s contribution was negligible.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the full year 2025, the company generated $529.8 million in total revenue, with the Nebius AI business contributing $477.3 million. In my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845220-nebius-valuation-update-after-q3-results-raising-price-target-to-147\">previous article</a>, I expected $551 million in revenue (and $248 million for Q4), while the actual Q4 figure for Nebius AI was $214.2 million. However, I don't see this discrepancy as a major issue. Revenue figures are highly sensitive to the timing of new capacity commissions. In the Q4 results, it is far more effective to look at the December ARR, as major capacities only began generating revenue in December.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding ARR, the company exceeded its own guidance: against a forecast of $0.9–$1.1 billion, the actual figure (December revenue multiplied by 12) came in at $1.25 billion, implying December revenue of $104 million. This reinforces my view that Arkady Volozh and his team take a conservative approach to forecasting, increasing the likelihood that the December 2026 ARR guidance will also be surpassed. It’s also worth noting the rapid growth: September ARR was $551 million. For comparison, here is the ARR progression previously disclosed by Nebius:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>December 2025 ARR: $1.25 billion</p></li> <li><p>September 2025 ARR: $551 million</p></li> <li><p>June 2025 ARR: $430 million</p></li> <li><p>April 2025 ARR: $310 million</p></li> <li><p>March 2025 ARR: $249 million</p></li> <li><p>December 2024 ARR: $90 million</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company also noted that Active Capacity (power consumed by IT equipment, which I interpret as installed capacity) reached 170 MW by year-end, significantly beating the 100 MW guidance. It is likely that all 75 MW in Finland became active by year-end, which is plausible given that the second part of the Meta contract capacity was delivered by early February. I also assume the Kansas City data center was expanded to 20 MW. My breakdown of the 170 MW active capacity is as follows:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>Finland: 75 MW</p></li> <li><p>New Jersey: 50 MW</p></li> <li><p>Kansas City: 20 MW</p></li> <li><p>Iceland: 10 MW</p></li> <li><p>Paris: 5 MW</p></li> <li><p>London: 5 MW</p></li> <li><p>Israel: 5 MW</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is little point in calculating revenue per 1 MW based on December alone, as not all 170 MW of active capacity began generating revenue that month (at the very least, the second 25 MW of the Meta contract did not). Some units may have only been active for a fraction of the month. However, if we take the September revenue-per-MW figure of $0.918 million, it suggests that once the full 170 MW of active capacity is fully ramped up, it could generate an ARR of at least $1.87 billion. We should see this level reflected in the February ARR, as the second half of the Meta contract revenue began flowing in February.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">EBITDA, EBIT, CapEx, and FCF</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the first time, the company’s total Adjusted EBITDA turned positive, reaching $15 million (a 7% margin). If you attempt to calculate Adjusted EBITDA yourself, it is important to note that this $15 million figure is adjusted for one-time non-recurring expenses in SG&amp;A amounting to $43.6 million. I found no specific data on the nature of these expenses or which segment they should be allocated to.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the Nebius AI segment, Adj. EBITDA was $51.8 million, representing a 24% margin (up from 19% in the previous quarter). The overall group margin remains lower than the AI Cloud segment due to the negative profitability of TripleTen and Avride.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we allocate all depreciation and amortization to Nebius AI, the segment's operating loss would stand at $128.9 million. However, given the aggressive growth phase, I would not focus on this metric for the current or even the following year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capital expenditures in Q4 '25 were lower than both <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845220-nebius-valuation-update-after-q3-results-raising-price-target-to-147\">my</a> and management’s expectations. Against a $3 billion forecast, actual spending was $2.06 billion. We can conclude that a portion of the CapEx has been deferred to the current year, which is reflected in management’s updated guidance that we will analyze later.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Free Cash Flow loss for the quarter was $1.2 billion. Notably, a portion of the cash flow came from working capital—specifically, prepayments from contracts with Meta and Microsoft. This is evident in the deferred revenue (both short-term and long-term), which increased by $1.56 billion during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, total liquidity stood at $3.7 billion at year-end. It is worth noting that the ATM (At-The-Market) program for the sale of 25 million shares, announced in the previous report, was not utilized. I assume that in the absence of an urgent need for liquidity, the company is waiting for higher share price levels before tapping into this program.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2026 Forecast</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue and ARR Outlook</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To recap, in the previous earnings report, the company provided a December 2026 ARR guidance of $7–$9 billion. This implies December 2026 monthly revenue of $583–$750 million ($667 million at the midpoint). Meanwhile, the company maintained its previously issued guidance for Connected Capacity of 800–1,000 MW by year-end. It is important to distinguish \"Connected\" from \"Active\" capacity; in Nebius's terminology, Connected Capacity refers to power successfully connected to the data centers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we use the revenue-per-MW from the Meta contract as a benchmark (~$0.967 million), the company would need 603–776 MW of revenue-generating capacity by December 2026 to hit the $583–$750 million monthly revenue target. However, there is a high probability that average revenue-per-MW will be higher by December due to a larger share of on-demand rentals and the increased performance density of new GPUs—particularly the Rubin GPUs—expected to be deployed in the second half of 2026. Consequently, the company may require less physical capacity to meet its financial targets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845220-nebius-valuation-update-after-q3-results-raising-price-target-to-147\">previous article</a>, I noted that the seven existing data centers would provide a combined 455 MW by year-end, leaving a gap of 235 MW. Given the plans for new capacity, the company is well-positioned to meet its guidance, assuming no significant delays in data center launches.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, management provided its first FY 2026 revenue guidance, projecting $3.0–$3.4 billion. While this is slightly below <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845220-nebius-valuation-update-after-q3-results-raising-price-target-to-147\">my expectation</a> of $3.6 billion, I believe management is simply being conservative in their outlook.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability &amp; Capital Expenditures</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management expects Adjusted EBITDA for FY 2026 to settle at approximately 40%, which, based on their revenue guidance, translates to $1.2–$1.36 billion. While operating profit is expected to remain negative for the year, the company reaffirmed its long-term target of 20–30% operating margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nebius has shifted to a 5-year depreciation schedule for GPUs, a move that should accelerate the path to GAAP operating profitability. This is a well-founded decision. Previously, the company used a 4-year schedule, but given that the lion's share of revenue this year and next will come from 5-year contracts with Meta and Microsoft, the adjustment is justified. Notably, this policy remains more conservative than that of Big Tech peers or CoreWeave, who depreciate server hardware over 6 years—a practice that carries the risk of negative revaluations once those 5-year leases expire.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Due to the aggressive data center expansion plans, the CapEx guidance came in higher than my estimates. Management anticipates $16–$20 billion in capital expenditures for FY 2026, compared to my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845220-nebius-valuation-update-after-q3-results-raising-price-target-to-147\">previous estimate</a> of $12.8 billion. The company <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9_O3-C0F3c\" rel=\"nofollow\">noted</a> that 60% of this will be covered by existing cash, operational cash flow, and customer prepayments.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">My Updated Data Center Capacity Forecast</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nebius raised its Contracted Capacity guidance for year-end from 2.5 GW to 3 GW. As a reminder, \"Contracted\" refers to capacity where land and power agreements are fully secured—much of this will come online post-2026. A more immediate metric for investors is the Active Capacity guidance of 800–1,000 MW by the end of this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s break down the projected capacity by site, starting with current locations and moving to the newly announced data centers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on the earnings call, both tranches of capacity under the Meta contract are already leased. Assuming these are located in the Finnish data center, its capacity has already reached 75 MW. I also expect the London site (Surrey) to expand to its declared 16 MW in Q1 26 and the Modi’in site (Israel) to reach 10 MW this year. Paris (5 MW) and Keflavik (10 MW) should remain stable, while Kansas City is likely to expand to 40 MW by year-end. For the New Jersey site, I expect an additional 50 MW in Q2 26, with the remaining 200 MW coming online late in the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My year-end expectations for existing sites (Total: 456 MW):</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>New Jersey (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>): 300 MW</p></li> <li><p>Mäntsälä (Finland): 75 MW</p></li> <li><p>Kansas City (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>): 40 MW</p></li> <li><p>Surrey (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UK\" title=\"Ucommune International Ltd\">UK</a>): 16 MW</p></li> <li><p>Keflavik (Iceland): 10 MW</p></li> <li><p>Modi’in (Israel): 10 MW</p></li> <li><p>Paris (France): 5 MW</p></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Expansion: 9 New Locations</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Data on the new sites is scarce, but based on the <a href=\"https://assets.nebius.com/assets/85571bd2-050b-468c-954c-42e9d24e4cd2/Letter%20to%20Shareholders%20Q4%202025.pdf?cache-buster=2026-02-12T11:57:13.886Z\" rel=\"noopener\">Shareholder Letter</a> and industry sources like <em>DataCenterDynamics</em>, I estimate the following:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>Independence, Missouri (Owned): <a href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/nebius-plans-800mw-data-center-campus-in-kansas-city-missouri/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Planned</a> for 800 MW (expandable to 1.1 GW).

Conservatively, I assume 567 MW will be revenue-generating across the full Q4 26.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <td><strong>Period</strong></td> <td><strong>Active Capacity (Installed)</strong></td> <td><strong>Revenue-Generating Capacity</strong></td> </tr></thead> <tr> <td><span><strong>End of 2026</strong></span></td> <td><span>907 MW</span></td> <td><span>567 MW</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span><strong>End of 2027</strong></span></td> <td><span>1.6 GW</span></td> <td><span>1.08 GW</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span><strong>End of 2028</strong></span></td> <td><span>2.5 GW</span></td> <td><span>2.0 GW</span></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: Created by the author using his own estimates</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I expect the company to reach and exceed its 3 GW contracted capacity target by 2029.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While my revenue-generating capacity estimates for 2026–2027 remain largely stable, the outlook for 2028 has shifted significantly upward. The increase in total installed capacity across the board is the primary driver for my upward revision of the CapEx forecast.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">CapEx Forecast</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a reminder, my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845220-nebius-valuation-update-after-q3-results-raising-price-target-to-147\">previous estimates</a> for capital expenditures were $12.8 billion for 2026, $11.0 billion for 2027, and $11.9 billion for 2028, totaling $35.7 billion. However, following the updated guidance on new data center additions, I have revised my projections. I now expect CapEx to reach $16.5 billion in 2026, another $16.5 billion in 2027, and $21.5 billion in 2028.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This brings the three-year total to a staggering $54.5 billion. Such a colossal figure immediately raises the question of where the funding will come from. To address this, I will first present my updated forecasts for revenue, operating income, and EBITDA to determine how much internal cash flow the company can generate over this period.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue, Operating Income, and EBITDA Forecast</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My revenue forecast splits Nebius’ revenue into:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>Revenue from Microsoft and Meta fixed-price GPU contracts.</p></li> <li><p>Revenue from flexible-priced GPU capacity, where hourly rates and utilization vary.</p></li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For data centers with capacity exceeding 100 MW, I expect them to be reserved for large-scale fixed contracts. For the rest of the data center capacity, hourly pricing ranges from $1.6 to $7, while GPU utilization ranges from 40% to 85%, depending on the GPU model. In future years, I also expect GPU rental rates to decline 3–10% per quarter (depending on the GPU model) to remain conservative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on these assumptions, my revenue forecast is:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>2026: $3.6 billion (+574% YoY) — unchanged</p></li> <li><p>2027: $10.3 billion (+187% YoY) — previously $10.1 billion</p></li> <li><p>2028: $16.5 billion (+60% YoY) — previously $13.5 billion</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/29957065-1772023515901673_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"840\" data-height=\"446\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/29957065-1772023515901673_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"My Nebius AI's Revenue forecast\" width=\"640\" height=\"340\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/29957065-1772023515901673_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/29957065-1772023515901673_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/29957065-1772023515901673_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/29957065-1772023515901673_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">My Nebius AI's Revenue forecast <span>(Created by the author using his own estimates)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">An additional upside to this forecast lies in the PaaS (Token Factory) and SaaS segments. However, until the company begins to break these out separately, I am excluding them from my projections to remain conservative.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Adjusted Operating Income and Adj. EBITDA</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving to operating income, I expect:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>For 2026, I expect an adjusted operating loss of $178 million (previously a loss of $374 million). This improvement is due to the shift in GPU depreciation from 4 to 5 years, which partially offset the upward revision in CapEx. I still expect the company to reach positive adjusted operating income in Q4 2026.</p></li> <li><p>For the full year 2027, I expect $2.2 billion in operating profit (previously $2.3 billion) with a 22% margin.</p></li> <li><p>For 2028, I expect $4.1 billion in operating profit (previously $3.3 billion) with a 25% margin.</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My expectations for adjusted EBITDA:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>2025: -$74 million (previously –$98 million)</p></li> <li><p>2026: $1.5 billion (previously +$1.67 billion)</p></li> <li><p>2027: $6.5 billion (previously +$7.0 billion)</p></li> <li><p>2028: $10.6 billion (previously +$9.8 billion)</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having established forecasts for revenue, adj. EBIT, and adj. EBITDA, we now move to estimating Nebius’ external funding needs through 2028.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additional Funding Requirements</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, let’s look at the funding needs for 2026. Starting with $3.7 billion in liquidity at the end of Q4 '25, the company is expected to generate $1.5 billion in EBITDA during 2026. Based on my estimates, interest payments will consume $264 million, while CapEx will require $16.5 billion. This leaves a funding gap of $11.6 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845220-nebius-valuation-update-after-q3-results-raising-price-target-to-147\">previous analysis</a>, I took a conservative stance and did not model prepayments from Meta and Microsoft. However, following the actual cash inflows in Q4 '25, I am now incorporating the projected cash flow from customer prepayments into my 2026 forecast.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To estimate the remaining prepayments due this year, we can look at the $1.5 billion already received. Considering that all 50 MW for Meta and the initial 50 MW for Microsoft have been delivered, Nebius still has 250 MW to deliver to Microsoft. Based on these inputs, the $1.5 billion represents a portion of the $2.9 billion Meta contract and roughly $2.9 billion of the $17.4 billion Microsoft contract. This implies a prepayment rate of approximately 26% (which I will round down to 25% for conservatism).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that the remaining 250 MW for Microsoft is slated for delivery this year, the remaining prepayment should amount to roughly $3.6 billion. Consequently, to cover my projected expenses through the end of the year, the company will need to raise an additional $8 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9_O3-C0F3c\" rel=\"nofollow\">earnings call</a>, management repeatedly emphasized that 60% of CapEx would be funded through existing liquidity, operational cash flow, and prepayments. Using management’s 40% EBITDA margin and the midpoint of their revenue guidance, these sources would provide $8.68 billion. Meanwhile, 60% of their lower-bound CapEx guidance is $9.6 billion, suggesting a gap of roughly $900 million. I expect this shortfall to be covered either by other working capital components or by prepayments from yet-to-be-announced contracts, which I anticipate no earlier than the end of Q2 '26.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">How can Nebius bridge my projected funding gap? The company has several levers. The 25 million shares ATM program remains untouched. At a share price of $100, this alone covers a significant portion. Additionally, Nebius could monetize parts of its stakes in ClickHouse and Avride.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the longer-term horizon from Q1 '26 through Q4 '28, the company will require $54.5 billion in CapEx.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Between Q1 '26 and Q4 '28, I estimate the company will generate:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>$18.6 billion in EBITDA</p></li> <li><p>$0.409 billion in taxes</p></li> <li><p>$3.3 billion in interest payments</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The elevated interest estimate requires explanation. The existing four convertible bond issues imply only $253 million of interest over this period. However, to stay conservative, I model the entire capital shortfall as debt at a 9% interest rate—benchmarked against the rate CoreWeave<strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWV\" title=\"CoreWeave, Inc.\">CRWV</a>)</strong> pays on its latest asset-backed financing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Nebius has many financing options (selling stakes in ClickHouse, Avride, or Toloka; issuing new convertible bonds or equity), I am modeling this conservative debt-heavy scenario until more clarity emerges. Under these assumptions, the company will require $34.5 billion of additional capital during 2026–2028:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>$9 billion in 2026 (including a buffer for 2027)</p></li> <li><p>$11 billion in 2027</p></li> <li><p>$14.5 billion in 2028</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are substantial figures, but I have little doubt that Nebius can secure this funding, especially given the diversity of available financing tools. It is important to note that this $34.5 billion is not a fixed obligation—it is a discretionary growth spend that can be adjusted based on market conditions and demand. In the near term, I expect Nebius to secure asset-backed financing specifically against the high-quality cash flows of the Microsoft contract.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, we move to valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nebius AI’s Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845220-nebius-valuation-update-after-q3-results-raising-price-target-to-147\">previous analysis</a>, I valued Nebius using the EV/EBIT multiple, taking the 2028 adjusted operating profit as the denominator. I believe EV/EBIT is a more robust metric here than EV/EBITDA because it does not artificially inflate the valuation. Instead, it accounts for capital intensity and reflects differences in depreciation as a percentage of revenue, which directly impacts FCF profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current average forward EV/EBIT'28 multiple for the peer group (Amazon, Oracle, Alphabet, and Microsoft) is 13.5x (down from 15.9x at the time of my last article).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Applying this 13.5x multiple to my updated 2028 adjusted operating profit forecast of $4.1 billion, I arrive at a fair Enterprise Value for Nebius AI of $55.7 billion (up from my previous estimate of $52.7 billion). The decline in peer multiples was more than offset by the upward revision in my operating profit forecast, which, as noted, was partly driven by the change in depreciation policy. It is worth noting that if we adjusted peer multiples to match Nebius’s more conservative 5-year depreciation (vs. their 6-year schedules), their multiples would effectively be higher. However, I will stick with the current 13.5x to remain conservative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To derive the fair Equity Value, we must subtract net debt. Rather than using the current figure ($450 million), I factor in the future capital required to achieve the projected 2028 financials. My model estimates this funding need at $34.5 billion. When discounted to the present, this represents a present value of $29.8 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I treat the outstanding convertible notes as additional shares rather than debt, as the current share price significantly exceeds the conversion price. Consequently, I subtract the projected capital raise ($29.8 billion) from the Enterprise Value. This results in an Equity Value for Nebius AI of $27.4 billion (previously $34.5 billion). The decrease in equity value is primarily due to the higher debt assumptions I’ve integrated into the model to maintain a conservative stance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fully Diluted Share Count</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of Q4 '25, Nebius has 219.5 million Class A shares and 33.6 million Class B shares. To determine the fully diluted count, I add:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>19.4 million shares from the 2029 and 2031 convertible notes.</p></li> <li><p>7.4 million shares from stock options (exercise price: $88.15).</p></li> <li><p>6.2 million shares from RSUs (average exercise price: $43.74).</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Note: The figures for options and RSUs are based on data from the ATM program announcement, but I assume they have not changed materially.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Total Fully Diluted Shares: 286 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on this share count, the core Nebius AI business is valued at $95.7 per share. This is remarkably close to the current market valuation and, crucially, does not yet include the valuation of Nebius’s other business segments or its stakes in Toloka and ClickHouse.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Avride, TripleTen, and Stakes in Toloka and ClickHouse</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this article, I will not revalue Nebius’s holdings in Avride ($4.8 billion) or Toloka ($0.64 billion). I intend to cover these in separate articles, as both businesses deserve a deep dive of their own.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I am updating my valuations for ClickHouse and TripleTen. Notably, ClickHouse <a href=\"https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-raises-400-million-series-d-acquires-langfuse-launches-postgres\" rel=\"nofollow\">raised</a> a new $400 million funding round in January at a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-16/clickhouse-lands-15-billion-valuation-in-ai-database-race\" rel=\"nofollow\">$15 billion valuation</a>. Prior to this round, Nebius held a 28% stake. While I initially estimated a dilution to 27%, management clarified during the earnings call that Nebius now holds a 25% stake.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will use this updated figure, which values Nebius’s stake in ClickHouse at $3.75 billion. Given ClickHouse’s growth trajectory, I believe this holding has further upside potential; therefore, I am including it in my valuation without a liquidity discount for its private status.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am also updating my valuation for TripleTen. Previously, I used an average EV/Sales'25 multiple of 2.9x from a peer group consisting of Coursera, Udemy, and Duolingo. I have since adjusted my approach. Given Duolingo’s recent price correction, I am now using its current EV/Sales'26 multiple of 3.77x as the primary benchmark for TripleTen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TripleTen's business grew 88% YoY in 2025 to $52.5 million. Taking a lack of specific revenue guidance for TripleTen this year, I expect at least 50% growth in 2026, reaching $78.8 million. At a 3.77x multiple, this yields a fair value for TripleTen of $297 million (up from $267 million).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts &amp; Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By combining the updated valuations for Nebius AI, TripleTen, and ClickHouse while keeping Avride and Toloka unchanged, I arrive at a fair equity value for Nebius Group of $36.9 billion (previously $42 billion). This corresponds to a fair value of $128.9 per share based on the diluted share count of 286 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As noted earlier, the decrease in target price is driven by the compression of peer multiples and my more conservative assumptions regarding the capital required over the next few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sum-of-the-Parts Valuation Breakdown:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>Nebius AI: $27.4 billion ($95.70 per share)</p></li> <li><p>ClickHouse Stake: $3.75 billion ($13.10 per share)</p></li> <li><p>Avride: $4.8 billion ($16.80 per share)</p></li> <li><p>Toloka Stake: $0.64 billion ($2.24 per share)</p></li> <li><p>TripleTen: $0.3 billion ($1.04 per share)</p></li> <li><p>Total Fair Value: $128.90 per share</p></li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Verdict</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the slight reduction in my fair value estimate, I have become even more bullish on Nebius. Even under a highly conservative financing scenario, the current share price offers significant upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Several factors provide further upside potential to my valuation:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>Cheaper Financing: My model assumes a 9% interest rate on debt. Any asset-backed financing or customer prepayments from newly announced data centers would lower this cost.</p></li> <li><p>Strategic Milestones: I expect major contract announcements around the launch of the Bethune (France) facility this summer and the Alabama site toward year-end, which should serve as strong catalysts.</p></li> <li><p>Conservative Multiples: Valuing the business on 2028 EBIT is conservative, as Nebius is likely to maintain a higher growth rate than its Big Tech peers well beyond 2028. Also, a part of the 2028 CapEx will generate revenue only in 2029.</p></li> </ol> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I mentioned in my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845220-nebius-valuation-update-after-q3-results-raising-price-target-to-147\">previous column</a>, I have fully rebuilt my initial position in Nebius. In early February, I increased my position by another 10% after the stock dipped below $75. I do not plan to sell any shares until the price reaches at least $130 without additional news.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, while my fair value estimate moved from $147 to $129, my conviction in the company’s prospects has only strengthened due to their successful operational execution. It is also important to note that my estimate represents current fair value, rather than a 12-month price target used by most analysts.</p>",

Their current valuation, however, suggests prospects are mostly<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> baked in.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Business context</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens is organized into four main business segments:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Digital Industries: This segment offers product and system solutions for factory automation, including factory automation software such as TIA (Totally Integration Automation), motors, drives, inverters, sensors, product lifecycle management software (PLM) such as Teamcenter, electronic design automation software (EDA), as well as digital marketplaces for electronics such as Supplyframe and Pixeom. Industries served include consumer packaged goods, semiconductors, automotive, and pharmaceuticals, and their customers include <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAY21NZ9JNE&amp;t=653s\" rel=\"nofollow\">Micron</a>, Intel, and Rapidus, to name a few.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens competitors in this space include Rockwell Automation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROK\" title=\"Rockwell Automation, Inc.\">ROK</a>), ABB (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABBNY\" title=\"ABB Ltd\">ABBNY</a>), and Schneider Electric (factory automation software) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBGSF\" title=\"Schneider Electric S.E.\">SBGSF</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBGSY\" title=\"Schneider Electric S.E.\">SBGSY</a>), Dassault (PLM) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DASTY\" title=\"Dassault Systèmes SE\">DASTY</a>), Cadence Design Systems (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CDNS\" title=\"Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\">CDNS</a>) and Altium (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALMFF\" title=\"Altium Limited\">ALMFF</a>) to name just a few, and Siemens is consistently among the top players in several of these segments including <a href=\"https://www.abiresearch.com/press/ptc-siemens-and-dassault-systemes-take-the-lead-in-abi-researchs-plm-for-large-manufacturers-competitive-ranking\" rel=\"nofollow\">PLM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ema-eda.com/ema-resources/blog/top-eda-companies/\" rel=\"nofollow\">EDA</a>, and <a href=\"https://manufacturingdigital.com/ai-and-automation/top-10-industrial-automation-software-companies\" rel=\"nofollow\">factory automation</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of Q1 2026, Digital Industries is their second-biggest segment accounting for roughly a fifth or so of revenues. The segment generates revenues through two major streams, namely, software (which accounts for roughly a third of Digital Industries’ revenues) and automation, which accounts for the remainder. Margins typically hover in the high teens.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Smart Infrastructure: This segment offers products and system solutions to support the shift in energy generation from fossils to renewables. Products and solutions include EV charging infrastructure; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning controls, distribution systems, and switchgear including <a href=\"https://www.siemens.com/en-us/products/vacuum-switching-technology/sion-vacuum-circuit-breakers\" rel=\"nofollow\">circuit breakers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.siemens.com/en-us/products/siprotec/\" rel=\"nofollow\">relays</a> and <a href=\"https://www.siemens.com/en-us/products/sivacon/\" rel=\"nofollow\">busbars</a>. This segment also includes software solutions such as Building X (Building Management System), Gridscale X (grid management), Electrification X (electricity infrastructure management), and Siemens Xcelerator marketplace platform where customers can buy components and software solutions from Siemens and sellers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens competes with a number of competitors in this segment, including Schneider Electric (in BMS and grid management with products like Schneider EcoStruxure), ABB (switchboards, EV charging infrastructure).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of Q1 2026, Smart Infrastructure is Siemens’ biggest revenue generator accounting for over a quarter of revenues. Margins hover in the high teens.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mobility: This segment offers products and services related to rail passenger and freight transportation, including rolling stock, as well as software solutions including rail automation. This is their smallest segment accounting for under a fifth of revenues, and is also the least profitable with the lowest margins. Competitors in this space include Alstom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALSMY\" title=\"Alstom SA\">ALSMY</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AOMFF\" title=\"Alstom SA\">AOMFF</a>) and CRRC (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRCCY\" title=\"CRRC Corporation Limited\">CRCCY</a>)). This segment accounts for under 15% of revenues. Margins are typically in the high single digits, making it one of the least profitable segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens Healthineers: Siemens Healthineers sells medical products and solutions with a particular focus on medical imaging and laboratory diagnostics. Products include MRI scanners, CT scanners, radiography systems, oncology equipment, and analysis equipment for urine analysis, and blood testing, among other purposes. Competitors include GE Healthcare (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GEHC\" title=\"GE HealthCare Technologies Inc.\">GEHC</a>) and Mindray (medical imaging) and Roche (lab diagnostics) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RHHBY\" title=\"Roche Holding AG\">RHHBY</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RHHBF\" title=\"Roche Holding AG\">RHHBF</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RHHVF\" title=\"Roche Holding AG\">RHHVF</a>) and Philips (oncology) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PHG\" title=\"Koninklijke Philips N.V.\">PHG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RYLPF\" title=\"Koninklijke Philips N.V.\">RYLPF</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens currently holds nearly a <a href=\"https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/siemens-plans-deconsolidate-siemens-healthineers\" rel=\"nofollow\">70%</a> stake in Siemens Healthineers. The segment contributes to at least a quarter of Siemens’ revenues, and margins typically hover in the mid teens.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Financial context</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In <a href=\"https://assets.new.siemens.com/siemens/assets/api/uuid:3948cdd4-35e0-4c1d-8412-9aed4097b3d0/HQCOPR202511117277EN.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">FY 2025</a>, Siemens’s revenues rose 5%, while orders grew 6% largely driven by Digital Industries.

Net income was EUR 2.2 billion (compared to EUR 3.9 billion in Q1 2025 which benefited from a EUR 2.1 billion gain from the sale of Innomotics. Free cash flow was EUR 0.7 billion for the quarter. Growth was largely driven by Smart Infrastructure and Digital Industries. Digital Industries orders were up by at least 10% to EUR 4.8 billion from EUR 4.2 billion in Q1 2025, with both the software business and automation business contributing to growth. Smart Infrastructure order growth exceeded 15% reaching EUR 7.1 billion (from EUR 6.1 billion in Q1 2025) largely driven by the electrical products business which included significant orders from data center customers (data center orders reached a record high of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869206-siemens-aktiengesellschaft-siegy-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">EUR 1.8 billion</a> for the quarter). Order backlog hit a record <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869206-siemens-aktiengesellschaft-siegy-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">EUR 120 billion</a> and book-to-bill was <a href=\"https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/strong-start-fiscal-2026-outlook-raised\" rel=\"nofollow\">1.12</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Prospects</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Data center growth engine has room to run and support management growth targets</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens’s growth appears to be largely driven by data center capex spend. This year alone, AI and hyperscalers Amazon (AWS), Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>), Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), and Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) have announced data center capex investments totaling more than <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/google-microsoft-meta-amazon-ai-cash.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">USD 700 billion</a> this year (led by Amazon = <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/amazon-and-google-are-winning-the-ai-capex-race-but-whats-the-prize/\" rel=\"nofollow\">USD 200 billion</a>, Google = USD 180 billion, Meta = <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/02/06/what-is-a-data-center-capex-spending-630-billion-dollars-amazon-microsoft-google-meta/\" rel=\"nofollow\">USD 135 billion</a>) to win the AI race.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The capex upcycle is likely only the beginning. Estimates indicate that data center capacity could rise by as much as <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/ai-power-expanding-data-center-capacity-to-meet-growing-demand\" rel=\"nofollow\">20%</a> annually over the medium term through 2030 which bodes well for Siemens which has already proven to be a beneficiary. Assuming market share remains unchanged, management’s 6%-9% growth targets therefore appear realistic on the back of booming data center spend near term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Fragmented market and Siemens' strategic positioning supports market share gains and growth prospects</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens appears to be making moves to increase their share of data center capex spend, particularly in the higher-value semiconductor side (which accounts for an estimated <a href=\"https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2785404-alphabet-to-hike-data-center-spending-in-2026\" rel=\"nofollow\">60%</a> of hyperscalers’ planned USD 700 billion capex spend in 2026). Siemens acquisition of Altair Engineering last year bolstered their capabilities in industrial simulation, positioning them as a more competitive vendor for semiconductor clients seeking simulation i.e., <a href=\"https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/siemens-acquires-altair-create-most-complete-ai-powered-portfolio-industrial-software\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">digital twin</a> solutions. This year the momentum continued with the acquisition of <a href=\"https://engineerlive.com/content/siemens-acquires-canopus-ai-help-solve-critical-challenges-semiconductor-manufacturing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Canopus AI</a> which provides metrospection solutions for semiconductor manufacturers to increase yield. Both acquisitions are synergistic, bolstering Siemens’ existing portfolio which could drive organic market share gains; Altair strengthens Siemens' digital twin capabilities by adding advanced mechanical and electromagnetic simulation, while Canopus complements their EDA offering, enabling clients to improve semiconductor production yields.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile Siemens is inking numerous partnerships aimed at carving out a bigger share of the EDA market where Siemens competes with products like Solido and Calibre (the gold standard in integrated circuit physical verification). Siemens formed an alliance with Samsung last year to increase their position in the EDA space (an <a href=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250716PD242/ip-siemens-synopsys-cadence-samsung.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">oligopoly</a> dominated by Synopsis and Cadence which hold roughly <a href=\"https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-regulation/china-chip-design-620616\" rel=\"nofollow\">30%</a> global share each, far ahead of Siemens’ 13%) and inked a <a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/siemens-and-nvidia-expand-partnership-industrial-ai-operating-system\" rel=\"nofollow\">partnership</a> with Nvidia to build an Industrial AI operating system. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These acquisitions and partnerships position Siemens as more than just a provider of hardware components i.e., electricals but also software solutions from grid management to simulation and metrospection, which are becoming increasingly in demand as data center construction and semiconductor development costs increase. Not only could this support topline growth but could be margin accretive as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens secured EUR 1.8 billion in data center related orders in Q1 2026. Assuming order books are built in quarterly stages. At their current run rate I estimate Siemens may possibly rake in as much as EUR 8 billion or so in data center related orders this year. Considering hyperscalers alone are expected to spend as much as USD 700 this year on capex spend, of which roughly <a href=\"https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2785404-alphabet-to-hike-data-center-spending-in-2026\" rel=\"noopener\">40%</a> or so is on data center construction itself of which <a href=\"https://www.mastt.com/guide/data-center-construction\" rel=\"nofollow\">50%</a> (or approximately USD 140 billion) is for electricals, suggests Siemens’ market share is likely in the single digits. Rival Schneider Electric, which also captured around <a href=\"https://dcpulse.com/news/schneider-electric-switch-sign-usd-2-3-billion-us-data-centre-deals-for-ai-growth\" rel=\"nofollow\">USD 2 billion</a> in data center related orders, likely holds a roughly similar share or higher reflecting a market that potentially has room for further consolidation as data center construction technical complexities and demands grow. Siemens could be well positioned to increase market share as they differentiate themselves with an expanding and interconnected portfolio which offers a cohesive, and operationally seamless solution compared to fragmented alternatives by competitors. </p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Siemens Healthineers: Dry powder to drive organic and inorganic growth through acquisitions, but much depends on execution</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I expect Siemens will likely remain acquisitive. Management’s plan to spin-off their stake in Siemens Healthineers could potentially yield EUR 20 billion (<a href=\"https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/siemens-plans-deconsolidate-siemens-healthineers\" rel=\"nofollow\">30%</a> of their 67% stake will be divested directly to shareholders with the remaining 37% likely liquidated through the open market, a stake worth as much as EUR 20 billion based on Siemens Healthineers’ market cap of EUR 47 billion). Management has indicated the funds will be used to further bolster their position across the industrial software and industrial hardware value chain as part of their ONE Tech strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the strategy has merits, particularly in terms of improving market positioning, to what extent they could support financial performance remains to be seen; the data center and AI space is in an upswing, and valuations appear demanding. Siemens shelled out around EUR 13 billion on two acquisitions, Altair and Dotmatics, in 2025, at valuations that were arguably on the high side (revenues of the two companies combined are under USD 1 billion) and both have so far had an immaterial contribution to Siemens’ financials. Much depends on management's execution ability to integrate and cross-sell them to their customer base and drive growth industry averages to justify steep valuation premiums paid. So far this has yet to materialize, and therefore any revenue and profit growth arising from acquisitions is considered to be a bull case scenario.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The SaaS evolution: Shift toward a high-margin industrial ecosystem</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens’s overall strategy of focusing on shifting from hardware components to higher margin industrial software and solutions is potentially margin accretive. Their software business currently accounts for an estimated mid single digit share of revenues, so there is ample potential for further expansion of their software business, which they are working towards through efforts like transitioning <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAY21NZ9JNE&amp;t=653s\" rel=\"nofollow\">away </a>from perpetual licenses and towards recurring subscriptions (high switching costs such as data migration and personnel training are likely to keep customers tethered to Siemens). Their cloud business also allows them to tap smaller customers who previously may have been beyond reach due to high costs related to perpetual licenses. Over <a href=\"https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/siemens-enters-next-stage-growth-its-one-tech-company-program\" rel=\"nofollow\">90%</a> of their 24,000 SaaS customers are SME.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens’s record EUR 120 billion order book gives some visibility on revenue prospects for the next couple of years or so. The order book comprises a mix of short cycle orders (such as automation products under their Digital Industries segment which are typically produced in under one year), medium cycle (such as data centers which typically take 2-3 years or so), and long-cycle orders (typically from mobility customers which can run into several years). The vast majority of their order book is for short and medium cycle orders (Mobility orders in total are around EUR 15 billion). Coupled with potential new orders for data centers in the coming quarters, as well as orders in other AI-related areas where Siemens is positioned to benefit from due to strong semiconductor demand, management growth targets of 6%-9% looks possible over the next year or two assuming their software business (which generates recurring revenue of several billions notably from software products like Teamcenter X which have sticky users) maintains their double digit growth momentum which is not impossible. After that however I expect data center orders are likely to normalize with little order growth at that point as the cycle plateaus temporarily (data center construction typically takes 1-3 years so current capex spend could feed data center supply as far as 2-3 years from now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assuming revenues grow at the lower end of management’s projections, i.e., 6% this year and next year, revenues could potentially reach EUR 87 billion by 2027. Assuming margins of 15% (largely consistent with current levels, as significant margin expansion is likely a gradual long term process) suggests net income could be around EUR 13 billion or so. Deducting around EUR 3 billion in deconsolidated segment profit, assuming Siemens successfully disposes of their Siemens Healthineers stake suggests a net income of around EUR 10 billion. Assigning a P/E of 16 (slightly higher than historical averages to account for the ongoing shift to higher margin software businesses as well as Healthineers disposal and subsequent greater penetration into emerging tech like AI and semiconductors, which makes them more of a tech company than an industrial one) translates into a terminal value of EUR 160 billion. Adding EUR 17 billion (being shares shareholders receive from the Siemens Healthineers disposal) means a value of EUR 177 billion (USD 208 billion) for Siemens looks fair. If we tweak the valuation slightly and assign an 18x P/E their valuation could reach EUR 197 billion (USD 232 billion). Not too far from their current market cap of USD 224 billion, suggesting prospects are likely baked in for now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Execution risks</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens is aggressively transitioning toward AI and industrial software, a strategy which includes disposing of their stake in Siemens Healthineers - a stable, almost recession-proof, low-volatility business—to focus on acquiring higher growth industrial software businesses. Industry valuations currently are steep, and Siemens could end up overpaying, resulting in capital destruction due to execution missteps. Their acquisition of Altair (USD 140 million FCF translating into a FCF yield of under 1%) is a case in point. Even if we assume expected USD 150 million EBITDA near term cost savings will flow through FCF, it still translates into a yield of under 3%. Given Siemens WACC of around 10%, Altair would need to annual growth above 30% for at least 6 years or so to generate economic value, which would be quite a feat for the company that notched 9% YoY growth in 2024. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Takeaway</span></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens's share price has enjoyed a good run on the back of solid financial performance largely driven by AI and data center spending. The cycle has further room to run, which could support management's growth projections. Management continues to enhance Siemens' capabilities through acquisitions and partnerships to boost market capabilities, positioning the firm to capture market share, however much remains on their ability to execute and drive tangible financial growth to justify steep valuation premiums. Even after assigning a slightly higher P/E multiple to account for the transition from a traditional industrial conglomerate to a tech-focused industrial software vendor, the current market cap appears to be in line with fair value. Siemens has a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SIEGY/ratings/sell-side-ratings\">BUY</a> analyst consensus rating; however, I view Siemens as a HOLD.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
