Results were impacted by weaker-than-expected demand from industrial end markets, and we believe some of the share price weakness also reflected profit-taking following strong performance in prior periods. From our perspective, these short-term dynamics do not alter the structural advantages of MonotaRO’s business model. The company continues to gain traction with large enterprise customers, who now represent over 30% of sales. These clients typically have higher lifetime value and are more likely to adopt MonotaRO’s value-added services, such as purchase management systems, which enhance customer retention and deepen relationships. Importantly, we believe MonotaRO’s value proposition lies in convenience, execution and product curation—qualities that are difficult to replicate in Japan’s fragmented MRO market. With a high-margin, asset-light model, a scalable platform and a long runway to expand share across businesses of all sizes, we continue to view MonotaRO as a high-quality, competitively advantaged business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Accenture, the global IT consultancy, was one of the largest detractors. </strong>The company’s operations are split roughly evenly between Consulting and Managed Services (outsourcing). While Accenture’s strategic pivot to AI in 2023 has driven a rapid increase in AI-related revenue and bookings (nearly doubling to $5.9 billion in fiscal 2025), investors have grown increasingly concerned about the longer-term impact of AI on its outsourcing business—revenue heavily reliant on billable hours. Moreover, the U.S. government’s DOGE initiative created a headwind, as federal contracts have historically represented about 8% of Accenture’s revenue. Despite these challenges, Accenture continues to grow, albeit at a below-normal rate in the recent period, while simultaneously investing in its workforce—now employing roughly 77,000 AI and data specialists, about 10% of its global staff—and returning billions of dollars to shareholders through double-digit increases in both dividends (+10% year-over-year) and share buybacks (+15%). While we acknowledge that market concerns about AI’s disruptive potential warrant consideration, we believe Accenture shares have been excessively punished (valuations are at 10-year lows). The stock has retreated to mid-2020 levels, even though earnings per share and FREE cash flow are more than 50% and 40% higher, respectively, than they were at that time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Credicorp, the largest bank in Peru, was a leading contributor during the quarter.</strong> Results exceeded expectations, supported by robust loan growth—particularly in microfinance and retail segments—stable asset quality and disciplined cost management, even as Peru’s central bank cut rates. From our perspective, these outcomes represent the strength of a well-executed long-term strategy. Credicorp’s multi-pronged platform—anchored in banking, insurance and wealth management—offers durable advantages in an underpenetrated financial system. Its leading positions in microfinance (via Mibanco), pension fund management and investment advisory foster lasting customer relationships and recurring revenue through multi-product engagement. The company is also prudently expanding its digital ecosystem, enhancing efficiency and broadening access across income levels. Importantly, even amid macroeconomic uncertainty, management has consistently prioritized long-term value over volume, allocating capital conservatively and maintaining disciplined underwriting. We believe this enduring combination of diversification, market leadership and risk-aware culture supports our conviction in Credicorp as a resilient business with the ability to compound value over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Erste Group Bank (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EBKOF#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\" title=\"Erste Group Bank AG\">OTCPK:EBKOF</a>), a leading retail and commercial bank in Central and Eastern Europe, was a primary contributor during the quarter. </strong>Shares rose following strong results, supported by healthy loan growth, stable deposits and solid fee income. Looking beyond near-term performance, Erste announced its intent to acquire a significant stake in Santander Bank Polska (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BKZHF#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\" title=\"Santander Bank Polska S.A.\">OTCPK:BKZHF</a>), one of Poland’s largest banks. This transaction would expand Erste’s geographic footprint into a structurally attractive market, adding scale and diversification while providing exposure to one of the fastest-growing economies in the region. As a retail-oriented bank with meaningful exposure to underbanked populations across Central and Eastern Europe, we believe Erste is well positioned to benefit as Central and Eastern economies grow, cross key income thresholds, and drive increasing demand for financial services. In addition, we believe ongoing cost efficiencies—particularly through increased use of technology—should further improve profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody><tr><td> <p>(All MSCI index returns are shown net and in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.)</p> <p>Disclosures</p> <p>The opinions expressed herein are those of Aristotle Capital Management, LLC (Aristotle Capital) and are subject to change without notice.

Pure gross returns do not reflect the deduction of any trading costs or other fees and are supplemental to the net returns. Net returns are calculated by subtracting the highest applicable wrap/SMA fee, which includes trading costs and custodial fees, from the pure gross composite return. (From inception to 12/31/2015, the highest applicable wrap/SMA fee is 3.00% on an annual basis, or 0.75% quarterly. From 1/1/2016 to 12/31/2023, the highest applicable wrap/SMA fee is 2.00% on an annual basis, or 0.50% quarterly and 0.17% monthly from 1/1/2024 to present.)</p> <p>All investments carry a certain degree of risk, including the possible loss of principal. Investments are also subject to political, market, currency and regulatory risks or economic developments. International investments involve special risks that may in particular cause a loss in principal, including currency fluctuation, lower liquidity, different accounting methods and economic and political systems, and higher transaction costs. These risks typically are greater in emerging markets. While Large-capitalization companies may have more stable prices than smaller, less established companies, they are still subject to equity securities risk. In addition, large-capitalization equity security prices may not rise as much as prices of equity securities of small-capitalization companies. Securities of small- and medium-sized companies tend to have a shorter history of operations and be more volatile and less liquid.

Why will be coveted next.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">IMOS could be in the process of breaking out</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802632-chipmos-technologies-could-soon-show-the-path-ahead\">previous article</a> from last July mentioned how the stock seemed to be looking for directions at a time a potential catalyst could be near, which had the potential to send IMOS higher, but also lower if the situation was not resolved in favor of IMOS, which would come at a bad time considering the stock was sitting just above a trendline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Losing the support of the trendline was likely to send the stock significantly lower. On the other hand, the article also mentioned there were a number of reasons for long IMOS, if one is in it for the long run, especially with IMOS possessing a number of attributes most investors are likely to appreciate in a stock. As a result, I opted to rate IMOS a buy in the article.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5933791-17617524801386352_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1523\" data-height=\"904\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5933791-17617524801386352_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"IMOS chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"380\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"380\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5933791-17617524801386352_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5933791-17617524801386352_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5933791-17617524801386352_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5933791-17617524801386352_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5933791-17617524801386352_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5933791-17617524801386352_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5933791-17617524801386352_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5933791-17617524801386352_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Thinkorswim app</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The chart above shows how the stock fell at first, especially after the release of the most recent earnings report, but this proved to be a misdirection because IMOS has since proceeded to move higher to the point it is at the highs for 2025. Moreover, it appears the stock is in the process of breaking out by moving past resistance that has kept the stock down for over a year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The chart of the past 12 months shows the number of times the stock was unable to get past the $20-21 region once it fell below it about a year ago, beyond brief forays on an intraday basis. For instance, the stock topped out in this region in January, February, June and as recently as this October, to be followed each time by the stock pulling back to lower levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, this hold on IMOS seems to be giving way. The stock closed at $21.14 on October 20, which is worth noting because it is the first time the stock managed to close above $21.00 ever since it fell below this price level one year ago. The stock managed to do this for the second time on October 27 by closing even higher at $21.41.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IMOS followed this up by closing at $23.29 on October 28, making it the first back-to-back close above the $20-21 region in almost a year. Note that it may be too early to conclude IMOS has breached resistance since the stock still needs to provide confirmation, which would require one or two additional consecutive closes above the aforementioned region. Some may also want a retest of prior resistance to be fully convinced resistance has been broken.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is still possible for the stock to head back to the $20-21 region, but it does appear IMOS is breaking out, a bullish signal. It’s worth mentioning that IMOS went from a high of $32.19 in March 2024 to a low of $12.78 in April 2025, and if we retrace this move, the 50% Fibonacci retracement of $32.19 to $12.7 is $22.49, which probably played a role in IMOS jumping higher on October 28 after the stock managed to surpass this price point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we assume IMOS has broken out and is on the way higher, then it may be able to head as far as the next potential resistance level. This could be the next or 61.8% Fibonacci retracement, which would take the stock to around $24.78. The stock may pause as it gets closer to this price level, but the resistance that kept it locked up for a year would be no more.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings have gone down, but the worst could be over</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The decline in the stock starting in March 2024 coincided with a decline in earnings at IMOS. Earnings declined sequentially in each of the past four earnings reports to culminate in a quarterly loss, which is rare for IMOS and the first in years. In the <a href=\"https://www.chipmos.com/english/ir/info2.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">most recent</a> or Q2 FY2025 report, revenue declined by 1.3% YoY to NTD5,735.8M or $196.6M and IMOS recorded a net loss of NTD533.1M or $18.3M, which converts to a net loss of $0.51 per ADS, down from a profit of $0.42 a share a year ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gross margin decreased by 740 bps YoY to 6.6%, but it is worth pointing out that the net loss was mostly the result of a foreign exchange loss of NTD690M or $23.6M. Exchange rates are skewing the results and it may be better to look at EBITDA, which came in at NTD1,302.4M in Q2 FY2025, down from NTD1,424.7M in Q1 FY2025 and NTD1,558.3M in Q2 FY2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IMOS was still worse off, but not as badly at it appears at first based on the headline numbers. Furthermore, there is reason to think the streak of four consecutive declines in quarterly earnings will end with the upcoming report, which is scheduled to be released on November 11. Unlike other companies, IMOS releases monthly <a href=\"https://www.chipmos.com/english/ir/financial.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">revenue updates</a> and the latest update shows revenue grew by 10.6% YoY to NTD2,087.4M in September.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">IMOS looks relatively inexpensive at current valuations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we add up the numbers, then the Q3 FY2025 report is very likely to report a 1.2% YoY increase in revenue to NTD6,143.7M or $201.7M, which would make it the best quarter in terms of the top line in three years. Using this as a guideline, my estimate is that Q3 FY2025 earnings will come in at about $0.60 per ADS, although exchange rates may skew the final number. This would be a big improvement since IMOS earned $0.26, $0.19 and $0.15 in the three quarters from Q3 FY2024 to Q1 FY2025 and after it lost $0.51 per ADS in Q2 FY2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IMOS has earned just $0.09 TTM, which accords IMOS a P/E ratio of 258.8x with the stock last closing at $23.29 per ADS, but this number is skewed by forex losses. In terms of EBITDA, which in this case is more representative of how the company is doing from an operational standpoint, IMOS earned NTD5,754.7M TTM, which converts to $188.7M using a USD:NTD exchange rate of 1:30.5.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IMOS has a market cap of $812M, debt of $528.8M and cash worth $470.8M, which gives IMOS an enterprise value of $870M. EV/EBITDA is thus 4.6x, which looks much better than a P/E in the triple digits. IMOS would only need to grow EBITDA at a CAGR in the 5% range for a PEG of less than one, which according to the methodology of Peter Lynch would make IMOS undervalued relative to growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why the recovery could have legs to it</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, Q3 FY2025 is just one quarter and one good quarter does not make a trend. However, there is reason to feel optimistic that IMOS can build on the improvement in demand in Q3 FY2025, as shown by the monthly revenue figures. This is because IMOS is highly exposed to the <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/10/27/news-memory-makers-reportedly-halt-quotes-on-select-dram-nand-products-as-china-faces-daily-pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow\">memory market</a> and demand for DRAM and NAND has gotten stronger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Prices for both have risen, a sign of growing demand. In contrast, DRAM and NAND in particular were both dealing with soft demand most of last year and into this year, except in certain segments like those exposed to datacenter demand. In response to these weak conditions in the memory market, the OEMs shifted memory production towards segments where demand was better, like, for instance, HBM to take advantage of capital pouring into AI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This caused supply for other memory segments like mobile to drop, which seems to have had a positive effect on the overall market for memory products given that prices have risen so strongly compared to last year. If the memory market has fully recovered from the downturn, IMOS is likely not far behind and the loss of Q2 FY2025 was in all likelihood the bottom.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The dividend looks safe</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A major reason to be long IMOS over the year is that it has a long track record of paying a dividend, which is usually much higher than what most tech names pay out. The last dividend was $0.82 per ADS, which seems high given that IMOS only earned a fraction of this amount. This may have created doubts about the sustainability of the dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, if IMOS earns the estimated $0.60 in the upcoming report, and the recovery continues for reasons mentioned earlier, than that should help ease concerns about the dividend. The dividend payout varies from year to year and can be adjusted if needed. There is also enough cash on the balance sheet to cover the dividend, even if the income statement would not be able to.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Are there risks facing IMOS?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Declining earnings was not the only headwind facing IMOS in the past one and a half year. Other issues that have weighed on IMOS during this period include natural disasters and the state of relations between Taiwan, where IMOS is based, and the U.S. and China. For instance, there have been a couple of episodes of earthquakes in both 2024 and 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tensions with mainland China spike from time to time, and while they have left a temporary impact in terms of how the stock trades during these episodes, they have not affected actual quarterly results to a significant degree. This is because each episode has ended the same way with an easing in tensions in the Taiwan Strait.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One issue that has also not been as bad as perhaps feared is the issue of tariffs. The Trump Administration alluded to semiconductor tariffs earlier in the year, but they have yet to implement them. On the contrary, semiconductors were among the items excluded when the U.S. imposed tariffs in April after “Liberation Day”. Tariffs have not been a problem for IMOS so far, but it is possible this could change in the future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investor takeaways</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IMOS was essentially locked up for almost an entire year. The stock fell below the $20-21 price region a year ago and in spite of repeated attempts, IMOS was unable to trade back above this region, brief forays notwithstanding. Each attempt to move past the resistance imposed resulted in the stock heading south. That is until the last several days.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock has moved well above the $20-21 region in the last couple of days after being stuck below it for almost an entire year. While it is not impossible for the stock to drop again, it appears IMOS has broken the resistance that kept it contained, which opens the door to higher stock prices, something that was not to be expected with the stock locked down by resistance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IMOS went through a downturn since early last year, but there are signs the downturn is ending, if it has not already ended. Monthly revenue figures suggest the upcoming report will be the best in years, a sharp turnaround from the quarterly loss reported in the last report. The memory market is on the upswing and this should give IMOS a boost in the coming quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the recent surge in the stock price means IMOS is no longer available at less than book value, IMOS is still available at a EV/EBITDA of less than 5x. IMOS should also be able to grow EBITDA at a CAGR of at least 5-10% in the next three years, assuming the downturn has ended and the upcoming report marks the official start of an upturn.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am bullish on IMOS with the above in mind. Whether it is the monthly revenue figures or the state of the memory market, there is reason to believe IMOS is transitioning from a downturn to an upturn. The stock price was in the doldrums during the downturn and if it gets back to where it was before the downturn took down the stock, the recent rally in the stock is just the beginning.</p>",

My thesis is that while LAD is doing well in the used vehicle and aftersales segments, new vehicle profitability remains under pressure, and consumer affordability is still a problem. Until<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> GPU gets better and revenue growth re-accelerates with healthier unit economics, I believe LAD's valuation will stay rangebound.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Company overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">LAD is a global automotive retailer that addresses the entire vehicle ownership lifecycle. It has a network of 447 physical locations as of Q3 2025, with 52 distinct brands across the US, UK, and Canada. It also operates e-commerce platforms, including <a href=\"https://Driveway.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Driveway.com</a> and <a href=\"https://GreenCars.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">GreenCars.com</a>. A basic idea of what LAD really does is the sale of new and used vehicles, the arrangement of finance and insurance [F&amp;I] products, and aftersales support (includes automotive repair and maintenance). It also has a financing division called Driveway Finance Corporation [DFC].</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings Review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">LAD saw a decent <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20274777-lithia-and-driveway-lad-reports-record-third-quarter-revenue-of-9_7-billion-achieves-11#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A2\">Q3 2025 quarter</a>, with record quarterly revenue of $9.7 billion, up 4.9% y/y from $9.2 billion in Q3 2024. On a same-store basis, growth was even stronger at 7.7% y/y. In terms of segment, new vehicle retail revenue grew 5.5% y/y on a same-store basis, but new vehicle gross profit per unit [GPU] fell 10.8% y/y to $2,867. Used vehicles did better, with same-store revenue up 11.8% y/y, but GPU also saw 4.8% y/y decline to $1,767. F&amp;I also contributed positively, with 5.7% y/y same-store revenue growth. The same goes for aftersales revenue, which grew 3.9% y/y on a same-store basis. Together, gross profit grew 2.5% y/y to $1.47 billion, with overall gross margin only moderately easing by 30 bps y/y to 15.2% (mainly due to new vehicle margins). However, OPEX inched upwards with SG&amp;A expenses up 5.8% y/y, which led to flattish y/y adj. EBIT ($421.6 million in Q3 2025), while adj. net income grew 9.7% y/y to $239.4 million. The difference is primarily due to lower floor plan interest expense vs. last year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bullish aspects</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the aftersales segment will remain as the main profit driver for the foreseeable future, and so far, it is evident that demand is strong. While same-store revenue grew 3.9% y/y, same-store gross profit grew even faster by 9.1% y/y. This pushed same-store gross margin to a record 58.4%, up 280 bps y/y. This tells you that demand is really strong, as customer pay gross profit was up 9.2% (indicating customers' willingness to pay for services, even if it's out of pocket), and warranty work was up 10.8% (indicating LAD taking on more warranty work). I like the aftermarket revenue more than the new/used vehicle sales because it is recurring in nature and, in a sense, macro-cycle-resistant. During both good and bad times, if your car breaks down, you are sending it for servicing almost all the time, and this gives LAD good earnings visibility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On vehicle sales, while new vehicle sales were bad, used vehicle demand, especially in the value segment, is helping LAD to capture demand. My sense is that consumers are \"trading down\" effectively. Instead of paying for a full-price vehicle, those that need a vehicle are opting for cheaper alternatives, and used vehicles are generally the best alternative here (instead of buying a broken car and fixing it yourself). The momentum so far is good too. Same-store used units grew 6.3% y/y in Q3, and with retail volumes already tracking up 10% quarter-to-date in October, this recovery strength should continue into Q4.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Negative Aspects and Potential Concerns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Not everything is smooth sailing, though. I do see areas that are concerning, especially the weak vehicle gross profits, which is the most visible headwind. Same-store sales are good and fine, but it is just not a good look fundamentally when the new vehicle GPU is declining at double-digits (down 10.8% y/y to $2,867), and the used vehicle GPU is down 4.8% y/y to $1,767. For context, these are multi-year lows for LAD. The saving grace is that this is not just limited to LAD. The entire industry is facing a similar issue (per management in the Q3 2025 transcript), but this doesn't mean it is a good thing. This is still an earnings headwind, and the fact that overall gross profit only grew 2.5% goes to show how significant this headwind is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The problem I have is the lack of clarity into when the cycle will turn. Would it get better next month? Next quarter? Or even late next year? Between now and then, if GPUs continue to decline while volume does not pick up, earnings growth could literally turn negative despite positive top-line momentum.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One key factor to keep in mind is that part of the Q3 new vehicle strength may have been influenced by a one-off event (the expiration of certain US EV tax credits in late September). We do not know the exact volume impact, but management did note seeing an end-of-quarter sales push to clear qualifying inventory, which helped drive a ~40% lease penetration rate for new vehicles. Which means we don't really know the like-for-like growth, but given that this one-off tailwind is unlikely to happen again, it is reasonable to believe that volume growth is going to turn sequentially weaker. LAD could surprise us with better volume performance, but if GPU declines and headline new vehicle sales volume falls, the stock sentiment is not going to be good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taking a step back, I guess the high-level concern is consumer affordability, and I also do not have a view on when it will get better. The elevated interest rate narrative has been running on for quite some time already, and coupled with uncertain trade policies, it seems more than likely that consumers will continue to stay cautious on spending. This really hurts demand for new models (pricier), and as much as LAD is pivoting focus on the used vehicle segment, new vehicle retail is still the majority of revenue. Any decline will have a huge impact on consolidated sales.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60305098-17617279978662126_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"664\" data-height=\"330\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60305098-17617279978662126_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A graph of stock market AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"318\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60305098-17617279978662126_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60305098-17617279978662126_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60305098-17617279978662126_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60305098-17617279978662126_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60305098-17617279978662126_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60305098-17617279978662126_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60305098-17617279978662126_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60305098-17617279978662126_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Bloomberg</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">LAD has historically traded very well in line with its revenue growth outlook. Adjusting away the extreme high growth rates seen during the post-covid period, the median revenue growth should be somewhere in the high-single-digits to low-teens percentage, and LAD is at low-single-digits today. There are a few occasions where LAD had this similar level of growth outlook: in 2019 (traded at ~10x forward PE) and during covid (stock traded down to 6x). As I write this post, LAD trades at 8.5x forward PE, which I think is a fair multiple relative to history. The bottom line is that vehicle sales have to not only grow but also come with better unit economics. Until then, I think LAD continues to trade at where it is today.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My view on LAD is neutral. While there are positive aspects of the business, the main worry I have is that headwinds tied to weak GPU and consumer affordability will continue to dominate the narrative, and that puts pressure on the stock valuation. If the GPU continues to get worse, so much so that it causes earnings to decline despite top-line growth, that would likely drive multiples downward as investors start to model in further earnings decline until the cycle turns.</p>",

Trump has pushed the government to invest in minerals and technology companies needing funding to build manufacturing facilities or new mines for key minerals, leading to unwarranted excitement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The quantum computing space doesn't need any funding. D-Wave Quantum <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4464109-d-wave-quantum-completes-400m-at-the-money-offering\">raised $400 million</a> back in Q2 and saw the cash balance reach $819 million when the quarter ended.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to reports, the Commerce Department is discussing minimum funding awards as little as $10 million using the Chips Research and Development office overhauling the Chips Act funding. Deputy Commerce Secretary Paul Dabbar is apparently running the program after spending 4 years running Bohr Quantum Technology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The news just doesn't make a lot of sense with the quantum computing space not needing funding. The only real benefit to D-Wave Quantum is policy shifts to encourage quantum computing development and acceptance of smaller sector players.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At this point, though, the large-cap tech companies are much more likely to take a bigger slice of the quantum pie, with <strong>IBM</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM\" title=\"International Business Machines Corporation\">IBM</a>) <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4508128-ibms-key-quantum-computing-algorithm-can-work-with-standard-amd-chips\">announcing</a> a quantum algorithm working with standard <strong>AMD</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>) chips and <strong>Alphabet</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4506779-alphabet-ceo-says-quantum-chip-has-achieved-first-ever-verifiable-quantum-advantage\">announcing</a> achieving a quantum advantage with their latest Willow chip.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just to highlight the current situation, D-Wave proclaimed how the company sold $400 million worth of stock via an ATM program at a 149% premium to the prior $150 million program. The company sold these shares at a price of just $15.18, in a signal of how the stock was seen as expensive back in Q2.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meager Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">D-Wave Quantum only <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4481209-d-wave-quantum-non-gaap-eps-of--008-misses-by-003-revenue-of-31m-beats-by-056m\">reported Q2 revenues</a> of $3.1 million with quarterly bookings of $1.3 million. The company grew quarterly revenues by 42%, but the amount is generally immaterial.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock has a market cap of $12 billion already, questioning how the government investment matters to the quantum computing race. D-Wave doesn't lack for capital; the company lacks customers and technology that is viable for real-world problems to solve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4810480-d-wave-quantum-inc-qbts-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q2'25 earnings call</a>, CEO Alan Baratz again repeated how quantum computing is still years away from commercial viability as follows:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>So relative to our gate model program, look, we still believe that, a, you will never, never see a commercially viable gate model quantum computer before we have error correction. And then we still need to scale to solve useful real-world problems. And as a result, we're still many years out because no matter what you hear, in the -- from the industry, there are still very hard problems that need to be solved around error correction. It's not just a matter of engineering. And then there are still very hard problems that need to be solved in scaling. It's not just a matter of engineering. And so we do think that it's still a <strong>number of years before we will see a scaled error corrected gate model system that is commercially viable</strong>.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">D-Wave Quantum announced a <a href=\"https://ir.dwavesys.com/news/news-details/2025/Swiss-Quantum-Technology-SA-Signs-10M-Agreement-to-Deploy-D-Wave-Advantage2-Annealing-Quantum-Computer/default.aspx\" rel=\"noopener\">€10 million commitment</a> from Swiss Quantum Technology SA. The customer plans to deploy the Advantage2 annealing computer in Europe to offer D-Wave's Leap quantum cloud service.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the deal is promising, management announcing only a €10 million commitment is a prime sign of the company lacking actual large-scale revenues. D-Wave Quantum doesn't have any material deals to actually announce, and the company even suggested the system sales might only reach 6 or 7.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">D-Wave Quantum is set to report Q3'25 results on November 6. The company is forecast to report revenues of just $3 million with a $0.07 loss.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The business is losing about $20 million per quarter now, with a $20 million EBITDA loss in Q2. D-Wave Quantum reported a 43% increase in operating expenses in the quarter to over $22 million and further forecasts a 15% bump in quarterly operating expenses in the 2H of the year, though not really a material boost.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company raised the large cash balances in order to boost R&amp;D expenses and capital expenditures going forward. Even as revenues grow the next few years, the losses will grow at a similar clip.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The amazing part of the big stock rally this year is that analyst expectations for revenues haven't changed. The forecast for 2027 revenues of $71 million is actually lower than earlier this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_7799ce6bbff4e7e32a800407ab272759.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_7799ce6bbff4e7e32a800407ab272759.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_7799ce6bbff4e7e32a800407ab272759.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_7799ce6bbff4e7e32a800407ab272759.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_7799ce6bbff4e7e32a800407ab272759.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_7799ce6bbff4e7e32a800407ab272759.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_7799ce6bbff4e7e32a800407ab272759.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_7799ce6bbff4e7e32a800407ab272759.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_7799ce6bbff4e7e32a800407ab272759.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stocks have a difficult time maintaining rallies when the fundamentals don't follow the stock price. D-Wave Quantum now trades at nearly 170x 2027 sales targets while the company and Wall St. analysts are telling investors the story is still years away.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite all logic pointing to selling D-Wave Quantum on any Trump bump, the market isn't trading logically. The market could easily perceive any deal with the U.S. government as bullish despite the extra cash amounting to shareholder dilution.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key investor takeaway is that D-Wave Quantum still trades on hype with no tangible reason for the big rally this year. Investors should understand the stock should ultimately trade back down towards cash value with no material revenues over the next few years.</p>",

This isn't surprising considering latest key data prints like the labor market report weren't available. As a result, inflation was the only number for the FOMC to work with, which is only half the story.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The paucity of data also reflects in the latest FOMC statement. It starts by alluding to \"Available indicators...\", compared to the starting remark in the previous statement that said \"Recent indicators...\". Following the change in starting point, it continues to affirm that economic activity has moderated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving to labor market conditions, the Fed now says that \"...unemployment rate has edged up but remained low through August\". Here, a mention of the month in question is worth highlighting since it reflects that the Fed is working with dated data right now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Government shutdown indicates another cut...</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Would the Fed have acted any differently if more data were available? Unlikely. In my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4823959-fed-will-cut-rates-again\">previous article</a> following the FOMC meeting, it was clear that two more rate cuts can happen in 2025. One of them has come through.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering the current macroeconomic conditions, the case for another cut has only become stronger, even as the latest inflation print isn't entirely supportive of one. Here's how. The government shutdown has now lasted long enough to impact the economy negatively in Q4 2025. According to a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/federal-shutdown-could-cost-us-economy-up-14-billion-2025-10-29/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reuters report</a>, some 2% of GDP growth could be lost in the quarter as some spending will lapse. This could reflect in labor market data, which has already been weakening.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">...while inflation isn't entirely supportive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, inflation data so far isn't entirely supportive. In September, headline inflation rose for the second consecutive month to touch 3% YoY once more, marking the biggest rise in eight months (see chart below).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617993590633466_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"689\" data-height=\"319\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617993590633466_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Headline Inflation, %, YoY\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"296\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617993590633466_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617993590633466_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617993590633466_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617993590633466_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617993590633466_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617993590633466_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617993590633466_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617993590633466_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Headline Inflation, %, YoY <span>(Source: Trading Economics)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While a drop in core inflation to 3% YoY from 3.1% YoY in August is somewhat encouraging, is it enough to make up for a rise in the headline inflation? Maybe not. A look at the chart below shows that of the nine months YTD, the latest core inflation figure sits nicely in the middle of the range. While the number has been higher in four months, it has also been smaller in the remaining four.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617994736477704_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"688\" data-height=\"326\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617994736477704_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Core inflation, %, YoY\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"303\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617994736477704_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617994736477704_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617994736477704_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617994736477704_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617994736477704_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617994736477704_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617994736477704_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617994736477704_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Core inflation, %, YoY <span>(Source: Trading Economics)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Is another rate cut in the offing?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So the question now is whether the available data indicates the likelihood of another rate cut. Going by the Fed's recent actions, it would still appear so. First, inflation has been relatively de-emphasised. So, barring a significant upward movement in prices, it's unlikely to be the deciding factor.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reserve is more likely to continue focusing on the labor market. It's instructive then, to consider the projections put forth in the Philly Fed's <a href=\"https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/real-time-data-research/spf-q3-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">quarterly survey</a> of professional forecasters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The survey expects the unemployment rate to inch up to 4.4% in Q4 2025 from 4.3% in Q3 2025, just shy of the Fed's own forecast of a 4.5% level. Payroll figures are also expected to drop to 70.7k in the final quarter of the year, 5.4% below the average level of 74.75k YTD. If these projections are accurate, the Fed will continue to have a case for a cut.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How the stock markets responded</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We can then conclude that the outlook for interest rates remains unchanged. In this context, the stock market non-response makes a whole lot of sense. The S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500#hasComeFromMpArticle=true#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\">SP500</a>, <span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Futures\">SPX</a></span>, <span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"SPDR® S&amp;P 500® ETF\">SPY</a></span>) was up by a minuscule 0.05% in yesterday's trading session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJI\" title=\"Dow Jones Industrial Average Index\">DJI</a></span>) moved in the opposite direction, but only just, dropping by 0.18%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The NASDAQ 100-Index (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NDX\" title=\"NASDAQ 100-Index\">NDX</a></span>), (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ\" title=\"Invesco QQQ Trust ETF\">QQQ</a></span>) was the only key index to see some real movement. It was up by 0.45%, but this is more likely to have been driven by results from big tech companies like Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) and Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) than interest rate movements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617990577150671_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"870\" data-height=\"264\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617990577150671_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"US Equity Indices\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"194\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617990577150671_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617990577150671_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617990577150671_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617990577150671_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617990577150671_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617990577150671_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617990577150671_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17617990577150671_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Where to invest now</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With double digit percent increases in all key indices YTD, however, it's clear that investor sentiment remains relatively buoyant.

Its P/E ratio is at <a href=\"https://worldperatio.com/index/sp-500/\" rel=\"nofollow\">almost 29x now</a>, higher than the historical range of 19x-25x. This, combined with the Fed's cautiousness about the economy and the government shutdown's impact, balancing the investing portfolio with defensives is a good idea right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering that sectors like consumer staples are in the red YTD (see chart above), there's an even bigger case to consider defensives now. Even healthcare has underperformed this year, what with the uncertainty stemming from the risk of massive import tariffs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Among consumer staples, in the past month I've covered tobacco stocks like Philip Morris (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PM\" title=\"Philip Morris International Inc.\">PM</a>) and Imperial Brands (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IMBBY\" title=\"Imperial Brands PLC\">OTCQX:IMBBY</a>), both of which have a long-term Buy case in place. For healthcare, Eli Lilly (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY\" title=\"Eli Lilly and Company\">LLY</a>) looks good, so investors might want to look out for its Q3 2025 results due later today.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">In conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If uncertainty were the defining term for the year, it only got underlined with the government shutdown underway. Even though the Fed has cut rates at yesterday's meeting, as widely expected, its lack of latest data on account of the shutdown is apparent in the statement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This data paucity also leaves the question as to whether another rate cut will be delivered before the year comes to a close. It would appear so, going by the Fed's recent stance, the expected impact of the government shutdown and labor market projections for Q4 2025.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For investors, the possibility of a weaker economy, however, suggests a need for caution. And this is actually a favourable time to be cautious anyway, since defensive sectors have also been under-performers this year, providing good opportunities to buy stocks with potential.</p>",

From this remediation, DRD produces saleable gold and silver, but mostly gold. At the same time, DRD is doing something good for the environment and improving the quality of life for the residents by eliminating sources of dust and wastewater. The company was founded in 1895 and is headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa. DRDGOLD Limited is a subsidiary of Sibanye Gold Limited.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>DRD Stock Performance Since Our Last Article</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In our previous article, we suggested looking for a significantly lower share price to mitigate the spectre of headwinds from DRD as Africa’s high-cost producer, potentially materialising in a sort of undoing of some of the major work that record-high, bullish gold prices were doing to this company’s earnings, normally the primary driver of sentiment on the NYSE. On the gold bull market side, the precious metal continued to exhibit strong, still breathtaking upside potential, although the astonishing rise that far led us to fear that sentiment surrounding NYSE-listed DRD shares had become somewhat saturated and that a fasting period was needed to revive demand for DRD shares. In this context, we would like to point out that the increase in the “average gold price” achieved by DRD is crucial because it allows a company with high operating costs to still generate impressive profits, pave the way for the payment of dividends, advance growth plans, and influence the sentiment on the NYSE. And so, a 31% year-on-year increase to US$2,564/oz for the six months ended December 30, 2024, resulted in a 65% year-on-year growth in headline earnings to 112.6 South African cents per share for the six months ended December 30, 2024 (see DRDGOLD Limited's print screen interim results in our<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800994-drdgold-expansion-underway-stock-could-pull-back-bit-rating-downgrade\"> previous article</a>). Following this sub-period, DRD's “average gold price” continued its record-breaking upward trend, increasing 38.59% year-on-year to US$3,030/oz for the second half of the year ending June 30, 2025, resulting in an estimated 72.25% year-on-year growth in headline earnings to an estimated 148 South African cents per share for the second half of the year ending June 30, 2025. The average gold price and earnings for the second half of 2025, as well as their year-on-year growth, were mathematically estimated based on the first half of fiscal 2025 and<a href=\"https://senspdf.jse.co.za/documents/2025/JSE/ISSE/DRD/FS_FY2025.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"> full-year 2025 figures</a>. For the latter, DRD achieved an average gold price of US$2,797/ounce—a 35% year-on-year increase—and recorded headline earnings of 260.6 South African cents per share, a 69% year-on-year increase. Given these dynamics and their impact on market sentiment, it does not mean that these factors were not fully considered when we proposed to exploit a price decline to improve one's position, because this had its natural premise in first and foremost owning shares in DRD in light of our expectation of rising share prices, which ultimately allowed shareholders to benefit from this development: The market value of DRD shares listed on the NYSE gained +74.30%, representing a total return of +76.05% (including a dividend yield of 1.75%), thus outperforming the S&amp;P 500, the benchmark for the entire US stock market, which increased by 9.91%, as of this writing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Trigger for DRD Investors in 2025: The price of gold</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Higher gold prices have fully offset lower sales volumes and higher costs, as DRD, with an AISC of $1,716/oz, operates a more expensive gold production compared to the African region, and we conclude the comparison based on available data from<a href=\"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/gold-focus/2025/03/ever-upwards-aisc-distinct-regional-variations-are-emerging\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Sarah Tomlinson</a>, Director of Mine Supply Metals Focus at the World Gold Council, which is not very recent but not so outdated either as to affect its utilization.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-1761745604276442_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"919\" data-height=\"474\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-1761745604276442_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Screenshot source: senspdf.jse.co.za/documents/2025/JSE/ISSE/DRD/FS_FY2025.pdf, accessed on October 28, 2025\" width=\"640\" height=\"330\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-1761745604276442_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-1761745604276442_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-1761745604276442_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-1761745604276442_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-1761745604276442_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-1761745604276442_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-1761745604276442_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-1761745604276442_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Screenshot source: senspdf.jse.co.za/documents/2025/JSE/ISSE/DRD/FS_FY2025.pdf, accessed on October 28, 2025</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tomlinson wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>The regional average AISC for Africa in Q3’24 was US$1,532/oz, up 4% q/q and 14% y/y.

This supports the ambitious growth targets of Far West Gold Recoveries Proprietary Limited (“FWGR”) and extends the operating life of Ergo Mining Proprietary Limited (“Ergo”), primarily due to the robust rise in the gold price. Gold volumes were solid in the first half of fiscal year 2025 but were significantly impacted by the late and heavy summer rainfall in the third quarter (or first quarter of 2025).</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Cash Flow Movements and Growth Initiatives of the Company</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company paid lower dividends in fiscal year 2025 than in fiscal year 2024: 431 million South African Rand in fiscal year 2025 compared to 731.7 million South African Rand in the previous year, resulting in cash savings. Cash flow reinvested in the company (\"CapEx\") amounted to 2,254.9 million South African Rand in fiscal year 2025, lower than the 2,985.7 million South African Rand in fiscal year 2024. As the majority of CapEx was used for growth investments in fiscal year 2025, we conclude that the company, which continues to have higher operating costs compared to other African gold producers, is currently benefiting from a lower-than-usual need for sustainable capital expenditure because:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A) Production at FWGR is stable and under control.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">B) The photovoltaic system (“PV”) and the battery storage system (“BESS”) at Ergo (60 MW photovoltaic system and 160 MWh BESS) are leading to a decrease in electricity consumption. This is having a significant impact on DRD in terms of cost savings, as the company<a href=\"https://www.drdgold.com/component/jdownloads/?task=download.send&amp;id=365&amp;catid=135&amp;m=0&amp;Itemid=232\" rel=\"nofollow\"> states</a> that</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>“electricity is Ergo’s fourth-largest operating cost item after labour, contractors and re-agents.”</p> <p>Source: \"Results booklet: Reviewed condensed consolidated financial statements and cash dividend declaration for the year ended 30 June 2025\", DRDGOLD Limited website, accessed on October 28, 2025.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capital expenditures (\"CapEx\"), primarily used to finance growth initiatives: Although FWGR's ongoing investment projects require a 130% increase in capital expenditures to 1,559.3 million Rand in fiscal year 2025 (compared to 678.8 million Rand in fiscal year 2024), Ergo's substantial allocation for growth investments, which was 2,110.3 million Rand in fiscal year 2024, has decreased to just 340.1 million Rand in fiscal year 2025. This trend is likely to be viewed very positively by investors, as it signals that Ergo is completing and commissioning its key growth initiatives, particularly the photovoltaic plant and associated battery storage system. Since Ergo accounts for 72% of DRDGOLD's total gold production in kg (3,473 kg were produced for Ergo and 1,357 kg for FWGR in fiscal year 2025), it remains to be seen what impact this will have on production after the massive investments, while gold prices stay robust. The current status of the DRD business unit is as follows:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>FWGR</strong> and <strong>Ergo</strong> are the two gold segments with which DRD is realising its goal of gold production through mine tailings retreatment. Information on their composition, organisation, and location can be found in our previous analysis of DRDGOLD as well. We add here that <strong>Ergo</strong> is normalising from the Ergo 1 phase (2008–2023) of higher yields and throughputs to the current Ergo 2 phase, with a tailings rate capped at 1.65 million tonnes per month until August 2026 and then up to 1.8 million tonnes per month for the entire remaining operating life of Ergo beyond 2040. Ergo will process a resource base consisting of 6.7 million ounces of M&amp;I resources (including reserves) and 0.2 million ounces of inferred resources as of December 30, 2024. This is supported by hundreds of hectares of land connecting Johannesburg to Soweto (“South Western Townships”), a large and vibrant urban complex that is now more than ever known for its post-apartheid identity. Reclaiming this area will eliminate the enormous pollution caused by dust and water management, so it's easy to imagine that the necessary permits can be obtained without excessive problems. At <strong>FWGR</strong> operation near Carletonville in the western part of the Gauteng province of South Africa, the throughput rate will be significantly increased from 0.6 million tonnes per month in Phase 1 of the FWGR to 1.2 million tonnes per month in Phase 2 of the FWGR. Completion is planned for the first quarter of fiscal year 2027. Financing is currently entirely internal. FWGR will process a resource base consisting of 2.26 million ounces of M&amp;I resources (100% P&amp;P reserves) and no inferred resources as of December 30, 2024.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>A Strengthened Financial Condition</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operating cash flow increased by 90.3% year-on-year, primarily due to the gold price, from South African rand 1,845.2 million in fiscal year 2024 to South African rand 3,511.1 million in fiscal year 2025. At the same time, capital expenditures and dividend payments decreased.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cash and cash equivalents increased by 150% year-on-year in fiscal year 2025 to South African rand 1,306.2 million, compared to South African rand 521.5 million in fiscal year 2024. At the end of the fiscal year, the company remained debt-free, and DRD's financial position had significantly improved. This secures future dividends and growth, particularly through two factors:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A) The production expectation for gold production in the coming years, at least until 2028, with a vision of 200,000 ounces per year, is projected to be between 140,000 and 150,000 ounces, with operating cash costs of approximately R995,000/kg, compared to 155,288 ounces with operating cash costs of R903,824/kg in fiscal year 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">B) Although the gold price trend is strongly upward, the scenario remains uncertain.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>But The Expected Gold Price Underpins DRD's Future Growth</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To achieve the 2028 target, DRDGOLD expects medium-term investments totalling approximately R7.8 billion or R3 900 million per year over the next 2 years. To this, we add our estimate of annual sustaining capital expenditure of approximately R4 835.9 million based on FY 2025 figures, which means that DRD’s total annual capital expenditure would be around R8 735.9 million per year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We estimate the annual capital expenditures for sustaining operations as follows: The “All-in sustaining costs” for DRDGOLD in fiscal year 2025 amounted to ZAR 1,001,214/kg or US$1,716/ounce, based on an average exchange rate of ZAR/US$18.15. DRDGOLD produced 155,288 ounces or 4,830 kg of gold in fiscal year 2025. Therefore, the “All-in sustaining costs” for DRDGOLD, based on the amount of gold produced in fiscal year 2025, amounted to ZAR 4,835.9 million or US$266.5 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRDGOLD's estimated annual capital expenditures (sustaining and growth CapEx) amount to 8.8 billion Rand, which, with an annual gold production of 150,000 ounces, equates to R58 667 per ounce. As one South African Rand is currently equivalent to US$0.05809, DRDGOLD's annual (total) capital expenditures in US dollars amount to US$3,408 per ounce. The expenditures are ambitious, and in order for investors to remain optimistic about the future strength of the margin that will guarantee profits and dividends, they can only place their hopes on the development of the gold price. Wall Street remains optimistic about the future, although the pause in safe-haven assets due to the prospect of a U.S.-China trade deal caused a setback in the gold price earlier this week.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gold Spot Price (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAUUSD:CUR\" title=\"Gold Spot Price\">XAUUSD:CUR</a>) was $4,028.00 per ounce at the time of publication, representing a 51.58% increase year to date.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-sinks-below-4000-as-investors-sell-safe-haven-assets-on-china-us-trade-deal-203316587.html?.tsrc=372&amp;ncid=crm_-1855326-20251028-1--A&amp;bt_user_id=xzQU1RPnY6KFXPpifOCA7GpWcVI5lbYDC/Winmlr5TZ6PRBM9nlkaowUcgQQ63mHUKC35Ywidn6jlJ5/tt7rPd9h/EKcsj7CktZmaBE4/oczdUIjSeBvksTPyftttaOX&amp;bt_ts=1761645727891\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Yahoo Finance</a> highlights UBS Global Wealth Management's optimistic scenario of a gold price of $4,700 per ounce, and Bank of America analysts reaffirm their buy recommendation for gold with a peak of $6,000 per ounce by mid-2026, and Goldman Sachs predicts a price of $4,900 per troy ounce by the end of 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Valuation</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the time of this article, DRDGOLD Limited's shares, traded on the NYSE under the symbol \"DRD\", were trading at $24.13 per share, representing a market capitalisation of $2.05 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-17617456033698297_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1252\" data-height=\"481\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-17617456033698297_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source for screenshot: seekingalpha.com/symbol/DRD/chart, website accessed on October 29, 2025.\" width=\"640\" height=\"246\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-17617456033698297_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-17617456033698297_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-17617456033698297_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-17617456033698297_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-17617456033698297_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-17617456033698297_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-17617456033698297_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5074741-17617456033698297_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source for screenshot: seekingalpha.com/symbol/DRD/chart, website accessed on October 29, 2025.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock has traded between $8.38 and $31.91 per share over the past 52 weeks. The trailing 12-month dividend is $0.40 per share, representing a trailing 12-month dividend yield of 1.66%. The dividend yield of the<a href=\"https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-dividend-yield\" rel=\"nofollow\"> S&amp;P 500</a> is 1.13% as of this writing. Earnings per share are 260.6 South African cents (\"cps\"), or US$1.47, for the full year 2025. Based on the current market valuation, this results in a price-to-earnings ratio (\"TTM P/E ratio\") of 16.41, while the<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DRD/valuation/metrics\"> sector’s median</a> is 23.29x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock appears reasonably valued, and the moving average suggests that a near-term upward trend dominates the sentiment surrounding DRDGOLD's NYSE shares and that this trend, as long as rising gold prices in conjunction with the progress of the company's growth plans and realistic, albeit ambitious, spending act as upward drivers, has the potential, as confirmed by the 200-day moving average, to be maintained in the long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The RSI is currently at 41.67, correcting from the overbought levels of late September 2025. This could indicate some indecisiveness in demand for DRDGOLD shares, particularly after the recent visible drop in the gold price following the ceasefire in the Middle East and the prospect of a US-China trade agreement. However, this is likely to be temporary, and DRD shares are expected to trade within a neutral range just in the short term. We believe that this phase will soon give way to a renewed upward movement, fueled by a renewed awareness of DRDGOLD's robust prospects. The trigger will be the gold price: once the ounce stabilises at a healthier level after the correction, the price will resume its strong upward trend. The global environment continues to show interest in gold as a safe haven, while the likelihood of two further interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve by the end of 2025 is further fueling demand for gold, although it does not yield any income.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRDGOLD, a South African gold producer that extracts gold from the processing of tailings piles from former open-pit mine activities, is a cost-intensive producer. But the record rise in the gold price makes buying its shares a sensible option. The company has an ambitious investment budget to secure a promising future for its gold business. The impressive gold price, which has already risen by almost 60%, provides the best possible conditions for this. DRDGOLD generates positive free cash flow to distribute dividends to the shareholders of DRDGOLD Limited. Despite the recent decline in the price per ounce, Wall Street remains very optimistic about the future performance of the gold price. Rising profits and progress on the company's growth plans will positively influence sentiment on the New York Stock Exchange regarding DRDGOLD shares.</p>",

On<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the year, GDP was up 0.4%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As usual at the preliminary estimate stage, Istat did not provide a detailed demand breakdown. We just know that domestic demand (gross of inventories) acted as a drag, while net exports were growth supportive. The supply-side angle shows an increase in value added in agriculture, stability in services, and a contraction in industry - a pattern broadly consistent with confidence data published throughout the summer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today’s release confirms a picture of stagnation, where the impact of US tariffs on trade flow data has yet to settle. We had expected some rebound in the external component, which had subtracted 0.7% from quarterly GDP growth in the second quarter, and it seemed sensible to assume less of a push coming from inventories.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We suspect that at the heart of the flat reading, there's another flat quarter for private consumption and a small contraction in investments. Apparently, the peak tourism season did not work its magic this summer, notwithstanding solid international tourist flows. Domestic consumers still seem to be taking a prudent approach - the savings ratio in the third quarter remained above average. On the investment front, tariff-related uncertainty might have weighed on business decisions in the machinery domain, leaving the onus for growth on the infrastructure component, which is still driven by inflows of EU recovery funds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, today’s GDP release shows that the Italian economy is stagnating. October confidence indicators were generally improving for both consumers and businesses, except for services, marking a decent start to the last quarter of 2025. Also, on a positive note, the labour market remained resilient in September, with employment posting a decent monthly gain and the unemployment rate at 6.1%, hovering around historical lows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fundamentals remain consistent with some improvement on the consumption front in a low-inflation environment. We thus stick to our forecast of a small positive GDP growth in the fourth quarter, leaving average GDP growth for 2025 at 0.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

Not only is CAC potentially higher than initially reported, but the economics of the business might also be worse.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For these reasons, I believe the name <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4805223-travelzoo-q2-does-not-shed-clarity-on-new-business-model-profitability-yet\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4805223-travelzoo-q2-does-not-shed-clarity-on-new-business-model-profitability-yet\" target=\"_blank\">remains</a> a Hold.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another Quarter Of Unprofitable Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Travelzoo posted a quarter with revenues up almost 10%. The growth was entirely explained by higher membership fees and revenues generated by their relatively new membership-based model (implemented in 2024). Advertising revenues were flat YoY, with a decrease sequentially that can be fully explained by seasonality (1H25 has better seasonality because of Spring/Summer in the Northern Hemisphere).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The higher revenues were accompanied by a negative contribution across every line of the income statement. Gross margins decreased, Opex increased, and operating income went down 90%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">More Data On Membership Economics</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company has been commenting for several quarters, and provides several explanations in its presentation that the lower operating margins come from higher investments in <a href=\"https://s201.q4cdn.com/362028750/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-2025-Presentation-FINAL-v2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://s201.q4cdn.com/362028750/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-2025-Presentation-FINAL-v2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">member</a> acquisition. Because member fees are recognized ratably, but the CAC is recognized immediately, the accounting makes it look as if the company's margins decreased, when they are increasing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have been wary of this dynamic, commenting that although it makes sense, it is also hard to determine the actual profitability of the new membership business. This quarter has not changed the situation, but it has built up more data, which makes me more confident that the economics of the business are not very good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, the company says that the new users, after being acquired, should be accretive to earnings (the cost of acquiring has already been expensed). If that were the case, we should either see a higher level of growth (because more is being invested) or a higher level of profitability. We found none of them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We can estimate the number of users by looking at membership revenues per quarter and dividing by $10 ($40 a year for Travelzoo membership). It is an approximation, but I think it works. Based on that, the company has added 60 thousand net new members per quarter since <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"4q24\" htloopnumber=\"569611403\">4Q24</em>. This implies the pace of growth has not increased. Therefore, the profitability should have increased QoQ, because older members are not expensed as CAC. And yet, profitability has worsened.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, the cash change in deferred revenues does not show that level of improvement in users. If a user pays $40 upfront, and $10 is recognized as new revenue in the quarter (actually less than that because the member might join after the quarter starts), then deferred revenues should grow by about $30 by the amount of net new members. However, deferred revenues on the <a href=\"https://s201.q4cdn.com/362028750/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/EX-99-1-09-30-2025.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://s201.q4cdn.com/362028750/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/EX-99-1-09-30-2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">release</a> grow by only $643 thousand, or 20 thousand members, not 60 thousand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this line, the company says that although it affects GAAP earnings (because of accrual recognition), it should not affect cash flows, because users pay upfront. However, we see that the CFO, before working capital remains low, at about $640 thousand for the quarter ($1.3 million when adding deferred revenues),</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third, the company's CAC might be higher than reported when considering all factors involved. The company reports a CAC of $40 per user (basically the same cost as a year of membership fee revenues). With 60k net new adds, the cost should have been $2.4 million. However, YoY S&amp;M costs increased $4 million, and are also higher sequentially. This is much closer to actual GAAP profitability for the quarter ($500 thousand) than to the profitability a year ago ($4 million). This implies the economics are not only GAAP but also cash.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the same line, CoGS increased by another $2 million. The company has commented in the last call and in previous ones that the higher CoGS comes from offering better deals to members, which reduces the margins on the trips sold. That should be part of CAC, as it reduces gross profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What I worry about are <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"two\" htloopnumber=\"569611403\">two</em> factors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, the net additions require many more gross additions, because many users simply cancel, and therefore the actual CAC per net user is higher (explaining the increase in S&amp;M expenses, both annually and sequentially).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, the business has extremely low margins, because the (reported) CAC is the same as the membership fee, and the revenues from sales of packages are low margin because they are offering cheap deals to justify the membership (therefore, gross margins fall).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">None of the comments above implies an accusation about any wrongdoing from management or misreporting. Rather, these are speculations about the potential economics of the new businesses, which will become more evident as time passes by.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Repurchases Continue As Owners Sell</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I have commented in previous articles, it is strange that the company continues to repurchase shares while the owners sell. In the last quarter, the company repurchased about $1.5 million in shares, and almost $13 million for the YTD.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the last <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"three\" htloopnumber=\"569611403\">three</em> months, the largest shareholder of the company, <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tzoo/insider-activity\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tzoo/insider-activity\" target=\"_blank\">Azzurro Capital, sold</a> about 220 thousand shares, which at a current price of $8 imply ~$1.75 million, or more than the company purchased itself. Over the last <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"twelve\" htloopnumber=\"569611403\">twelve</em> months, the largest shareholder, which is controlled by the company's founder (also brother of the current CEO, see <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/18385703\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/18385703\" target=\"_blank\">proxy</a>), has sold almost 950 thousand shares, or almost $15 million if we consider an average price over the year of about $15 per share.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Is Not Attractive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have maintained a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/quipus-capital/analysis?ticker=tzoo\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/quipus-capital/analysis?ticker=tzoo\" target=\"_blank\">fairly consistent</a> Hold rating on TZOO, especially since the company announced the changes to its business model. At this point, the company trades at one of the lowest valuations in the past <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"two\" htloopnumber=\"569611403\">two</em> years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, I do not believe it is attractive yet. The data from the past quarters fails to convince me that the new membership model is attractive economically. Rather, I believe the economics are subpar.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to this, the largest shareholder is selling large quantities of stock, which does not bode well for the prospects of the business, even if other reasons could be behind the selling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, the prospects macroeconomically are not fantastic, with fears that consumer discretionary spending (of which travel is an important category) will decrease as the economy manages the impact of tariffs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financially, Travelzoo has rarely generated a net income above $10 million, which would remain fair for a valuation like the current one, of about $95/100 million. The time when the business made that much money was related to the post-COVID travel boom, and is unlikely to repeat soon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to this, the company operates simply at operational breakeven. According to management, this is all because of growth investments, but I have reasons to believe the economics of the business are just worse than they were before.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For these reasons, I believe the current price is not attractive, and therefore maintain a Hold rating on Travelzoo.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

The S&amp;P has continued on its strong trajectory, carried by positive AI sentiment, up nearly 41% over the same period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/54869375-1761597835560265_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2064\" data-height=\"860\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/54869375-1761597835560265_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"267\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/54869375-1761597835560265_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/54869375-1761597835560265_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/54869375-1761597835560265_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/54869375-1761597835560265_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/54869375-1761597835560265_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/54869375-1761597835560265_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/54869375-1761597835560265_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/54869375-1761597835560265_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, their share price performance is not that surprising since I warned readers that the expected drop in occupancy as well as negative sentiment surrounding interest rates could result in further volatility. But Prologis' balance sheet, dividend, and upside potential to their price target of $150 made them attractive long-term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI Beneficiary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Prologis reported their <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830199-prologis-inc-pld-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q3 earnings</a> earlier this month and managed to beat on both their top and bottom lines. As a result, the share price rallied and allowed management to raise full-year guidance across the board.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Core FFO amounted to $1.49, a beat by $0.05, and revenue to $2.21 billion, besting estimates by $180 million. While this is nothing to get overly excited about, Prologis' rally was more about the guidance raise than the beat on earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, the market likely reacted positively to the record quarter in leasing. This amounted to 62 million square feet. They also continued expanding power capacity for data center buildouts. In Q3, PLD moved an additional 1.5 gigawatts to advanced stages, bringing the total to 5.2 gigawatts total.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This made the REIT one of the largest owners of utility-fed power readily available for data centers. They also signed an additional 9 build-to-suits in the quarter, bringing the total to 21 for roughly $1.6 billion of total investment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Their energy business also delivered 28 megawatts of solar generation and storage, bringing their current capacity to 825 megawatts. This brought the REIT closer to their 1-gigawatt expectation by the end of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, from a performance standpoint, PLD looks poised for future growth and to be a benefactor of the world's growing AI infrastructure. Unlike peer Rexford Industrial (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/REXR\" title=\"Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc.\">REXR</a>), which is solely concentrated in Southern California, PLD has properties globally in 20 countries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609929327921016_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1220\" data-height=\"771\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609929327921016_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" width=\"640\" height=\"404\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609929327921016_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609929327921016_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609929327921016_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609929327921016_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609929327921016_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609929327921016_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609929327921016_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609929327921016_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>PLD fact sheet</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">PLD's NOI growth on an effective and cash basis was solid. Although, this was lower than the previous year's quarter at <strong>3.9%</strong> and <strong>5.2%,</strong> respectively. This declined from <strong>6.2%</strong> and<strong> 7.2%</strong> in Q3'24. And was likely due to continued softness and rent declines, particularly in their SoCal markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Peer Rexford Industrial managed to see higher NOI growth on a cash basis at <strong>6%</strong> in their Q3. On a net effective basis, this was lower at<strong> 2.9%</strong>. But REXR managed to see growth in both from the prior year's <strong>2.6%</strong> and <strong>5.3%,</strong> respectively.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strong Guidance Raise</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As previously mentioned, Prologis' strong Q3 allowed management to raise their full-year guidance. Core FFO is now expected in a range of $5.78 - $5.81. This represents a growth rate of <strong>4.4%</strong> from 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The growth rate is lower than the high single-digit to double-digit growth Prologis and other industrial REITs are used to seeing. This was also lower than the <strong>8.4%</strong> growth they saw from 2023, an obvious sign of macro uncertainty and supply &amp; demand headwinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NOI growth is now expected to be between 4.25% and 4.75% on a net-effective basis and 4.75% and 5.25% on a cash basis. The REIT also raised development and disposition guidance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend &amp; Balance Sheet</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since I last covered Prologis, the REIT raised its dividend from $0.96 to $1.01, continuing its solid streak of paid dividends. Additionally, dividends were covered by AFFO despite the slight dip from 2023 to 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the payout ratio is high, around <strong>91%</strong> currently, I don't expect PLD to cut its dividend any time soon. So, the 3+ yield is likely safe for the foreseeable future. But this is something investors should keep a close eye on, as I prefer REITs with more conservative payout ratios around 70%–75%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609936065088074_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1427\" data-height=\"423\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609936065088074_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" width=\"640\" height=\"190\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609936065088074_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609936065088074_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609936065088074_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609936065088074_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609936065088074_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609936065088074_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609936065088074_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609936065088074_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>PLD supplemental</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a positive note, PLD has additional sources of capital and an A-rated balance sheet, giving them plenty of flexibility for dividend sustainability.

Moreover, due to the likelihood of seeing continued softness in their markets, I don't expect significant upside from current levels, at least for the near to medium term. However, I do think they remain attractive over the longer term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For comparison, PLD's multiple was higher than both of its peers', Rexford Industrial and EastGroup Properties (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EGP\" title=\"EastGroup Properties, Inc.\">EGP</a>). REXR's forward P/FFO multiple was <strong>17.72x,</strong> while EGP, my favorite amongst the peer group, sits at <strong>19.98x.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to <span></span>FAST Graphs, Prologis presents some upside from the current price of $127 to their price target of $135 by the end of 2027. For investors looking to buy, I would look for any share price weakness, preferably around $110 or below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609941721268559_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2724\" data-height=\"1201\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609941721268559_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" width=\"640\" height=\"282\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609941721268559_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609941721268559_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609941721268559_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609941721268559_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609941721268559_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609941721268559_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609941721268559_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/20/54869375-17609941721268559_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>FAST Graphs</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And this is due to continued headwinds because of overall market declines, SoCal softness, and macro uncertainty.

As I explained in my recent <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831017-megi-collect-high-yield-income-from-global-utilities-and-infrastructure\">review of NYLI CBRE Global Infrastructure Megatrends Term Fund (MEGI</a>), lower rates increase the performance of the utility holdings by introducing capital gains in addition to lowering the cost of capital. Utility companies may experience benefits from lower rates but could also run into difficulties if there is a corresponding economic downturn, as explained in this <a href=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/interest-rate-cut-stocks\" rel=\"nofollow\">US News report</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>\"Utilities are capital intensive with high debt burdens. A reduction in interest rates is likely to benefit margins.\" Still, Cluver cautions, \"Energy and materials both have high economic growth sensitivity and low interest rate sensitivity. As such, should economic growth concerns prompt a rapid reduction in yields, these sectors may struggle.\"</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Like MEGI, the abrdn Global Infrastructure Income Fund (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASGI\" title=\"abrdn Global Infrastructure Income Fund\">ASGI</a></span>) is a relatively young CEF (with an inception date of July 2020) that offers high-yield income and the potential for capital appreciation from holdings in global utilities and related equities. Aberdeen makes it clear, however, that ASGI is focused on delivering high current income as its primary investment objective (i.e., capital appreciation is secondary), as explained on the fact sheet.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The Fund's investment objective is to seek to provide a high level of total return with an emphasis on current income.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In March 2024 I wrote about ASGI and rated the fund a <strong>Buy</strong> at that time, suggesting that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4678422-abrdn-global-infrastructure-income-fund-global-infrastructure-finds-sweet-spot-2024\">global infrastructure was in its sweet spot</a>. These were the summary bullet points from that article:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em>The global infrastructure sector is likely to see a shift in sentiment in 2024 after a poor performance in 2023.</em></li> <li><em>Trillions of dollars in infrastructure investments are expected globally over the coming decade.</em></li> <li><em>Emerging trends of decarbonization, digitalization, and deconsolidation/deglobalization are expected to further stimulate infrastructure spending, creating investment opportunities.</em></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, ASGI delivered a total return of nearly 45% since that article was published. Today, as ASGI has gone up in price over the past year, the discount has also vanished. At the current price and yield, I rate ASGI a <strong>Hold</strong>. This was what I wrote a year and a half ago when rates were still high.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>As investors digest the latest news and economic reports, the fund price rises and falls based on the latest interpretation of what will happen to interest rates. For investors with a long-term view, those daily price gyrations offer potential buying opportunities when the price drops for no other reason than market sentiment.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now that rates have been cut twice in the past few months, investors have bid up the price of ASGI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945854977934_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1037\" data-height=\"786\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945854977934_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ASGI chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"485\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945854977934_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945854977934_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945854977934_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945854977934_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945854977934_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945854977934_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945854977934_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945854977934_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at an overview chart from CEFConnect, we can see that ASGI went from a rather large discount of almost -12% at the lowest point to a very small discount now, with a sideways trending NAV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945855642836_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1535\" data-height=\"881\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945855642836_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"discount price chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"367\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945855642836_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945855642836_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945855642836_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945855642836_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945855642836_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945855642836_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945855642836_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/329016-17617945855642836_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>CEFConnect</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Income investors will be interested in the 12% distribution that has averaged close to $0.20 monthly since May 2024.

In September 2024, the fund completed the <a href=\"https://www.aberdeeninvestments.com/docs?documentId=AA-220924-183309-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">reorganization</a> with the Macquarie/First Trust Global Infrastructure/Utilities Dividend &amp; Income Fund.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Most recently, the fund <a href=\"https://www.aberdeeninvestments.com/docs?documentId=AA-121025-199631-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">completed the reorganization</a> with the ABRDN JAPAN EQUITY FUND, INC.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>In the reorganization, common shareholders of JEQ received an amount of ASGI common shares with a net asset value equal to the aggregate net asset value of their holdings of JEQ common shares, as determined at the close of regular business on October 10, 2025.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund managers appear to be preparing for future uncertainty and continued volatility. In the <a href=\"https://www.aberdeeninvestments.com/docs?editionId=9e0060c3-26b1-493f-b66b-9b492bc1d074\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q3 2025 fund commentary</a>, the fund’s outlook and strategy are outlined, and it makes a compelling case for strong future returns due to Fed easing.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>With the Fed moving towards an easing cycle, this should be positive for infrastructure valuations, although this is not always reflected immediately, particularly given investors’ exuberance for all things related to artificial intelligence. An interesting observation – rather than an outlook – and perhaps somewhat linked to the Fed’s easing, is the performance of renewables over the past couple of months. After hitting their nadir due to the effective repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act by the Trump administration, we have seen renewed interest in the sector, as rising power prices driven by data centre demand mean returns still look attractive even without the tax credits.</p> <p>Looking beyond these near-term market fluctuations, infrastructure continues to stand out as an attractive investment opportunity, offering defensive characteristics and long-term value in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. We also believe infrastructure provides a compelling way to navigate volatility while benefiting from essential, irreplaceable assets. Amid the focus on near-term trends, it is important not to lose sight of the long-term structural drivers we see in infrastructure – namely the energy transition, digital acceleration, ageing infrastructure and increasing urbanisation.</p> </blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks: Valuation and Market Sentiment Drive Short-Term Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As an income investor, I am mostly concerned with the monthly distribution.

The bigger issue in my mind is that the price has risen to the point of eliminating any margin of safety with respect to the discount to NAV. As the fund trades closer to the NAV and the prices of underlying holdings may experience some pricing pressure in a market correction, I would not be surprised to see ASGI sell off if we see a broader market downturn.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conversely, the news of lower rates could act to propel utilities even higher, in which case ASGI stands to benefit. I would not be a seller of ASGI at current prices, but I would not be a buyer here either. Existing shareholders may want to ride out any short-term price volatility and continue collecting the 12% distribution. For those looking to start a position, I suggest waiting for a better entry point in the coming months.</p>",
