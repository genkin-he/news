The issue is, when we look under the hood, Carvana is supporting more and more of their business model with marking up and reselling used car loans they self originate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In recent weeks, multiple subprime used car lenders have gone bankrupt here in the U.S. While I don’t think Carvana is heading towards bankruptcy, I do believe there's a huge risk: any further tightening of the used car loan market will mean Carvana could see one of its two sources of capital dry up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that more than 100% of Carvana’s net income this year has come from gains on the sale of used car loans (to Wall Street and their partner, Ally Bank), I think there is significant net income risk going forward if the credit markets were to freeze.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For this reason, shares are double downgraded from a Strong Buy to a Hold.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why I’m Doing Follow-Up Coverage</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the biggest reasons why I am choosing to do <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4770885-carvana-well-positioned-to-dominate-amazon\">follow-up coverage</a> on Carvana now is because the Fed has cut interest rates <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/fed-rate-cut-credit-cards-mortgages-savings.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">25 bps</a> to 3.75%-4.00%. Post-earnings, this would normally be a game changer. However, I think there is a fundamental weakness underneath.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lower borrowing costs typically directly stimulate auto financing, and because Carvana is a company that is heavily involved with e-commerce and auto loans, it normally would be able to capitalize greatly on the lower-rate environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we’ve seen historically, even a 100 bps decline in loan rates has lifted auto sales growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, in this case defaults are rising. I think Carvana is uniquely exposed to this. This could be really catastrophic. Post-earnings, this is why I am doing follow-up coverage.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 Review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the surface, Q3 looked <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4770885-carvana-well-positioned-to-dominate-amazon\">solid</a>. Carvana reported an EPS of $1.89/share, which beat estimates by $0.52. Revenues came in at $5.65 billion, which marked year over-year growth of 54.50% and beat estimates by $550 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We have to dig deeper to look at loan sales to really understand what drove the quarter, however.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As Jenkins, Carvana’s CFO, stated on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835180-carvana-co-cvna-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Non-GAAP other GPU increased by $63. This change was primarily driven by improvements in the cost of funds and higher finance and VSC attach rates, partially offset by higher-than-normalized loan sales relative to originations in Q3 2024.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’ll get into why this is important later, but loan sales are a huge driver for Carvana’s profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we look at the rest of the gross profit per vehicle, we can see that overall gross profit declined for their vehicles they sold:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Non-GAAP retail GPU decreased by $77, primarily driven by higher retail depreciation rates. Non-GAAP wholesale GPU decreased by $168, primarily driven by higher wholesale depreciation rates and retail units sold growth outpacing ADESA marketplace growth -Q3 Earnings Call.</p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Defaults Are Rising, Carvana Is Exposed</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To understand why Carvana is so exposed to marking up loans, we have to look at their most recent 10Q (filed this week).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/18873474\">10Q</a>, if we look at how much gain (profit) Carvana booked in Q3, we can see that more than 100% of the net profits the company earned in Q3 were driven from their gain of sale on their subprime loans:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The total gain related to finance receivables sold to financing partners and pursuant to securitization transactions was $331 million and $224 million during the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $878 million and $541 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, which is included in other sales and revenues in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations -10Q.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, the company booked $331 million in gains on loans in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Their Q3 net income? <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVNA/income-statement\">$151 million</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These gains on loans are financed by Carvana selling their loans to two main groups: Ally Bank, and private pools of auto loans.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Increasingly, Ally Bank is a bigger chunk of the loan purchasing volume:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>During the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company sold $1.2 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively, in principal balances of finance receivables under the Ally MPSA. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company sold $3.2 billion and $2.15 billion, respectively, in principal balances of finance receivables under the Ally MPSA, and had $2.0 billion of unused capacity as of September 30, 2025 -10Q.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While this agreement with Ally Bank does not end until Q3 2026, there’s still risk here. Ally Bank is trusting that these pools of loans that Carvana is issuing don’t exhibit disproportionate levels of defaults. I think the risk here is that as the economy slows down (and as peers have shown), defaults are rising.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If Carvana were to lose access to their $6 billion purchase facility from Ally Bank, this could have a major impact on their long-run net income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recent subprime lender <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/subprime-lender-primalend-capital-partners-files-bankruptcy-protection-2025-10-22/\" rel=\"nofollow\">bankruptcies</a> are pushing Wall Street to more closely examine their books of subprime loans.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the past, I thought Carvana’s valuation had some upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, since I first rated the company a Strong Buy in September of 2024, shares have jumped over 125% as their revenues have picked up and consumers purchased more used cars from them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58772689-1761916828442702.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Carvana Performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"550\" height=\"864\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58772689-1761916828442702.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58772689-1761916828442702.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58772689-1761916828442702.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58772689-1761916828442702.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58772689-1761916828442702.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58772689-1761916828442702.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58772689-1761916828442702.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58772689-1761916828442702.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Carvana Performance <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I have mentioned before, I think their service is incredible. That doesn’t mean they’re a high-quality stock anymore, however.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I first rated the company a Strong Buy, I thought shares had <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4719532-carvana-surprising-profits-turnaround-is-accelerating-rating-upgrade\">28% upside</a>. The 128% return from there blew away my expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, the valuation feels a little rich.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, the company’s non-GAAP forward P/E is now <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVNA/valuation/metrics\">56.46</a>, which is 235.87% above the sector median of 16.81.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the price-to-sales front, shares now trade at a 129.22% premium to the sector median. Keep in mind that when I originally rated the company a Strong Buy back in September of 2024, the price-to-sales multiple was at a 56% premium to the sector median.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In essence, the company’s valuation premium has more than doubled over the last year or so. This now feels extended to me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the past, when I rated the stock a Strong Buy, I had an idea what the fair value of shares was.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now that I think shares are a Hold, I’m no longer sure what the fair value of shares are.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bull Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What’s interesting to me about this Fed interest rate cut this week is that (typically) in a lower-rate environment, affordability boosts demand. As of late, payments have become stretched. New car buyers are paying an average of about <a href=\"https://www.coxautoinc.com/insights-hub/may-2025-vai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">$756</a> per month for their vehicles, with one in five buyers paying more than <a href=\"https://www.edmunds.com/industry/press/a-record-1-in-5-new-car-shoppers-committed-to-a-1000-monthly-payment-in-q2-2025-according-to-edmunds.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">$1,000</a> per month. Rate relief should allow for Carvana to benefit disproportionately.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The problem? <a href=\"https://www.cbtnews.com/carguru-reports-affordability-strains-persist-as-auto-sales-hold-steady-across-segments/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Car sales</a> in September and earlier this month have shown signs that used car prices continue to be an issue even as the Fed has cut interest rates and prices have stabilized. Cars are just too expensive now, even if interest rates are falling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For Carvana, this presents another risk: Carvana could be stuck with tons of overpriced inventory. This was one of the major drivers that caused shares to drop significantly from 2021 until early 2023. There’s a risk that inventory could get mismatched with prices again.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To be clear, Carvana has huge potential with their online dealer business model. I still believe the company can have Amazon-like disruption potential for traditional brick-and-mortar used car dealers. But, this doesn’t mean the business model will be free of growing pains (we already are seeing this).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Carvana’s profits this year appear basically entirely supported by the gain on the sale of used car loans. This works great when the used car loan market is liquid and functional. Recent subprime lender bankruptcies remind us that this market can freeze up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we see the market freeze up, it's not unreasonable to assume that Carvana’s sources of capital to issue loans could dry up as well. This could be extremely challenging for their business.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With this, shares are now a Hold, downgraded from a Strong Buy.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XYL\" title=\"Xylem Inc.\">XYL</a></span>) was a buy rating because of the strong secular tailwinds that it benefits from. Also, the Evoqua integration and PFAS funding pipeline could<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> be a major growth catalyst. My recommendation for XYL remains a buy rating, as it continues to deliver solid performance. In the Q3 2025 results, we can basically confirm that the 80/20 transformation strategy is working given the strong margins, growth, and EPS growth. With these secular tailwinds, strong execution, and order visibility, it all points to solid earnings growth ahead.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">3Q25 Results Update</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">XYL's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20281489-xylem-reports-third-quarter-2025-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A1\">Q3 2025 results</a> really proved my thesis right and were a textbook beat-and-raise quarter. Total revenue reached $2.3 billion, up 7% y/y on an organic basis, and importantly, growth was driven by all four segments. The outperformers were Measurement and Control Solutions (MCS), which grew 11% organically, and Water Solutions and Services (WSS), which grew 10% y/y. This flowed directly to margin expansion, driving adj. EBITDA margin to a record of 23.2%, up by 200 bps y/y. This strong margin, then, flowed through to drive adj. EPS up 23% y/y to $1.37.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The forward outlook also seems very positive, as management noted the business was “accelerating,” and the upward revision in guidance instilled confidence. Specifically, XYL raised its FY2025 revenue guide to ~$9 billion and also raised its profit targets. Adj. EBITDA margin is now guided to 22% to 22.3%, up sharply from the previous 21.3%–21.8% range, and the FY2025 adj. EPS guide was raised to $5.03–$5.08 versus the previous $4.70 to $4.85 range. At the midpoint, that implies a 6% lift.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 80/20 Transformation Is Working</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 80/20 transformation that I talked about deeply previously has worked out really well, as expected. For those that did not follow my coverage, this 80/20 idea was simple but powerful. Basically, it is to focus resources on the top 20% of products and customers that drive profit and simplify or exit everything else. We know this is working because management explicitly noted the record-high margins were due to this very transformation. Even if you don’t believe management’s word, you can see it clearly in the legacy segments. Water Infrastructure delivered a very impressive 400 bps y/y expansion in adj. EBITDA margin, reaching 24.4%, while Applied Water, which was once a drag on profitability, improved by 310 bps y/y to 21.7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The transformation efforts go beyond just fixing legacy segments’ margins. The same transformation impact is playing out in portfolio optimization. The case in point is XYL’s divestiture of its international water and heat metering (IWHM) business, which is a deal that, in my view, perfectly illustrates this transformation in action. The IWHM business generated ~$250 million in 2024 revenue, but the adj. EBITDA margin was &lt;10%, which means this is a drag on XYL’s overall margin. I view this exit favorably, as it achieves two things: (1) it structurally improves margin (due to mix impact), and (2) it allows XYL to allocate resources to its most profitable growth arena, which is the North American smart metering (AMI) market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My view is that the North American market is where XYL has a right to win. In North America, XYL benefits from its proprietary Sensus FlexNet technology, which I think is a major competitive advantage. Unlike mesh networks that pass data from meter to meter, FlexNet is a private, point-to-multipoint network that operates on FCC-licensed radio frequency spectrum. Now, where it works in favor of XYL is that it owns this private spectrum. Owning this private network enables XYL to offer reliable long-distance data transmission that is secure. This means that XYL can reach nodes in the network (i.e., the meters) in remote and difficult locations (like in basements) far more effectively than competitors. And XYL can offer this while requiring less infrastructure, which lowers the total cost of ownership (TCO) for the utility customer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe this edge gives XYL the right to capitalize on the ongoing replacement demand tailwind more than peers. As background info, the North American installed base of <a href=\"https://media.berginsight.com/2025/06/05145927/bi-smartwater4-ps.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">water meters is old</a>, with many of them already past their useful life and needing to be replaced soon. Replacing is one demand driver, but the bigger driver is the type of replacement. Since the adoption of two-way AMI technology is still only at <a href=\"https://media.berginsight.com/2025/06/05145927/bi-smartwater4-ps.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">~40% penetration</a>, this means the majority of the market is still operating on the older, one-way meters. To explain it simply, the old one-way meter is just a \"drive-by\" system that utilities can only “collect” data from but cannot “ask” the meter questions. The new two-way AMI technology makes this possible. Utility customers can “ask” the meter on-demand for a real-time read, and the meter can respond with the right information. Think about the implication of this for a few seconds. It basically makes it possible for the utility customer to constantly monitor for leaks, pressure problems, or, at the very least, provide detailed usage data for analysis purposes.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">MCS Order Strength De-Risks 2026 Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While total company orders declined 2% y/y organically, it wasn’t due to any structural weakness. It was simply due to very tough comps and softness in China. If you look beneath the headline numbers, you will find that the MCS (this is the segment that has the high-growth smart metering and AMI platforms in it) did extremely well. Orders managed to grow 11% y/y organically in Q3, despite the tough comps, which reflects the strong underlying demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we lapse this tough comps period, FY2026 growth should be a lot more amazing. There is good visibility to this happening, as the MCS segment still sits on a healthy $1.5 billion backlog. Management was confident that the book-to-bill ratio will climb back to &gt;1x in Q4 as major water-meter projects convert into firm orders. If that is true, growth is going to accelerate, and that supports the case for MCS to reach high-single-digit growth in 2026. Margins should also inflect as revenue ramps up because of mix impact. The margin expansion in Q3 was quite muted (just 60 bps y/y) because of lower-margin energy projects. Management noted that the core water business is performing at or above peer-level margins. The closest public peer to XYL is Badger Meter (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BMI\" title=\"Badger Meter, Inc.\">BMI</a>), which has an operating margin of ~20% in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that the &lt;10%-margin international business is being sold, we should see the true earnings power of this segment soon.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59932035-17618374876925159_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"872\" data-height=\"381\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59932035-17618374876925159_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A screenshot of a graph AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"280\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59932035-17618374876925159_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59932035-17618374876925159_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59932035-17618374876925159_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59932035-17618374876925159_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59932035-17618374876925159_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59932035-17618374876925159_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59932035-17618374876925159_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59932035-17618374876925159_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Redfox Capital Ideas</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While XYL’s share price has risen, I still see a nice one-year 15% upside. Given the success with the 80/20 transformation, divestiture, and growth momentum, I upgrade my revenue growth assumption to 7% (high single digits) vs. mid-single digits previously. Management revised margin guidance (work backwards using adj. EPS guide * shares outstanding) also showed me that margin can inflect faster than I thought. As such, I upgraded my margin outlook to closer to mid-teens. All these upgrades justify XYL trading higher than what I expected previously (27x), which the market seems to agree with as well since XYL now trades at 29x. At 29x, I get to a share price target of ~$176.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main risk is the slowdown in China, which was a 2% headwind to total company orders. This weakness, coupled with delays in UK funding cycles, ultimately drove a 2% y/y organic order decline. The problem is these are largely outside of XYL's control, and there is no guarantee that they will not get worse. If it does, overall organic orders could decline much further, and that could drag down performance again. Even with the $5 billion backlog that provides solid visibility, any delay in converting these large projects could create a temporary drag (or what one would term as an “air pocket”) in the quarterly results.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I maintain a buy rating for XYL. The strong Q3 performance, accelerating MCS orders, and solid progress with the 80/20 execution give a lot of confidence that revenue can grow and margin can expand. Overall, I still see upside, and the share price should reflect this as the market continues to recognize XYL’s improving fundamentals.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PGY\" title=\"Pagaya Technologies Ltd.\">PGY</a></span>) has cratered 15% on fears over the health of the US credit market following the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/first-brands-tricolor-collapses-invite-more-scrutiny-wall-street-sees-robust-2025-10-14/\" rel=\"noopener\">bankruptcies</a> of Tricolor and First Brands. Despite this, I believe<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the bullish thesis on Pagaya remains intact, especially ahead of its upcoming Q3 earnings.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that in mind, several key Pagaya partners reported their Q3 earnings results recently, showing broader signs of strong loan demand and improving credit quality. This suggests that Pagaya may be on track to beat analysts’ estimates and raise its full-year outlook when it reports its Q3 earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, Pagaya’s partners’ results suggest that the credit environment in the US is stable and improving. This could be a sign of the US heading into a strong credit cycle over the coming quarters, especially with default rates stabilizing and beginning a gradual descent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These signs of an improving credit environment could be supported by Barclays’ (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BCS\" title=\"Barclays PLC\">BCS</a>) latest expansion in the US personal lending market through its acquisition of Pagaya’s partner Best Egg, showcasing the attractiveness of the US credit market at the moment. Furthermore, Pagaya’s latest point of sale (POS) ABS transaction highlights the current favorable credit environment, in my opinion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The transaction came with better funding terms, despite carrying riskier loans compared to the prior transaction, highlighting investors’ higher risk appetite and their growing confidence in Pagaya’s underwriting. In light of these factors, I’m reiterating my strong buy rating for Pagaya and raising my price target to $70, implying 168% upside from current levels.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 Preview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pagaya is set to <a href=\"https://investor.pagaya.com/news-releases/news-release-details/pagaya-announces-timing-third-quarter-2025-earnings-release\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a> its Q3 earnings results on November 10th in pre-market, with analysts <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PGY/earnings\">estimating</a> the company to report revenues of $338.86 million and a GAAP EPS of $0.16. That said, I expect Pagaya could be on track for another beat and raise quarter in light of latest results from 3 of its key <a href=\"https://pagaya.com/about-us\" rel=\"nofollow\">partners</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of Pagaya’s key partners is SoFi (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SOFI\" title=\"SoFi Technologies, Inc.\">SOFI</a>), which has recently <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20281582-sofi-reports-third-quarter-2025-with-record-net-revenue-of-962-million-record-member-and#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A2\">reported</a> impressive Q3 earnings driven by strong loan demand. During Q3, SoFi reported record loan originations of <a href=\"https://s27.q4cdn.com/749715820/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/3Q25-SoFi-Earnings-Presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">$9.9 billion</a>, of which $3.4 billion were originated from its loan platform business, an all-time high. The latter fact is the most direct positive to Pagaya, in my opinion, since loans originated under SoFi’s loan platform business are the loans that are referred to Pagaya to give a second look using its AI platform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, these record originations are likely to reflect on Pagaya’s network volume in Q3. Moreover, SoFi reported a net charge-off rate of 2.60% in Q3, down from 2.83% sequentially and 3.52% in the prior year. This implies a healthy personal loan borrower pool, as the improvement came along with higher loan volumes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another key Pagaya partner is US Bancorp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USB\" title=\"U.S. Bancorp\">USB</a>), which also <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20268280-u-s-bancorp-reports-third-quarter-2025-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A5\">reported</a> solid Q3 earnings. During the quarter, the bank reported an average loan balance of <a href=\"https://s203.q4cdn.com/711684571/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Earnings-Call-Presentation-3Q25.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">$379.2 billion</a>, representing growth rates of 1.4% YoY and 0.2% sequentially. The strong indicator for Pagaya’s upcoming earnings is that US Bank’s commercial loans, where consumer loans represented 27.3%, grew 9.5% YoY and 1.4% QoQ. This shows that US Bank is actively growing its consumer segment, a sign of an increased lending appetite, which could be a strong driver for Pagaya’s network volume when it reports Q3 earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In similar fashion to SoFi, US Bank also saw an improving credit quality in Q3, as its net charge-off rate was 0.56%, 3 bps lower QoQ and 4 bps lower YoY. At the same time, the bank’s provision for credit losses represented 2.06% of its average loan balance, down from 2.07% and 2.12% in the prior quarter and year, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">US Bank’s growing loan balance combined with better credit quality suggests that the bank is confident in the near-term credit outlook, which points to a healthy lending environment, in my opinion. The improving credit quality at US Bank could also serve as a tailwind for Pagaya's network volume in the coming quarters, potentially supporting the case for a guidance raise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shifting to auto loans, a segment Pagaya is rapidly expanding into, the company’s key partner in this segment, Ally Financial (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALLY\" title=\"Ally Financial Inc.\">ALLY</a>), also <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20270141-ally-financial-reports-third-quarter-2025-financial-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A3\">reported</a> strong Q3 earnings. During the quarter, Ally reported an all-time record <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/753234398/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Ally-3Q-2025-Earnings-Presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">4 million</a> applications for auto loans, with originations growing 25% YoY to $11.7 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ally’s record application volume is a significant positive for Pagaya, in my opinion, since it could provide it with a significant funnel of potential loans to analyze through its platform, which is a tailwind to network volume. With that in mind, 42% of Ally’s originations during Q3 were to its S-tier members, meaning that the majority of its originations came from lower tier borrowers. These lower quality borrowers include the higher risk borrowers that are usually given a second look through Pagaya’s platform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for credit quality, Ally reported a $230 million YoY reduction in its provision for credit losses during Q3. In my opinion, this could be a major sign of a better credit environment, as Ally expects better performance in its newer loan cohorts. In this way, Ally could increase its risk appetite in the coming quarters by offering loans to riskier borrower pools, which could drive additional network volume for Pagaya.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Improving Credit Environment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aside from the company’s potential Q3 earnings beat, the longer-term credit environment appears to be trending favorably for Pagaya’s business, in my opinion. According to data from <a href=\"https://www.apolloacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/101925-Charts_v2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apollo</a>, US speculative grade default rates for loans appear to be stabilizing and in the process of falling from their peak, suggesting that the credit cycle is improving.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732954166925_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1256\" data-height=\"707\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732954166925_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"US speculative grade default rates\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732954166925_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732954166925_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732954166925_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732954166925_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732954166925_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732954166925_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732954166925_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732954166925_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Apollo </span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This improving backdrop could be a major tailwind for Pagaya, as an improving credit outlook supports favorable funding terms for Pagaya, as its loans could be perceived as of lower risk. This has actually occurred in Pagaya’s latest POS ABS transaction, <a href=\"https://www.kbra.com/publications/wMmnzKws/kbra-assigns-preliminary-ratings-to-pagaya-point-of-sale-holdings-grantor-trust-2025-2-and-pagaya-point-of-sale-holdings-trust-2025-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">POSH 2025-2</a>, which is expected to close on November 7th.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The new ABS deal is for $300 million of loans backed by Klarna (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KLAR\" title=\"Klarna Group plc\">KLAR</a>) loan flow and includes better funding terms for Pagaya compared to its prior <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4789637-pagaya-a-deep-dive-into-its-untapped-value-proposition\">POSH 2025-1</a> ABS transaction, despite carrying a riskier loan pool. For starters, KBRA has a cumulative net loss expectation of <a href=\"https://www.kbra.com/publications/vbSVBLMx/pagaya-point-of-sale-holding-grantor-trust-2025-2-and-pagaya-point-of-sale-holding-trust-2025-2-pre-sale-report?format=file\" rel=\"nofollow\">6.79%</a> for this transaction compared to 5.01% in the company’s inaugural POS ABS transaction, as Class A notes are lower while other classes are higher in balance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the riskier loan pool, the latest transaction has a larger excess spread compared to the prior transaction at 24.02% compared to 22.43%. The higher excess spread was driven by a higher collateral interest rate at 31% compared to 30%, indicating that the profitability of these loans is greater than the previous pool. Moreover, the transaction has a lower coupon rate at 5.73% compared to 6.32%, reflecting strong investor demand despite the riskier loan pool and highlights investors’ growing trust in Pagaya’s underwriting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732950022345_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"895\" data-height=\"567\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" data-lt-tmp-id=\"lt-77221\" spellcheck=\"false\" data-gramm=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732950022345_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"PGY stock POSH 2025-2 ABS transaction terms\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732950022345_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732950022345_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732950022345_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732950022345_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732950022345_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732950022345_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732950022345_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732950022345_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>KBRA POSH 2025-2 Pre-Sale Report</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, another sign of confidence in the health of the US credit environment and Pagaya’s own business model could be Barclays’ latest $800 million <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/barclays-buy-us-personal-loan-firm-best-egg-800-million-2025-10-28/\" rel=\"nofollow\">acquisition</a> of Pagaya’s partner Best Egg to expand its US personal banking business. According to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47782937-39d2-42a5-b684-2099a8362e2c\" rel=\"nofollow\">Financial Times</a>, Barclays expects this acquisition to provide it with access to more loans to bundle and sell them in ABS transactions, the same market Pagaya has been leading over the past few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, Barclays’ venture into this market validates Pagaya’s asset-light approach and securitization model, which indicates that the company’s ABS transactions are likely to remain a strong growth driver over the coming years. At the same time, since Best Egg is already a Pagaya partner, this acquisition could provide Pagaya with an avenue to expand its footprint in new global markets through Barclays. While the company remains focused on serving the US market, a global expansion could serve as a new growth lever in case of a worsening credit cycle in the future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At its current share price of $26, Pagaya has a market cap of $2 billion, which translates to an EV of $2.48 billion after netting its $485.6 million in net debt. This means that the stock is trading at an EV/adjusted EBITDA multiple of 6.93 at the midpoint of its full-year adjusted EBITDA <a href=\"https://investor.pagaya.com/static-files/9c888e83-5ed3-4d0a-a48b-a445c8dd30b5\" rel=\"nofollow\">guidance</a> of $357.5 million, compared to a sector median of 16.30.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, other high growth fintechs such as <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4781342-upstart-ai-edge-is-fueling-outperformance-amidst-macro-uncertainty\">Upstart</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UPST\" title=\"Upstart Holdings, Inc.\">UPST</a>), <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4818134-affirm-holdings-sticky-product-moat-to-drive-sustainable-profitability\">Affirm</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AFRM\" title=\"Affirm Holdings, Inc.\">AFRM</a>), Klarna, and Sezzle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SEZL\" title=\"Sezzle Inc.\">SEZL</a>) are trading at the following EV/EBITDA multiples.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p>Company</p></td> <td><p>EV/EBITDA</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>UPST</p></td> <td><p>26.47</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>AFRM</p></td> <td><p>27.73</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>KLAR</p></td> <td><p>92.75</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>SEZL</p></td> <td><p>14.34</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, this valuation gap compared to its peers suggests that the market may be underestimating Pagaya’s growth potential as the engine driving loan originations at banks and fintechs thanks to its platform. Therefore, I’m applying the sector median 16.30 EV/EBITDA multiple to Pagaya’s adjusted EBITDA guidance, which leads to my price target of $70, representing 168% upside from current levels.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p>Adj.

As an ABS issuer, Pagaya is obligated to retain at least 5% of the credit risk of the loans being securitized, per Dodd-Frank. These loans are typically of the lowest classes in its ABS transactions or the highest risk loans due to vertical retention.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Pagaya has been increasing its non-ABS funding deals, including forward flow agreements, ABS issuances remain a key growth driver for the company. Therefore, if default rates increase and these loans perform poorly, the company may be forced to adjust the fair value of these loans downwards, leading to potentially significant losses. As is, the company currently previously incurred a $235 million <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4760961-pagaya-severely-undervalued-despite-improving-business-performance\">impairment</a> charge on its 2021-2023 loan vintages in Q4 2024, which had weighed on its valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, I believe Pagaya presents a compelling risk-to-reward profile ahead of Q3 earnings at its current valuation. With some of the company’s key partners recently reporting strong Q3 results, highlighted by strong personal loan demand and improving credit quality, the company could be well-positioned to exceed its network volume guidance, beat analysts’ estimates, and raise its full-year outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, the longer-term credit environment appears to be promising for Pagaya, with US speculative grade default rates trending in the right direction, indicating an improving credit cycle, in my opinion. With that in mind, Pagaya’s latest POS ABS transaction could be a sign of an improving credit environment after the company secured more favorable funding terms compared to its prior transaction, despite carrying a riskier loan pool.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the company's partners and investors appearing to have an increased risk appetite, Pagaya’s network volume may be well-positioned to sustain its growth rates in the short-to-medium terms. In my opinion, if Pagaya is able to achieve this feat while managing the risk of its originated loans through its underwriting, the stock could witness a rerating near other high-growth fintechs. It is for these reasons that I’m reiterating my strong buy rating for Pagaya and raising my price target to $70, representing 168% upside from its current valuation.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a></span>), I said investors should hold the stock. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4789176-apple-biggest-risk-isnt-competition-its-the-consumer\">My reasoning</a> was that Apple’s business itself looked strong, but the bigger picture wasn’t so friendly. Interest rates<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> were going up, there were concrete data points showing that people were feeling less confident about the economy, and spending on nonessential items appeared to be slowing down, and that’s a challenging dynamic for a company like Apple, which depends on customers </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content\">wanting</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> its products, not needing them. Back then, I wasn’t sweating how Apple was managed, I was worried about the economy as a whole.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After looking at Apple's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511802-apple-gaap-eps-of-1_85-beats-by-0_08-revenue-of-102_47b-beats-by-220m\">most recent earnings</a> report, I think the company is still one of the world's most financially responsible and brand-resilient companies. However, the stock market has already factored that strength into the price, meaning investors are paying a premium for Apple’s excellence.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apple Shows Strength in Services, Stability in Hardware</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-1761917009111669_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1518\" data-height=\"790\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-1761917009111669_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AAPL's EPS stats\" width=\"640\" height=\"333\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"333\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-1761917009111669_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-1761917009111669_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-1761917009111669_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-1761917009111669_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-1761917009111669_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-1761917009111669_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-1761917009111669_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-1761917009111669_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's jump right in. From a strategic standpoint, Apple focused on its strong products while dealing with changing global policies and currency fluctuations, yet Apple did what Apple usually does, and the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">company’s revenue</a> reached $102.5 billion, that's an 8% increase from the same quarter last year, while EPS reached $1.85, both record highs for the September quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reading through the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">transcript</a>, it’s clear that most of the improvement came from the sales mix. In essence, Apple sold more of its higher-margin products, which nudged its overall <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL/profitability\">gross margin</a> up by 0.7 percentage points to 47.2%. The Products division’s margin rose to 36.2%, while the Services division’s margin was 75.3%, a touch lower, slipping 0.3 percentage points from the previous quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving on, let’s break it down by segment:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>iPhone revenue: $49 billion, up 6% year over year. “We did set a September quarter record for upgraders,” <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">said</a> CEO Tim Cook. He also noted supply constraints on several iPhone 16 and 17 models.</li> <li>Mac revenue: $8.7 billion, which is up 13% year over year. “We grew in every geographic segment with strong double-digit growth in emerging markets,” CFO Kevan Parekh <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">said</a>, adding that nearly half of Mac buyers were new to the product.</li> <li>iPad revenue: $7 billion, flat year over year. “We faced a difficult compare against the full quarter impact of the iPad Air and iPad Pro launch from last year,” Parekh <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">explained</a>, though he highlighted that over half of iPad customers this quarter were new to the product.</li> <li>Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue: $9 billion, flat year over year. “Both the Apple Watch and AirPods installed bases reached new all-time highs,” <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">said</a> Parekh.</li> <li>Services revenue: $28.8 billion, up 15% year over year and an all-time record. “Our strong performance for the quarter is really organically driven,” Parekh <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">added</a>, emphasizing that growth came broadly across categories and geographies.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before I go on, I want to say that I think Apple's numbers show a clear change in power toward its Services business. Hardware growth seems to be cooling off, however. Even though supplies were limited and the global economy was unstable, both the iPhone and Mac performed well, showing that Apple's loyal environment is still as strong as ever.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, the flat numbers for iPad and Wearables suggest those areas might be hitting a point of market saturation. But the record-breaking Services revenue tells us that Apple’s plan to build up steady, high-profit income from subscriptions and digital services is working exactly as intended.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apple Manages Costs, Capital, and Growth with Precision</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apple’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Greater China sales fell 4%</a> compared to last year, and management said most of that drop was due to limited iPhone supply, not weaker demand. Even though sales are down, more people <em>are</em> going into stores in China, which is a good omen for future sales. Looking ahead, Apple’s management expects sales in China to grow again in the December quarter. They also said that local government <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3315680/apple-joins-chinas-subsidy-scheme-boost-sales-amid-heated-domestic-competition\" rel=\"nofollow\">subsidies</a> are helping to boost sales. However, these programs only cover certain iPhone models that are priced at certain levels, so not all devices can get the discount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The CFO <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">said</a> that costs are following the usual pattern. Prices for memory parts have dropped a bit, which helps a little. However, at the start of a new product cycle, the cost of materials is usually higher until the company finds ways to make things more efficiently.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apple spent around <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">$1.1 billion on tariffs</a> this quarter, which matched what they had expected. I want to stop here for a second, because even with more than a billion in tariffs, Apple still posted record revenue and profit this quarter, a sign of just how tightly the company runs its operation. Given current trade policies, Apple expects tariff costs to climb to around $1.4 billion for the December quarter. This estimate also considers recent changes in tariff rates, which is why Apple says tariff costs won’t increase in direct proportion to how many products they sell.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, management also <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">said</a> that investments in Private Cloud Compute for Apple Intelligence will cause capital spending to go up. One of these is that brand-new <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/apple-begins-shipping-ai-servers-houston-factory-2025-10-23/\" rel=\"nofollow\">data center in Houston</a> that's already sending servers out. Apple said it will stick with a plan that uses both its own facilities and those of outside companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the end of the quarter, the company had <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">$132 billion in cash</a> and assets, around $99 billion in debt, and $34 billion in net cash, which is after paying off its debts. During the quarter, Apple gave $24 billion back to shareholders, which includes $20 billion through stock buybacks and $3.9 billion in dividends. Also, to shareholders who own the stock as of November 10, the Board announced a dividend of $0.26 per share, which will be paid on November 13.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apple <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">expects</a> its revenue for the December quarter to grow by 10% to 12% compared to the same time last year, with iPhone sales rising by double digits. The company also projects a gross margin of 47% to 48%, that, by the way, already factors in about $1.4 billion in tariff costs. Operating expenses are expected to be between $18.1 billion and $18.5 billion, other income and expenses (OI&amp;E) should be around $150 million, and the tax rate is estimated at 17%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apple’s Building the Future of AI on Its Own Terms</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before I go into valuation, I want to circle back and cover some more background on how Apple is spending more money to grow its <a href=\"https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Private Cloud Compute</a> system, which uses its own custom computer chips. The company is also moving more of its AI processing to its M-series devices, like Macs and iPads. Apple said that its new AI servers, built right here in the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/in-the-loop/2025/10/shipping-apples-american-made-advanced-servers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">United States</a>, act as backup power for on-device AI when bigger computing power is needed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Essentially, Apple describes Private Cloud Compute as a privacy-first system. It uses verified software that can’t be changed without approval, doesn’t keep any long-term data, and has a program where outside researchers can check the exact software before it’s allowed to process real user activity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This, as you know, isn't exactly <em>common</em> for big tech companies. It also shows that Apple likes a hybrid strategy, where most private work stays on your device and only the bare minimum is sent to its tightly controlled cloud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding performance, it comes as no surprise that Apple is gearing up its devices to handle more AI work locally. The new <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-unleashes-m5-the-next-big-leap-in-ai-performance-for-apple-silicon/\" rel=\"nofollow\">M5 chip generation</a> has more than 4x as much peak GPU power for AI as its predecessor. It also packs a faster Neural Engine and more memory bandwidth, letting devices handle bigger AI jobs, things like parsing longer conversations or combining text, images, and audio, without leaning so much on the cloud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, the takeaway is that every bit of processing that happens directly on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac instead of Apple’s servers helps cut cloud costs, improves latency, and fits Apple’s strong stance on user privacy. So when your device can’t handle a request on its own, Apple’s new Houston servers step in under the same security guarantees and apparently erase all data once the job is done.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Personally, I believe this makes a big difference because it helps Apple keep its profits high (hence, SA's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL/profitability\">A+ profit grade</a>) and makes the brand stronger against the effects of its current and future competitors. Apple saves money on outside computer costs by doing more AI processing on its own devices and only using its own cloud when it needs to. It also makes Apple's image for protecting privacy stronger, which keeps users and lawmakers on board.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/\" rel=\"nofollow\">earlier this year</a>, the company said it’s committing over $500 billion in U.S. spending over the next four years, with AI infrastructure and chipmaking near the top of the list. So while building and assembling servers in Texas helps keep the supply chain tighter, parts and upgrades will move faster while also insulating Apple a bit from trade tensions abroad. It also means Apple can control its upgrade pace instead of depending completely on outside GPU suppliers. All very practical moves, though they also happen to make for good PR in the current <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/08/trump-effect-a-running-list-of-new-u-s-investment-in-president-trumps-second-term/\" rel=\"nofollow\">political climate</a> too, about “investing in America.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From an investor’s perspective, Microsoft Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) and Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) largely depend on extensive shared GPU cloud infrastructures to support their AI tools. Apple's hybrid route, meanwhile, could boost Apple’s Services revenue without depending on the same cost structure as full-blown cloud AI providers. All things considered, you can look at it this way: instead of charging users to “rent” AI power, Apple bakes new AI features right into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, encouraging people to upgrade their devices rather than pay per use.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AAPL’s Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-17619179233533921_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1372\" data-height=\"440\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-17619179233533921_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AAPL's valuation metrics\" width=\"640\" height=\"205\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"205\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-17619179233533921_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-17619179233533921_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-17619179233533921_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-17619179233533921_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-17619179233533921_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-17619179233533921_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-17619179233533921_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-17619179233533921_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FAST Graphs</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’m valuing Apple based on its earnings and how it compares to other companies in the same industry.

It also assumes Apple can handle the costs of investing in AI without hurting its free cash flow or the valuation investors give it.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'm keeping my Hold rating. I love the brand. It's all I use. It's all my family uses, and most everyone I know too. At its core, Apple’s brand and product ecosystem are second to none, and its growing Services business, along with new AI investments, should keep its cash flow strong over time.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, with AAPL stock trading at about 36x earnings and carrying higher valuation ratios than most of its peers, buying more shares now means paying a steep price for that strength. I’d rather stay patient and look to add on multiple compression or a reset.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOGI\" title=\"Logitech International S.A.\">LOGI</a></span>) is a designer and manufacturer of consumer computer hardware, including keyboards, mice, microphones, cameras, and other computer peripherals. The Swiss company was founded in 1981 and has around 7,300 employees with a market capitalization<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> of around $11.4 billion. This puts it in the top 15 companies in technology hardware and peripherals. This part of information technology can often be forgotten, as software and AI-related companies get the most attention. Most importantly, the stock is in the consumer discretionary category, which suggests it may be more sensitive to the cyclicality of the economy.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revisiting November 2024 Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since my last <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4739480-logitech-margin-expansion-offers-valuation-opportunity\">analysis</a> was published about a year ago, LOGI bounced from trading down -9.4% in the year through November 2024 to increasing over 50% through the end of October 2025. In that piece, I highlighted Logitech’s improving profitability and operational discipline as signs that the market was undervaluing the company’s long-term potential. The core message was that margin expansion, product innovation, and growing exposure to the education market were reshaping its fundamentals even as headline revenue growth remained uneven. Here are the key points from that analysis:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Profitability had become Logitech’s defining strength, with gross margins rising to around 43.6% (the highest since early 2021) as cost reductions and a better product mix drove consistent improvement. The company achieved five straight quarters of margin gains, signaling durable progress in its pricing power and expense control.</li> <li>The company’s innovation, particularly in gaming and creative peripherals, showcased its ability to differentiate in both mature and emerging markets. These launches helped reinforce LOGI’s reputation as a premium brand rather than a low-cost manufacturer. Additionally, rapid growth in tablet accessories tied to schools and digital learning highlighted the success of LOGI’s move into the education sector. Management viewed this vertical expansion as a model for extending the brand into other specialized markets.</li> <li>China remained both a challenge and an opportunity, as demand softness and competition weighed on short-term results while local product strategies and supply chain diversification laid the groundwork for recovery. LOGI’s measured approach balanced near-term caution with long-term positioning in a critical market.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The primary motivation behind my buy recommendation a year ago was a favorable valuation after the stock had dropped in the month and year before. Despite the clear fundamental improvement, the stock traded with a P/E ratio around 17-18x, below its five-year average of 22x. That mismatch between fundamentals and valuation made it clear that LOGI had significant upside. As mentioned before, LOGI has seen a strong run in the past year, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SP500</a>) with gains of just over 45%. That demands a reassessment of the value proposition and, potentially, an update to the rating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">FYQ2 2026 Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">LOGI recently <a href=\"https://s1.q4cdn.com/104539020/files/doc_financials/2026/q2/Logitech-Q2-FY26-Press-Release_vF.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">released</a> its FYQ2 2026 earnings, which cover its results for Q3 2025. The stock continued its run of earnings beats, reporting non-GAAP EPS of $1.45, a healthy beat over Wall Street expectations of $1.23. Its revenue numbers are typically a bit closer to consensus, and in FYQ2 2026, LOGI met expectations with revenue of $1.19 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Importantly, its growth rates of revenue and profits were both positive. Total revenue increased 6% YoY in U.S. dollar terms and 4% YoY in constant currency terms, the strongest increase so far this calendar year, with five business segments expanding and three business segments declining. The sales growth helped contribute to an increase of 19% YoY in operating income, also the strongest so far this calendar year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sales Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619171931339068_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1047\" data-height=\"786\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619171931339068_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Regional and product sales growth analysis\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619171931339068_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619171931339068_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619171931339068_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619171931339068_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619171931339068_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619171931339068_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619171931339068_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619171931339068_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>LOGI FYQ2 earnings</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regional <a href=\"https://s1.q4cdn.com/104539020/files/doc_financials/2026/q1/Logitech-Q1-2026-Shareholder-Letter_vF.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">performance</a> was mixed, with strong international gains offsetting softness in the Americas. Sales in the Americas declined -4% YoY in constant currency, weighed down by weakness in Gaming and Tablet Accessories, though Pointing Devices saw healthy growth. EMEA delivered a 3% YoY increase, supported by solid demand across segments. The clear standout was Asia Pacific, where sales rose 19% YoY, marking a second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Strength was broad-based in this region as well, highlighting improving sell-through momentum and successful new product uptake in the region. In fact, the overall increase in sell-through relative to net sales growth (10% YoY vs. 6% YoY) points to stable consumer demand despite weakness in LOGI’s main region. Across product lines, growth was led by Logitech’s core Personal Workspace and Gaming segments, picking up the slack in some smaller segments:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Gaming revenue grew 5% YoY in constant currency, driven by PC Gaming and strong Asia-Pacific results. Notably, demand in the Americas was softer due to market weakness and pricing adjustments related to tariffs. Despite that, LOGI announced 12 new products in this segment, showing its commitment to innovation in the face of uncertainty.</li> <li>Within its Personal Workspace product group, Keyboards &amp; Combos and Pointing Devices both posted 10% YoY growth (constant currency), supported by double-digit expansion in EMEA and Asia Pacific and the launch of new premium models. LOGI continues to maintain its top position in these markets, which is key in uncertain times.</li> <li>Beyond Gaming and Personal Workspace, smaller segments struggled. Video Collaboration grew 3% YoY, with premium products lifting average selling prices, while Webcams rose 2% YoY, maintaining market leadership despite a modest decline in Asia Pacific. Tablet Accessories slipped -3% YoY after a strong prior-year comparison, and Headsets fell -8% YoY due to transitioned product lines.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the mix of gains in core categories and strong international growth reinforced the company’s leadership in premium peripherals. LOGI has consistently shown that its diversification across the computer peripheral market is its strength. For example, management noted in the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834351-logitech-international-s-a-logi-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">conference call</a> that its B2B segments performed well while consumer segments were a bit soft, and similarly, the growth in Asia Pacific picked up some of the slack of the North American markets. I believe this has been key to its consistency in earnings results over the last few years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-1761917639728845_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1044\" data-height=\"389\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-1761917639728845_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Non-GAAP operating expenses FYQ2 earnings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"238\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-1761917639728845_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-1761917639728845_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-1761917639728845_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-1761917639728845_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-1761917639728845_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-1761917639728845_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-1761917639728845_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-1761917639728845_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>LOGI FYQ2 earnings</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While it’s always good to see solid top-line growth, the storyline for 2025 has been about profit margins. Tariffs have created a challenging environment for managing costs and compressed margins in the first two quarters of the year, and that has called into question one of my main motivations for rating the stock as a Buy. However, results in FYQ2 2026 earnings have shown LOGI’s resilience. Non-GAAP gross margins were down -30 bps YoY to 43.8% in FYQ2 as tariff costs weighed, but this was a significant improvement of 170 bps over gross margins of 42.1% in FYQ1 (which were down -120 bps YoY). Further down towards the bottom line, non-GAAP operating margins were reported to have increased 210 bps YoY to 19.4% in FYQ2 (up 180 bps QoQ), an even more impressive showing of operational efficiency. Management highlighted two key reasons for the preservation of its margins:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>LOGI focused on cutting costs where they could control them, specifically in SG&amp;A and marketing expenses, such that operating expenses actually declined -3% YoY to be about 24.4% of total sales, a drop of -240 bps from the same quarter a year ago. This was part of a successful plan put in place by management to offset the impact of the tariffs.</li> <li>Another way LOGI sought to find relief from tariffs was by diversifying its supply chains. Management reported that it was continuing to find ways to source a few North American goods from China and was “on track to reduce our share of U.S. products originating from China to 10% by the end of this calendar year.”</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b990dbe362f826de17ed2bd9b22b5ed4.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b990dbe362f826de17ed2bd9b22b5ed4.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b990dbe362f826de17ed2bd9b22b5ed4.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b990dbe362f826de17ed2bd9b22b5ed4.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b990dbe362f826de17ed2bd9b22b5ed4.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b990dbe362f826de17ed2bd9b22b5ed4.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b990dbe362f826de17ed2bd9b22b5ed4.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b990dbe362f826de17ed2bd9b22b5ed4.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b990dbe362f826de17ed2bd9b22b5ed4.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I continue to be impressed by LOGI's ability to convert healthy sales growth into strong profitability, while maintaining a reputation for developing premium products for consumer and business customers (releasing 16 new products in the last quarter). Wall Street seems to consistently underappreciate this facet of LOGI’s fundamentals, which is why we see earnings beats consistently, even while revenues are estimated pretty well by analysts. It does appear that the worst of the volatility in U.S. trade policy is likely behind us, and tariff rates have more or less reached their ceilings. With that in mind, further gross margin compression is likely to become less of an issue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619172723127685_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"796\" data-height=\"327\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619172723127685_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FYQ3 2025 outlook\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"263\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619172723127685_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619172723127685_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619172723127685_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619172723127685_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619172723127685_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619172723127685_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619172723127685_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619172723127685_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>LOGI FYQ2 earnings</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FYQ2 2026 earnings ended with an outlook for the final quarter of 2025, the most important quarter for LOGI since it includes the holiday season. The outlook sees sales growth similar to what was seen in FYQ2 and an increase of about 5.2% YoY in operating income. Management’s feelings about the upcoming quarter can be described as cautiously optimistic. CFO Matteo Anversa summarized the sentiment well in his comments about the outlook.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We believe we will see continued strong momentum in our business, but we also see some market uncertainty. The North American consumer market, especially in gaming, was softer in Q2... We're cautiously optimistic that this will improve for the holiday season, but that is, of course, yet to be confirmed.</p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Holiday Season Uncertainty</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yes, the holiday season is the biggest question mark for LOGI, especially in its largest North American segment. That segment already saw sales decline in FYQ2, and the macroeconomic fundamentals, especially in the US, suggest that we will likely see a similar trend in FYQ3. In my previous analysis, I highlighted how LOGI would likely see a strong holiday quarter due to healthy consumer fundamentals, especially among younger demographics that are more likely to spend on electronics. But that tailwind has quickly flipped into a headwind due to the deterioration of the labor market in 2025, especially for LOGI’s key younger demographic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619176810123303_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"750\" data-height=\"474\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619176810123303_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Younger demographics employment growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"404\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619176810123303_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619176810123303_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619176810123303_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619176810123303_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619176810123303_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619176810123303_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619176810123303_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619176810123303_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Vanguard</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the U.S., we have seen nonfarm employment growth slow down significantly, even seeing a month of job losses in June. The slowdown in hiring has been felt across the labor market, but it has particularly impacted younger populations. <a href=\"https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/data-show-labor-market-strength-despite-slower-hiring.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Research</a> from Vanguard shows that employment growth has indeed slowed in the 26-40 and 41-55 age groups, but the deceleration has been the sharpest in the 21-25 age group, falling from a peak of 5.7% in 2022 to just as of September 2025. This decline in employment growth translates to a decline in income growth, and Vanguard has tracked this trend in its own analysis (from 401(k) contribution data).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another <a href=\"https://www.ncci.com/SecureDocuments/QEB/QEB-Q3-2025.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">analysis</a> from NCCI about unemployment rates reports a more troubling result:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>“In August, the unemployment rate for younger workers reached 10.5%, compared to an unemployment rate of just 3.6% for prime age workers (25–54 years old).”</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The data on both hiring and joblessness are pretty consistent in pointing out that younger consumers are having more trouble in the labor market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result of this trend, I believe that FYQ3 2026 (and beyond) will be difficult for LOGI, and the softness in North American demand will weigh on its headline sales growth. This ties back into the simple fact that the company is a member of the consumer discretionary sector, which makes it sensitive to these moments in the business cycle. This is especially the case in a quarter that relies heavily on demand from the holiday season.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">China Is Still Critical</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While North America remains the main source of weakness, strength in the Asia Pacific, and especially in China, has become a key offset. The “China for China” strategy continues to deliver, with double-digit regional growth driven by strong local demand and a steady cadence of new product launches.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China has been the standout, leading global gaming sales thanks to the success of local products and more targeted, high-ROI marketing campaigns. Management also noted that China’s performance was ahead of the broader Asia Pacific region, which already grew 19% YoY in FYQ2. These results show that LOGI’s localized strategy and strong brand presence in China are paying off, and continued momentum in Asia Pacific could help cushion the impact of softer US demand heading into the next few quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619177439129403_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"775\" data-height=\"468\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619177439129403_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"China annual retail sales growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"386\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619177439129403_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619177439129403_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619177439129403_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619177439129403_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619177439129403_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619177439129403_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619177439129403_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619177439129403_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>China NBS</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although, the Chinese economy is feeling the effects of the U.S. tariff policy, creating a tougher macro environment for LOGI.

An analysis completed in Q2 2025 suggested that household income growth would only be about 1.4% in 2025, down from 2.5% YoY, and while that didn’t necessarily translate to weaker expected consumption, LOGI’s products being more discretionary suggests it is likely to see more of a headwind in weaker income growth. Nevertheless, LOGI’s management has more visibility into its own Chinese markets, and its market positioning might shield it from broader macro weakness.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revisiting The Value Proposition</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_81ece75ddd41dfd6c42bf96f6b500e46.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_81ece75ddd41dfd6c42bf96f6b500e46.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_81ece75ddd41dfd6c42bf96f6b500e46.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_81ece75ddd41dfd6c42bf96f6b500e46.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_81ece75ddd41dfd6c42bf96f6b500e46.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_81ece75ddd41dfd6c42bf96f6b500e46.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_81ece75ddd41dfd6c42bf96f6b500e46.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_81ece75ddd41dfd6c42bf96f6b500e46.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_81ece75ddd41dfd6c42bf96f6b500e46.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With LOGI running up over 45% in the last year and FYQ2 operating income reported up around 19% YoY, there has been a significant increase in its valuation over that time period. The market has (rightfully) readjusted its pricing of sales up from 2.8x about a year ago to 3.9x today and its pricing of earnings up from 17.7x a year ago to around 27.4x today. Comparatively, this puts its P/S ratio at the highest levels since 2021, and its P/E ratio at the highest since early 2024 (still below the peak valuations in late 2023).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Importantly, these valuation changes haven’t come about from weaker fundamentals, but rather from the market adjusting (appropriately) to LOGI’s consistently better-than-expected margin results. Unfortunately, this makes the stock much less of a value opportunity, and Seeking Alpha’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOGI/ratings/quant-ratings\">Quant ratings</a> reflect that, as the valuation grade has moved from B- six months ago to a D- now (though the P/E ratio comparison is still rated a B).</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After its latest earnings, LOGI is now trading above $120, the highest since the stock peaked above $130 during the COVID lockdown period. I like this company’s fundamentals, as it showcases why strong and consistent margins are an important factor that can lead to outperforming the broader market. However, because the valuations have increased and macro conditions have started to become unfavorable in its key North American market (especially for its key upcoming FYQ3 quarter), I am downgrading my LOGI rating from a Buy to a Hold.</p>",

I say this because a major objection for investors when purchasing assets that replicate the main American indexes is waiting for an eventual return to the average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, research over the last 225 years (since 1800) shows that one sector can dominate the market for up to 50 years. Therefore, you should not wait for technology and artificial intelligence stocks to return to their historical average, as they may take a long time to correct. Additionally, when the price of these shares returns to its historical average, it is probably no longer the best time to invest.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59387725-17618543049020112.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Sectors can stay the largest without reversion for half centuries\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"550\" height=\"382\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59387725-17618543049020112.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59387725-17618543049020112.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59387725-17618543049020112.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59387725-17618543049020112.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59387725-17618543049020112.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59387725-17618543049020112.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59387725-17618543049020112.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59387725-17618543049020112.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Sectors can stay the largest without reversion for half centuries (Goldman Sachs, ETF Shares.

But the relative reliability for projecting performance with fixed-income securities is closely linked to<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> buying and holding a bond through its maturity date. Results over shorter periods can and often do vary substantially. Investing in bond funds introduces more return variability vs. the implied outlook with a relevant buy-and-hold position in an individual Treasury security or corporate bond.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A high degree of clarity for expected return with bonds is a function of using the current yield at the time of purchase as a forecast. For example, a 5-year Treasury Note is currently trading around 3.7%. Assuming you purchase the security directly at that current yield and hold it through maturity, the performance will roughly match the yield at the time of purchase. (Technically, yield-to-maturity, which factors in additional variables, is a more accurate measure for projecting return, but for simplicity in this illustration, let’s assume current yield is equivalent. Note, too, that we’re ignoring such issues as how you invest a bond’s payouts through time and other variables, such as callable bonds and defaults that affect returns for corporates.)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investing in bonds by way of a fund adds another layer of complication that can, and usually does, affect performance - sometimes in ways that aren’t intuitive. As an example, consider a buy-and-hold investment in Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VBMFX\" title=\"Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Investor Shares\">VBMFX</a>), a popular mutual fund that holds investment-grade securities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Morningstar reports that a bit more than half of VBMFX’s portfolio is held in US government bonds, with corporates (25%) and securitized bonds making up most of the rest (22%). The fund’s yield to maturity is 4.38%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assume the 5-year Treasury yield is a proxy for the fund, which implies that when you bought VBMFX, the current 5-year rate is a reasonable first approximation of what you can expect to earn over the next 5 years. The broader portfolio holdings in VBMFX will create differences vs. a 5-year Note, but current yield for the government security should be a decent back-of-the-envelope forecast.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sometimes that’s a reasonable assumption, but it can also be wide of the mark. Much depends on current macro conditions and the outlook when you buy VBMFX.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For context, the chart below compares the 5-year annualized total return for VBMFX five years hence relative to the 5-year yield. If the 5-year yield was a perfect forecast for VBMFX’s return five years down the road, the two lines would match exactly. Clearly, that’s not the case. Although there are periods when the 5-year yield (red line in chart) is a reasonably accurate estimate of the future 5-year return for VBMFX (black line), there can be substantial divergences for prolonged periods.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_322a798d23fd71081330249b14cd5a04.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart showing 5-year US Treasury yield versus subsequent 5-year return for VBMFX\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_322a798d23fd71081330249b14cd5a04.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_322a798d23fd71081330249b14cd5a04.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_322a798d23fd71081330249b14cd5a04.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_322a798d23fd71081330249b14cd5a04.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_322a798d23fd71081330249b14cd5a04.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_322a798d23fd71081330249b14cd5a04.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_322a798d23fd71081330249b14cd5a04.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_322a798d23fd71081330249b14cd5a04.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For most of VBMFX’s history, the fund has outperformed or matched the 5-year yield. But since the Federal Reserve’s latest round of rate hikes starting in 2022, VBMFX’s five-year return has trailed the 5-year yield (from five years earlier) by a relatively wide margin for an extended period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are several possible reasons for the mismatch in recent years, including the rapid pace of 2022-2023 rate hikes, the lingering effects of the pandemic on the economy, and the sharp spike in inflation in 2022-2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another relevant factor: the four-decade trend of generally declining interest rates that ended in 2021. Forty years of falling yields bred a high degree of comfort in assuming that risk was minimal for the bond market’s outlook. When that regime ended, the shift introduced more uncertainty and volatility into the market to a degree unseen in decades.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even before 2021, it was unsurprising that VBMFX’s rolling 5-year return deviated from the implied forecast via a 5-year yield. The fund, although it tracks an index, holds a range of bonds and therefore takes more risk vs. a Treasury note. The higher risk mostly paid off, until the 2022 rate hikes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The larger point is that developing return and risk expectations for bond funds has become considerably more nuanced. By contrast, forecasting VBMFX and other bond strategies was more or less pro forma in the pre-2021 era, with relatively low stakes given the general slide in yields.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That era ended in 2022, and it’s debatable when or if it will return. Between tariffs, gridlock in government, elevated fiscal risk for the US government, and the potential for AI-fueled economic disruption, a repeat performance of the secular slide in interest rates during 1981-2021 looks unlikely, at least at the moment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In turn, the stakes are higher for crunching the numbers and reading the trends for developing expectations for bond funds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Buying and holding a Treasury note, by comparison, still offers simplicity and relative reliability for projecting future performance.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Original Source: <a href=\"https://themilwaukeecompany.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Milwaukee Company</a></em> </p>",

The used car retailer, which some like myself thought could go bankrupt just a few years ago, has been one of the best-performing stocks in recent years. On Wednesday, the company announced its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285155-carvana-announces-record-third-quarter-2025-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285155-carvana-announces-record-third-quarter-2025-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">third-quarter results</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">, and while the stock dropped afterwards, there were certainly many things to like.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Previous </strong>Coverage Of The Name</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's been about two and a half years since I last covered Carvana, at which point <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4601598-carvana-stock-closer-to-the-brink\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4601598-carvana-stock-closer-to-the-brink\" target=\"_blank\">I remained a major skeptic</a>. At that time, revenues were falling as the company was pulling back on inventory to stem major cash burn, and the balance sheet was in terrible shape. With a so-so margin picture and not much room to grow in the near term, the once booming stock traded for just around $11 a share. With things improving significantly since, this has been one of the market's biggest rallies, up over 2,700%, compared to a 65% gain for the S&amp;P 500.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>A </strong>Look At The Q3 Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the September ending period, Carvana announced retail units sold of 156,000, or more than 44% growth over the prior year period. With some help from average selling prices, the company reported record quarterly revenue of $5.65 billion. This number was up 55% year over year, and it crushed street estimates by more than $550 million. Total revenues have more than doubled from where they were just two years earlier. Thanks to <span>seven</span> straight quarterly revenue beats and management's hope to get to 3 million annual deliveries within 5 to 10 years, analyst revenue estimates <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVNA/earnings/revisions\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVNA/earnings/revisions\" target=\"_blank\">for future years have soared</a>, as seen in the table below.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618344475287867.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Revenue Estimates\" width=\"432\" height=\"161\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"432\" data-height=\"161\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618344475287867.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618344475287867.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618344475287867.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618344475287867.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618344475287867.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618344475287867.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618344475287867.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618344475287867.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Carvana Revenue Estimates <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest key to the ongoing turnaround has been major cost management. As the company has worked to integrate the ADESA sites it acquired over time, along with reducing operating expenses per unit, overall margins have improved tremendously. In Q3 2022, for instance, gross margins were 10.6%, and operating margins were negative 15%. In the just reported quarter, however, those numbers had jumped to 20.3% and a positive 9.8%, respectively. On the operating side, that's more than <span>$1</span> billion of improvement. Even with gross margins down 175 basis points year over year, management was still able to drive a 55-basis-point increase for its operating margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As revenues continue to grow over time, the bottom line could look even better. While the gross margin percentage may not rise every single quarter, gross margin dollars should benefit from the top-line increase. It also appears that as the company continues to sell more vehicles, it may be able to reduce operating expenses as a percentage of revenue another percentage point or two. Finally, interest expenses were still running at a half<span>-</span>billion-dollar pace in Q3 2025, and annual positive cash flow moving forward will help to bring those payments down further from the nearly $700 million run rate peak they were at in early 2024.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Major </strong>Balance Sheet Improvement</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My biggest concern back in the day was the company's balance sheet. With the company losing money for a time, and also spending wildly to grow, cash burn was extremely high. Just two and a half years ago, net debt was nearly $8 billion, and there was a lot of talk about a potential bankruptcy. Carvana <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/19/carvana-deal-to-reduce-debt-shares-soar.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/19/carvana-deal-to-reduce-debt-shares-soar.html\" target=\"_blank\">struck a major debt deal</a> with lenders, and since then, the situation has improved tremendously, as seen in the chart below.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618349503585184_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"866\" data-height=\"480\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618349503585184_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Net Debt\" width=\"640\" height=\"355\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"355\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618349503585184_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618349503585184_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618349503585184_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618349503585184_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618349503585184_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618349503585184_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618349503585184_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618349503585184_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Carvana Net Debt <span>(Company Filings)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the end of September, the net debt figure was down to just around $3 billion. Total cash was more than $2.1 billion, while total debt stood at just over $5.2 billion. The company has diluted investors a bit over the years to help with its debt pile, but it shouldn't need any substantial equity raises moving forward unless it is for a major acquisition. With the surge in shares in recent years, even a couple of percent of dilution now would wipe out a significant amount of the company's remaining debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Free cash flow in the first 9 months of the year was just over half a billion dollars. While that was down from nearly $800 million in the first <span>three</span> quarters of last year, it was mainly due to an extra $522 million spent on inventory. Positive cash flow will allow for more debt repurchases, and as mentioned <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835180-carvana-co-cvna-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835180-carvana-co-cvna-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">on the conference call</a>, another nearly $100 million worth of notes were bought back in October.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Valuation </strong>Is High, But It Has Certainly Come Down</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With Thursday's more than 13.8% drop, Carvana currently has a market cap of about $66.5 billion. Based on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVNA/earnings/estimates\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVNA/earnings/estimates\" target=\"_blank\">current revenue estimates</a>, that means the stock trades for about 2.67 times next year's projected revenue. That is a major premium to names like CarMax (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KMX\" title=\"CarMax, Inc.\">KMX</a>) and AutoNation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AN\" title=\"AutoNation, Inc.\">AN</a>), who both go for about 0.25 times their projected 2026 sales. However, those two names are projected for very limited revenue growth, while Carvana is seeing its top line soar.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With shares of Carvana about $100 off their 52-week high, and revenue estimates jumping as shown above, that valuation has certainly improved. The stock was going for well over 4 times next year's expected sales just a few months ago. As pointed out in the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1690820/000169082025000352/ex99_1q32025.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1690820/000169082025000352/ex99_1q32025.htm\" target=\"_blank\">company's shareholder letter</a>, growth currently dwarfs the industry (44% unit growth in Q3 vs. 0% average), and margins are considerably higher (11.3% Adjusted EBITDA vs. 5.0% average).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Wall Street analysts are also very positive on the name currently. As of Thursday morning, 14 of the 22 analysts covering the name had either a <span>\"B</span>uy\" or <span>\"S</span>trong Buy\" recommendation on the stock, with just <span>one</span> \"Strong Sell,\" and seven holds. The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVNA/ratings/sell-side-ratings\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVNA/ratings/sell-side-ratings\" target=\"_blank\">average price target</a> as of Thursday night was just about $424, implying nearly 39% upside from current levels.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Final </strong>Thoughts And Recommendation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Carvana shares tumbled on Thursday, the company's Q3 report showed just how much of a turnaround has been completed here. No longer is the company losing money and burning through large amounts of cash. Revenue growth is soaring with decent margins, and positive cash flow has helped to significantly improve what was once a hideous balance sheet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the company having just 1.5% market share currently, there is plenty of room for future growth, especially given a lack of meaningful presence in some areas of the country, seen below. Just a doubling of market share would put the company over a million retail units sold a year, and management hopes to get well beyond that in the next decade.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-1761836416667238.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Coverage Map\" width=\"606\" height=\"371\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"606\" data-height=\"371\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-1761836416667238.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-1761836416667238.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-1761836416667238.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-1761836416667238.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-1761836416667238.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-1761836416667238.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-1761836416667238.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-1761836416667238.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Carvana Coverage Map <span>(Q3 Shareholder Letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure><div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the valuation here certainly is high compared to peers, you aren't going to get this kind of growth elsewhere in the space. With Carvana's worst days behind it, I think this pullback provides an opportunity for those looking to \"buy,\" and thus that will be my new rating here today. I was definitely one of the company's biggest skeptics a few years ago, but the major turnaround here now has me believing that there are still gains to be had for shareholders moving forward.</p>",

While this could suggest that my call was a bit too early<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> considering the cautious stance of the market, its valuation was justified then. And now, SHAK is becoming more attractive with its robust </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511190-shake-shack-non-gaap-eps-of-0_36-beats-by-0_05-revenue-of-367_4m-beats-by-3_69m\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 2025 performance</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and well-positioned fundamentals. Market challenges are still there, but resilience is present. Technicals are still weak, but bullish divergences are appearing once again.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">SHAK Q3 2025: Its Strength Sustained</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The macroeconomic environment remains challenging for many restaurants. Discretionary spending is still experiencing softness as inflation affects purchasing power. Yet, those who capitalize on value propositions and prudent and cautious expansion are taking advantage of the situation. Increasing brand popularity also bolsters their demand. Shake Shack, Inc. also enjoys this trend as reflected by its Q3 2025 performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its operating revenue amounted to <a href=\"https://investor.shakeshack.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Shake-Shack-Announces-Third-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">$367.4M</a>, up by 16% YoY from $316.9M. Its company-operated and franchised stores were stronger during the quarter as Shack sales and licensing revenue rose. As you can see, systemwide sales reached $571.5M, a 15% YoY increase from Q3 2024. At first glance, one might think that this was only due to SHAK’s continued expansion. After all, it opened a total of 13 new company-operated and seven licensed Shacks during the quarter. But if we look closely, SHAK really had a stronger performance. Note that it already has <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001620533/10d84de8-2a9a-466b-b8fe-0793d8665ade.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">630</a> restaurants today versus <a href=\"https://s27.q4cdn.com/357966323/files/doc_financials/2024/q3/b478f899-4d0e-4bd7-8a63-46ef58ad5570.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">552</a> restaurants on a YoY basis. With that, Shacks generated average sales of $907,143 versus $896,919. This is also higher than in my previous coverage.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>Q3 2024</td> <td>Q2 2025</td> <td>Q3 2025</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Systemwide Sales</td> <td>$495.1M</td> <td>$549.9M</td> <td>$571.5M</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Restaurant Count</td> <td>552</td> <td>610</td> <td>630</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Average Sales Per Restaurant</td> <td>$896,919</td> <td>$901,475</td> <td>$907,143</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, SHAK did not become too complacent with its expansion. In fact, it appears more efficient today than in the previous year despite higher cost pressures. Its total operating expenses only increased by 4%, so revenue growth is more than enough to offset it. As a result, its operating margin improved from -5.6% to 5.0% YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191436593334_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1516\" data-height=\"681\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191436593334_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Income Statement\" width=\"640\" height=\"287\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"287\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191436593334_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191436593334_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191436593334_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191436593334_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191436593334_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191436593334_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191436593334_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191436593334_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Income Statement <span>(SHAK Q3 2025 Release)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">It Remains Well Positioned</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Inflation is still a challenge for many restaurants. I know that this impacts fast-food restaurants much more than fine-dining and fast-casual restaurants like SHAK. Yet, there may be a point where inflation reaches a point where consumers might rethink their spending habits. Although it capitalizes on value propositions rather than pricing strategies, SHAK may still be affected. Note that inflation has already regained momentum to its 14-month high of <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi\" rel=\"nofollow\">3.0%</a>. Nonetheless, SHAK has natural insulation, making it well-positioned against headwinds and for possible market opportunities.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">1. Premium Pricing Gives It Some Flexibility</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because of value propositions and target market, fast-casual restaurants like SHAK set premium prices on burgers, unlike quick-service restaurants, such as McDonald's Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD\" title=\"McDonald's Corporation\">MCD</a>) and Burger King (\"BK\"). It can set higher prices as it boasts product quality and extra convenience for customers. With that, sales and margins are still increasing. Costs and expenses remain well-managed. If inflation skyrockets and impacts demand, I believe that SHAK can afford to lower prices to still attract and stabilize demand without sacrificing margins. It may even narrow its gap from the QSRs I mentioned, which may highlight product differentiation. As a result, it can take away a portion of their demand.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. Prudent And Cautious Expansion Protects Its Topline Growth</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite its increasing popularity in recent years, SHAK prevents itself from overexpanding. It still has less than 1,000 stores globally, although its store openings continue to increase. This prevents unnecessary expenses and cash burns considering macroeconomic volatility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, most Shacks are located in prime locations like central business districts, national airports, luxury malls, and near large hotels. That way, it is likely that the people in the vicinity can afford to purchase its products. It can also avoid direct competition with cheaper options. This is a very crucial consideration in emerging and third-world economies because of the tendency to value prices more than value propositions. And the way I see it, SHAK is successful in it. A perfect example is in my country, the Philippines. You can only see Shacks in <a href=\"https://shakeshack.ph/locations\" rel=\"nofollow\">prime locations</a>, especially malls that are frequented by people from middle-income to upper-middle-income households.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On top of these facts, SHAK is increasing its exposure to franchised or licensed shacks. In fact, it now has 271 licensed Shacks versus 242 YoY. In addition, its licensing revenue per restaurant in Q3 2025 averaged at $53,700 versus $49,700 YoY. This proves that increasing licensed restaurants is fruitful for SHAK. It also helps increase its brand popularity with less capital intensity and expenses. So, it can manage its capex, borrowings, and operating costs and expenses better.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">3. Shifting Consumer Preferences Move In Favor Of Shake Shack</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another factor is the increased health consciousness of consumers. While these are typically behavioral, I believe that the pandemic stimulated this trend. People going for healthier options open new opportunities. We know that <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/health-and-wellness/nutrition/article-741664\" rel=\"nofollow\">burgers are often considered junk foods</a>. But the narrative may be different for Shake Shack Hamburger. It's a classic hamburger that only has 370 calories and 24 grams of carbohydrates. What makes it more interesting is its whopping <a href=\"https://lorieeberwellnesscoaching.com/healthiest-fast-food-burger/\" rel=\"nofollow\">25 grams of protein</a>, an important component for building muscles.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">4. Robust Fundamentals Are A Testament To Its Solid Business Model And Strategies</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its capex is over $100M, which is not surprising since it has a higher concentration on company-operated Shacks. Despite this, its operating cash flow remains high enough to cover capex. In fact, it generated an FCF of $152.5M, which means that it converted 15% of its sales into free cash using the FCF/Sales Ratio. This amount is also enough to cover all remaining outflows, such as debt repayments and stock repurchases. With that, SHAK has a very high liquidity as its cash level keeps increasing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191462898063_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"729\" data-height=\"745\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191462898063_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cash Flow\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"654\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191462898063_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191462898063_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191462898063_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191462898063_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191462898063_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191462898063_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191462898063_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191462898063_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cash Flow <span>(SHAK Q3 2025 Release)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is also worth noting that it has a relatively low and stable debt level with a long maturity profile. In fact, no amount will mature within a year. Cash alone can cover the whole amount in a single payment even if SHAK doesn’t have to. Indeed, it has a large buffer to sustain its expanding operating capacity. It maintains enough income and cash reserves to expand even without increasing its borrowings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619146859756806_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"777\" data-height=\"772\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619146859756806_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Balance Sheet\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"636\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619146859756806_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619146859756806_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619146859756806_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619146859756806_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619146859756806_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619146859756806_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619146859756806_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619146859756806_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Balance Sheet <span>(SHAK Q3 2025 Release)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The continued price decrease in SHAK makes it even more attractive today. This justifies my Hold rating at $130. And even if I was a bit early to rate it a buy at $99, the dip opens more buying opportunities. This is proven by my updated valuation. As you can see, the price remains cheap relative to previous years. Using P/S, the price only trades at 2.73x versus the five-year average of 3.45x. If I use this to derive the fair value, the target price or TP will be $115.57. The same applies to cash per share as it only trades at 10.23x versus the average of 12.29x. This gives a TP of $109.72. And even if I add a 10% risk consideration, SHAK will still appear quite underpriced due to the new TPs of $104.02 and $98.76.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While price ratios are historical, they can point to the potential direction of the stock price. Note that the regression model in my previous coverage revealed a high correlation between cash per share and the EPS. It also showed that their direct relationship did not happen by chance. So, valuation makes sense today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619148701067393.png?io=w640\" alt=\"P/S And P/CPS Ratio\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">P/S And P/CPS Ratio <span>(Author's Computation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Technicals</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SHAK’s technicals still show bearish tendencies as the price decreases with lower highs and lows. It is also below the 50-day and 200-day SMA, so the downtrend still holds. The 50-day SMA is also still trending downwards below the 200-day SMA, so market sentiment is still quite pessimistic. On the other hand, we can note that the price and 50-day SMA downtrends have flattened a bit recently. This can tell us that buyers have started seeing the current price as an ideal entry point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619149643684638_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"861\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619149643684638_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Technical Analysis\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"287\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619149643684638_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619149643684638_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619149643684638_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619149643684638_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619149643684638_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619149643684638_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619149643684638_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619149643684638_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Technical Analysis <span>(Yahoo Finance)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, MACD and RSI show early bullish divergences. As you can see, the MACD line has increased as the price kept decreasing. This can imply that the stock has become attractive for many buyers. Although it is still within negative territory, it has already crossed above the signal line close to zero, showing that buying volume has increased recently. It is also worth noting that the histogram is moving within positive territory, so buying volume has already outpaced selling volume. RSI may explain this because the stock became oversold, prompting new entries at $91-95. Now, the trend has already normalized, which can lead to consolidation. But since it’s quite close to the oversold region, there is still wide room for buying and may drive some upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619150763464527_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1844\" data-height=\"838\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619150763464527_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Technical Analysis\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"291\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619150763464527_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619150763464527_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619150763464527_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619150763464527_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619150763464527_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619150763464527_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619150763464527_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619150763464527_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Technical Analysis <span>(TradingView)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shake Shack, Inc. remains a strong and well-positioned company, supported by its prudent and cautious expansion and pricing strategies. Fundamentals are also robust, which ensures the longevity and sustainability of its increasing capacity. These aspects can justify its valuation and may prompt upside. Technicals are still bearish, but recent overselling and early bullish tendencies open new buying opportunities. I’m reiterating my Buy rating on SHAK stock.</p>",

And in the lower left corner [brown oval], a group of three dots has formed, which I believe is due to the fact that AbbVie always, in 2022-2025, offers a discount on Humira and also on Rinvoq/Skyrizi.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And again, risks.
