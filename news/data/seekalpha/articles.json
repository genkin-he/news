In an environment shaped by tariffs, geopolitical tension, and inflation concerns, gold often attracts investors seeking stability. That dynamic can amplify the earnings leverage of large miners, particularly those with strong balance sheets following large run-ups in the price of gold. Barrick’s scale and relatively low-cost operations magnify these benefits, especially if investors continue to use gold as a safe haven hedge against economic uncertainty. Setting up the fundamental strengths, I’ll begin with Barrick’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/B/valuation/metrics\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/B/valuation/metrics\" target=\"_blank\">valuation metrics</a>.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50113560-17721391250759883.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Barrick Stock Valuation Metrics\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"596\" height=\"295\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50113560-17721391250759883.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50113560-17721391250759883.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50113560-17721391250759883.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Barrick’s forward non-GAAP P/E of 13.55 offers nearly a 20% discount to sector peers, while its PEG, which factors in the miner’s forward growth potential, is even more attractive at 0.30, offering almost a 77% discount to peers. Supporting the attractive PEG is Barrick’s stellar <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/B/growth\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/B/growth\" target=\"_blank\">growth metrics</a>, which earn it an ‘A’ for its respective Quant Factor grade. The miner’s forward EBITDA growth is nearly 4x the sector median, while its free cash flow per share rate of nearly 72% is more than 4.5X its sector peers. These metrics signal that Barrick Mining is entering a period where rising gold prices and operational efficiency are translating into material future profitability and cash generation. This gives the company greater capacity to fund dividends, reduce debt, and reinvest in high-return projects.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50113560-17721391252319758.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Barrick Stock Growth Metrics\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"595\" height=\"620\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50113560-17721391252319758.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50113560-17721391252319758.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50113560-17721391252319758.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Geopolitical tensions and tariff-driven economic uncertainty can continue to support gold prices in 2026, which can translate into free cash flow for miners, which helps explain renewed interest in this space.

Like Barrick, CDE's hard asset connection can work well in a macro environment shaped by tariff uncertainty, geopolitical tension, and stagflationary pressures. While large miners provide stability, mid-tier names like Coeur tend to respond more quickly to rising metal prices, and the stock has been a member of the flagship <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/alpha-picks/picks/current\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/alpha-picks/picks/current\" target=\"_blank\">Alpha Picks portfolio</a> since Sept. 15, 2025, and returned 52%-plus to the portfolio.

In the current policy environment, domestic semiconductor capacity has taken on strategic importance, while the rapid growth of AI workloads is dramatically increasing demand for advanced memory. Each new generation of AI servers requires significantly more high-performance memory, giving suppliers substantial operating leverage during upcycles. From a Quant perspective, MU is a textbook example of how a seemingly overpriced AI stock with incredible performance momentum can continue to defy the expectations of many investors and analysts. How can a stock that has jumped nearly 360% in one year, and almost 50% year-to-date continue to perform?

On the surface, a stock with a share price above $400 and a trailing P/E of 38.03 can appear unattractive to a value investor. But when forward earnings growth has incredible potential, the valuation story flips. For example, MU’s forward P/E of 12.65 offers a 43.7% discount to the technology sector median, and its PEG of 0.22 is nearly an 85% discount to those sector peers. I then naturally turn to the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU/growth\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU/growth\" target=\"_blank\">Quant Growth</a> metrics to help support the PEG. MU’s Growth Grade of ‘A+’ is well supported by multiple metrics, including its forward EBITDA growth of over 99%, which is over 6.5x the sector median. Its incredible Levered FCF Growth of over 1600% shows immense profitability, debt capacity, and ability to fund growth internally.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50113560-17721391256287525.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MU Stock Growth Grade\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"590\" height=\"624\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50113560-17721391256287525.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50113560-17721391256287525.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50113560-17721391256287525.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If tariffs and geopolitical friction accelerate investment in domestic technology infrastructure, Micron’s position within the semiconductor industry could become even more valuable.

Precious metals miners like Barrick and Coeur can benefit from safe-haven demand fueled by geopolitical tensions and inflation concerns, while global platforms like Amazon may gain from shifting supply chains and resilient consumer activity. At the same time, the relentless expansion of artificial intelligence infrastructure continues to create opportunities in certain semiconductor names like Micron and Advanced Micro Devices. Together, these dynamics illustrate how investors can identify both direct and indirect beneficiaries of policy change. In a market defined by uncertainty yet driven by powerful technological trends, a diversified approach across commodities, platforms, and AI infrastructure may prove especially valuable for investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We have many stocks with strong buy recommendations, and you can filter them using <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/screeners#hasComeFromMpArticle=true#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/screeners#hasComeFromMpArticle=true#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\" target=\"_blank\">Stock Screens</a> to suit your specific investment objectives.

At quarter-end, the fund’s 30-day SEC yield was 5.05% subsidized and 4.81% unsubsidized for institutional shares.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund increased its emerging market exposure across equities and local-currency debt, and rotated equity positioning by adding global health care and defense-focused stocks. Growth exposure was trimmed in favor of more attractively-valued non-cyclical and defensive segments, alongside a modest tactical increase in the overall equity allocation.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Contributors</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positive performance was led by strong security selection among U.S. equities, as the team’s bespoke allocations were supported by resilient economic data and earnings momentum. The fund’s overweight allocation to equities was additive in a risk-supportive environment. Selection within U.S. investment grade corporate bonds contributed amid stable credit fundamentals, while an overweight position in floating rate assets provided a modest benefit as policy rates remained elevated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Detractors</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main detractors were an underweight exposure to international equities and weaker security selection in international markets, as improved growth expectations and supportive policy measures drove positive performance outside the United States. Infrastructure equity selection was detrimental, though to a lesser extent, as long-end rate volatility pressured yield-sensitive assets. In addition, the fund’s long Japanese yen position detracted as the currency weakened materially against the U.S. dollar.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further insight</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We continue to expect more attractive opportunities in equities relative to credit, as spreads remain tight and offer limited scope for further compression. Given elevated U.S. equity market concentration, we foresee a broadening of market leadership to support dividend- oriented equities. We maintain an underweight exposure to duration(interest rate sensitivity) as a risk-management measure, amid ongoing long-end rate volatility and uncertainty about the persistence of inflation. Within credit, we continue to favor high- quality investment grade and securitized assets over high yield, where valuations remain stretched. Overall, we expect equity income strategies to remain well supported by resilient earnings growth and a gradual broadening of market participation into 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50624080-1772189288093981.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"401\" height=\"78\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50624080-1772189288093981.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50624080-1772189288093981.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Institutional shares rated against 80 Us Fund Conservative Allocation Funds, as of 12/31/25, based on risk-adjusted total return.

The index is designed to reflect the performance of equities in the parent index(excluding REITs) with higher dividend income and quality characteristics than average dividend yields that are both sustainable and persistent. The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is a broad-based flagship benchmark that measures the investment grade, U.S. dollar-denominated, fixed-rate taxable bond market. The Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High Yield 2% Issuer Capped Index— an unmanaged index comprised of issues that meet the following criteria: at least$150 million par value outstanding, maximum credit rating of Ba1, at least one year to maturity, and no one issuer represents more than 2 percent of the index.<strong>‡</strong> The Morningstar Rating TM for funds, or \"star rating\", is calculated for managed products(including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year(if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. The fund was rated against the following numbers of U.S.-domiciled Us Fund Conservative Allocation funds over the following time periods:80 in the last 3 years, 77 in the last 5 years and 58 in the last 10 years. With respect to these Us Fund Conservative Allocation funds, the fund received a Morningstar Rating of 4, 4 and 4 stars for the 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively. Other classes may have different performance characteristics.</p> <p><em>You</em> <em>should</em> <em>consider</em> <em>the</em> <em>investment</em> <em>objectives,</em> <em>risks,</em> <em>charges</em> <em>and</em> <em>expenses</em> <em>of</em> <em>the</em> <em>fund</em> <em>carefully</em> <em>before</em> <em>investing.</em> <em>The</em> <em>prospectus</em> <em>and,</em> <em>if</em> <em>available,</em> <em>the</em> <em>summary</em> <em>prospectus</em> <em>contain</em> <em>this</em> <em>and</em> <em>other</em> <em>information</em> <em>about</em> <em>the</em> <em>fund</em> <em>and</em> <em>are</em> <em>available,</em> <em>along</em> <em>with</em> <em>information</em> <em>on</em> <em>other</em> <em>BlackRock</em> <em>funds,</em> <em>by</em> <em>calling</em> <em>800-882-0052</em> <em>or</em> <em>from</em> <em>your</em> <em>financial</em> <em>professional.</em> <em>The</em> <em>prospectus</em> <em>should</em> <em>be</em> <em>read</em> <em>carefully</em> <em>before</em> <em>investing.</em></p> <p>©2026 BlackRock, Inc. or its affiliates.

Since then, Everpure has made some critical business model changes that I think will position the company well for continued growth and margin expansion this year. Amid a share price that remains down from TTM highs just shy of $100 (notched briefly in October), I reiterate my<strong> buy</strong> rating here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a reminder, Everpure's core business is selling \"storage as a service,\" which it's now increasingly rebranding as data management. The company essentially makes it easy for companies to offload their IT backend storage needs to Everpure, which sells integrated hardware servers and software tools to manage storage needs. Increasingly, more of the company's sales are going to hyperscaler cloud companies, which have an insatiable demand for new data center capacity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since last quarter, a lot has changed fundamentally for this company beyond just a corporate name rebrand (which is intended to reduce the company’s association with storage, which was initially an oversupplied commodity, and move toward data management as a strategic value-add). To me, these are all changes that position the company well for earnings growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First: Everpure raised its prices on February 9. The company had initially delayed price increases to try to prioritize share growth, but amid rising component prices, the company is making the decision to protect margins. We think this is a good environment for a price increase, since customers are now well aware of the memory shortage and prepared to lock in higher prices in order to secure supply. Speaking to the price bump on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874904-everpure-pstg-q4-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">Q4 earnings call,</a> CEO Charlie Giancarlo noted as follows:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Everpure raised prices on our product line on February 9th reflecting the dramatic and rapid rise in component prices. I believe we were the last in our industry to raise prices, and I also believe that our increase was the lowest in the industry, to protect our customers. Based on the extraordinary rapid rise in component costs, we expect product gross margins in Q1 to be at the lower end of our typical range of 65-70%.”</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A major reason Everpure’s stock has wavered over the past year is scrutiny over the company’s weakening gross margin profile (though we note that for a company previously considered a commodity, a mid-60s margin isn’t at all disappointing). This move to right-size prices is a tailwind to revenue growth and will help in the profit margin rebound.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other move that Everpure is making (which perhaps Wall Street is cheering more) is that going forward, it will no longer be securing NAND supply on behalf of its hyperscaler customers (such as Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) and Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), which are the leading capex spenders in the AI boom), which, needless to say, is becoming an increasingly sizable chunk of Everpure’s business. This reduces Everpure’s exposure to volatile prices, with hyperscalers owning supply procurement agreements with major suppliers like Micron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU\" title=\"Micron Technology, Inc.\">MU</a>), which are constrained through the visible future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In spite of the recent upswing in growth and strong actions to protect the company’s margins, Everpure still trades at very reasonable valuations against forward expectations. At current post-earnings share prices near $66, Everpure trades at a market cap of $21.78 billion. Netting off the $1.55 billion of cash (which is now completely debt free) from Everpure’s latest balance sheet gives us an enterprise value of $20.23 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For FY27 (the year for Everpure ending in January 2027), the company is guiding to $4.30-$4.40 billion in revenue, or 17-20% y/y growth. It’s expecting particularly robust Q1 revenue growth of 27-30% y/y, a sharp acceleration from 20% growth in Q4. Management is also expecting a midpoint ~26% growth in pro forma operating income to ~$800 million, or an 18.4% midpoint margin that’s up 110 bps y/y - a relief for investors who had worried about possible margin compression amid rising component costs and a statement to the benefits of the company’s recent price increases and passing on NAND procurement burden to customers. If we assume FCF grows at the same 26% y/y pace as operating income (a conservative assumption, given that Everpure will be procuring fewer commodities in FY27 versus FY26 and thus has less inventory burden), FY27 FCF would be $776 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-1772080735822354_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1198\" data-height=\"440\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-1772080735822354_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Everpure outlook\" width=\"640\" height=\"235\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"235\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-1772080735822354_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-1772080735822354_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-1772080735822354_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-1772080735822354_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Everpure outlook <span>(Everpure Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This positions Everpure’s valuation multiples at:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>4.6x EV/FY27 revenue</li> <li>25.3x EV/FY27 FCF</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, this isn’t a bargain stock (for bargains, look to the adjacent enterprise software sector).

Also, revenue growth accelerated meaningfully from 16% growth in Q3 and is expected to continue accelerating to a stunning 27-30% range in Q1. All of these are healthy indicators that AI is providing a true, durable tailwind for Everpure’s business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the core metrics we’re looking at that further crystallizes the rampant nature of the current demand for storage products is Everpure’s RPO, or essentially backlog. RPO in the fourth quarter surged 40% y/y to $3.67 billion, adding $728 million in net new backlog in this quarter alone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-17720808552602553_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1212\" data-height=\"670\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-17720808552602553_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Everpure RPO\" width=\"640\" height=\"354\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"354\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-17720808552602553_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-17720808552602553_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-17720808552602553_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-17720808552602553_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Everpure RPO <span>(Everpure Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking to momentum on sales to hyperscalers and the NAND procurement change on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874904-everpure-pstg-q4-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">Q4 earnings call</a>, CFO Tarek Robbiati noted as follows:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>First and foremost, and specifically for our hyperscaler business, I would like to remind everyone that we started ramping our hyperscaler line of business in fiscal year '26 and feel very confident about the future of our business for years to come. We expect to significantly accelerate shipments and revenues in fiscal year '27 relative to fiscal year '26. This momentum is reflected in our strong fiscal year '27 guidance. As a reminder, hyperscaler revenues are governed by the schedule of hyperscalers data center buildouts and are not linear during the course of the year.</p> <p>For fiscal year '27, we expect the majority of revenue from hyperscalers to be recognized in Q3 and Q4. Also, we have now standardized our business model to cater for the hyperscaler market. Moving forward, we will procure some of the components that are needed by hyperscalers to build their solution in their environment, but not the NAND. Hyperscalers will continue to procure the NAND through their supply chain. As a result, we expect gross margins of hyperscaler revenues to range between 75% to 85%, a level accretive to product revenue gross margins and overall company gross margins.\"</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company notes additionally that another factor driving strong sales is that Everpure has broadened its storage options, ranging from higher performance (and higher cost) to lower-cost storage for less-critical workloads. It’s now becoming more of a one-stop shop for a company needing data management and storage for multiple workstreams, boosting the company’s potential wallet share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the profitability front, as expected, the company's product gross margins slid sequentially to 67.3% (though still improved on a y/y basis). Meanwhile, total gross margins still rose y/y to 71.4%, helped by richer subscription margins. We expect the company's price increases to help stabilize product margins into FY27.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-17720808226794844_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1214\" data-height=\"676\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-17720808226794844_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Everpure gross margins\" width=\"640\" height=\"356\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"356\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-17720808226794844_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-17720808226794844_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-17720808226794844_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-17720808226794844_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Everpure gross margins <span>(Everpure Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stacked on top of strong opex discipline, the company also achieved 100 bps of sequential operating margin improvement to 21.3% (also a ~4 point y/y rise):</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-1772080839109788_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1210\" data-height=\"682\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-1772080839109788_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Everpure operating margins\" width=\"640\" height=\"361\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"361\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-1772080839109788_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-1772080839109788_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-1772080839109788_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/33427965-1772080839109788_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Everpure operating margins <span>(Everpure Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pro forma EPS of $0.69 also beat Street expectations of $0.64 with 8% upside.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks and Key Takeaways</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, there are a number of risks that we need to keep in mind here as well. At some point, hyperscaler capex will peak (2026 could very well be the peak year for datacenter investments, as Meta and Microsoft are under market pressure to show returns on AI spending). Present levels of demand may taper off, and Everpure will be pressured to find other sources of net-new business. We note as well that while Pure Storage is no longer committing to procuring NAND on behalf of its customers, it still is procuring other key components - any of which could become the bottleneck in the datacenter supply chain.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, I see more upside than risk in this stock. Everpure remains on track for a big year in FY27. Unprecedented demand from hyperscalers is fueling expectations for sharp revenue acceleration in Q1, while the company is also turning more structurally profitable thanks to its recent February price increases as well as passing on the burden of NAND price volatility to its hyperscaler partners. Stay long here and use the post-earnings dip as a buying opportunity.</p>",

The housing market has been caught in a state of stasis. Owners who locked in ultra-low rates in the 2s, 3s, or 4s have been reluctant to give up those cheap loans by selling. Buyers have been reluctant to buy because rates in the 6s and 7s have made monthly payments too high. As a result, home listings, sales, and pricing have remained weak for a few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But as I noted several weeks ago, lower rates could break the logjam! Taking out a big, round number will also get the attention of buyers <em>and</em> sellers - especially since it’s <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/economy/housing/mortgage-rates-fall-below-6-for-the-first-time-since-2022-f572ed7e?mod=hp_lead_pos1\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">being widely reported</a> in the press.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The two housing ETFs I wrote about last month are trouncing the State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (<a href=\"https://www.moneyshow.com/quotes/?symbol=spy\" rel=\"noopener\">SPY</a>) so far in 2026. The State Street SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF (<a href=\"https://www.moneyshow.com/quotes/?symbol=xhb\" rel=\"noopener\">XHB</a>) is up 10.8% year-to-date, while the iShares US Home Construction ETF (<a href=\"https://www.moneyshow.com/quotes/?symbol=itb\" rel=\"noopener\">ITB</a>) is up 10.5%. That compares to just 1.6% for SPY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If mortgage rates continue on their current trajectory, that outperformance could be just the beginning. And in a year where <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872929-money-leaving-tech-how-should-you-diversify\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">rotation is the name of the game</a>, home building, real estate, and construction stocks could be just what your portfolio needs to pile up more profits!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Originally published on <a href=\"https://www.moneyshow.com/articles/tradingidea-64888/chart-of-the-day-2-27-26-mortgages-take-out-6-helping-this-sector/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MoneyShow.com</a></em></p>",

Although the figures are slightly higher than<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the consensus forecast, this rise was expected on our side: it is mainly explained by less favourable base effects. In February 2025, regulated gas tariffs had been cut by 15% following a government decision. That decrease has now dropped out of the price index calculation, as regulated gas tariffs have since remained stable. This mechanically contributes to the rise in the inflation rate. In addition, energy prices on global markets have edged up slightly. Overall, energy inflation is now down only 3% year-on-year, compared with a 7.6% fall in January.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond these energy-related base effects, inflationary pressures remain moderate. Services inflation is still contained at 1.8% year-on-year, following 1.7% in January, whereas Insee was still expecting a rate close to 2% for February in its December forecast. This moderation in services prices helps to limit the overall increase in inflation. Prices of manufactured goods are falling year-on-year (-0.3%), but the decline is less pronounced than in January (-1.2%), notably due to a different timing of the sales period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the coming months, a further small rise in headline inflation is likely, as energy base effects gradually become less favourable. Energy inflation should therefore move back into positive territory. This does not, however, signal a marked resurgence in inflationary pressures. On the contrary, inflation in France should remain subdued in the months ahead and fluctuate within a range of 1% to 1.5%. France should therefore continue to be among the countries with the lowest inflation rates in the euro area.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The labour market lacks momentum</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, Insee today published employment data for the fourth quarter of 2025, showing a slight decline in salaried employment (-0.1% quarter on quarter, i.e., 40,100 jobs lost), following stability in the third quarter. Salaried employment is now down 0.2% year-on-year (-45,900 jobs), while remaining well above its pre-pandemic level (+4.9%, or +1.3 million jobs). Data on self-employment, which is generally more dynamic, has not yet been published.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the French labour market therefore remains relatively resilient, with limited job losses. Nevertheless, the lack of momentum is evident, and the likelihood of a turnaround with strongly positive net job creation remains low in the coming months. The employment climate, as measured by the Insee survey, deteriorated further in February, with business leaders showing increased caution regarding hiring. It is therefore likely that France will continue to record slight job losses in the coming months, even though we do not expect a collapse in the labour market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, economic growth should remain positive but moderate in the absence of a genuine short-term growth driver. We are forecasting GDP growth of 1.0% in 2026, after 0.9% in 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

The U.S. government shutdown—lasting a record 43 days—created a significant information vacuum just<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> as markets sought clarity on growth, inflation, and policy trajectories. Despite the data fog, the global macro backdrop proved “good enough” for risk assets. Global growth held firm, inflation stayed sticky but avoided more disruptive outcomes, and most central banks leaned more accommodative than hawkish. In the U.S., elevated downside labor market risk kept U.S. Federal Reserve (“Fed”) easing in play, leading to rate cuts even as the economy expanded. However, policymaker dissents emerged as the Fed Funds rate approached the Federal Open Market Committee’s neutral estimate. International markets—particularly Japan and parts of Europe—offered broadly supportive signals, though political uncertainty occasionally weighed on European sentiment. Since mid-2024, most major developed market central banks have cut rates by 150-200 basis points (1.50%-2.00%) or more, meaning some could be close to the end of their easing cycle. The Bank of Japan remains on a separate trajectory with a gradual pace of rate hikes from a highly accommodative starting point, including two in 2025 and two more expected in 2026. Overall, the global tariff environment proved less disruptive than earlier fears. U.S. monthly tariff collections rose but remained well below levels implied by announced policies, while statutory rates edged lower as deals and exemptions took hold. Still, investors monitored persistent trade-related risks alongside other potential headwinds, including slower AI investment, labor market softening, bond market volatility tied to inflation or fiscal stress, and ongoing risk of geopolitical shocks.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financial markets capped a strong 2025 with 4Q gains across both equities and fixed income. Many fixed income segments gained around 1%. The Treasury yield curve steepened as short-end rates dropped following multiple rate cuts in the quarter by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Credit spreads were mostly unchanged in both investment grade and high yield, ending near their lowest levels in 2025. Global equities added a little more than 3% as non-U.S. regions outperformed the U.S. in U.S. dollar terms (despite slight U.S. dollar strengthening). U.S. equity returns were positive (roughly 2.5%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The U.S. Federal Reserve continued easing, delivering 25-basis point (0.25%) cuts at each of its two meetings. However, an increase in hawkish dissents and adjustments to the policy statement signaled a higher threshold for future reductions. Even so, ongoing easing contributed to further steepening of the Treasury curve, as front-end yields through five years moved lower. The 2‑ year yield ended the quarter at 3.47%, down 14 basis points (0.14%). In contrast, longer-term rates remained more resilient, with the 10-year yield up 2 basis points (0.02%) to 4.17%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment grade (IG) credit spreads widened by 3 basis points (0.03%) to 0.73%, while high-yield (HY) spreads tightened by 1 basis point (0.01%) to 2.66%. In terms of return, IG fixed income gained 1.1%, with high yield slightly outperforming at 1.3%. Periods of short-lived weakness followed by a strong recovery mirrored the pattern seen throughout most of the year. As a result, credit spreads enter 2026 below where they began 2025 across many quality buckets. Fundamentals continue to look healthy, but AI-related capex is helping to accelerate corporate debt issuance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Explanation of Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">High Yield Fixed Income had positive performance October through December, adding to an already positive year. The broad High Yield index returned 131 basis points (1.31%) for the quarter, ending the year up 8.62% as measured by the Bloomberg US Corporate High Yield Issuer Capped 2% Index. Healthcare and Finance Companies led sector performance over the final quarter of 2025. Healthcare benefitted from positive earnings and sector rotation as the market sought quality while interest rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve and steepening of the yield curve helped Finance Companies. Packaging and Railroads lagged sector performance over the quarter. Packaging underperformed on concerns about some of the more highly leveraged issuers addressing upcoming maturities while softening freight volumes and high fixed costs negatively affected Railroads.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">High Yield recorded positive inflows October through December with $3.8 billion entering the asset class (Source: Lipper). The primary market issued $65 billion over the quarter, capping a very busy year as $331 billion was issued throughout 2025, the busiest year since 2021 ($469 billion) (Source: Barclays). Companies have taken advantage of market strength to proactively address funding needs. We view this as a positive to underlying fundamentals for our market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund outperformed its benchmark. An overweight to CCC rated bonds helped performance while an underweight to BB rated bonds was a detractor. An overweight to Independent Energy was a positive while overweighting Midstream lessened performance. Security selection within Media &amp; Entertainment and Healthcare was beneficial to performance while security selection within Cable &amp; Satellite and Utilities and Consumer Cyclical Services detracted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Holdings are subject to change and current and future portfolio holdings are subject to risk.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td colspan=\"4\"><p><strong>Performance as of 12/31/2025</strong></p></td> <td colspan=\"4\"><p><strong>Annualized Returns</strong></p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>FUND</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>QTR</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>YTD</strong></p></td> <td> <p><strong>1</strong></p> <p><strong>Year</strong></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>3</strong></p> <p><strong>Year</strong></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Year</strong></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>10</strong></p> <p><strong>Year</strong></p> </td> <td><p><strong>Since Inception*</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Gross Expense Ratio</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Net Expense Ratio</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>High Yield Fixed Income</p></td> <td><p>1.42%</p></td> <td><p>8.74%</p></td> <td><p>8.74%</p></td> <td><p>10.18%</p></td> <td><p>4.49%</p></td> <td><p>5.83%</p></td> <td><p>5.68%</p></td> <td><p>0.66%</p></td> <td><p>0.61%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Bloomberg US Corp HY 2% Issuer Capped Index 1</p></td> <td><p>1.31%</p></td> <td><p>8.62%</p></td> <td><p>8.62%</p></td> <td><p>10.06%</p></td> <td><p>4.50%</p></td> <td><p>6.52%</p></td> <td><p>6.52%</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">*Inception Date- 12/31/98</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>1</strong> <strong>Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High Yield 2% Issuer Capped Index</strong> is an unmanaged index that measures the market of U.S. dollar-denominated, non-investment grade, fixed-rate, taxable corporate bonds.

With tenant defaults in 2025 and cannabis rescheduling uncertain, the share price remains depressed, but I think the valuation is finally attractive.</p> <h2>Summary of Previous<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> Thesis</span> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The first time I covered this company was almost two years ago, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4692948-innovative-industrial-properties-fair-price-no-signs-of-recreating-its-past\">in May 2024</a>. At the time, IIPR was still a cannabis pure play, by way of its REIT structure. General sentiment about cannabis at that time was positive, but I declined to rate their shares a Buy. I did acknowledge the positives that came with this investment:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Listing on a major exchange, rare for any cannabis company</li> <li>First mover as a cannabis REIT</li> <li>Steady profits</li> <li>Low-risk, triple-net leasing model</li> <li>Virtually zero debt</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I largely felt that IIPR lacked room for growth, with much of the cannabis market developed at that time. I wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Cannabis continues to be a popular search among stocks for outsized returns on waves of legalization. With IIP, a honeymoon of vertical growth rates seems to be behind it, and there are no obvious catalysts to this company taking off. Rather, it will be a game of managing the current portfolio and working with tenants to improve the properties, while incrementally adding new tenants as more layers of legalization come down and bring more growth into the industry.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It just didn't seem discounted for what seemed likely to be slower growth ahead, hence my Hold rating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strategic Adjustment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cannabis investing depends heavily on politics. Former optimism hinged on the Biden Administration's intentions to reschedule cannabis as a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This would pose enormous tax benefits, improving the cash flow for tenants across IIPR's portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Biden's exit from the 2024 election and Harris's defeat created much more uncertainty on this, and previous rescheduling efforts halted under Trump. Cyclical factors, <a href=\"https://www.supplychainbrain.com/articles/42797-behind-the-us-cannabis-industrys-oversupply-battle\" rel=\"nofollow\">such as oversupply</a> and <a href=\"https://www.blankrome.com/publications/cannabis-industrys-6-billion-debt-wall\" rel=\"nofollow\">upcoming debt maturities</a>, weakened many operators. IIPR therefore announced <a href=\"https://investors.innovativeindustrialproperties.com/news/news-details/2025/Innovative-Industrial-Properties-Announces-Strategic-and-Diversifying-270-Million-Investment-in-Life-Science-Real-Estate-Platform-08-06-2025/default.aspx\" rel=\"noopener\">a strategic pivot</a> in August 2025. They would be diversifying into life sciences, not longer purely owning and acquiring cannabis properties.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It indicated the limited growth available to cannabis that I worried was present. Management finally seemed to concur and acted accordingly. Unlike their cannabis portfolio, which consists of directly owned assets, the shift into life sciences is done through investment in IQHQ, Inc., a life sciences real estate platform. The two primary investment vehicles entail:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Providing a $100M credit facility at 13.5% interest</li> <li>Purchase of $170M of IQHQ's preferred stock at a 15% yield</li> <li>(Thirdly, conditional warrants to buy equity in IQHQ)</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Put in simple terms, IIPR is acting as equity REIT in cannabis and mortgage REIT in life sciences with this shift.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Full-Year 2025 Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The full-year results and <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001677576/0d690613-d8b8-49aa-853f-281255fb9d51.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">latest Form 10K</a> illustrate the issues that hit IIPR's portfolio.

It is still primarily a REIT and business exposed to the strengths and weakness of cannabis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook and Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I wrote about IIPR the first time, it was valued $107 per share, had market cap over $3B, and a dividend yield of about 6.5%. Now, it's $53, has a market cap of $1.4B, and dividend yield of 14.8%. Just on valuation alone, it's a very different prospect, but we still need to assess if it's a good price, taking into account the changed fundamentals and the outlook they support.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, how sustainable in the $7.60 annual dividend?

But what we're seeing is this return to growth, and we're seeing strong re-leasing activity, which is driving revenues. And we continue to see -- and we have the resolutions of some of these major lease or major litigations. And with those resolutions and the activity -- the leasing activity we're seeing, we continuously feel positive about where we are with regards to our dividend.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's very plausible that the dividend could be trimmed a bit (perhaps as low as $7.00) if upcoming quarters have enough non-recurring cash expenses. Even so, that's still about a 13% yield on cost, giving IIPR something of a risk premium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">An example of non-recurring cash items may include refinancing the 2026 notes, which come due this May. In the Form 10K, management stated:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>As of December 31, 2025, the outstanding principal balance on our Notes due 2026 was $291.2 million and we plan to refinance these notes prior to maturity in May 2026.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">No announcement has been made, but the Form 10K also mentions that these notes were issued in 2021, when interest rates were much lower and when IIPR was given an investment-grade credit rating. The rating is intact, but interest rates are up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-17720683452147272_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"861\" data-height=\"276\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-17720683452147272_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Screenshot\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"205\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-17720683452147272_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-17720683452147272_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-17720683452147272_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-17720683452147272_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">US 5Y Note (Seeking Alpha)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assuming another five-year issue, the 5Y Note (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US5Y\" class=\"ticker-link\">US5Y</a>) rose from about 0.80% to 3.63%, more recently. As the 2026 notes bear 5.5% interest, it's conceivable they would need to be refinanced at 8%. With a $291M balance, that would be a $7.2M annual difference, plus a few million related to underwriting and repurchasing the old notes. With AFFO already too low at $205M for 2025, this friction doesn't help. The concern isn't in ability to refinance, so much as it is the higher cost of capital going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I am less worried about the durability of their cannabis portfolio than before. This is because President Trump announced in December, for the first time, that he was <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/increasing-medical-marijuana-and-cannabidiol-research/\" rel=\"nofollow\">committed to rescheduling</a> cannabis to Schedule III. While the long-term pacing of this is still unclear, it bodes well for these assets, whose tenants have been in a cyclical rut.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This improvement, plus the substantially lower valuation (14.8% dividend, 7x AFFO multiple), make IIPR worth upgrading to Buy. Nevertheless, let's keep in mind a major <strong>risk factor</strong>, besides any implicit to a dividend trim.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Several of their major tenants have significant debt and questionable cash flow to repay it:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Ascend Wellness Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAWH\" title=\"Ascend Wellness Holdings, Inc.\">AAWH</a>)</li> <li>Curaleaf (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CURLF\" title=\"Curaleaf Holdings, Inc.\">CURLF</a>)</li> <li>Cannabit (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CBSTF\" title=\"The Cannabist Company Holdings Inc.\">CBSTF</a>)</li> <li>4Front (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FFNTF\" title=\"4Front Ventures Corp.\">FFNTF</a>) (This is <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/4front-initiates-bankruptcy-and-insolvency-act-proceedings-in-canada-302478172.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">in receivership</a>)</li> <li>Cresco (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRLBF\" title=\"Cresco Labs Inc.\">CRLBF</a>)</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are five that have publicly available financial data and account for 36.1% of the portfolio's ABR. If they all become distressed, then IIPR would have to worry about more than a trimmed dividend. Depending on how soon Trump reschedules cannabis, many of these companies could end up in a similar spot as 4Front, leading to defaults and lack of payments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IIPR can find new tenants among better-capitalized operators in the industry, but this would take time, possibly eliminating the dividend in the meantime.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The risk to IIPR's cannabis properties still loom and have, in part, materialized. The high-yield investments in life sciences, unexpected tailwinds from rescheduling under Trump, and heavily reduced valuation, however, make the shares more attractive than before. With the dividend now more properly representing a risk premium, I upgrade IIPR to Buy.</p>",

At the same time, however, the fact that the absolute number of those unemployed remains<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> above the politically important 3 million is anything but good news. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate remained unchanged at 6.3%.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">No turning point in sight yet</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the last four years, German unemployment has increased by some 500,000. This gradual worsening reflects textbook economics; with the economy effectively stagnating for more than five years and industry facing severe structural challenges, a deterioration in the labour market was inevitable. At the same time, employment has started to gradually drop since last summer, providing additional evidence of a structurally changing labour market: a shrinking working force due to demographics, sectoral and geographical shifts due to the industrial transition and higher entrance barriers for graduates due to AI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, the number of vacancies has come down further and even if employment plans in both manufacturing and services have started to rebound, we see the gradual worsening of the labour market continuing throughout the year. Previous and potential additional announcements of cost-cutting measures across the automotive and other industries as well as the continuing increase in bankruptcies suggest that conditions will first worsen before they improve. The AI disruption of the labour market could add to this. If we are right and the cyclical recovery of the German economy unfolds over the coming months, the labour market, however, should stabilise towards the end of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, today's labour market report sends a mixed message but definitely no signs of a turning point. Instead, the gradual worsening looks set to continue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

Since its publication, the Ashtead share price has moved up 23%. (Since that piece was<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> published, as part of ongoing portfolio reallocation, I have sold my stake in Ashtead).</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With its primary listing due to move to New York next month, alongside plans to host an investor day in the city, now seems like an apposite time to provide a snapshot of the company’s health.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Basic Investment Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In June, and previous pieces, I set out what I see as the investment thesis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plant rental is a large market and one that benefits from some attractive economic characteristics. Demand can often be high, contracts can stretch for months or years, specialist requirements can make some customers effectively captives. Ashtead has rolled up lots of smaller businesses over the years and also taken a strategic approach to business building. That has given it economies of scale and attractive profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One ongoing risk, though, is the inherently cyclical nature of plant rental. As the economy weakens and construction activity reduces, rental providers like Ashtead can be left holding the baby in terms of having lots of capital tied up in pricy plant that lies idle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What sets Ashtead apart from many rivals, in my view, is how strategic it has been about growing the business, through a series of strategic growth plans. In my prior piece, I reckoned that Ashtead was undervalued given its proven business model and North American focus.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Financial Year Shows Modest Revenue Growth but Reduced Profitability</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In December, the company released its <a href=\"https://www.ashtead-group.com/newsroom/news/2025/unaudited-results-for-the-half-year-and-second-quarter-ended-31-october-2025/\" rel=\"nofollow\">results for the first half of its current financial year</a>. These were fine at the top line, though less impressive at the bottom line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenues rose 1% year-on-year, but a 9% decline in operating profit fed through to a 10% fall in pre-tax profit. Revenue performance was the same across both the first and second quarter, but those profit metrics were both sequentially worse in the second quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17720824767495081_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"967\" data-height=\"405\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17720824767495081_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Ashtead interim results topline\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"268\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17720824767495081_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17720824767495081_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17720824767495081_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17720824767495081_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Company interim results announcement</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company struck an upbeat note about current demand, saying that it continued to see “positive leading indicators for local non-residential construction activity”. It also launched a new $1.5bn share buyback, which I see as a strong sign of management confidence coming hot on the heels of $714m of buybacks in the first half.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the full year, the company is guiding for rental revenue growth of 0%-4%, and free cash flow of $2.2bn-$2.5bn. That compares favourably to last year’s free cash inflow of $1.8bn.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Can Ashtead Step Up a Gear?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the long run, Ashtead has performed phenomenally well. It is up 6,410% since the start of 2010, for example.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But the current outlook feels more like “steady as she goes” rather than transformative to the investment case. Meanwhile, an uncertain outlook for the U.S. economy and therefore for the construction market in general (and the plant rental market within it specifically) poses a risk to revenues and profits over the coming years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have outlined in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4761832-ashtead-long-term-drivers-remain-positive\">previous pieces</a> on the name that the company’s strategic plans have helped it perform very well in the past and I expect the same of its current plan (<a href=\"https://www.ashtead-group.com/about-us/strategic-review/our-strategic-priorities/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sunbelt 4.0</a>). Indeed, in its interim results the company specifically noted, “As we execute on Sunbelt 4.0, we expect a number of years of strong earnings and free cash flow generation”. Ashtead’s free cash flow generation is substantial and I do think it has the potential to keep that flowing if the construction market holds up. As it points out, having invested heavily in infrastructure under its previous strategic plan, it is now trying to make the most of that infrastructure to generate revenues and, thereby, cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But while I like the business, see it as very well run and also appreciate the financial potential of Sunbelt 4.0, I do not see transformational growth drivers in the coming year or two. The fact that the year’s outlook for rental revenue has at its bottom end a flat year-on-year performance underlines that point I feel.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Does Not Now Look Compelling</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently Ashtead’s price-to-earnings ratio is 22, which is a bit steeper than I would like to find it attractive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the interim point, net debt was $10.5bn. The current market cap is $29.7bn, making for an enterprise value of $40.2bn. Last year’s cash flow from operating activities was $2.2bn. I expect this year’s may be higher given the company’s guidance on cash flow overall, but using last year’s number, the current enterprise value is around 18 times operating cash flow. Again, I do not find that especially attractive but I do at least think it is justifiable for a proven company with ongoing growth potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I expect the switch to a primary listing in New York City to give the share price some benefit as it will help it to access deeper liquidity more easily, in an end market that anyway accounts for most of its business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, as outlined above, I see current share price as reasonable rather than attractive to start a position and accordingly, on valuation grounds, am downgrading my rating from “buy” to “hold”.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
