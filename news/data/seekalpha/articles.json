While I acknowledge that the risk of a dividend cut even for Blackstone Secured Lending has increased lately, I maintain a strong buy rating on BXSL based on the fact that the BDC is oversold and undervalued.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well-performing private credit platform with excess coverage</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Q4 2025 earnings scorecard of Blackstone Secured Lending was defined by a Y/Y drop-off in net investment income, which is the key figure that investors pay attention to in order to calculate dividend payout ratios. Blackstone Secured Lending saw $0.80 per share in net investment income, which was <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556554-blackstone-secured-lending-gaap-nii-of-080-beats-by-002-tii-of-358m-misses-by-154m\">$0.02 better than expected</a>, but the BDC's income nonetheless dropped 4.8% year-over-year due to falling interest income.

BDCs with heavy SaaS exposure have seen massive valuation declines as investors fear that AI-driven tech will make certain software products obsolete, thereby negatively affecting valuations of loans made to SaaS and software companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While this story may make for interesting headlines, there is no concrete evidence that AI is actually having a negative impact on the sector's overall loan performance. While BXSL has a high percentage of loans to the software sector, about 21%, the underlying credit and NII performance look solid enough to me to maintain a strong buy rating. For comparison, Ares Capital, Blue Owl Capital, and Hercules Capital have SaaS/software exposure percentages of 24%, 11%, and 35%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53926820-17720327983818784.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Blackstone Secured Lending\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"582\" height=\"625\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53926820-17720327983818784.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53926820-17720327983818784.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53926820-17720327983818784.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Blackstone Secured Lending</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>High excess safety margin for BXSL</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even higher-quality BDCs have been rerated lower in recent months due to concerns about software exposure and related AI disruption risk, causing investors to sell into the weakness. The result: top BDC firms are now priced at a significant discount to their historical valuation averages.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Blackstone Secured Lending is trading at 0.9X net asset value, about 17% below the 3-year average P/NAV. Ares Capital, one of the most established private credit platforms in the market, is trading at a 3% discount to net asset value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Blue Owl Capital – which faces a loss of trust following the failed merger with another private BDC in November 2025 – is trading at a 19% discount to net asset value. Despite merger-related issues, OBDC reported solid results for the fourth quarter, highlighting that investors may have overreacted to the current weakness in the market, as well as to the missed merger opportunity last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see BXSL as a rock-solid BDC alternative for investors valuing quality and consistency. At the very least I would expect this BDC to reprice to net asset value, which as of the end of the December quarter was $26.92 per share, although the current BDC meltdown may negatively affect investor sentiment for longer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_c5f967d9965b14273bf72be918e78719.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_c5f967d9965b14273bf72be918e78719.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_c5f967d9965b14273bf72be918e78719.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_c5f967d9965b14273bf72be918e78719.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks with BXSL</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest risk for BXSL, considering that the investment firm has seen a sequential drop-off in its dividend coverage, is obviously the risk of a dividend reset in a falling-rate world. While some BDCs have already lowered their dividends lately, such as FS KKR Capital (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FSK\" title=\"FS KKR Capital Corp\">FSK</a>) and Golub Capital BDC (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GBDC\" title=\"Golub Capital BDC\">GBDC</a>), I believe that a dividend cut at this point for Blackstone Secured Lending is not a credible near-term risk.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Blackstone Secured Lending remains a top BDC investment choice for income investors that want to hedge against a major downturn in the BDC market on SaaS fears: the BDC has managed to fully support its dividend in the last twelve months with net investment income, and the portfolio is overall, despite a sequential increase in the non-performing loan ratio in Q4 2025, performing well. In addition, BXSL outperforms other top BDCs such as Ares Capital and Blue Owl Capital in terms of asset quality.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I like that the SaaSpocalypse has made high-quality, first lien-focused private credit platforms a lot cheaper lately, and I am buying the drop in highly rated BDCs with excellent long-term performance records, such as ARCC, OBDC, and HTGC. The significantly reduced valuation multiplier also creates an excess safety margin for investors concerned about SaaS exposure and lower base interest rates in 2026.</p>",

Spreads have never fully normalized after what happened last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721331395462909_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"989\" data-height=\"711\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721331395462909_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Gold - difference between cash and futures largest volume contract\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"460\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721331395462909_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721331395462909_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721331395462909_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721331395462909_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 1: Spot vs Futures</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown below, gold delivery volume for February matched what was seen in December.

When metal is “delivered” it does not mean it’s leaving the Comex. It means that Registered ownership is moving from one party to another. When the metal leaves the vault, that is where things get interesting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown, last year saw a major influx as the arbitrage trade took hold, but that metal has been flowing back out. In the latest month, Registered metal saw quite a large down move. This metal did not flow into Eligible, which stayed relatively flat. Instead, the metal left the vault entirely. This shows sustained <em>physical</em> demand for gold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333598150218_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"952\" data-height=\"708\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333598150218_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Gold inventory levels\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333598150218_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333598150218_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333598150218_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333598150218_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 5: Inventory Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead to the March delivery period (a minor month for gold), we see a contract that is hovering near the average but seeing some selling pressure with 2 days remaining.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333964515145_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"997\" data-height=\"691\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333964515145_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Gold open interest countdown to contract first positions date\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"444\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333964515145_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333964515145_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333964515145_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333964515145_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 6: Open Interest Countdown</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the massive surge in inventory, the open interest relative to physical stocks is actually lower.

Almost $2B of silver was delivered in the minor month of February.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721335695398815_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"941\" data-height=\"718\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721335695398815_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Silver historical notional deliveries for Feb\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"488\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721335695398815_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721335695398815_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721335695398815_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721335695398815_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 10: Notional Deliveries</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Similar to gold, net new contracts were a driver until stalling out mid-month.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336153452246_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1000\" data-height=\"726\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336153452246_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Silver cumulative net new contracts after first position\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"465\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336153452246_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336153452246_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336153452246_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336153452246_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 11: Cumulative Net New Contracts</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Silver-eligible inventories are being removed from the vault at a pretty rapid clip.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336476544783_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"948\" data-height=\"704\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336476544783_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Silver inventory levels eligible\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"475\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336476544783_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336476544783_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336476544783_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336476544783_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 12: Inventory Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Registered metal (metal available for delivery) is also seeing major outflows. Since September, there has been a massive drawdown in Registered supplies. This is further evidence of strain in the physical market. Investors are taking delivery and moving it out of the vault. If we fall below 50M ounces, then Comex physical supplies will start to be extremely strained. While Eligible still has decent supply, much of that metal is not available for delivery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336866354828_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"967\" data-height=\"704\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336866354828_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Silver inventory levels -

That said, demand remains strong despite the all-time highs in price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Silver is showing significant demand and metal is leaving the vault at a rapid clip. This is a market in backwardation, facing high demand, record prices, and metal leaving the vault. This is a perfect storm for silver. After the strong pullback in January, we have seen a lot of speculative money get flushed out. While there are still speculators in this market, there are also big buyers with a strong physical appetite. This is going to put a lot of pressure on the Comex in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/comex-silver-supplies-continue-to-shrink-rapidly\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p>",

My primary concern here is not the health of the hyperscalers but the sustainability of their spending. For this spending to be sustainable, these companies need to show a proportional increase in the free cash flow from AI services. If not, their shareholders will eventually force a capex pivot. Because Nvidia’s revenue is so concentrated, even a 10% reduction in capex across these five customers could account for a $10 billion ($215 billion x 50% x (100%-90%)) hit on Nvidia’s top line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is also unclear as to what portion of the diversified revenue is from startups that are funded by the hyperscalers. If the Big Five reduce their direct buying, it would be accompanied by a reduction in venture investments in the ecosystem. Because the tail of these smaller customers is tethered to the head of the hyperscalers, the concentration risk is higher than it looks on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/income-statement\">income statement</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Compute is Revenue?

It helps to look at both the diversions in the graph above.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Test-time scaling allows a model to think longer before answering. You might have noted this in the chatbots that have toggle switches to think longer. This, understandably, is supposed to consume several times more compute than the faster mode. Inference was supposed to be cheap, but test-time scaling made inference expensive again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, test-time scaling turned out to be <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12215\" rel=\"nofollow\">optimal</a> when done through parallel scaling strategies. This meant that they could be distributed across separate chips or data centers more easily than training loops. Why is this relevant? Because it makes test-time scaling a commodity workload. If Microsoft has to spend a dollar of compute on Nvidia H100s but they can achieve the same for 30 cents on their Maia chips, they have a fiduciary duty to switch. So while test-time scaling increases the total addressable market for compute, it could simultaneously undercut Nvidia’s pricing power within that market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The post-training scaling also undercuts the comment about compute being too tied to revenues. Distillation is a post-training scaling method, and OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>) <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-accuses-deepseek-distilling-us-213928567.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">claimed</a> DeepSeek (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DEEPSEEK\" title=\"Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co., Ltd.\">DEEPSEEK</a>) used distillation to train their own models. If a $5 million distillation can replicate the reasoning capabilities of a $500 million training run, then the “Compute = Revenue” equation suffers from a huge deflation. So I remain very skeptical of this idea that you need to burn more silicon to get more value.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation and Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia trades at ~$23x FY27 earnings estimates. That looks reasonable for a company growing at this pace. However, a lot of the incremental revenue is likely coming from the same concentrated set of customers for the next two years. Pressure in hyperscaler stocks indicates they are already pushing the limits on capital intensity. Not to mention the consensus revenue growth in the second year (FY28) is around 23%. So we had two years of triple-digit growth followed by two years of mid-60s percentage growth, which is expected to be followed by a much steeper descent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48014573-1772131849426464_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1472\" data-height=\"467\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48014573-1772131849426464_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nvidia Consensus Estimates\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"203\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48014573-1772131849426464_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48014573-1772131849426464_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48014573-1772131849426464_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48014573-1772131849426464_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Nvidia Consensus Estimates <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A 23x multiple is cheap for a company exhibiting hypergrowth, but it is fair-to-expensive for a company entering a deceleration curve with a concentrated set of customers.

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRDO\" title=\"Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd\">CRDO</a></span>) <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4793407-credo-q4-exceeding-expectations-exceptionally\">analysis</a>, the stock has gained over 50% in price. Indeed, the AI infrastructure investment boom has been remarkably rewarding and may very well continue to be so even while macro valuation concerns persist. In any case, I would be very cautious right now about not having a sizeable cash position and exposure to gold, because at this valuation and the complexity of the emergence of the AI economy, some severe volatility ahead would not be unexpected by me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, this could be the equivalent of 1996, and the S&amp;P 500's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SP500</a>) forward P/E could expand over the next three years to what it was at the peak of the dot-com boom (25.2x), but it's more plausible in my opinion that we will see index-level price normalization in 2027 and a meaningful drawdown in 2028 at the latest. I can't predict it with temporal precision, but data suggests 2029 at a push, 2027 in the bear case, and 2028 in the base for a negative index-level inflection. As we are now in 2026 and growth is already slowing, I am moving defensively to cash early, as it's not only slowing growth that could tumble the markets but also multiple compression from mere growth normalization. This is made evident in the second chart of this thesis, in the second section below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-17721190259264572_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2167\" data-height=\"1500\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-17721190259264572_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"S&amp;P 500 Index at Inflection Points\" width=\"640\" height=\"443\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-17721190259264572_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-17721190259264572_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-17721190259264572_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-17721190259264572_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>J.P.Morgan</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 Earnings Preview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Firstly, we certainly need to understand that <a href=\"https://investors.credosemi.com/overview/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Credo</a> is directly tied to the broad AI investment supercycle.

As a result, the stock price reaction to the official, full report will depend on gross margin, opex, working capital, customer concentration, and how confidently management frames demand into Q4 and Fiscal 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The prior guidance indicated a non-GAAP gross margin of about <a href=\"https://investors.credosemi.com/news-events/news/news-details/2025/Credo-Technology-Group-Holding-Ltd-Reports-Second-Quarter-of-Fiscal-Year-2026-Financial-Results/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">65% at the midpoint</a>, but there could be pressure from expedites, product mix, or ramp costs related to the surge in revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's very important to understand that the primary risk with CRDO stock is that the company's accounts receivable and revenue remain concentrated, with Customer A at <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1807794/000162828025054549/crdo-20251101.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">62% of accounts receivable</a> and 64% of prior-quarter revenue. I would look carefully for management's commentary in the earnings call on collections, payment terms, and program breadth, as there is currently substantial volatility and downside risk here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We should also remember that the AI capex tailwind is colliding with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-ai-boom-faces-electric-shock-2026-02-25/\" rel=\"nofollow\">power and permitting</a> constraints in key U.S. regions. This surely could introduce pockets of volatility in the next few years and could, in fact, be one of the major reasons for a macro valuation compression phase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Credo's core engine is high-speed connectivity silicon and Active Electrical Cables, and Q3 will offer us a <a href=\"https://investors.credosemi.com/news-events/news/news-details/2025/Credo-Technology-Group-Holding-Ltd-Reports-Second-Quarter-of-Fiscal-Year-2026-Financial-Results/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">chance to see</a> if ZeroFlap Optics, Active Linear Cables, and OmniConnect gearboxes are converting from design wins to revenue, effectively broadening the revenue base and reducing downside risk. On the other side of the equation, limited uptake would reinforce revenue concentration risk. These new offerings are a key swing factor.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Copper vs. Optics</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Credo is currently strongest in <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1807794/000162828025054549/crdo-20251101.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Active Electrical Cables</a>, retimers, and emerging Active Linear Cables that extend copper performance. However, hyperscalers are pushing toward <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1807794/000162828025033813/crdo-20250503.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">higher speed</a>, denser AI racks, seeking lower power per bit as grids become strained and the pressure mounts for self-generation. In essence, optics are gaining share, and this creates a strategic vulnerability for Credo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4459600-broadcom-nvidia-among-those-set-to-benefit-from-co-packaged-optics-technology-jp-morgan\">Large incumbents</a> like Broadcom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\" title=\"Broadcom Inc.\">AVGO</a>) and Marvell (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRVL\" title=\"Marvell Technology, Inc.\">MRVL</a>) have broad optical portfolios and deep scale, meaning they could capture share if hyperscalers accelerate optical adoption. Among the biggest manufacturers of datacom optical modules globally are also Coherent (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COHR\" title=\"Coherent Corp.\">COHR</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/300502.SZ/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eoptolink</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Coherent may make the better investment than Credo at this time if the energy bottleneck thesis mounts. However, its valuation is higher.

We are also dangerously close to a death cross here, and while it may not materialize, I am not so keen on CRDO's valuation now, viewing it more as natural normalization than an unjustified sell-off. The best entry point would have been at the beginning of February, when the RSI briefly breached into de facto oversold territory. Yet, right now, sentiment value appears fair to me from a technical standpoint.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-1772117812627322_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1633\" data-height=\"1358\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-1772117812627322_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CRDO One-Day-Intervals Price Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"532\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-1772117812627322_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-1772117812627322_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-1772117812627322_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-1772117812627322_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">CRDO One-Day-Intervals Price Chart <span>(Author's Chart)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, we are left with operational execution and the realization of base-case consensus estimates to sustain sentiment. If I am correct that CRDO's current price is fairly valued, then we may indeed see a 35% return in the next 12 months from the equity. However, the nature of the revenue concentration and emerging shift toward higher-efficiency technology amid energy bottlenecks has me more confident building a position in the dominant Advanced Micro Devices (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>) and Marvell (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRVL\" title=\"Marvell Technology, Inc.\">MRVL</a>) than risking capital on this smaller, late-stage growth stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-17721177643564286_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1206\" data-height=\"371\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-17721177643564286_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CRDO Consensus EPS Estimates\" width=\"640\" height=\"197\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-17721177643564286_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-17721177643564286_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-17721177643564286_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-17721177643564286_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">CRDO Consensus EPS Estimates <span>(Seeking Alpha; Author's Annotations)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Credo's valuation from a fundamental perspective looks somewhat contradictory. On the one hand, the raw P/Es are far above the sector medians. However, the forward PEG non-GAAP ratio is -65% below the sector median, indicating that the company's earnings growth should logically be able to sustain its valuation. Investors still have to be careful of low-probability risks materializing and the reality that this is still a cyclical AI market, even if various equities are riding in and out of a supercycle investment wave.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-1772117615057949_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"865\" data-height=\"306\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-1772117615057949_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CRDO Valuation Grades\" width=\"640\" height=\"226\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-1772117615057949_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-1772117615057949_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-1772117615057949_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-1772117615057949_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If Credo delivers $5 in normalized EPS in Fiscal 2028, which ends April 2028, and trades at a forward P/E of 32.5 in April 2027, allowing for some compression, then the stock price will be about $160 in about 12 months. The current price is $115, so the implied upside is 40%.

As Warren Buffett taught, first of all, they buy within their circle of competence. Second of all, they only buy those equities that skew reward over risk, or they structure their portfolio as such so that if outsized reward does emerge, it is not then destroyed by outsized risk. CRDO currently falls into a category where the size of the reward no longer dominates the risk; in my opinion, the ratio is now fairly balanced. As a result, the equity has become a late-stage growth stock, applicable for the slow money but not elite for those looking to catch an early wave. Still, Credo is a Buy for now.</p>",

But with the topline ramping and also coming in well above projections, that doesn’t bother me much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Networking revenue was another good surprise, reaching $11B, with stronger QoQ growth (34%) than data center. Keep an eye on networking because it’s a good proxy for full-rack system shipments, which tend to carry better margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sovereign AI exceeded $30B in revenue for the year, roughly 3x what was sold in FY2025. This remains a good second growth driver for Nvidia, after big tech.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other segments have been dwarfed by data center revenue, but Gaming came in below consensus and was down 13% sequentially, which makes sense seasonally. Management said the sequential decline was mainly channel inventory moderation after a strong holiday season. I’d also blame memory price increases (likely more painful for gaming than data centers) and some level of supply prioritization.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management also suggested that their previous guidance of $500B, or $~300B on data center revenue for this calendar year, could be conservative:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We look ahead, we expect sequential revenue growth throughout calendar 2026, exceeding what was included in the $500 billion Blackwell and Rubin revenue opportunity we shared last year. We believe we have inventory and supply commitments in place to address future demand, including shipments extending into calendar 2027. <em>Colette Kress - CFO.</em></p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">My take</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think there’s almost nothing not to like in NVDA’s print. I see no sign of real deceleration nearby, especially with capex still guided higher. The major question for the company is the continuity of the type of growth we’re seeing. This perceived risk of a sudden digestion creates a kind of bizarre logic where the better the earnings, the more “ephemeral” they’re assumed to be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If I had to explain why the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557937-nvidia-leads-chip-stocks-lower-investors-worry-about-ai-buildout-plans\">stock reacted negatively</a> today, I’d attribute it to that fear of revenue growth slowing down, which guidance can imply if we look at the recent pattern:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <td><strong>Fiscal Quarter</strong></td> <td><strong>Data Center Revenue ($B)</strong></td> <td><strong>Sequential Growth (%)</strong></td> </tr></thead> <tr> <td><span>Q3 FY2025</span></td> <td><span>$30.8</span></td> <td><span>—</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Q4 FY2025</span></td> <td><span>$35.6</span></td> <td><span>+16%</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Q1 FY2026</span></td> <td><span>$39.1</span></td> <td><span>+10%</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Q2 FY2026</span></td> <td><span>$41.1</span></td> <td><span>+5%</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Q3 FY2026</span></td> <td><span>$51.2</span></td> <td><span>+25%</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Q4 FY2026</span></td> <td><span>$62.3</span></td> <td><span>+22%</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span><strong>Q1 FY2027 (Guide)</strong></span></td> <td><span><strong>~$71.0B-$73.0B</strong>*</span></td> <td><span><strong>~15% (Est.)</strong></span></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for me, I prefer to focus on the $10B+ revenue increase implied for next quarter, especially given they’ve been consistently beating guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk is the previously announced OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>) deal, which is probably near closing. There are <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557785-nvidia-confirms-its-finalizing-deal-with-openai\">indications</a> the deal will be smaller than anticipated, though. I guess we’ll have to wait and see, but I agree that investing in another company’s equity adds another layer of risk and also strengthens the “circular funding” narrative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, if we look at the company’s multiples, I believe a good part of those risks are already priced in. Over the last 3 years, these multiple levels have usually been very good entry points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_1b850b75d663ca7949ec51e709ae0f42.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_1b850b75d663ca7949ec51e709ae0f42.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_1b850b75d663ca7949ec51e709ae0f42.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_1b850b75d663ca7949ec51e709ae0f42.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most bullish development for the whole chip thesis is the agentic AI revolution that is going on, in my opinion. I don’t know if you’ve had the opportunity to code with Anthropic's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANTHRO\" title=\"Anthropic\">ANTHRO</a>) Claude, but it’s quite impressive, to say the least.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chip demand ultimately needs to be justified by real applications being built, and I think today’s agentic capabilities are already at a level that will change the world profoundly (and, in some ways, already are).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There's, of course, the whole debate about whether this level of capex will be justifiable in the end. But at this point I believe that:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>No one actually knows if these investments will lead to big tech-level ROICs. Today’s agentic progress points in that direction, but to be honest, we’ll all have to wait and see.</li> <li>Big tech can’t really avoid investing, whether to avoid losing market share in the data center or to reduce the risk of being technologically disrupted.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, I don’t see that logic shifting for now, unless the economic backdrop changes in a way that forces companies to get more conservative as a group. With rates expected to fall, I don’t take that scenario as my base case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I do think semiconductors always operate in cycles, but I’m not willing to call the peak just yet. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4555119-nvidia-earnings-gtc-likely-to-be-a-catalyst-for-the-stock-gf-securities\">GTC is coming</a> up too, which could be a near-term sentiment driver.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA’s print was about as clean as it gets, and the setup still looks constructive. The debate around growth sustainability is reasonable, but with agentic AI accelerating and capex still ramping, I’m not calling the peak yet. I’m willing to stay invested, especially after today’s stock price reaction.</p>",

This is also true for DRD's US shares trading on the NYSE.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We will see how DRD intends to continue its success, based on the company's past performance and forecasts derived from the current business situation together with the macroeconomic and geopolitical situation. We present our readers with an updated overview.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Volatility Makes It Possible: The “Buy the Dips” Strategy</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This scenario, however, is not without its problems stemming from a weaker US dollar, which reflects macroeconomic difficulties in the US. Tariff uncertainty is resurfacing, as <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-tariff-uncertainty-trade-is-back-110011487.html?.tsrc=372&amp;ncid=crm_-1992266-20260224-1--A&amp;bt_user_id=eTtO+U5TsRu6u8OO1z2CTwiipBrdZfbii7skWcs8PY/piTanP9Dctgs8w8zbNBILYoxYszxd/248QxP4dRy6bdkI+MDwsewPEts7KqSb5yZrs5FA+0OtQezOGTOxbCBx&amp;bt_ts=1771931050136\" rel=\"nofollow\">new tariffs</a> from the Trump era are triggering fresh market concerns. Finally, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/we-are-concerned-scott-bessent-says-treasury-is-keeping-a-close-eye-on-the-private-credit-market-145117264.html?.tsrc=372&amp;ncid=crm_-1992266-20260224-1--A&amp;bt_user_id=eTtO+U5TsRu6u8OO1z2CTwiipBrdZfbii7skWcs8PY/piTanP9Dctgs8w8zbNBILYoxYszxd/248QxP4dRy6bdkI+MDwsewPEts7KqSb5yZrs5FA+0OtQezOGTOxbCBx&amp;bt_ts=1771931050136\" rel=\"nofollow\">private credit risk</a> is rising, causing concerns about the $1.8 trillion market. We believe it is possible that this could lead to broader financial pressure, particularly for banks with non-performing loans, possibly similar to the SVB crisis in spring 2023. Our readers have likely already noticed that we are not excluding the possibility that the US financial system could be generally exposed to crisis risk. This is another indicator, which should ultimately benefit gold as a hedge against uncertainty. While rising gold prices underscore the profitability of DRD's South African operations, the weaker US dollar against the South African rand presents a challenge. Operating costs appear higher when converted to US dollars than they did during periods of a stronger US dollar. Although this is only an optical effect, as operating costs in South Africa are covered in local currency, it could nevertheless diminish the attractiveness of the stock as an investment. As a result, market participants with the power to influence valuations may become overly concerned about short-term effects, leading to a fear-driven decline in DRD's share price. This could be seen as yet another opportunity to strengthen their positions in DRD shares for those confident in DRD’s current performance and future gold prospects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, buying on the dip can provide resilience to the negative impact of concerns about the weak US dollar on the markets. This headwind will whisper through for a while, occasionally chilling the mood around DRD shares on the NYSE.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Statistics That Support Our View</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We substantiate the necessity of the strategy with statistical data on the performance of the DRD on the NYSE, as well as on the benchmarks of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GDX\" title=\"VanEck Gold Miners ETF\">GDX</a>), the Gold Spot Price (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAUUSD:CUR\" title=\"Gold Spot Price\">XAUUSD:CUR</a>), and the US$/ZAR exchange rate (US Dollar/South African Rand)—each based on the last twelve months (LTM) and year-to-date (YTD).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance of the securities in the respective markets (LTM):</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD +228.92% / 250 = 0.92% per day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">GDX +172.16% / 250 = 0.69% per day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">XAUUS$ +74.25% / 250 = 0.30% per day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">US$ZAR -13.13% / 250 = 0.05% per day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance of securities in the respective markets (YTD):</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD +22.13% / 35 = 0.63% per day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">GDX +29.13% / 35 = 0.83% per day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">XAUUS$ +18.74% / 35 = 0.54% per day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">US$ZAR -3.31% / 35 = 0.09% per day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: While the gold price is gaining momentum (with a daily increase of +0.30% year-to-date compared to +0.54% over the past twelve months), DRD is also growing, but less strongly in this initial start to 2026. The sector to which DRD belongs, and whose performance is tracked by the GDX ETF, generally follows the strengthening upward trend for the precious metal. DRD may have suffered from the increasing weakness in the US dollar, with the US$/ZAR exchange ratio deteriorating from a daily decline of 0.05% year-to-date to a daily decline of 0.09% over the past twelve months.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>From Our Previous Coverage</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In our previous article, we upgraded DRD to \"Buy\" due to its strong performance and promising future potential, fueled by the precious metals market recovery. DRD's earnings growth continued with dynamic expansion and improved margins, further strengthening its already solid balance sheet. These factors formed the basis for DRD's expansion plans at its ambitious core projects, Far West Gold Recoveries and the Ergo mines in South Africa. Although operating costs were not among the lowest in the South African gold production sector, the company's debt-free status offered potential for increased cash flow, aside from higher operating costs. DRD's well-positioned dividend contributed to shareholder value and reinforced the \"Buy\" signal despite share price volatility.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile: What Happened On Yield Front</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DRD/dividends/history\">raised</a> its regular semi-annual dividend to up to $0.3122 per share. The dividend was announced on February 20, 2026, and is scheduled to be paid on March 23, 2026. This is an increase from the $0.23 per share dividend announced on August 22, 2025, and paid on September 22, 2025—approximately one month earlier than the publication of our previous analysis of DRD stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The dividend boosted the share price, with DRD stock rising 48.54%, outpacing the S&amp;P 500's +0.43% change since our last article. Returns are as of the date of this writing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Interim Results After 6 Months: DRDGOLD's Situation As Of December 31, 2025</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financial results were robust, primarily because the company, as it <a href=\"https://www.drdgold.com/media-insights/media-releases/2026/1834-drdgold-converts-favourable-gold-price-into-cash-generation-and-long-term-reinvestment\" rel=\"nofollow\">states</a> in the title, is able to</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>converts favourable gold price into cash generation and long-term reinvestment</p></blockquote> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Financials</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD faced several challenges beyond their control, but these could not jeopardize profitability, as the record-high gold price proved to be a formidable opponent to fight against and defeat. The precious metal was truly gargantuan in its hunger for constant new heights.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It should be noted that the average gold price achieved by DRD for the precious metal sold in the first half of the year, ending December 31, 2025 (First Half of Fiscal Year 2026), was approximately ZAR 2,114,227/kg (or US$3,555 per ounce), representing a 43% increase compared to the previous year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD is an unhedged producer and benefits fully from the higher gold price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD therefore reported the following changes in the growth of the most important profitability indicators for the six-month period ending December 30, 2025, or the first half of Fiscal Year 2026, compared to the previous year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Converted Financial Figures Using Seeking Alpha's US$/ZAR Exchange Rate:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue: UP 33% to ZAR 5,053.2 million, or ≈ US$ 298.9 million</li> <li>Headline Earnings: UP 99% to ZAR 1,932.4 million or ≈ US$ 114.4 million</li> <li>Operating Profit: UP 72% to ZAR 2,712.8 million or ≈ US$ 160.4 million</li> <li>Free Cash Inflow: UP 149% to ZAR 793.1 million or ≈ US$ 46.9 million</li> <li>Capital reinvestment in extending the operating life: UP 74% to ZAR 1,651.3 million, or ≈ US$ 97.6 million</li> <li>Cash and Cash Equivalents: UP 162% to ZAR 1,734.4 million or ≈ US$ 102.7 million</li> <li>Cash Operating Costs: UP 13% to ZAR 980,042 per kg or ≈ US$ 57,946.49 per kg</li> <li>All-in Sustaining Costs: UP 14% to ZAR 1,094,188 per kg or ≈ US$ 64,669.72 per kg</li> <li>Interim Cash Dividend of 50 cents per share: UP from 30 cents per share in H1 FY2025.</li> </ul> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Operations</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Group's gold production decreased by 9% to 2,337 kg. However, this decline is not a cause for concern, as we expect the rising gold price to enable economically viable extraction of the metal from the surface tailings piles with the lowest gold concentration (recovery of 0.188 g/t in H1 FY2026 compared to 0.199 g/t in H1 FY2025). Throughput decreased by 4% to 12.5 million tonnes in H1 FY2026 (compared to 12.9 million tonnes in H1 FY2025). With regard to the decrease in throughput, the company is not liable for any disruptions or impairments to operational efficiency, as these were attributable to rain and weather-related interruptions in November and December 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lower production due to factors beyond DRD's control temporarily led to higher costs. This was due to higher input costs, as these were spread over a smaller quantity of gold. Additionally, the currently higher gold price is resulting in higher royalties for gold mining and exploration companies worldwide. These cost changes are illustrated in the preceding “Financials” subsection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the increased costs resulting from lower production for reasons beyond DRD's control, the record gold price was the decisive factor driving DRD's improved profitability: the operating margin improved to 53.7% in H1 FY 2026, compared to 41.5% in H1 FY 2025—a gain of 1,220 basis points driven by an impressive YOY jump in gold revenues.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Outlook: Expansion In Sight</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The impressive profit margin enables DRDGOLD to advance its Vision 2028 with production increases and extended operating life beyond 2040. This will be obtainable as Ergo will optimize gold recovery and reduce costs by connecting to the Daggafontein tailings facility (TSF) and resuming tailings disposal at Withok. FWGR, receiving 80% of reinvestments, will expand the DP2 facility and build a regional tailings site, set to be operational by Q1 FY 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In its press releases regarding the interim results for the first half of fiscal year 2025, DRDGOLD also states:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The Group’s resource base increased following the transfer of approximately 67 million tonnes of goldbearing tailings from Sibanye-Stillwater to FWGR at the Kloof 2 dump.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These resources from Sibanye will be added to the following resources:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392746994665_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1317\" data-height=\"670\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"> <picture> </picture></a></span><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392746994665_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1317\" data-height=\"670\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392746994665_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: DRDGOLD Limited website\" width=\"640\" height=\"326\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392746994665_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392746994665_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392746994665_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392746994665_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw -

The 52-week range was from $10.73 to $39.37. Due to volatility, the 20-day moving average is currently above the 50-day moving average, which in turn is above the 100-day moving average, and this is finally above the 200-day moving average. This indicates a positive market trend in the short, medium, and long term. From here, there is still considerable upside potential, as the RSI of 58.32 paves the way for robust price growth until the overbought level of approximately 80 is reached. This will initiate the next upward phase, provided the gold price continues to rise. Also, the two short-term lines are very close together, as the cycle is currently volatile. The 20-day moving average is converging on the 50-day simple moving average, and a lower share price is possible soon. However, should this present an attractive entry point, it remains to be seen, given the current gold price of $5,194.15, which is putting amazing bullish pressure on everything.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Valuation</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The data at <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DRD/valuation/metrics\">Seeking Alpha</a> has provided the following financial figures, available as of this writing:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD's P/E Non-GAAP (FWD) of 16.76 Vs. Sector Median's 17.09.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD's P/E GAAP (TTM) of 16.63 Vs. Sector Median's 24.70.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD's EV/EBITDA (TTM) of 11.45 Vs. Sector Median's 12.08.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD's EV/EBITDA (FWD) of 9.39 Vs. Sector Median's 9.43.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD's Price/Cash Flow (TTM) of 11.72 Vs. Sector Median's 13.16.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD's Dividend Yield (TTM) of 1.46% Vs. Sector Median's 1.58%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In our view, the comparison suggests that DRD stock is valued in line with the sector median, possibly even slightly below. This would allow investors to profit from the record price of the precious metal with DRD shares—at a more favorable valuation than most competitors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The buy signal is supported by the comparison, while concerns about the costs in USD due to the weak US currency, which has been mentioned at the beginning of this analysis, may provide a valid reason to hope for the implementation of a “buy the dip” strategy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Risks</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are the risk factors:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance Sheet Risk: The first six months of the 2026 fiscal year showed that with 14% higher AISC due to a 9% lower group gold production to 2,337 kg, it is possible to achieve a 1,220 basis point gain in the margin to 53.7%, driven by an impressive escalation in gold revenues due to a 43% jump in the gold price of 2,114,227 ZAR/kg (or 3,555 USD per ounce). As costs will be lower as their increase was due to temporary factors, beyond which production can reasonably be expected to be at least in line with H1 2026, analysts' forecasts for a gold price of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4551711-gold-pullback-seen-as-buying-opportunity-anz-forecasts-5800oz-in-q2-2026\">$5,800</a> per troy ounce to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4546215-deutsche-bank-stands-firm-on-6000-gold-target-as-it-says-the-bullish-case-remains-intact\">$6,000/oz</a> reflect a 69% upside over the average realized by DRD in H1 2026. This puts the margin on track to sustain improved earnings, dividend payments, and capital expenditures, with the possibility that some expansion projects, such as FWGR's DP2 facility plus regional tailings facilities, will be operational well before Q1 2027. This will boost the share price if things move in line with past trends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gold Bearish Risk: The biggest risk, therefore, lies in the price of gold, which has so far benefited from strong demand for gold as a hedge against global turmoil. This risk would be particularly reduced if the war in Ukraine were to end, as this war is a major pillar of international tension and disputes between the Western bloc and countries allied with Russia. With the end of the war, the market's incentive to buy gold for its portfolios would disappear. The first to feel the effects of a stagnant or even falling gold price would be DRD's profits, the company's growth prospects given the imminent completion of projects, and consequently the company's shares on the NYSE.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, CEO Niël Pretorius said in his commentary on DRDGOLD's interim results for the first half of the 2025 financial year:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Favourable gold prices have allowed us to reinvest meaningfully in extending the life of our operations, to maintain a strong financial position and to continue to create value in a way that remains sustainable for our business and our stakeholders,</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Low Volume of Tradable Shares: According to Seeking Alpha's “<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DRD\">Trading Data</a>” section, only 384,958 shares of DRDGOLD Limited were traded in the last three months, indicating low trading volume on a daily basis. This dynamic introduces a two-sided liquidity risk (bearish/bullish): if a bearish trend necessitates a rapid liquidation of positions, the lack of trading volume forces sellers to accept considerably lower prices, often resulting in important capital erosion. However, this structural illiquidity also acts as a flywheel for higher multiples; if there is an increase in buyer demand, the limited supply of available shares can trigger an aggressive and disproportionate improvement in the asset's market valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Country Risk: The Sprott Mining Risk Heat Map assigns South Africa an orange code, indicating high risk for DRD's reprocessing of gold tailings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392782217088_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1128\" data-height=\"730\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392782217088_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Sprott Asset Management\" width=\"640\" height=\"414\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392782217088_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392782217088_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392782217088_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392782217088_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Sprott Asset Management</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the NYSE shares of DRDGOLD Limited, a Johannesburg-based gold company that extracts the yellow metal from the processing of surface mine waste in South Africa, we reiterate our Buy signal.

(3:26)</p> <p>This is an abridged transcript of the podcast:</p> <p>Our top story so far, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557783-from-ai-to-a1-sauce-staples-are-now-pricier-than-megacaps\">investors are going from AI to A1.</a></p> <p>Looking at forward valuations, the premium investors were paying for the mega caps has faded — and they’re now willing to pay up for household goods and pantry fillers.</p> <p>Neil Sethi of Sethi Advisors flagged a chart from Matt Cerminaro showing that the average forward P/E of the Magnificent 7 excluding Tesla — Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), Alphabet (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a></span>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>), Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), Microsoft (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a></span>) and Nvidia (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a></span>) — is now below the Consumer Staples (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLP\" title=\"State Street Cons Staples Sel Sec SPDR Inc ETF\">XLP</a></span>) sector.</p> <p>And today’s hardware-led selloff — with Nvidia sliding while staples hold steady — is only reinforcing that shift.</p> <p>Sethi noted that staples’ forward P/E has climbed to its highest level in at least a decade, while the top six megacaps have fallen toward the low end of their range over the same period.</p> <p>He added that a big driver is the Walmart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\" title=\"Walmart Inc.\">WMT</a>) and Costco (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COST\" title=\"Costco Wholesale Corporation\">COST</a>) effect — together about 20% of XLP and trading at P/Es in the 40 to 50 range — but he argues the broader staples group still looks stretched, and it’s hard to see most of those names suddenly turning into big earnings compounders.</p> <p>Among active stocks, two guilty-pleasure names are off to the races.</p> <p>Krispy Kreme (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DNUT\" title=\"Krispy Kreme, Inc.\">DNUT</a>) <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557668-krispy-kreme-rallies-as-turnaround-efforts-start-to-pay-off\">is up more than 20% as investors reward its turnaround strategy.</a> Revenue fell 2.9% year over year in Q4, with organic revenue down 3.9%, largely due to the strategic closure of underperforming locations — a move that reduced global points of access by 13.5%.</p> <p>CEO Josh Charlesworth said the company is making meaningful progress, pointing to strong demand, profitable U.S. expansion, and capital-light international franchise growth.</p> <p>And Shake Shack (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SHAK\" title=\"Shake Shack Inc.\">SHAK</a>) <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557800-shake-shack-absorbs-higher-beef-prices-with-promos-onion-rings-and-the-dubai-chocolate-shake\">is rallying after posting a double-digit sales jump in Q4</a>, helped by promotions and new menu items — allowing it to offset higher beef costs and a challenging macro environment.</p> <p>Looking ahead to 2026, Shake Shack expects pressure from beef prices to ease as supply-chain initiatives kick in and cost pressures on food and paper products moderate.</p> <p>And speaking of races, Churchill Downs (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CHDN\" title=\"Churchill Downs Incorporated\">CHDN</a>) <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557122-churchill-downs-gets-a-boost-from-both-historical-racing-and-live-sports-betting\">is trailing the field</a>, despite posting higher Q4 revenue in both its live and historical racing business and its wagering services and solutions segment. Gaming revenue did fall from a year ago and analysts pointed to expanded risks.</p> <p>In other news of note, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557445-washington-post-losses-2025\">the Wall Street Journal reports The Washington Post lost about $100M last year</a>, following similar losses in 2024 and roughly $77M in 2023.</p> <p>The financial strain was a primary driver behind recent layoffs of about one-third of the workforce — cuts that eliminated the sports section and scaled back many foreign bureaus.</p> <p>At a staff meeting Wednesday, acting publisher and CEO Jeff D’Onofrio and executive editor Matt Murray discussed the paper’s financial condition and productivity.</p> <p>D’Onofrio said the number of news stories published has fallen 42% since 2020, while newsroom costs were up 16% in 2025 compared with 2020.</p> <p>Looking to ETFs, <a href=\"https://%20https//seekingalpha.com/news/4557786-jane-street-becomes-slvs-top-holder-in-q4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jane Street disclosed a record 20.7M-share stake in the iShares Silver Trust</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SLV\" title=\"iShares Silver Trust ETF\">SLV</a>) for Q4 2025, making it the ETF’s largest institutional holder.</p> <p>The stake surged from about 41K shares in Q3, vaulting Jane Street ahead of big holders like BlackRock (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BLK\" title=\"BlackRock, Inc.\">BLK</a>), Morgan Stanley (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MS\" title=\"Morgan Stanley\">MS</a>) and Bank of America (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAC\" title=\"Bank of America Corporation\">BAC</a>).</p> <p>The filing also shows SLV put and call options, suggesting the position may be part of a hedged setup rather than a straight directional bet on silver.</p> <p>And in the Wall Street Research Corner, the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" class=\"ticker-link\">SP500</a>)<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557551-sp-500-flashes-sixth-hindenburg-omen-in-a-month\"> has triggered its sixth Hindenburg Omen signal in the past month</a>, according to data compiled by Subu Trade — reviving memories of February 2020, when a cluster of similar signals came ahead of the COVID-driven selloff.</p> <p>The Hindenburg Omen is a technical indicator meant to flag internal weakness in the market. It’s triggered when a meaningful number of NYSE stocks hit new 52-week highs and new 52-week lows at the same time — a split that suggests market breadth is fracturing.</p> <p>Other conditions often include a rising index and a weakening McClellan Oscillator, a momentum gauge.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder\"></div><p>Historically, it’s the clusters of signals — not isolated readings — that get traders’ attention. But it’s also worth noting: over the past decade, it’s been a false alarm more often than not.</p>",

Like silver and gold, copper prices have stumbled a bit in recent weeks, although<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the pullback wasn’t nearly so dramatic. Copper prices are driven more by demand and applicable use rather than as a store of wealth, like gold (and to a lesser extent, silver). Copper is heavily used in data centers, and the massive global data center expansion has helped send copper prices soaring. However, I believe we’ll see the data center build-out ease a bit, and even if momentum is maintained, fiber optics may cool demand for copper.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Copper inventories in the United States surged ahead of tariffs as well, raising the prospect of a glut. While I’m going to cover the ETF in specific, I believe its price is primarily going to be driven by the price of copper. Historically, the two track each other pretty consistently. Ultimately, I don’t believe the above trends are going to completely upend the copper market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720256656873538_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1218\" data-height=\"630\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720256656873538_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"copper stocks globally\" width=\"640\" height=\"331\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720256656873538_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720256656873538_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720256656873538_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720256656873538_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Mining.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A massive, sustained plunge in copper prices would be surprising, but I do believe tailwinds will cool, and shallow retreats should be expected. Inventories are high in the United States, China, and other key markets, but demand should remain high as well. Fiber optics could cool demand but won’t eliminate it. Still, I believe risks have ticked up while upside has cooled. As such, I’m downgrading my rating to a hold.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trade War Led To Soaring Copper Stockpiles</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the bruising trade war heated up, copper stockpiles soared. The Trump Administration ultimately leveled Section 232 tariffs on finished and semi-finished copper products but <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/31/why-us-copper-tariff-exemption-wont-fully-ease-price-rises.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">decided against</a> tariffing raw materials. That exemption <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/trump-just-crashed-the-copper-market-43ffff25\" rel=\"nofollow\">led to a sell-off</a>, but copper prices mostly trended up through 2025. On June 30th, 2026, the Administration is expected to announce whether additional copper tariffs should be applied to refined copper. Potential tariffs of 15% for 2027 and 30% for 2028 are on the table. Amid elevated inflation and with the 2026 midterms looming, I suspect the Administration will decide against tariffs for now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214019427326_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"502\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214019427326_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"copper inventories\" width=\"640\" height=\"201\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214019427326_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214019427326_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214019427326_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214019427326_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>CME Group</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CME warehouses, which store copper approved for exchanges, have seen <a href=\"https://www.mining.com/web/column-copper-is-pricing-scarcity-at-a-time-of-plenty/\" rel=\"nofollow\">inventories explode </a>from 85,000 tons at the beginning of 2025 to well north of half a million tons in recent weeks. Globally, copper stockpiles have also been rising. Copper is useful for several crucial applications, including in AI data centers and for building electric vehicles, which are enjoying strong sales growth in many markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stockpiles have led to <a href=\"https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/industrial-goodsservices/Copper-Stocks-Correct-Amidst-Inventory-Glut-Demand-Slowdown/6991117612665ef560f988fa\" rel=\"nofollow\">some worries</a> of a potential glut. While the large stockpiles will cancel out at least some upward pressure on copper prices, I suspect prices will hold steady, and any sharp decline is more likely to be a temporary rotation. Right now, in terms of raw material, the United States should be able to meet demand for copper domestically, but <a href=\"https://www.mining.com/charts-us-copper-glut-hides-refining-crunch/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the lack of refining</a> and smelting capabilities means it still imports quite a bit.

Many companies have come under fire for investing massive sums into developing AI. OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>) recently announced that it is <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/20/openai-resets-spend-expectations-targets-around-600-billion-by-2030.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">cutting its CapEx spending</a> plans in half. The company had envisioned spending $1.4 trillion on AI development by 2030 but now aims to spend “just” $600 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon.com, Inc.'s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) and Alphabet Inc.'s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) share prices have taken hits in recent weeks, following the unveiling of massive spending plans. Keep an eye on financial news media, and you’ll likely hear claims that the AI spending is unsustainable. Amid pressure and criticism, more companies may announce plans to slow spending. If this happens, it’ll almost surely include major cuts to infrastructure investments. This, in turn, could substantially reduce demand for copper.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As far as OpenAI, Anthropic (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANTHRO\" title=\"Anthropic\">ANTHRO</a>), and Magnificent 7 companies are concerned, I expect AI spending to remain brisk. Even with OpenAI, I wouldn’t be surprised if they change course yet again in a few months or years. If and when investors get comfortable with AI, OpenAI could re-raise its spending targets. Then again, I also wouldn’t be surprised if some of the other big players announce plans to cut back on spending. This would mean fewer data centers and thus less copper consumed. Also, I wouldn't be surprised if we see smaller players scaling down AI infrastructure investments. Currently, the pursuit of AI is at risk of developing into a \"be big\" or go home endeavor.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Don’t Overlook Fiber</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Transferring data across copper requires quite a bit of energy and can quickly result in heating issues. While copper has played a vital role in the AI build-out, don’t be surprised if it’s replaced by a better technology. With copper, developers can be restrained by the wiring itself. Fiber-optic alternatives can transfer far more quickly and don’t produce as much heat. Given the simple economics of the situation, I expect <a href=\"https://www.eetimes.com/why-fiber-optics-is-replacing-copper-in-data-centers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">fiber-optic substitution</a> to unfold rather rapidly. This would reduce demand for copper but won’t eliminate it.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">COPX: Some Fundamentals and Valuation Considerations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since I covered COPX a few months ago and went over portfolio content and various fundamentals, I’m going to focus on what’s changed. First, the PE ratio has obviously climbed a bit. Back in October, it was a tantalizing 16.88 but has since ticked up to 18.05. That’s still pretty good in my eyes but is slightly above the category average of 17.74. The Price/Sales ratio rose from 0.97x to 1.56x, which is pretty significant but not something I’m worried about.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The dividend yield dropped from 1.29% to 0.82%. While the yield wasn’t particularly high beforehand, it has shrunk considerably. Share prices have risen steadily, as illustrated below. After such big climbs, it’s easy for would-be investors to wonder if they missed the boat. If judged by the generally good fundamentals, I’d disagree with that sentiment. However, the potential headwinds discussed above could overwhelm those fundamentals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_846f0e49ca9d79367c41a51d75d48b3a.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_846f0e49ca9d79367c41a51d75d48b3a.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_846f0e49ca9d79367c41a51d75d48b3a.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_846f0e49ca9d79367c41a51d75d48b3a.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ultimately, I rate COPX a hold. This is in pretty stark contrast to Seeking Alpha’s quant tools, which give a strong buy recommendation. My ratings are often only one level higher or lower than the quant tool grades. Two levels is rather rare, but that’s the case here. That said, my thesis primarily lies in the market and macro environment and headwinds that are hard to fully capture with quant tools. I don’t put as much weight into momentum as the other factors, and I’d argue the dividend grade is rather rich.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214018625793_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1254\" data-height=\"478\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214018625793_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"quant grades COPX\" width=\"640\" height=\"244\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214018625793_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214018625793_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214018625793_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214018625793_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why I Could Be Wrong</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this article, I focused on AI development and its impact on copper demand. However, copper is used in many other endeavors as well. Copper piping is common in households. Copper is also crucial for electric vehicle technologies. Demand outside of AI may push prices higher even if AI companies go on a diet. Further, other countries are entering the AI race and are building out data centers, which should bolster copper demand.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Takeaway: Solid Upside But Higher Risk</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">COPX has had a good run, but for now, I believe tailwinds will weaken a bit. As such, COPX is now a hold for me. Investors would be wise to keep an eye on emerging technologies and their potential to disrupt copper demand. The stockpiles could result in a glut, but I’d expect that to be short-lived.</p>",

This call was based on structural risk-reward asymmetry alone. PLTW, with a 120% Palantir (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR\" title=\"Palantir Technologies Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">PLTR</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) weekly return tracking methodology, is obviously a leveraged and suffers when Palantir Technologies, Inc. (PLTR) corrects. So, as expected, since August, PLTW has corrected significantly.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Where PLTY disappoints is that during past drawdowns (like April 2025), it has hardly mitigated collapses to the same extent that it caps upsides. That is the risk asymmetry that had made PLTY a Hold in my view. As Palantir has corrected significantly over the past few months now, I have reviewed the PLTW vs. PLTY thesis to study whether the expected structural issues have persisted in PLTY in a slower and longer drawdown — and they have. On the contrary, PLTW has done what its structure predictably allows. The first sustained drawdown gives us critical insights into the structural differences and hence sets expectations ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, the structural hierarchy remains Buy PLTW and Hold PLTY because no structural fixes have emerged since in PLTY. A look at the PLTY structure now shows it is well-poised to capture gains if there is a rebound. However, a similar structure in the recent past was also attributed to a lack of meaningful drawdown mitigation. Actively managed option-based strategies have active agility potential in terms of strike selection, the extent of portfolio coverage, and even implementing different derivative strategies (like collars or spreads) — PLTY's performance and current positioning seem to indicate they maintain a light options layer, i.e., less income focus and keeping upside capture open. Despite that upside capture focus, it is obviously behind PLTW if PLTR rebounds.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Palantir is the Protagonist</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A look at the charts comparing total returns between PLTR, PLTY, and PLTW clearly shows the obvious - the primary decider of where PLTY and PLTW are headed is Palantir. There is no way around betting on the underlying thesis when riding both vehicles: PLTW is obvious by definition, and PLTY is because of its setup (as we will see in the subsequent section).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_3a015a98018912cfa364eabb56c46ebc.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_3a015a98018912cfa364eabb56c46ebc.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_3a015a98018912cfa364eabb56c46ebc.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_3a015a98018912cfa364eabb56c46ebc.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In August, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4793478-palantirs-retail-led-rally-might-have-structural-legs\">I had a bullish thesis</a> in Palantir. That <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4839687-palantir-great-quarter-greater-caution\">outlook changed</a> in November, and I have not changed my outlook since. The concerns that emerged in November were centered around extreme valuation expansion in a market that was looking less sure about underwriting long-duration growth assumptions. I also took a neutral stand because stock-based compensation appeared to be a high-risk dilution if shares corrected. Despite strong execution and growth, cash generation lagged operating leverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market regime has not changed since, and this time we have not yet seen a quick rebound like we saw in April 2025. I am yet to update my view on Palantir ahead, but I have a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872479-schgs-upgrade-engine-is-losing-steam-time-to-temper-expectations\">generic thesis</a> around growth markets and how they are poised for a period of consolidation ahead, as earnings grow into valuations and earnings upgrades start showing up only after a few quarters of digestion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">PLTW clearly moves when Palantir moves next, either up or further down. PLTY too, despite an option layer, does not add too much alpha in consolidation. Most of its trajectory is a reflection of Palantir. So, there is little to choose between them in the upcoming expected phase of stagnation. The clearer positioning choice is for the next big move, whenever that happens.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strictly speaking from a statistical perspective, the odds of an upward move increase after a stock is down ~30% (from August). Plus, the long-term thesis in Palantir is still intact (although timing is not). Another angle that preserves the PLTW Buy and a PLTY Hold at this point (apart from odds and Palantir outlook) is that the utility of an option-based strategy like PLTY is usually at the highs (like was the case in August) and less so now, after some meaningful corrections. I had explained this use case of options-based strategies at underlying highs for BTCI in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4864360-btcis-moment-is-over-why-this-bitcoin-income-star-just-lost-its-edge\">a separate </a>analysis; the same is applicable for PLTY and any other covered call play:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>BTCI is a psychologically easier vehicle to ride Bitcoin at the highs. Although the drawdown mitigation is not huge, when investors have a fear of heights after a Bitcoin rally, BTCI offers a less daunting entry - knowing fully well it will trace upsides reasonably well from there but offers consolation if there is a crash (material or not).</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So overall, PLTY and PLTW both work on Palantir's moves, and overwhelmingly so. Simply looking at the risk-reward asymmetry when Palantir rallies and the increasing odds after a correction, PLTW becomes an even stronger Buy today over PLTY than it was in August. Of course, if your Palantir thesis is weak, neither vehicle is appropriate.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">First Sustained Drawdown and What it Reveals</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apart from a change in the underlying strength (Palantir), one of the key reasons to revisit this thesis is to see whether my theoretical expectations of minimal drawdown protection in PLTY still holds in a slower drawdown, this being the first sustained drawdown since PLTY's inception. Unfortunately, it does.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I had mentioned how the speed of a drawdown matters in my earlier thesis, and this is how a longer drawn-out correction offers a chance for an option-based strategy to provide a greater (although limited) cushion. If I were to buy an ATM option for a March-end expiry today, the $130 strike <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR/options\">call option</a> is trading close to $8. That is ~6% premiums relative to the spot prices. In other words, a fully covered portfolio through ATM call writing should limit drawdowns in the underlying by 6% — the premiums earned on written calls. The exact extent of protection is limited and defined by the number of options written.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Income strategies often balance aggressive income versus keeping upside capture open (through a lighter option layer and written at further strikes). But whatever the level of aggressiveness, unless the option layer is extremely small, you expect a material mitigation from this setup every month. And since the mitigation is limited, a prolonged slump over several months adds up premiums earned compared to a sharp drop (like April 2025) and rebound scenario. Since August, Palantir has been broadly flat and has been correcting since the end of last year (more than a month). Across the entire period, the option premiums earned should have added up. However, the returns data show only a ~3% mitigation in this period in the PLTY route. In what has been a first regime of \"flat followed by corrections\" period for Palantir spanning months, the strategy has disappointed even my own theoretical expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This can be explained by PLTY's exact setup. And once that is understood, expectations ahead also become clearer. I downloaded the current holdings (as of February 25, 2026) and saw synthetic positions (implemented as short puts and long calls at strikes of $140 and $150) for March and April expiries. The total exposure adds up to ~$372 million. The option layer is implemented as a staggered ladder of call spreads (long far away strike and short the nearer strike). There are three such setups with the strikes for the spread only $5 apart. The total notional value of this layer adds up to ~$325 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62089123-17720054533708062_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"864\" data-height=\"224\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62089123-17720054533708062_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"PLTY Current Portfolio - Feb 25th 2026\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"166\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62089123-17720054533708062_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62089123-17720054533708062_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62089123-17720054533708062_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62089123-17720054533708062_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">PLTY Current Portfolio - Feb 25th 2026 <span>(PLTY Holdings (Website))</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A couple of observations can be made from this setup that explains both the lack of drawdown mitigation and its relatively better position in capturing upsides. A spread setup means all the income from the short call position is not retained — a significant chunk is used to fund the long position in the further strike call that retains upside capture. The net income is poor from the setup and explains why it should not be expected to add alpha in drawdowns and flat conditions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The long call leg of the covered call spread implies sharper rallies are relatively well captured; there are blind spots such as the spot ending up between the strikes and efficiency losses from net premium costs while capturing such a rally. So, the expectation from PLTY is one where drawdowns are mitigated but not materially; nothing meaningful is added in consolidating markets, and rebounds from here can be captured well but will still lag due to inefficiencies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, PLTW captures any rebound within any timeframe (from a sharp rebound to a slow grind up) and adds the ~20% leverage on top of the efficient upside capture. The current drawdown also reveals how PLTW has its own shortcomings too. PLTW uses total return swaps that provide linear exposure to the underlying returns. This is leveraged roughly to around 120%, but there is no option convexity loss that explains the more than 20% magnification of the ~31% drawdown in PLTR.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Simple math implies that a 120% leveraged vehicle should be only down by 37-37.5%, but PLTW has another 2-2.5% extra drag to account for. This mechanism is implied in the weekly reset structure, where there could be permanent volatility drag and losses irrespective of the eventual direction of the underlying stock. Usually volatility is seen more during drawdowns, but it could be applicable in rallies too if that remains volatile. So, while PLTW offers mechanical leverage minus an option layer that could add alpha, it does have a permanent volatility drag. This can range anywhere around the 2-2.5% drag we saw in the past months, meaning a longer wait time before a rebound can mean some losses that will not be recovered even if PLTR finally rebounds.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Pecking Order is Retained</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The final takeaways of this thesis, updated for the slower and more sustained drawdown scenario, are the following. I will enumerate only the ones that have become more visible over the past five months. One, Palantir is the main protagonist. If investors do not have a bullish underlying thesis on Palantir in the long run, then neither instrument is recommended. Two, for those who still have a long-term bullish thesis, the pecking order remains PLTW (Buy) over PLTY (Hold). This is because the odds of a rebound appear stronger now, and PLTY's utility as an entry vehicle at the highs is diminished after a fall.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Three, PLTW does have a cost of waiting. However, while PLTY theoretically has the advantage of being able to add premium income if Palantir consolidates for a long while, its setup is geared to capture upside over generating income. So, unless the wait is prolonged (over a year), PLTW's waiting premium (due to volatility losses) still does not compensate enough for the gains when Palantir rebounds. In fact, PLTY's performance in a slower drawdown period has shown how it is structurally set up for gains over income — the very game that PLTW should excel in.</p>",

For this purpose, looking through the lenses of relationship psychology, I first use Rusbult’s \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_model_of_commitment\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Investment Model of Commitment</a>\" to show that investors are likely to remain committed to the cybersecurity provider after Anthropic (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANTHRO\" title=\"Anthropic\">ANTHRO</a>) recently unveiled a new AI feature called Claude Code Security.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Relationship Psychology Shows Customers Are Likely to Remain Committed to CrowdStrike</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a social psychologist, Caryl Rusbult conceived her commitment model to explain why people stay in relationships for years, even when it appears to others (the family or society) that it is not worth staying together. In this particular context, “investment” means the time and effort (including financial) that each person has committed to their relationship.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Making a parallel with cybersecurity, corporations that choose CrowdStrike not only invest capital to purchase its endpoint security but also train their support teams (engineers and technicians) on the associated products, highlighting a partnership relationship rather than a buyer-seller approach.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to investment, Rusbult also emphasizes satisfaction (how good the relationship feels) and alternatives (like the implications of getting separated). In other words, if someone has made a big investment in a relationship and is satisfied while not having valid alternatives, she will continue to be committed (to her partner), even if there are intermittent problems (quarrels).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the same way, even when the glitch impacted 8.5 million devices due to a malfunction in CrowdStrike's security updates in 2024, the company continues to remain <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/platform/\" rel=\"nofollow\">trusted</a>, as shown below, because customers obtain satisfaction from its Falcon platform to safeguard their data and comply with the strictest regulations, especially when facing AI-driven <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/platform/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">cyberattacks</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720005541649184_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1463\" data-height=\"645\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720005541649184_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"s\" width=\"640\" height=\"282\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720005541649184_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720005541649184_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720005541649184_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720005541649184_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>www.crowdstrike.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In consequence, CrowdStrike did not face an erosion of its customer base, but, on the contrary, its total sales progressed from <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD/income-statement\">$3.05 billion</a> in fiscal year 2024 (FY-24 ending in January 2024) to $3.95 billion in FY 2025. Also, revenues of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD/earnings/estimates\">$4.80 billion</a> are expected for FY-26, which would represent a 21.5% YoY increase if achieved.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Instead of Being Disrupted, CrowdStrike Has Rapidly Integrated GenAI</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using the same logic, that is, a trust relationship is not easily broken, even if a new competitor comes up with a much cheaper endpoint protection tool as a result of employing AI agents (virtual software entities that work on behalf of a human developer) instead of human developers, it is unlikely for enterprises with critical data valued at billions of dollars to entrust them with their IT security needs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is especially so since, to reduce the chances of it being disrupted, CrowdStrike has rapidly integrated Gen AI in its product line, namely with <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/platform/charlotte-ai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charlotte AI,</a> as shown below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/49663886-17717389438881798_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"709\" data-height=\"358\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/49663886-17717389438881798_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"s\" width=\"640\" height=\"323\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/49663886-17717389438881798_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/49663886-17717389438881798_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/49663886-17717389438881798_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/49663886-17717389438881798_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>www.crowdstrike.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The approach here consists of assisting users, such as security analysts working in SOCs (Security Operations Centers), in identifying potential threats before they translate into issues. For investors, large enterprises rely on these centers, which are manned by security analysts on a 24/7 basis and which act as the first line of defense against viruses and cyberattacks. The problem is that this includes tedious and resource-intensive tasks that consume significant man-hours, given the sheer number of alerts. To address this issue, CrowdStrike automates or partially automates (depending on the corporate goals) through AI agents deployed through the Falcon <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/platform/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Agentic</a> Security Platform, an augmented version of its Falcon product.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The aim is to make the SOCs more autonomous, an approach essential to avoid staff manning them drowning in alerts as these rise <a href=\"https://www.vikingcloud.com/blog/cybersecurity-statistics#:~:text=The%20Outlook%20on%20Cyberattacks%20is,%E2%80%A2\" rel=\"nofollow\">exponentially</a>. Moreover, with the Charlotte AI platform, another innovation consists of the alert database being queried in natural language (plain English) instead of complex jargon understandable only by highly trained professionals. With such an approach, junior analysts can do the job, thus economizing support dollars for CrowdStrike's customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, against the daunting backdrop consisting of the <a href=\"https://onlineprograms.ecu.edu/blog/ai-cyber-attacks/#:~:text=The%20advancement%20and%20increasing%20accessibility,2023%2C%20according%20to%20a%20report\" rel=\"nofollow\">astronomical</a> rise of AI-driven attacks, whereas the hacker enhances his capabilities using AI agents, CrowdStrike has not stayed idle. It has rapidly embedded innovation in its cybersecurity portfolio. However, in sharp contrast, the stock has suffered and lost around <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD\">8%</a> on February 20 after the Anthropic announcement, hinting that investors are overlooking how the cybersecurity provider has augmented its products using AI and the trust factor. This is why I believe the stock deserves better.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuing CrowdStrike Based on the Trust Factor and Competitive Positioning</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, to quantify \"human trust\" in a stock like CrowdStrike involves assessing how customer loyalty fared in the period following the major outage. Now, in addition to revenue growth mentioned earlier, its fiscal third quarter 2025 (which ended in October 2024) gross retention rate, or the percentage of recurring revenue retained from existing customers, of over <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740521-crowdstrike-holdings-inc-crwd-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">97%,</a> shows resiliency three months after the outage, due to customers sticking to Falcon. Also, net retention rate, which measures whether customers have purchased more from the company, was <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740521-crowdstrike-holdings-inc-crwd-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">115%</a>, showing a strengthened commitment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The next step is to assess how brand perception has evolved as AI has taken center stage over the last two years. In this case, its Net Promoter Score of <a href=\"https://www.comparably.com/brands/crowdstrike\" rel=\"nofollow\">42</a> (on a scale of -100 to 100) indicates that its reputation remains positive, with 63% promoters (satisfied users) and 21% detractors (dissatisfied users).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, loyalty and a strong brand both support product adoption and sales, but only if the technology has kept up amid the competition. In this connection, as shown <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/platform/\" rel=\"nofollow\">below</a>, the company has been named a <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/crowdstrike-leader-2025-idc-marketscape-exposure-management/#:~:text=AI%20agents%20and%20automated%20remediation,addresses%20risk%20in%20real%20time.\" rel=\"nofollow\">leader</a> in IDC MarketScape for Exposure Management in August 2025, ahead of Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), which has been categorized as a major player. Additionally, the cybersecurity pure play was named as a leader in managed (threat) detection and response by <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/crowdstrike-named-leader-forrester-wave-managed-detection-response-services-europe-q3-2025/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forrester</a> last year, after being named as a leader for endpoint protection alongside some other big names by <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/why-crowdstrike/crowdstrike-industry-validation/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gartner</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49663886-17720922492986019_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1226\" data-height=\"698\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49663886-17720922492986019_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"s\" width=\"640\" height=\"364\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49663886-17720922492986019_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49663886-17720922492986019_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49663886-17720922492986019_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49663886-17720922492986019_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>www.crowdstrike.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notably, specifically related to cost, its endpoint security was stated to deliver <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/press-releases/crowdstrike-endpoint-security-delivers-high-roi-forrester-study/\" rel=\"nofollow\">273%</a> ROI over three years with a payback period of under six months, which, according to me, sets up a very high bar that emerging players have to beat. Thus, in view of the strength of its brand, ability to maintain customer loyalty, its competitive positioning, and its undervaluation (trading at a trailing P/S of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD/valuation/metrics\">21x</a>, which is around 23% below its five-year average), it appears to have been punished too hard.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, applying a premium of 23% to its current share price of $350, I have a target of $430 (350 x 1.23). This still represents a moderate position given its above 40% slide since November last year, but there are risks mainly related to AI startups.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <span>There Are Risks, But Paradoxically, AI Implies More Business for</span> <span>CrowdStrike</span> </h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What’s great about the recently launched Anthropic's security feature, Claude <a href=\"https://snyk.io/articles/anthropic-launches-claude-code-security/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Code</a> Security, is that it automatically scans code for security weaknesses, even suggesting fixes. Its launch on February 20 spelled havoc for cybersecurity stocks, with CrowdStrike sliding by around <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD\">8%</a>, which is considerable. There could be other similar episodes triggered by AI-led innovation, given that cybersecurity startups have garnered more than<a href=\"https://softwarestrategiesblog.com/2025/10/28/top-ten-cybersecurity-startups-2025-investor-funding/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> $3 billion</a> in venture capital.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, in addition to AI bubble fears, which were amplified since November last year (introductory chart), the stock has also been volatile because of “SaaS is <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/blogs/saas-as-we-know-it-is-dead-how-to-survive-the-saas-pocalypse/\" rel=\"nofollow\">dead</a>” fears. This centers around the emergence of new competitors (disruptors) offering cheaper products as a result of carrying out software development using AI agents instead of the human programmers employed by incumbents.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I believe these fears are largely unjustified for the following reasons.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, while Claude Security has potential, it is currently available in limited research preview mode, meaning for testing and refinement for production environments through a select group of users, not for general, unrestricted commercial use. Second, the fact that it can spot serious new vulnerabilities can also potentially be used by attackers to augment their attacks, something known as the <a href=\"https://www.trendingtopics.eu/anthropic-claude-code-security-flash-crash-stocks/\" rel=\"nofollow\">dual-use</a> aspect of technology, or be used for good or bad. One example is hackers using Anthropic AI to commit <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr24eqnnq9o\" rel=\"nofollow\">theft.</a> Thus, organizations have to be very careful when using Claude Security.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the company is not immune to volatility related to the AI bubble bursting or a new startup developing a revolutionary IT protection solution, I believe that paradoxically, its business could benefit from AI, potentially amplifying the number of cyberattacks. In this connection, when talking about AI agents during the most recent earnings call, CrowdStrike's CEO emphasized their \"rapidly <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4527899-crowdstrike-outlines-23-percent-arr-growth-target-for-fy26-as-ai-driven-demand-accelerates\">expanding</a> risk profile\" and how these represented a \"major driver for the business\". This implies more sales and supports the bullish position, as cybersecurity annual spending is expected to exceed <a href=\"https://cybersecurityventures.com/official-2026-cybersecurity-market-report-predictions-and-statistics/\" rel=\"nofollow\">$500 billion</a> as of this year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the Age of AI Agents, Human-Based Trust and CrowdStrike Integrated Platform Are Essential</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In conclusion, this thesis has shown the importance of human-based trust, a key element that, according to me, is being overlooked as investors' focus on AI’s prowess during product demos, not what they are actually capable of in a corporate setup. In the same vein, AI startups cannot replicate CrowdStrike's highly integrated Falcon platform, which combines endpoint, identity protection, data protection, threat intelligence, etc., as shown <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/platform/\" rel=\"nofollow\">below</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720462947305083_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1256\" data-height=\"455\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720462947305083_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"s\" width=\"640\" height=\"232\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720462947305083_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720462947305083_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720462947305083_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720462947305083_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>www.crowdstrike.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On top of that, CrowdStrike's technology is deeply integrated within customers' security operations and corporate process flows (established procedures) in a trustworthy manner for years. This all means that there are high switching costs for those thinking of dumping CrowdStrike products.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last, as the IT security landscape becomes more perilous, it is unlikely for companies to entrust the protection of their critical infrastructure to AI startups using agents. The reason is that one of the good agents may go rogue (possibly as a result of being hacked by a bad actor), leading to a breach, just like in the movie <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_%282007_film%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Breach</a> (2007), where Robert Hanssen, an FBI agent, leaked top-secret information to the Soviet Union and betrayed his country. In these conditions, organizations are more likely to continue trusting CrowdStrike's cybersecurity approach, where human capabilities are augmented by AI, instead of an AI-driven competitor with no track record.</p>",
