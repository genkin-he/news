The President stopped first in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, followed by Japan and South Korea. Last, but not least, and most importantly, he met with Chinese<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> President Xi on Thursday, Oct. 30.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What did the meeting with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (“ASEAN”) accomplish?</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Thailand</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The White House segmented the President’s <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/10/president-trump-opens-asia-trip-by-securing-landmark-wins-for-america/\" rel=\"nofollow\">deals into three groups</a>: peace deals, trade deals, and critical minerals deals. The peace deal might have minimal interest to readers, since defense firms like Lockheed Martin Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT\" title=\"Lockheed Martin Corporation\">LMT</a>), The Boeing Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA\" title=\"The Boeing Company\">BA</a>), or RTX Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RTX\" title=\"RTX Corporation\">RTX</a>). Product sales for defense contractors are bigger in other markets and countries. For example, RTX stock jumped by 6.11% in the last month to continue its yearlong uptrend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">RTX posted resilient strength in commercial aerospace, thanks to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831449-rtx-corporation-rtx-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">passenger air travel</a> resiliency. In addition, Pratt Canada serviced nearly 70,000 engines. RTX’s backlog grew by 13% Y/Y to $251 billion. Its book-to-bill in Q3 was 1.63. Collins and Pratt’s customers included NASA, General Electric Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GE\" title=\"General Electric Company\">GE</a>), SpaceX, and Textron Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TXT\" title=\"Textron Inc.\">TXT</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Malaysia and Cambodia eliminated tariffs on U.S. exports.

The U.S. and China paused tariffs and restrictions, respectively, for one year. They will continue to play their long game using short-term agreements in principle. Investors will need to exercise caution in holding companies that struggled before tariffs. For example, Newell Brands Inc.

(NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW\" class=\"ticker-link\">LOW</a>) is an American retail company, specializing in home improvement, maintenance, and decorating products and services. This is one of a few market-leading companies with a significant presence, highlighting more than <a href=\"https://corporate.lowes.com/who-we-are/our-business\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">1,700</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> stores.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">LOW stock has declined by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW\">9%</a> over the past 12 months, mainly driven by weak US consumer demand due to an elevated interest-rate environment and slower demand for home improvements. I think a meaningful decrease in new home sales trends, experienced since about 2021, has also significantly contributed to its bearish performance. Although the chart below highlights that <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/new-home-sales\" rel=\"nofollow\">new home sales may resume</a>, it may take time for this to translate into significant top and bottom-line growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617300101956096_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"879\" data-height=\"555\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617300101956096_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"LOW: United States New Home Sales\" width=\"640\" height=\"404\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617300101956096_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617300101956096_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617300101956096_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617300101956096_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617300101956096_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617300101956096_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617300101956096_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617300101956096_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">LOW: United States New Home Sales <span>(Tradingeconomics.com)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is why I think that Lowe's Companies is a Hold with a $266 price target over the next 12 months. This suggests roughly market-like returns, highlighting a 9% upside possibility without dividends. I believe the stock price may mirror bottom-line growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, unless consumers significantly recover and real estate activity increases, I am not sure whether the company can substantially outperform the benchmark in the following year. It has several tailwinds tied to a dovish Fed and easing cycle, but policy might take time; therefore, I remain cautious and monitor the macroeconomic outlook.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">FQ2 2026 Snapshot: Double-Beat Performance, Guiding For A Positive Shift</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On August 20, the company delivered<a href=\"https://corporate.lowes.com/sites/lowes-corp/files/lowes-q2-2025-press-release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"> FQ2 2026</a> results. This was a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/earnings\">double-beat</a> quarter, implying a shift in resumed top-line growth and bottom-line increase. However, based on the neutral investors' reaction, it seems that the market had already anticipated a turnaround, as the stock remained flat with roughly a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/historical-price-quotes\">0.60%</a> drop over the following trading day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lowe's posted $23.96 billion in revenue, up by 1.58% on a year-over-year basis, breaking the streak of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/earnings\">9 consecutive top-line decline</a> quarters. This arrived at about $9 million above what the market had anticipated. The bottom line came in at $4.33 in diluted EPS, indicating approximately 6% increase versus $4.10 in the same quarter last year, and $0.09 above the analysts' estimates, implying a 2% surprise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618140109823966_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1053\" data-height=\"461\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618140109823966_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"LOW: FQ2 2025 Key Highlights\" width=\"640\" height=\"280\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618140109823966_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618140109823966_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618140109823966_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618140109823966_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618140109823966_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618140109823966_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618140109823966_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618140109823966_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">LOW: FQ2 2025 Key Highlights <span>(Lowe's Companies Investor Relations)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management highlighted that the comparable sales increased by 1.1%, which is uplifting, considering the company has been experiencing a multi-month top-line contraction. The retail company underscored that it achieved 33.8% gross margin and 14.5% operating margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The home renovation business represented a 3.6% increase in comparable sales for ticket sizes exceeding $500, which I believe is promising and supports a bullish future. This also correlates to an increase in new home sales in the US, implying that home renovation products are typically tied to a higher price tag. Moreover, it may indicate that consumer spending is improving, and that would be a positive tailwind for this retail industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618143136829653_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1050\" data-height=\"342\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618143136829653_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"LOW: FQ2 2025 Key Highlights\" width=\"640\" height=\"208\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618143136829653_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618143136829653_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618143136829653_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618143136829653_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618143136829653_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618143136829653_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618143136829653_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618143136829653_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">LOW: FQ2 2025 Key Highlights <span>(Lowe's Companies Investor Relations)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the upside, the company highlighted it has experienced positive comparable sales in 9 out of 15 regions it operates. This also supports a bullish narrative and may sustain a positive stock price momentum, underlining a roughly <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/historical-price-quotes\">7% increase</a> over the past 6 months. I think this quarterly report underscored a promising shift in the company's performance. If the trend continues, I believe Lowe may rebound from these levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lowe's is expected to deliver its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/earnings/estimates?period=quarterly\">FQ3 2026</a> results on November 19, before the market opens. The market is forecasting $20.88 billion in revenue, implying about a 3.5% growth on a year-over-year basis, and roughly $3.00 in diluted EPS, representing approximately a 3.7% increase over the past 12 months. I think the company appears to be well-positioned to achieve these results. Given its recent performance and uptick in new home sales, LOW may meet the market expectations. If that materializes, investor confidence may improve, followed by expectations of a recovering consumer.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lowe's Appears To Be Fairly Priced, And I Argue That The Market Has Priced In The Consumer Recovery</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The home renovation retailer currently trades at a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/valuation/metrics\">forward P/E of about 20</a>, which appears to be approximately 12% overvalued versus the sector median of around 18 earnings multiples. However, versus the average company in the S&amp;P500 at roughly<a href=\"https://en.macromicro.me/series/20052/sp500-forward-pe-ratio\" rel=\"nofollow\"> 24x</a>, Lowe's trades at a 20% discount. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618154444049218.png?io=w640\" alt=\"LOW: Forward P/E\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"622\" height=\"409\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618154444049218.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618154444049218.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618154444049218.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618154444049218.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618154444049218.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618154444049218.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618154444049218.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618154444049218.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">LOW: Forward P/E <span>(YCharts)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The chart above also suggests that the current valuation reflects the high end of the trading range, which supports my outlook that upside may be limited in the near term. The forward P/E has increased significantly from about the mid-14's back in December 2023 to the current levels, mainly driven by the bottoming phase in the real estate market, as that period reflected the weakest activity over the past years. This also may support my stance that consumer recovery may already be priced in. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the forward PEG (non-GAAP) basis of 3.16, the company appears to be trading at a substantial premium to peers at 1.73. This implies more than an 80% premium, which adds an extra argument to my bearish stance. This also clouds a positive outlook. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The forward EV/Sales and Price/Sales ratios of 2.01 and 1.61, respectively, justify my thesis supporting a slightly bearish outlook, and that the market may have already priced in the improvement of consumer spending. This presents 60% overvaluation at the midpoint versus the sector median of 1.35 and 0.97. This also shows that even though the home renovation company may post an acceleration in top-line growth, this does not necessarily result in stock price appreciation. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618160646215525_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"871\" data-height=\"214\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618160646215525_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"LOW: Capital Structure\" width=\"640\" height=\"157\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618160646215525_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618160646215525_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618160646215525_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618160646215525_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618160646215525_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618160646215525_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618160646215525_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618160646215525_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">LOW: Capital Structure <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lowe's remains a heavily leveraged company, and that may cap the upside in the near term. The retail name has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/valuation/capital-structure\">$39 billion</a> in total obligations, which appears to be significant, and resulted in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/income-statement\">$355 million</a> in interest expenses to service the debt. Although it has $5.26 billion in cash that partially offsets its obligations, it remains elevated and could weigh on the stock price further.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company had achieved a roughly flat performance on both top and bottom lines over the past year. LOW experienced a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/growth\">0.49%</a> revenue decline and 0.93% EPS growth over the past 12 months. This may suggest that the current valuation appears slightly too high. However, I think investors have priced in the consumer recovery, which resulted in a premium multiple. Nevertheless, this suggests that if the company experiences weaker-than-anticipated results, the stock price could correct from these levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The retail company has been operating at a roughly market-like gross profit margin (TTM) of about <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/profitability\">34%</a>, which justifies a fair valuation. This implies about a 13% discount to peers in the consumer discretionary segment, but I think that with consumer recovery, the company may be able to enhance profitability metrics. However, this is an area to monitor for investors, as higher margins could result in premium multiples.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618165161298163.png?io=w640\" alt=\"LOW: Net Income (TTM)\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"624\" height=\"413\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618165161298163.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618165161298163.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618165161298163.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618165161298163.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618165161298163.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618165161298163.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618165161298163.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618165161298163.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">LOW: Net Income (TTM) <span>(YCharts)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, the net income margin (TTM) of 8.20% reflects about 2x outperformance versus peers of 4.31%, and that supports a bullish narrative for the company. This also highlights that LOW remains a highly profitable business, which may fuel the bottom-line growth in the following years. This also supports my thesis that the stock price may follow EPS expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Wall Street <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/earnings/estimates\">estimates</a> a $12.32 in diluted EPS for fiscal FY2026, up by 3% on a year-over-year basis, and $13.32 for fiscal FY2027, reflecting 8% increase versus the fiscal FY2026 estimate. I think Lowe's appears to be well-positioned to achieve these results. The company remains profitable, operating at market-like margins. If real estate activity continues to improve, and consumer spending rises, this may act as a substantial tailwind driving the bottom-line growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we apply a roughly current earnings multiple of 20x to a fiscal FY2027 EPS estimate of $13.32, we arrive at my price target of $266. This would represent about 9% upside possibility, driven by bottom-line growth. However, given the macroeconomic uncertainties, I think the stock may mirror its EPS performance, yet I am not sure whether LOW can significantly outperform the benchmark without a significant revenue growth catalyst.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Main Risks And Concerns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are risks and concerns tied to Lowe's that could meaningfully impact the stock price performance in the short term. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The home renovation company is highly dependent on the macroeconomic outlook. If inflation remains elevated or the job market weakens, this could result in slower-than-anticipated consumer spending and suppressed sentiment. This may also encourage the Fed to pause the easing cycle, which would establish an unfavorable environment for the company. This could stress its performance and result in continued underperformance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although new home sales experienced an uptick, and their growth appears to be resuming, it may not necessarily be the case. There is a possibility that, followed by macroeconomic uncertainties, new home sales may come in weaker-than-anticipated. This could pressure the stock price further. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lowe's is exposed to tariffs, and that is a concern. This is another argument for suppressed margins, and if tariffs will remain a concern over the following years, the market may reprice the company at a lower multiple. Because of this, the company is also experiencing cost inflation, which supports my limited upside narrative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering its 12-month top and bottom-line performance, LOW experiences stagnation. However, it also trades at only a 20% discount to the benchmark. This suggests that if the outlook remains cloudy, investors may not be willing to pay a higher premium for the company. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the upside, if none of the above materializes, and tariff risks and concerns fade away, the company could continue trading at a premium, and there may even be room for multiple expansion. I believe that investors should monitor whether an uptick in new home sales was only a short-term blip. If that is not the case, LOW may be able to accelerate its top and bottom-line expansion, which may be bullish for its stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Macro Shifts Appear Promising, But I Remain Cautious — A Hold</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that Lowe's may appear to be an interesting opportunity for long-term investors who may seek to diversify into the retail industry with exposure to real estate markets. For multiple years now, the real estate landscape has been stressed, but recent progress highlighting an uptick in new home sales may be promising and supports a bullish stance for the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, it remains trading at elevated multiples, despite experiencing stagnation on both the top and bottom line. This highlights that the market may already be priced in for future growth, which would suggest upside may be limited in the near term. To that, there is a risk that improved consumer spending in real estate was just a one-off blip, which may suggest that investors could reprice the stock at a lower multiple if tailwinds do not materialize.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given this, and a fairly valued stock, I think Lowe's Companies is a Hold. I think the stock may mirror bottom-line expansion, but I also don't believe it could significantly outperform the benchmark without a meaningful revenue growth catalyst. I forecast a $266 price target over the next 12 months, suggesting a 9% upside potential, but unlikely to outperform the broader market. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/ratings/sell-side-ratings\">35 Wall Street analysts</a> forecast a $282 price target, implying a roughly 18% upside possibility. This is a possibility, but I remain cautious until more data regarding real estate market activity appears.</p>",

The market has been reluctant to push the stock much higher recently, likely because some consider it overvalued. The stock<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> has essentially flatlined since my last article on Broadcom. However, there are still reasons growth investors may want to purchase this stock despite trading at what some consider an elevated valuation.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most significant reason investors may want to invest in Broadcom today is the potential for massive revenue growth acceleration from its artificial intelligence (\"AI\") business. Recently, Chief Executive Officer<span> </span>Hock Tan tied his pay incentives to the company's AI business, with the condition that the AI business achieve certain revenue in 2030. At the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821295-broadcom-inc-avgo-presents-at-goldman-sachs-communacopia-technology-conference-2025\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821295-broadcom-inc-avgo-presents-at-goldman-sachs-communacopia-technology-conference-2025\" target=\"_blank\">Technology Conference 2025</a> on Sept. 9, CEO Tan said:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>As you know, I signed up for an extension of my contract to 2030. With this extension, of course, I get some incentives. One of that incentives that tied to it is tied to - so you guys know AI revenue for Broadcom, very simple. And I need to hit to achieve max on my incentive for 2030, five years from now, give you a sense, AI revenue of exceeding $120 billion, OK? Today, '25, our AI revenue is $20 billion. But that gives you a sense of our belief how strong the demand for compute is in this race towards AI, generative AI, super intelligence.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Suppose you plug those numbers ($20 billion in 2025 and $120 billion in 2030) into a compound annual growth rate (\"CAGR\") calculator. In that case, it results in a 43.1% CAGR over five years—absolutely explosive revenue growth from AI alone. Hock Tan has been the CEO of Broadcom since March 2006, following Avago Technologies' merger with Broadcom and the formation of the new Broadcom Inc. The company has displayed excellent execution during Hock Tan's reign. A bet that Hock Tan can guide Broadcom to $120 billion in AI revenue by 2030 is not a bad bet. It's within the realm of possibility, especially considering the growth of the AI marketplace.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">He also noted at the conference that the company initially projected 60% revenue growth for fiscal year (\"FY\") 2026, but now expects that growth rate to accelerate beyond 60%. Typically, when revenue growth accelerates, momentum investors bid up the stock price. Broadcom's report date for fourth quarter 2025 earnings is on Dec. 11. If the company beats analysts' revenue estimates and raises 2026 guidance when it reports fourth-quarter earnings, it may spark a post-earnings rally in the stock—a good reason to invest in the near term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI Compute and networking</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference 2025, CEO Hock Tan explained he views the AI market in two distinct customer groups. The first group (the creators) consists of only a few significant players that include hyperscalers such as Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>), Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), and \"super start-ups\" or labs (like OpenAI, Anthropic) that are creating the Large Language Models (LLMs) and new platforms of the future. Hock Tan estimates that several players in the creator market spend up to $30 billion a year on AI infrastructure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hock Tan describes the creator group at the Goldman Sachs Conference:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>These are the guys who are really making that investment in LLMs, which entail huge amount of R&amp;D, particularly in respect to training, which is just - not just creating that algorithms to create those LLMs and make it work, but to also create the ability and spend on the ability to train huge amounts of data to improve on their journey towards super intelligence as we - for (want) of a better word.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second group is a more fragmented group of AI users, or the enterprise market, consisting of thousands of regular companies, public cloud customers, and government/sovereign entities, who are primarily interested in using AI to improve their businesses and achieve \"productivity gains.\" These users are rarely interested in doing much training. The AI user market is essentially the AI inference market. Hock Tan estimates the AI user market consists of around 10,000 customers today, each spending around $10 million a year, for a total of $100 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CEO Tan also discussed the AI user market at the Goldman conference:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>There's thousands and thousands of companies out there who are looking at AI as a very interesting tool to improve the way they run their business to basically achieve mostly productivity gains, which is truly - and trying to find use case for it and doubling most of them POCs (proof of concepts) right now on AI tools and trying to run AI and whether they get that ability through renting GPUs or buying some and running on-prem, these are that category. And that category of market are largely inference, truly inference. They talk about training. It's limited. Post training, perhaps, test time scaling, but it's all inference. It's looking for use case and trying to get a return on investment, mostly on productivity. And these guys are going to stay largely on merchant silicon, merchant GPU because they're not going to create XPUs, write software stacks to make it work and figure out all these things.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The creator group may have fewer potential customers, but it's still a sizeable market. Broadcom has little interest in marketing to the AI users market or enterprise customers who are primarily interested in using graphics processing units (\"GPUs\") manufactured by Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) or Advanced Micro Devices (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>), rather than Broadcom's customized XPUs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although the AI chip gets all the hype, Broadcom's biggest advantage in AI infrastructure is its networking products. Not many companies have the resources to compete with Broadcom's networking knowledge, SerDes (Serializer/Deserializer) IP, and deep expertise. SerDes is the technology that moves data between chips at extremely high speeds. Broadcom has pioneered the development and integration of this high-speed IP into its ASICs, making it a key differentiating factor for building large AI clusters (XPUs/custom AI chips). Although many companies have entered the ASIC space over the years, competitors have had difficulty beating Broadcom in the AI infrastructure category because replicating its networking and connectivity technology is difficult.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The LLM Creator market is the only segment that truly pushes the limits of networking, a core Broadcom strength. CEO Hock Tan discussed the importance of networking at the Goldman Conference:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>You are not able to do this generative AI training of this huge database to create this billion, billion parameters models with one single GPU or XPU, no matter how hard you try. You need to create a cluster of them. And the more complex your LLM becomes, the larger your clusters have to be. Then you face yourself a totally different problem. How do you create all this matrix multiplication across, say, 100,000 of the GPU simultaneously. And then you go to 1 million. That's even a bigger headache. That's one of the - that is, in fact, I consider the biggest technology challenge in computing on generative AI as you progress your models higher. And that comes in the other aspect, networking. How do you connect them? How do you have the bandwidth to connect them? How do you schedule the workloads, orchestrate it so that they can all run in parallel. This is more so as much software as the networking side, which is hardware. I think this is one of the biggest challenge towards progression, making massive progress on being able to create super intelligence. How do you get these huge workloads that you're supposed to run on these huge models and be able to train a huge amount of data on a 1 million GPU or XPU simultaneously and converge on a solution.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, AMD and Nvidia, or one of the new players like Groq, Tenstorrent, Lightmatter, Mythic, Hailo, and SambaNova, could build the greatest individual AI chip in the world, and it would all be for naught if they're not networked together optimally. Since networking is Broadcom's bread and butter, with its IP in SerDes and high-performance Ethernet switches like <a href=\"https://www.broadcom.com/products/ethernet-connectivity/switching/strataxgs/bcm78910-series\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.broadcom.com/products/ethernet-connectivity/switching/strataxgs/bcm78910-series\" target=\"_blank\">Tomahawk</a> and <a href=\"https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-ships-jericho4-enabling-distributed-ai-computing-across\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-ships-jericho4-enabling-distributed-ai-computing-across\" target=\"_blank\">Jericho</a>, it has a significant advantage over most companies. The only company that I can think of off the top of my head that has the networking chops to compete with Broadcom is Marvell (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRVL\" title=\"Marvell Technology, Inc.\">MRVL</a>). So, despite press releases from some of its competitors about creating the latest and greatest super-duper chip, some will never be able to overcome Broadcom's networking moat. Customers who buy its hardware, networking, and software understand Broadcom's advantages, and it's unlikely these companies will switch to competitors easily in the near future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Broadcom's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is 29.34, well above its three-, five-, seven-, and 10-year medians.

If one of its customers reduces orders for any reason or if it loses a customer, revenue growth and profits could drop significantly. Investors would likely react negatively and sell off the stock.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some of its hyperscaler customers are actively developing their own in-house chips (like Amazon's Trainium/Inferentia). Broadcom's role is to help hyperscalers build their own chips by supplying foundational IP (such as SerDes) and manufacturing expertise. However, as larger customers gain more experience in manufacturing AI chips, they may eventually cut out Broadcom entirely or move to a lower-cost partner.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Customer concentration within a few giant \"creators\" also carries the risk that they could gain negotiating leverage by threatening to move their business to competing infrastructure providers with lower prices or other advantages, such as Marvell. Broadcom may have to lower product prices to retain customers, potentially eroding gross margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of Marvell, its fiercest rival in the custom AI chip and high-speed networking market, has already secured major <a href=\"https://www.marvell.com/content/dam/marvell/en/company/assets/marvels-ai-momentum-bolstered-by-design-wins-new-contracts.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.marvell.com/content/dam/marvell/en/company/assets/marvels-ai-momentum-bolstered-by-design-wins-new-contracts.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">design wins in the past</a> with hyperscalers like Amazon, Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), and Microsoft. It's actively challenging Broadcom's market share in this lucrative space. While Broadcom has a solid moat in networking (SerDes, switches), it may not be a permanent technology edge. The technology industry has a long history of upstarts disrupting incumbents, and currently, Broadcom is an incumbent with what may eventually become legacy technology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Broadcom also has other competitors that investors should keep an eye on, with the biggest being Nvidia, which has proprietary networking solutions (InfiniBand/NVLink, now Spectrum-X) and a comprehensive CUDA software platform, making it a challenging rival, even as Broadcom pushes its open Ethernet-based solutions, like <a href=\"https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-introduces-industrys-first-800g-ai-ethernet-nic\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-introduces-industrys-first-800g-ai-ethernet-nic\" target=\"_blank\">Thor Ultra</a>. The danger is that competitors may take enough market share to stunt Broadcom's growth or shrink its margins.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Broadcom remains a buy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Broadcom trades at an elevated valuation and, like many technology stocks, has risks that some conservative investors may want to avoid. Assuming upside from the current level implies an extremely aggressive valuation that may discourage value investors from buying it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, if you're a risk-tolerant investor willing to accept some risk in return for a potential high upside, Broadcom may be for you. Analysts estimate revenue to accelerate over the next year. Typically, the market bids up a company's stock price when its revenue growth accelerates. Its FY 2027 PEG ratio implies the stock has a potential 87.50% rise before reaching a PEG ratio of 2.0, the upper limit at which growth investors generally consider a stock overvalued.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I maintain my buy rating on Broadcom.</p>",

Nothing is a buy regardless.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have been buying Meta for a while, since 2022, and I have never sold a single share, but now I am waiting on the sidelines: in about three years, the stock has gone from $85 per share to almost $800. I know that fundamentals improved. However, the price per share doesn’t always go up and sometimes a drop is needed before getting higher: investors might want to realize some profits along the way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recently, the <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/68/116068/original.pdf\">Q3 2025</a> results were released, and as a shareholder I was partially satisfied with the results.

This is what really matters, and the fact that Meta's advertising business keeps growing fast is impressive. The billions invested in AI are creating more targeted advertisings, therefore more effective in generating actual sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Not just that, but people are <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835033-meta-platforms-inc-meta-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">spending more time</a> on social media: compared to last year, 5% more on Facebook, 10% more on Threads, and 30% more on Instagram Reels. On top of that, daily active people passed the 3.50 billion threshold. That’s incredible, and consider that China doesn’t have access to these platforms. Basically, half of the world population uses one of Meta’s apps on a daily basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188735170107_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1379\" data-height=\"632\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188735170107_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"META Q3 2025\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"293\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188735170107_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188735170107_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188735170107_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188735170107_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188735170107_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188735170107_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188735170107_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188735170107_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>META Q3 2025</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All these improvements couldn’t have happened without all the AI CapEx spending.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, don’t get scared by the declining profits.

Anyway, that is not what is worrying investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company announced that 2026 CapEx will be <em>notably larger</em> than 2025 but it didn’t provide more details. We don’t know what they mean by <em>notably larger</em>; it might be $60 billion, $80 billion, or even $100 billion. Meta generated LTM cash from operations of $107 billion, so these kinds of figures are high even for one of the best companies in the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I can’t have any certainty, but I guess that 2026 CapEx will be close to $100 billion. Meta is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4512074-meta-to-raise-30b-in-record-bond-sale-amid-rising-ai-costs\">about to raise $30 billion</a> in bonds to fund the AI spending, and I don’t think they are doing that to increase the CapEx just by $5 billion-$10 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, a question arises: why is the market is so tough with Meta? Microsoft Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), Amazon.com, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) and Alphabet Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) are increasing AI spending as well, but their price per share is heading toward a new all-time high. Well, I think there are multiple reasons for this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Firstly, investing in Meta means investing in CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s vision, something that doesn’t happen with other big tech companies. Zuckerberg controls 58% of voting rights, so he has a huge power in implementing his ideas. This is both a positive and a negative aspect. His intuition about Instagram and WhatsApp was definitely correct, but we can’t know how far he will go with the VR segment. The losses are getting significant and we don’t see any sign of improvement. By doubling CapEx next year, I suppose the quarterly losses might even be higher than $5 billion; that’s a big amount of money even for Meta.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But what exactly is Mark Zuckerberg’s vision? He provided useful insights during the last <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835033-meta-platforms-inc-meta-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">conference call</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>So my view on this is that rather than continuing to be constrained on CapEx and feeling in the core business like we have significant investments that we could make that we're not able to make that would be profitable. But the right thing to do is to try to accelerate this to make sure that we have the compute that we need, both for the AI research and new things that we're doing, and to try to get to a different state on our compute stance on the core business. So that's kind of how I'm thinking about that overall.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think we can sum it up as follows: I don’t care what the market thinks, I am going to invest whatever CapEx we need to exploit this huge opportunity. Even if this means investing a huge part of the cash from operations and getting into debt. And this is exactly what is happening.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188691983855.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"635\" height=\"424\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188691983855.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188691983855.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188691983855.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188691983855.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188691983855.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188691983855.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188691983855.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188691983855.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before getting into the VR segment, Meta had a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META/balance-sheet\">net debt</a> of -$50 billion. Therefore, it held much more cash than debt. Now, the net debt is $6.46 billion and I don’t think this figure includes the ongoing bond issuance. Nothing to worry about in terms of debt sustainability, but I think it is something to look at. It shows that the company is willing to do whatever it can to lead the AI industry, even worsening its financial position.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mark Zuckerberg's approach is quite extreme, that is why investors are considering Meta as a riskier investment. However, let’s not get confused about where all this money will be invested. As Zuckerberg stated, most of the CapEx will be allocated to the core business, therefore Family of Apps, not VR.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fact that Family of Apps' profitability declined is not helping either, because investors are wondering if this huge CapEx is really worth it. And Mark Zuckerberg didn’t provide some clarity about it.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>I think it's too early to really understand what the margins are going to be for the new products that we build. I mean, I think certainly, every -- each product has somewhat different characteristics. And I think we'll kind of understand how that goes over time. I mean, my general goal is to build a business that maximizes value for the people who use our products and maximizes profitability, not margin. So I think we'll kind of just try to build the best things that we can and try to deliver the most value that we can for most people.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, it is too early to estimate the profitability improvements out of the billions invested. In terms of revenue growth it is pretty visible though.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Among the biggest tech companies, I believe Meta is the one that presents the most grey areas. The company is willing to invest every dollar to exploit the current opportunities, and I appreciate that. On the other hand, I see a VR segment that burns about $18 billion- $20 billion each year, and I honestly wonder if it is really worth it. When I first invested in Meta, the net debt was -$50 billion, now $6 billion. Still peanuts for Meta, but the cumulative losses are starting to hurt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The core business is improving a lot in terms of revenue growth, but in terms of profitability, it is struggling a bit. Compared to Alphabet, Microsoft or Amazon, we can’t associate the AI spending with increasing operating profit from the Cloud business, and this makes it harder to understand how profitable these investments actually are.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Anyway, I still firmly believe in this company and it remains one of my biggest holdings. I think we can try to understand where all these investments are going up to a certain point, then we can only trust the management. If they believe that lots of great opportunities are ahead, I am not against going all-in: building the proper infrastructure earlier can really make a difference.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, an aspect that often tends to be overlooked is that Meta can rely on 3.54 billion daily active users. Basically, the company can monetize in millions of ways all the investments it is making, something that other companies can do only to some extent. Its competitive advantage based on the network effect is something that nobody was able to replicate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I still believe Meta is a great business, and I don’t plan to sell any shares in the foreseeable future. Anyway, even though it dropped quite a bit recently, I am waiting for lower levels to buy some shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188696435952_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"952\" data-height=\"313\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188696435952_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DCF model made by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"210\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188696435952_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188696435952_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188696435952_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188696435952_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188696435952_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188696435952_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188696435952_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/56207090-17619188696435952_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DCF model made by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the current price and with a RRR of 12%, the stock is pricing in a 20.50% growth over the next 10 years. This is a feasible assumption, but definitely not conservative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would rather wait $600 or even $550 before jumping back in, partly because Meta already has a big weight in my portfolio. For now, I’ll just watch how the situation evolves, and I don’t rule out a further drop.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We are definitely not in the same situation as in 2022, but investors might make this wrong association. After all, VR losses are growing as well as Capex. As they see the stock falling by double digits, they might lose focus and believe once again that Meta is burning all the money “because of the Metaverse”. I hope you got it that this is not the case, and most of the money invested is for Family of Apps, which is why revenue grew over 20% year-over-year.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After years of strong stock price rises, we might witness a period where Meta is very cheap again. I look forward to catching those opportunities.</p>",

That is the kind of leap that keeps future stock price appreciation as a reasonable goal from the current price.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A lot of LNG export capacity continues to come online. There is also a focus on datacenter growth as another potentially large increase in the use of natural gas. All of this could mean that the North American natural gas market could well join the much stronger world pricing market. Since the stock prices of the midstream industry tend to follow the lead of upstream stock prices, it could well mean that there is more appreciation potential in the future for this stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The parent company, Antero Resources (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AR\" title=\"Antero Resources Corporation\">AR</a>), placed a <a href=\"https://www.anteroresources.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/251/antero-resources-announces-third-quarter-2025-financial-and\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"spot rig\"</a> on dry gas acreage that had not been drilled for some time. That is an extremely visible vote for a very favorable commodity price future that many believe the industry faces.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is possible that capital requirements for Antero Midstream could increase in the future if Antero Resources elects to take advantage of the situation by growing production. If that is the case, the growth of the Midstream Business would mean more free cash flow in the future that could be distributed to shareholders or used in stock repurchases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It was also mentioned that the company purchased treasury shares during the quarter. This is likewise a potential vote for the opinion that the stock is undervalued.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings And Free Cash Flow After Dividends</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings also grew in the teens in the comparison shown below:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618831110668626_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Antero Midstream Free Cash Flow After Dividends Calculation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"691\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618831110668626_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618831110668626_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618831110668626_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618831110668626_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618831110668626_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618831110668626_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618831110668626_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618831110668626_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Antero Midstream Free Cash Flow After Dividends Calculation (Antero Midstream Earnings Press Release Third Quarter 2025)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.anteromidstream.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/156/antero-midstream-announces-third-quarter-2025-financial-and\" rel=\"nofollow\">Note that the dramatic growth</a> in free cash flow for this management was after dividends. Free cash flow before dividends also grew at a nice pace. But nothing close to the headline that management put out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The start of a stock purchase plan likely signals that there is a cushion developing that may later allow for a dividend increase. This dividend has not been increased in several years. But the growth in free cash flow shown above, combined with management's tendency to find good used deals on equipment (usually through bolt-on acquisitions), could mean that a dividend increase may finally be a possibility within the medium-term future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Doing things this way means that if, for some reason, there is a cash flow decline, the dividend is very defensible in that the stock repurchase program can be eliminated first. This would also happen if capital needs increased.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Debt</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The earnings press release also mentioned a debt upgrade that can lead to lower debt costs in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17618836674601455_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Antero Midstream Debt And Liquidity Summary\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"460\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17618836674601455_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17618836674601455_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17618836674601455_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17618836674601455_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17618836674601455_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17618836674601455_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17618836674601455_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17618836674601455_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Antero Midstream Debt And Liquidity Summary (Antero Midstream Corporate Presentation Third Quarter 2025)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The debt rating was upgraded at Moody's. With the current debt ratio among the lowest in the midstream industry, there could be more debt rating upgrades. The main customer, Antero Resources (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AR\" title=\"Antero Resources Corporation\">AR</a>) has been upgraded to investment grade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That gives some room for more investment grades here. Both managements of Antero Resources and Antero Midstream have long explained that the highest debt rating that Antero Midstream can attain is whatever the major customer (Antero Resources) has for a debt rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even though the debt rating is below investment grade, it is likely high enough to allow this company to use the debt market for whatever debt needs it has at a reasonable cost. While the rating is considerable somewhat speculative, it is at the higher end of the speculative range.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Map Of Operations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Antero Midstream has long grown a bit faster than the parent company.

There is still more room for growth using the available capacity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Antero Resources management has long admitted to drilling rich gas acreage because it was more profitable to drill. But now things could be changing to the extent that the dry gas acreage could again be something to consider.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Antero Resources has also been purchasing subpar-sized positions that are right next to larger company positions. Some of these can be serviced in the future by Antero Midstream as well.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Summary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Midstream stocks often follow the upstream stocks, even though the midstream business itself is a very different business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17618863473290317_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Antero Midstream Common Stock Price History And Key Valuation Measures\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"401\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17618863473290317_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17618863473290317_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17618863473290317_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17618863473290317_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17618863473290317_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17618863473290317_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17618863473290317_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17618863473290317_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Antero Midstream Common Stock Price History And Key Valuation Measures (Seeking Alpha Website October 30, 2025)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But despite the fact that this stock has appreciated considerably since 2021, there is likely still more appreciation potential as long as the natural gas pricing recovery continues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market has long not paid attention to the fact that this business is very steady and without a lot of upstream risks. There are take-or-pay provisions that assure a minimum.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plus, this business does not service all of the Antero Resources business. It never has. Now, some acquisitions, like the capacity that serviced the dry gas acreage, have likely increased the percentage of the business serviced by Antero Midstream.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is also the possibility that, as the midstream business grows, there could be more value-added businesses to consider. That could potentially make this company more of a \"one-stop shop\" for those customers where that is important.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, this is one of the more richly priced midstream companies that I follow. Since there is a fear of a recession or worse due to the political uncertainty that exists. I would probably consider this a hold right now, even though I suspect there is still more long-term capital appreciation potential as long as natural gas prices continue to rise (long-term).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This company has a lot going for it. As such, I like everything but the stock price and the current market environment, that is caused by the political uncertainty. I intend to upgrade back to a buy as soon as this uncertainty that is causing the industry to \"hunker down\" goes away.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a hold rating, there are both risks to the upside and to the downside to consider for such a decision.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the downside, the threat of tariffs and trade wars, combined with still more political uncertainty, may bring about a recession or worse if this is not replaced by something permanent and constructive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the upside, a quick resolution of the current situation that would allow the economy to return to the growth mode that marked 2024 would be the upside risk.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company also has a new CEO. While the previous CEO is still around, there is a transition underway that may also cause the stock price to wobble at times. The new CEO needs to establish his own record that is comparable to what was happening before he took the job.</p>",

While U.S. stocks have recovered after stumbling earlier in the year, emerging market stocks have provided even higher absolute returns, as well as diversification benefits relative to other asset classes. China was particularly notable, as the MSCI China Index returned over 40% year to date. Its equity markets continued to benefit from domestic policy support and enthusiasm for technological breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI). South Korea has also been a market standout, benefiting from its key role in AI supply chains and improved political stability. Meanwhile, Latin American stocks continued to bounce back from 2024 with strong third quarter returns. Overall, the MSCI Emerging Markets had a total return of 10.6% for the third quarter and 27.5% year to date.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While emerging market valuations have risen to 14.0 times forward earnings, their valuation relative to the U.S. market has remained consistently compelling.<sup>2</sup> The relative value of emerging market stocks compared to U.S. stocks is at one of the lowest levels over the past 20 years. Furthermore, spreads are extremely wide among emerging market equities, as measured by dispersions in sector and regional valuations. This presents attractive opportunities for price-disciplined investors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio Strategy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As noted, China has been a stellar performer. Alibaba (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABA\" title=\"Alibaba Group Holding Limited\">BABA</a>), China’s largest ecommerce and cloud computing platform, has been the Fund’s largest contributor to relative performance in 2025.<sup>3</sup> However, the strength in the Fund’s Chinese holdings returns extends beyond internet-related names. Given the broad range of opportunity, we continue to diversify the Fund’s Greater China exposure.<sup>4</sup> We established a position in DiDi Global (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIDIY\" title=\"DiDi Global Inc.\">OTCPK:DIDIY</a>), China’s dominant ride-sharing platform, during the second quarter, and the stock is up 48% as our thesis of profitability inflection materialized. In the third quarter, we initiated a position in Sungrow Power Supply, a leading global supplier of solar power systems and energy storage solutions. We also added to the Fund’s position in Greentown Service Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GRTNF\" title=\"Greentown Service Group Co. Ltd.\">OTCPK:GRTNF</a>), a property management company with an attractive valuation, focused management team, and improved guidance for future profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of sectors, Energy and Industrials were the top two contributors to performance in the third quarter. In Energy, National Energy Services Reunited (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NESR\" title=\"National Energy Services Reunited Corp.\">NESR</a>), an oilfield services company operating in MENA and Asia-Pacific returned over 70%, adding 120 basis points of relative value versus the Index. The stock detracted from results during the first half of the year, but we added to the Fund’s position because our knowledge of the company’s fundamentals gave us long-term confidence. Our willingness to add to positions in times of short-term volatility and uncertainty is a hallmark of our strategy. The Fund’s outperformance in the Industrials sector was led by positions in United Integrated Services, a Taiwanese engineering and construction services company, and Contemporary Amperex Technology (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTATF\" title=\"Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited\">OTC:CTATF</a>)[CATL], a Chinese lithium battery manufacturer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the heightened unpredictability of current macroeconomic and geopolitical events, we expect continuing short-term volatility due to the nature of the emerging market landscape. Risks to the global economic and political order remain, including unknown effects of global tariff wars, increasing geopolitical risk in the Middle East, and volatile energy and commodity prices. Nevertheless, we continue to adhere to our disciplined investment approach and maintain our long-term investment horizon. Thank you for your continued confidence in Dodge &amp; Cox.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance Review (Fund vs. MSCI Emerging Markets)</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Third Quarter</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Key contributors to relative results included the Fund’s:</strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Energy holdings—notably National Energy Services Reunited;</li> <li>Industrials holdings, including United Integrated Services, CATL, and DiDi Global;</li> <li>Underweight position in India;</li> <li>Taiwanese dollar and Chinese renminbi currency hedges; and</li> <li>Position in Millicom International Cellular (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TIGO\" title=\"Millicom International Cellular S.A.\">TIGO</a>).</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Key detractors from relative results included the Fund's:</strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Brazilian holdings, including Ambev (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABEV\" title=\"Ambev S.A.\">ABEV</a>) and XP (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XP\" title=\"XP Inc.\">XP</a>), and overweight position in the country; and</li> <li>Underweight positions in Tencent Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TCEHY\" title=\"Tencent Holdings Limited\">OTCPK:TCEHY</a>) and Samsung Electronics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF\" title=\"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\">OTCPK:SSNLF</a>) and holding in HDFC Bank (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HDB\" title=\"HDFC Bank Limited\">HDB</a>).</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Year to Date</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Key contributors to relative results included the Fund’s:</strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Underweight position and stock selection in India;</li> <li>Financials holdings, including Itau Unibanco (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ITUB\" title=\"Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A.\">ITUB</a>), Prudential PLC (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PUK\" title=\"Prudential plc\">PUK</a>), Credicorp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAP\" title=\"Credicorp Ltd.\">BAP</a>), and XP;</li> <li>Consumer Discretionary holdings, particularly Alibaba, and overweight position in the sector;</li> <li>Stock selection in Industrials; and</li> <li>Position in Millicom International Cellular.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Key detractors from relative results included the Fund's:</strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Materials holdings; and</li> <li>Underweight positions in Tencent Holdings, Samsung Electronics, and SK Hynix and holdings in JD.com (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JD\" title=\"JD.com, Inc.\">JD</a>) and HDFC Bank.</li> </ul> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Top Ten Holdings</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>% of Fund</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd.

The issue is, when we look under the hood, Carvana is supporting more and more of their business model with marking up and reselling used car loans they self originate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In recent weeks, multiple subprime used car lenders have gone bankrupt here in the U.S. While I don’t think Carvana is heading towards bankruptcy, I do believe there's a huge risk: any further tightening of the used car loan market will mean Carvana could see one of its two sources of capital dry up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that more than 100% of Carvana’s net income this year has come from gains on the sale of used car loans (to Wall Street and their partner, Ally Bank), I think there is significant net income risk going forward if the credit markets were to freeze.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For this reason, shares are double downgraded from a Strong Buy to a Hold.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why I’m Doing Follow-Up Coverage</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the biggest reasons why I am choosing to do <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4770885-carvana-well-positioned-to-dominate-amazon\">follow-up coverage</a> on Carvana now is because the Fed has cut interest rates <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/fed-rate-cut-credit-cards-mortgages-savings.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">25 bps</a> to 3.75%-4.00%. Post-earnings, this would normally be a game changer. However, I think there is a fundamental weakness underneath.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lower borrowing costs typically directly stimulate auto financing, and because Carvana is a company that is heavily involved with e-commerce and auto loans, it normally would be able to capitalize greatly on the lower-rate environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we’ve seen historically, even a 100 bps decline in loan rates has lifted auto sales growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, in this case defaults are rising. I think Carvana is uniquely exposed to this. This could be really catastrophic. Post-earnings, this is why I am doing follow-up coverage.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 Review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the surface, Q3 looked <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4770885-carvana-well-positioned-to-dominate-amazon\">solid</a>. Carvana reported an EPS of $1.89/share, which beat estimates by $0.52. Revenues came in at $5.65 billion, which marked year over-year growth of 54.50% and beat estimates by $550 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We have to dig deeper to look at loan sales to really understand what drove the quarter, however.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As Jenkins, Carvana’s CFO, stated on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835180-carvana-co-cvna-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Non-GAAP other GPU increased by $63. This change was primarily driven by improvements in the cost of funds and higher finance and VSC attach rates, partially offset by higher-than-normalized loan sales relative to originations in Q3 2024.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’ll get into why this is important later, but loan sales are a huge driver for Carvana’s profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we look at the rest of the gross profit per vehicle, we can see that overall gross profit declined for their vehicles they sold:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Non-GAAP retail GPU decreased by $77, primarily driven by higher retail depreciation rates. Non-GAAP wholesale GPU decreased by $168, primarily driven by higher wholesale depreciation rates and retail units sold growth outpacing ADESA marketplace growth -Q3 Earnings Call.</p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Defaults Are Rising, Carvana Is Exposed</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To understand why Carvana is so exposed to marking up loans, we have to look at their most recent 10Q (filed this week).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/18873474\">10Q</a>, if we look at how much gain (profit) Carvana booked in Q3, we can see that more than 100% of the net profits the company earned in Q3 were driven from their gain of sale on their subprime loans:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The total gain related to finance receivables sold to financing partners and pursuant to securitization transactions was $331 million and $224 million during the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $878 million and $541 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, which is included in other sales and revenues in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations -10Q.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, the company booked $331 million in gains on loans in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Their Q3 net income? <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVNA/income-statement\">$151 million</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These gains on loans are financed by Carvana selling their loans to two main groups: Ally Bank, and private pools of auto loans.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Increasingly, Ally Bank is a bigger chunk of the loan purchasing volume:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>During the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company sold $1.2 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively, in principal balances of finance receivables under the Ally MPSA. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company sold $3.2 billion and $2.15 billion, respectively, in principal balances of finance receivables under the Ally MPSA, and had $2.0 billion of unused capacity as of September 30, 2025 -10Q.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While this agreement with Ally Bank does not end until Q3 2026, there’s still risk here. Ally Bank is trusting that these pools of loans that Carvana is issuing don’t exhibit disproportionate levels of defaults. I think the risk here is that as the economy slows down (and as peers have shown), defaults are rising.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If Carvana were to lose access to their $6 billion purchase facility from Ally Bank, this could have a major impact on their long-run net income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recent subprime lender <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/subprime-lender-primalend-capital-partners-files-bankruptcy-protection-2025-10-22/\" rel=\"nofollow\">bankruptcies</a> are pushing Wall Street to more closely examine their books of subprime loans.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the past, I thought Carvana’s valuation had some upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, since I first rated the company a Strong Buy in September of 2024, shares have jumped over 125% as their revenues have picked up and consumers purchased more used cars from them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58772689-1761916828442702.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Carvana Performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"550\" height=\"864\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58772689-1761916828442702.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58772689-1761916828442702.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58772689-1761916828442702.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58772689-1761916828442702.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58772689-1761916828442702.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58772689-1761916828442702.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58772689-1761916828442702.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58772689-1761916828442702.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Carvana Performance <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I have mentioned before, I think their service is incredible. That doesn’t mean they’re a high-quality stock anymore, however.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I first rated the company a Strong Buy, I thought shares had <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4719532-carvana-surprising-profits-turnaround-is-accelerating-rating-upgrade\">28% upside</a>. The 128% return from there blew away my expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, the valuation feels a little rich.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, the company’s non-GAAP forward P/E is now <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVNA/valuation/metrics\">56.46</a>, which is 235.87% above the sector median of 16.81.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the price-to-sales front, shares now trade at a 129.22% premium to the sector median. Keep in mind that when I originally rated the company a Strong Buy back in September of 2024, the price-to-sales multiple was at a 56% premium to the sector median.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In essence, the company’s valuation premium has more than doubled over the last year or so. This now feels extended to me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the past, when I rated the stock a Strong Buy, I had an idea what the fair value of shares was.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now that I think shares are a Hold, I’m no longer sure what the fair value of shares are.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bull Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What’s interesting to me about this Fed interest rate cut this week is that (typically) in a lower-rate environment, affordability boosts demand. As of late, payments have become stretched. New car buyers are paying an average of about <a href=\"https://www.coxautoinc.com/insights-hub/may-2025-vai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">$756</a> per month for their vehicles, with one in five buyers paying more than <a href=\"https://www.edmunds.com/industry/press/a-record-1-in-5-new-car-shoppers-committed-to-a-1000-monthly-payment-in-q2-2025-according-to-edmunds.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">$1,000</a> per month. Rate relief should allow for Carvana to benefit disproportionately.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The problem? <a href=\"https://www.cbtnews.com/carguru-reports-affordability-strains-persist-as-auto-sales-hold-steady-across-segments/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Car sales</a> in September and earlier this month have shown signs that used car prices continue to be an issue even as the Fed has cut interest rates and prices have stabilized. Cars are just too expensive now, even if interest rates are falling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For Carvana, this presents another risk: Carvana could be stuck with tons of overpriced inventory. This was one of the major drivers that caused shares to drop significantly from 2021 until early 2023. There’s a risk that inventory could get mismatched with prices again.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To be clear, Carvana has huge potential with their online dealer business model. I still believe the company can have Amazon-like disruption potential for traditional brick-and-mortar used car dealers. But, this doesn’t mean the business model will be free of growing pains (we already are seeing this).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Carvana’s profits this year appear basically entirely supported by the gain on the sale of used car loans. This works great when the used car loan market is liquid and functional. Recent subprime lender bankruptcies remind us that this market can freeze up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we see the market freeze up, it's not unreasonable to assume that Carvana’s sources of capital to issue loans could dry up as well. This could be extremely challenging for their business.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With this, shares are now a Hold, downgraded from a Strong Buy.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XYL\" title=\"Xylem Inc.\">XYL</a></span>) was a buy rating because of the strong secular tailwinds that it benefits from. Also, the Evoqua integration and PFAS funding pipeline could<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> be a major growth catalyst. My recommendation for XYL remains a buy rating, as it continues to deliver solid performance. In the Q3 2025 results, we can basically confirm that the 80/20 transformation strategy is working given the strong margins, growth, and EPS growth. With these secular tailwinds, strong execution, and order visibility, it all points to solid earnings growth ahead.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">3Q25 Results Update</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">XYL's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20281489-xylem-reports-third-quarter-2025-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A1\">Q3 2025 results</a> really proved my thesis right and were a textbook beat-and-raise quarter. Total revenue reached $2.3 billion, up 7% y/y on an organic basis, and importantly, growth was driven by all four segments. The outperformers were Measurement and Control Solutions (MCS), which grew 11% organically, and Water Solutions and Services (WSS), which grew 10% y/y. This flowed directly to margin expansion, driving adj. EBITDA margin to a record of 23.2%, up by 200 bps y/y. This strong margin, then, flowed through to drive adj. EPS up 23% y/y to $1.37.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The forward outlook also seems very positive, as management noted the business was “accelerating,” and the upward revision in guidance instilled confidence. Specifically, XYL raised its FY2025 revenue guide to ~$9 billion and also raised its profit targets. Adj. EBITDA margin is now guided to 22% to 22.3%, up sharply from the previous 21.3%–21.8% range, and the FY2025 adj. EPS guide was raised to $5.03–$5.08 versus the previous $4.70 to $4.85 range. At the midpoint, that implies a 6% lift.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 80/20 Transformation Is Working</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 80/20 transformation that I talked about deeply previously has worked out really well, as expected. For those that did not follow my coverage, this 80/20 idea was simple but powerful. Basically, it is to focus resources on the top 20% of products and customers that drive profit and simplify or exit everything else. We know this is working because management explicitly noted the record-high margins were due to this very transformation. Even if you don’t believe management’s word, you can see it clearly in the legacy segments. Water Infrastructure delivered a very impressive 400 bps y/y expansion in adj. EBITDA margin, reaching 24.4%, while Applied Water, which was once a drag on profitability, improved by 310 bps y/y to 21.7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The transformation efforts go beyond just fixing legacy segments’ margins. The same transformation impact is playing out in portfolio optimization. The case in point is XYL’s divestiture of its international water and heat metering (IWHM) business, which is a deal that, in my view, perfectly illustrates this transformation in action. The IWHM business generated ~$250 million in 2024 revenue, but the adj. EBITDA margin was &lt;10%, which means this is a drag on XYL’s overall margin. I view this exit favorably, as it achieves two things: (1) it structurally improves margin (due to mix impact), and (2) it allows XYL to allocate resources to its most profitable growth arena, which is the North American smart metering (AMI) market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My view is that the North American market is where XYL has a right to win. In North America, XYL benefits from its proprietary Sensus FlexNet technology, which I think is a major competitive advantage. Unlike mesh networks that pass data from meter to meter, FlexNet is a private, point-to-multipoint network that operates on FCC-licensed radio frequency spectrum. Now, where it works in favor of XYL is that it owns this private spectrum. Owning this private network enables XYL to offer reliable long-distance data transmission that is secure. This means that XYL can reach nodes in the network (i.e., the meters) in remote and difficult locations (like in basements) far more effectively than competitors. And XYL can offer this while requiring less infrastructure, which lowers the total cost of ownership (TCO) for the utility customer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe this edge gives XYL the right to capitalize on the ongoing replacement demand tailwind more than peers. As background info, the North American installed base of <a href=\"https://media.berginsight.com/2025/06/05145927/bi-smartwater4-ps.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">water meters is old</a>, with many of them already past their useful life and needing to be replaced soon. Replacing is one demand driver, but the bigger driver is the type of replacement. Since the adoption of two-way AMI technology is still only at <a href=\"https://media.berginsight.com/2025/06/05145927/bi-smartwater4-ps.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">~40% penetration</a>, this means the majority of the market is still operating on the older, one-way meters. To explain it simply, the old one-way meter is just a \"drive-by\" system that utilities can only “collect” data from but cannot “ask” the meter questions. The new two-way AMI technology makes this possible. Utility customers can “ask” the meter on-demand for a real-time read, and the meter can respond with the right information. Think about the implication of this for a few seconds. It basically makes it possible for the utility customer to constantly monitor for leaks, pressure problems, or, at the very least, provide detailed usage data for analysis purposes.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">MCS Order Strength De-Risks 2026 Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While total company orders declined 2% y/y organically, it wasn’t due to any structural weakness. It was simply due to very tough comps and softness in China. If you look beneath the headline numbers, you will find that the MCS (this is the segment that has the high-growth smart metering and AMI platforms in it) did extremely well. Orders managed to grow 11% y/y organically in Q3, despite the tough comps, which reflects the strong underlying demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we lapse this tough comps period, FY2026 growth should be a lot more amazing. There is good visibility to this happening, as the MCS segment still sits on a healthy $1.5 billion backlog. Management was confident that the book-to-bill ratio will climb back to &gt;1x in Q4 as major water-meter projects convert into firm orders. If that is true, growth is going to accelerate, and that supports the case for MCS to reach high-single-digit growth in 2026. Margins should also inflect as revenue ramps up because of mix impact. The margin expansion in Q3 was quite muted (just 60 bps y/y) because of lower-margin energy projects. Management noted that the core water business is performing at or above peer-level margins. The closest public peer to XYL is Badger Meter (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BMI\" title=\"Badger Meter, Inc.\">BMI</a>), which has an operating margin of ~20% in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that the &lt;10%-margin international business is being sold, we should see the true earnings power of this segment soon.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59932035-17618374876925159_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"872\" data-height=\"381\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59932035-17618374876925159_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A screenshot of a graph AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"280\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59932035-17618374876925159_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59932035-17618374876925159_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59932035-17618374876925159_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59932035-17618374876925159_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59932035-17618374876925159_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59932035-17618374876925159_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59932035-17618374876925159_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59932035-17618374876925159_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Redfox Capital Ideas</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While XYL’s share price has risen, I still see a nice one-year 15% upside. Given the success with the 80/20 transformation, divestiture, and growth momentum, I upgrade my revenue growth assumption to 7% (high single digits) vs. mid-single digits previously. Management revised margin guidance (work backwards using adj. EPS guide * shares outstanding) also showed me that margin can inflect faster than I thought. As such, I upgraded my margin outlook to closer to mid-teens. All these upgrades justify XYL trading higher than what I expected previously (27x), which the market seems to agree with as well since XYL now trades at 29x. At 29x, I get to a share price target of ~$176.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main risk is the slowdown in China, which was a 2% headwind to total company orders. This weakness, coupled with delays in UK funding cycles, ultimately drove a 2% y/y organic order decline. The problem is these are largely outside of XYL's control, and there is no guarantee that they will not get worse. If it does, overall organic orders could decline much further, and that could drag down performance again. Even with the $5 billion backlog that provides solid visibility, any delay in converting these large projects could create a temporary drag (or what one would term as an “air pocket”) in the quarterly results.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I maintain a buy rating for XYL. The strong Q3 performance, accelerating MCS orders, and solid progress with the 80/20 execution give a lot of confidence that revenue can grow and margin can expand. Overall, I still see upside, and the share price should reflect this as the market continues to recognize XYL’s improving fundamentals.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PGY\" title=\"Pagaya Technologies Ltd.\">PGY</a></span>) has cratered 15% on fears over the health of the US credit market following the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/first-brands-tricolor-collapses-invite-more-scrutiny-wall-street-sees-robust-2025-10-14/\" rel=\"noopener\">bankruptcies</a> of Tricolor and First Brands. Despite this, I believe<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the bullish thesis on Pagaya remains intact, especially ahead of its upcoming Q3 earnings.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that in mind, several key Pagaya partners reported their Q3 earnings results recently, showing broader signs of strong loan demand and improving credit quality. This suggests that Pagaya may be on track to beat analysts’ estimates and raise its full-year outlook when it reports its Q3 earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, Pagaya’s partners’ results suggest that the credit environment in the US is stable and improving. This could be a sign of the US heading into a strong credit cycle over the coming quarters, especially with default rates stabilizing and beginning a gradual descent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These signs of an improving credit environment could be supported by Barclays’ (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BCS\" title=\"Barclays PLC\">BCS</a>) latest expansion in the US personal lending market through its acquisition of Pagaya’s partner Best Egg, showcasing the attractiveness of the US credit market at the moment. Furthermore, Pagaya’s latest point of sale (POS) ABS transaction highlights the current favorable credit environment, in my opinion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The transaction came with better funding terms, despite carrying riskier loans compared to the prior transaction, highlighting investors’ higher risk appetite and their growing confidence in Pagaya’s underwriting. In light of these factors, I’m reiterating my strong buy rating for Pagaya and raising my price target to $70, implying 168% upside from current levels.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 Preview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pagaya is set to <a href=\"https://investor.pagaya.com/news-releases/news-release-details/pagaya-announces-timing-third-quarter-2025-earnings-release\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a> its Q3 earnings results on November 10th in pre-market, with analysts <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PGY/earnings\">estimating</a> the company to report revenues of $338.86 million and a GAAP EPS of $0.16. That said, I expect Pagaya could be on track for another beat and raise quarter in light of latest results from 3 of its key <a href=\"https://pagaya.com/about-us\" rel=\"nofollow\">partners</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of Pagaya’s key partners is SoFi (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SOFI\" title=\"SoFi Technologies, Inc.\">SOFI</a>), which has recently <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20281582-sofi-reports-third-quarter-2025-with-record-net-revenue-of-962-million-record-member-and#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A2\">reported</a> impressive Q3 earnings driven by strong loan demand. During Q3, SoFi reported record loan originations of <a href=\"https://s27.q4cdn.com/749715820/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/3Q25-SoFi-Earnings-Presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">$9.9 billion</a>, of which $3.4 billion were originated from its loan platform business, an all-time high. The latter fact is the most direct positive to Pagaya, in my opinion, since loans originated under SoFi’s loan platform business are the loans that are referred to Pagaya to give a second look using its AI platform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, these record originations are likely to reflect on Pagaya’s network volume in Q3. Moreover, SoFi reported a net charge-off rate of 2.60% in Q3, down from 2.83% sequentially and 3.52% in the prior year. This implies a healthy personal loan borrower pool, as the improvement came along with higher loan volumes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another key Pagaya partner is US Bancorp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USB\" title=\"U.S. Bancorp\">USB</a>), which also <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20268280-u-s-bancorp-reports-third-quarter-2025-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A5\">reported</a> solid Q3 earnings. During the quarter, the bank reported an average loan balance of <a href=\"https://s203.q4cdn.com/711684571/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Earnings-Call-Presentation-3Q25.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">$379.2 billion</a>, representing growth rates of 1.4% YoY and 0.2% sequentially. The strong indicator for Pagaya’s upcoming earnings is that US Bank’s commercial loans, where consumer loans represented 27.3%, grew 9.5% YoY and 1.4% QoQ. This shows that US Bank is actively growing its consumer segment, a sign of an increased lending appetite, which could be a strong driver for Pagaya’s network volume when it reports Q3 earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In similar fashion to SoFi, US Bank also saw an improving credit quality in Q3, as its net charge-off rate was 0.56%, 3 bps lower QoQ and 4 bps lower YoY. At the same time, the bank’s provision for credit losses represented 2.06% of its average loan balance, down from 2.07% and 2.12% in the prior quarter and year, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">US Bank’s growing loan balance combined with better credit quality suggests that the bank is confident in the near-term credit outlook, which points to a healthy lending environment, in my opinion. The improving credit quality at US Bank could also serve as a tailwind for Pagaya's network volume in the coming quarters, potentially supporting the case for a guidance raise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shifting to auto loans, a segment Pagaya is rapidly expanding into, the company’s key partner in this segment, Ally Financial (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALLY\" title=\"Ally Financial Inc.\">ALLY</a>), also <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20270141-ally-financial-reports-third-quarter-2025-financial-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A3\">reported</a> strong Q3 earnings. During the quarter, Ally reported an all-time record <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/753234398/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Ally-3Q-2025-Earnings-Presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">4 million</a> applications for auto loans, with originations growing 25% YoY to $11.7 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ally’s record application volume is a significant positive for Pagaya, in my opinion, since it could provide it with a significant funnel of potential loans to analyze through its platform, which is a tailwind to network volume. With that in mind, 42% of Ally’s originations during Q3 were to its S-tier members, meaning that the majority of its originations came from lower tier borrowers. These lower quality borrowers include the higher risk borrowers that are usually given a second look through Pagaya’s platform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for credit quality, Ally reported a $230 million YoY reduction in its provision for credit losses during Q3. In my opinion, this could be a major sign of a better credit environment, as Ally expects better performance in its newer loan cohorts. In this way, Ally could increase its risk appetite in the coming quarters by offering loans to riskier borrower pools, which could drive additional network volume for Pagaya.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Improving Credit Environment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aside from the company’s potential Q3 earnings beat, the longer-term credit environment appears to be trending favorably for Pagaya’s business, in my opinion. According to data from <a href=\"https://www.apolloacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/101925-Charts_v2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apollo</a>, US speculative grade default rates for loans appear to be stabilizing and in the process of falling from their peak, suggesting that the credit cycle is improving.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732954166925_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1256\" data-height=\"707\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732954166925_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"US speculative grade default rates\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732954166925_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732954166925_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732954166925_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732954166925_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732954166925_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732954166925_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732954166925_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732954166925_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Apollo </span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This improving backdrop could be a major tailwind for Pagaya, as an improving credit outlook supports favorable funding terms for Pagaya, as its loans could be perceived as of lower risk. This has actually occurred in Pagaya’s latest POS ABS transaction, <a href=\"https://www.kbra.com/publications/wMmnzKws/kbra-assigns-preliminary-ratings-to-pagaya-point-of-sale-holdings-grantor-trust-2025-2-and-pagaya-point-of-sale-holdings-trust-2025-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">POSH 2025-2</a>, which is expected to close on November 7th.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The new ABS deal is for $300 million of loans backed by Klarna (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KLAR\" title=\"Klarna Group plc\">KLAR</a>) loan flow and includes better funding terms for Pagaya compared to its prior <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4789637-pagaya-a-deep-dive-into-its-untapped-value-proposition\">POSH 2025-1</a> ABS transaction, despite carrying a riskier loan pool. For starters, KBRA has a cumulative net loss expectation of <a href=\"https://www.kbra.com/publications/vbSVBLMx/pagaya-point-of-sale-holding-grantor-trust-2025-2-and-pagaya-point-of-sale-holding-trust-2025-2-pre-sale-report?format=file\" rel=\"nofollow\">6.79%</a> for this transaction compared to 5.01% in the company’s inaugural POS ABS transaction, as Class A notes are lower while other classes are higher in balance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the riskier loan pool, the latest transaction has a larger excess spread compared to the prior transaction at 24.02% compared to 22.43%. The higher excess spread was driven by a higher collateral interest rate at 31% compared to 30%, indicating that the profitability of these loans is greater than the previous pool. Moreover, the transaction has a lower coupon rate at 5.73% compared to 6.32%, reflecting strong investor demand despite the riskier loan pool and highlights investors’ growing trust in Pagaya’s underwriting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732950022345_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"895\" data-height=\"567\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" data-lt-tmp-id=\"lt-77221\" spellcheck=\"false\" data-gramm=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732950022345_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"PGY stock POSH 2025-2 ABS transaction terms\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732950022345_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732950022345_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732950022345_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732950022345_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732950022345_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732950022345_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732950022345_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59696711-17618732950022345_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>KBRA POSH 2025-2 Pre-Sale Report</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, another sign of confidence in the health of the US credit environment and Pagaya’s own business model could be Barclays’ latest $800 million <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/barclays-buy-us-personal-loan-firm-best-egg-800-million-2025-10-28/\" rel=\"nofollow\">acquisition</a> of Pagaya’s partner Best Egg to expand its US personal banking business. According to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47782937-39d2-42a5-b684-2099a8362e2c\" rel=\"nofollow\">Financial Times</a>, Barclays expects this acquisition to provide it with access to more loans to bundle and sell them in ABS transactions, the same market Pagaya has been leading over the past few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, Barclays’ venture into this market validates Pagaya’s asset-light approach and securitization model, which indicates that the company’s ABS transactions are likely to remain a strong growth driver over the coming years. At the same time, since Best Egg is already a Pagaya partner, this acquisition could provide Pagaya with an avenue to expand its footprint in new global markets through Barclays. While the company remains focused on serving the US market, a global expansion could serve as a new growth lever in case of a worsening credit cycle in the future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At its current share price of $26, Pagaya has a market cap of $2 billion, which translates to an EV of $2.48 billion after netting its $485.6 million in net debt. This means that the stock is trading at an EV/adjusted EBITDA multiple of 6.93 at the midpoint of its full-year adjusted EBITDA <a href=\"https://investor.pagaya.com/static-files/9c888e83-5ed3-4d0a-a48b-a445c8dd30b5\" rel=\"nofollow\">guidance</a> of $357.5 million, compared to a sector median of 16.30.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, other high growth fintechs such as <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4781342-upstart-ai-edge-is-fueling-outperformance-amidst-macro-uncertainty\">Upstart</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UPST\" title=\"Upstart Holdings, Inc.\">UPST</a>), <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4818134-affirm-holdings-sticky-product-moat-to-drive-sustainable-profitability\">Affirm</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AFRM\" title=\"Affirm Holdings, Inc.\">AFRM</a>), Klarna, and Sezzle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SEZL\" title=\"Sezzle Inc.\">SEZL</a>) are trading at the following EV/EBITDA multiples.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p>Company</p></td> <td><p>EV/EBITDA</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>UPST</p></td> <td><p>26.47</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>AFRM</p></td> <td><p>27.73</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>KLAR</p></td> <td><p>92.75</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>SEZL</p></td> <td><p>14.34</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, this valuation gap compared to its peers suggests that the market may be underestimating Pagaya’s growth potential as the engine driving loan originations at banks and fintechs thanks to its platform. Therefore, I’m applying the sector median 16.30 EV/EBITDA multiple to Pagaya’s adjusted EBITDA guidance, which leads to my price target of $70, representing 168% upside from current levels.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p>Adj.

As an ABS issuer, Pagaya is obligated to retain at least 5% of the credit risk of the loans being securitized, per Dodd-Frank. These loans are typically of the lowest classes in its ABS transactions or the highest risk loans due to vertical retention.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Pagaya has been increasing its non-ABS funding deals, including forward flow agreements, ABS issuances remain a key growth driver for the company. Therefore, if default rates increase and these loans perform poorly, the company may be forced to adjust the fair value of these loans downwards, leading to potentially significant losses. As is, the company currently previously incurred a $235 million <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4760961-pagaya-severely-undervalued-despite-improving-business-performance\">impairment</a> charge on its 2021-2023 loan vintages in Q4 2024, which had weighed on its valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, I believe Pagaya presents a compelling risk-to-reward profile ahead of Q3 earnings at its current valuation. With some of the company’s key partners recently reporting strong Q3 results, highlighted by strong personal loan demand and improving credit quality, the company could be well-positioned to exceed its network volume guidance, beat analysts’ estimates, and raise its full-year outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, the longer-term credit environment appears to be promising for Pagaya, with US speculative grade default rates trending in the right direction, indicating an improving credit cycle, in my opinion. With that in mind, Pagaya’s latest POS ABS transaction could be a sign of an improving credit environment after the company secured more favorable funding terms compared to its prior transaction, despite carrying a riskier loan pool.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the company's partners and investors appearing to have an increased risk appetite, Pagaya’s network volume may be well-positioned to sustain its growth rates in the short-to-medium terms. In my opinion, if Pagaya is able to achieve this feat while managing the risk of its originated loans through its underwriting, the stock could witness a rerating near other high-growth fintechs. It is for these reasons that I’m reiterating my strong buy rating for Pagaya and raising my price target to $70, representing 168% upside from its current valuation.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a></span>), I said investors should hold the stock. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4789176-apple-biggest-risk-isnt-competition-its-the-consumer\">My reasoning</a> was that Apple’s business itself looked strong, but the bigger picture wasn’t so friendly. Interest rates<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> were going up, there were concrete data points showing that people were feeling less confident about the economy, and spending on nonessential items appeared to be slowing down, and that’s a challenging dynamic for a company like Apple, which depends on customers </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content\">wanting</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> its products, not needing them.

From a strategic standpoint, Apple focused on its strong products while dealing with changing global policies and currency fluctuations, yet Apple did what Apple usually does, and the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">company’s revenue</a> reached $102.5 billion, that's an 8% increase from the same quarter last year, while EPS reached $1.85, both record highs for the September quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reading through the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">transcript</a>, it’s clear that most of the improvement came from the sales mix. In essence, Apple sold more of its higher-margin products, which nudged its overall <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL/profitability\">gross margin</a> up by 0.7 percentage points to 47.2%. The Products division’s margin rose to 36.2%, while the Services division’s margin was 75.3%, a touch lower, slipping 0.3 percentage points from the previous quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving on, let’s break it down by segment:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>iPhone revenue: $49 billion, up 6% year over year. “We did set a September quarter record for upgraders,” <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">said</a> CEO Tim Cook. He also noted supply constraints on several iPhone 16 and 17 models.</li> <li>Mac revenue: $8.7 billion, which is up 13% year over year. “We grew in every geographic segment with strong double-digit growth in emerging markets,” CFO Kevan Parekh <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">said</a>, adding that nearly half of Mac buyers were new to the product.</li> <li>iPad revenue: $7 billion, flat year over year. “We faced a difficult compare against the full quarter impact of the iPad Air and iPad Pro launch from last year,” Parekh <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">explained</a>, though he highlighted that over half of iPad customers this quarter were new to the product.</li> <li>Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue: $9 billion, flat year over year. “Both the Apple Watch and AirPods installed bases reached new all-time highs,” <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">said</a> Parekh.</li> <li>Services revenue: $28.8 billion, up 15% year over year and an all-time record. “Our strong performance for the quarter is really organically driven,” Parekh <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">added</a>, emphasizing that growth came broadly across categories and geographies.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before I go on, I want to say that I think Apple's numbers show a clear change in power toward its Services business. Hardware growth seems to be cooling off, however. Even though supplies were limited and the global economy was unstable, both the iPhone and Mac performed well, showing that Apple's loyal environment is still as strong as ever.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, the flat numbers for iPad and Wearables suggest those areas might be hitting a point of market saturation. But the record-breaking Services revenue tells us that Apple’s plan to build up steady, high-profit income from subscriptions and digital services is working exactly as intended.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apple Manages Costs, Capital, and Growth with Precision</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apple’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Greater China sales fell 4%</a> compared to last year, and management said most of that drop was due to limited iPhone supply, not weaker demand. Even though sales are down, more people <em>are</em> going into stores in China, which is a good omen for future sales. Looking ahead, Apple’s management expects sales in China to grow again in the December quarter. They also said that local government <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3315680/apple-joins-chinas-subsidy-scheme-boost-sales-amid-heated-domestic-competition\" rel=\"nofollow\">subsidies</a> are helping to boost sales. However, these programs only cover certain iPhone models that are priced at certain levels, so not all devices can get the discount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The CFO <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">said</a> that costs are following the usual pattern. Prices for memory parts have dropped a bit, which helps a little. However, at the start of a new product cycle, the cost of materials is usually higher until the company finds ways to make things more efficiently.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apple spent around <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">$1.1 billion on tariffs</a> this quarter, which matched what they had expected. I want to stop here for a second, because even with more than a billion in tariffs, Apple still posted record revenue and profit this quarter, a sign of just how tightly the company runs its operation. Given current trade policies, Apple expects tariff costs to climb to around $1.4 billion for the December quarter. This estimate also considers recent changes in tariff rates, which is why Apple says tariff costs won’t increase in direct proportion to how many products they sell.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, management also <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">said</a> that investments in Private Cloud Compute for Apple Intelligence will cause capital spending to go up. One of these is that brand-new <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/apple-begins-shipping-ai-servers-houston-factory-2025-10-23/\" rel=\"nofollow\">data center in Houston</a> that's already sending servers out. Apple said it will stick with a plan that uses both its own facilities and those of outside companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the end of the quarter, the company had <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">$132 billion in cash</a> and assets, around $99 billion in debt, and $34 billion in net cash, which is after paying off its debts. During the quarter, Apple gave $24 billion back to shareholders, which includes $20 billion through stock buybacks and $3.9 billion in dividends. Also, to shareholders who own the stock as of November 10, the Board announced a dividend of $0.26 per share, which will be paid on November 13.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apple <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835951-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">expects</a> its revenue for the December quarter to grow by 10% to 12% compared to the same time last year, with iPhone sales rising by double digits. The company also projects a gross margin of 47% to 48%, that, by the way, already factors in about $1.4 billion in tariff costs. Operating expenses are expected to be between $18.1 billion and $18.5 billion, other income and expenses (OI&amp;E) should be around $150 million, and the tax rate is estimated at 17%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apple’s Building the Future of AI on Its Own Terms</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before I go into valuation, I want to circle back and cover some more background on how Apple is spending more money to grow its <a href=\"https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Private Cloud Compute</a> system, which uses its own custom computer chips. The company is also moving more of its AI processing to its M-series devices, like Macs and iPads. Apple said that its new AI servers, built right here in the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/in-the-loop/2025/10/shipping-apples-american-made-advanced-servers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">United States</a>, act as backup power for on-device AI when bigger computing power is needed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Essentially, Apple describes Private Cloud Compute as a privacy-first system. It uses verified software that can’t be changed without approval, doesn’t keep any long-term data, and has a program where outside researchers can check the exact software before it’s allowed to process real user activity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This, as you know, isn't exactly <em>common</em> for big tech companies. It also shows that Apple likes a hybrid strategy, where most private work stays on your device and only the bare minimum is sent to its tightly controlled cloud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding performance, it comes as no surprise that Apple is gearing up its devices to handle more AI work locally. The new <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-unleashes-m5-the-next-big-leap-in-ai-performance-for-apple-silicon/\" rel=\"nofollow\">M5 chip generation</a> has more than 4x as much peak GPU power for AI as its predecessor. It also packs a faster Neural Engine and more memory bandwidth, letting devices handle bigger AI jobs, things like parsing longer conversations or combining text, images, and audio, without leaning so much on the cloud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, the takeaway is that every bit of processing that happens directly on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac instead of Apple’s servers helps cut cloud costs, improves latency, and fits Apple’s strong stance on user privacy. So when your device can’t handle a request on its own, Apple’s new Houston servers step in under the same security guarantees and apparently erase all data once the job is done.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Personally, I believe this makes a big difference because it helps Apple keep its profits high (hence, SA's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL/profitability\">A+ profit grade</a>) and makes the brand stronger against the effects of its current and future competitors. Apple saves money on outside computer costs by doing more AI processing on its own devices and only using its own cloud when it needs to. It also makes Apple's image for protecting privacy stronger, which keeps users and lawmakers on board.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/\" rel=\"nofollow\">earlier this year</a>, the company said it’s committing over $500 billion in U.S. spending over the next four years, with AI infrastructure and chipmaking near the top of the list. So while building and assembling servers in Texas helps keep the supply chain tighter, parts and upgrades will move faster while also insulating Apple a bit from trade tensions abroad. It also means Apple can control its upgrade pace instead of depending completely on outside GPU suppliers. All very practical moves, though they also happen to make for good PR in the current <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/08/trump-effect-a-running-list-of-new-u-s-investment-in-president-trumps-second-term/\" rel=\"nofollow\">political climate</a> too, about “investing in America.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From an investor’s perspective, Microsoft Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) and Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) largely depend on extensive shared GPU cloud infrastructures to support their AI tools. Apple's hybrid route, meanwhile, could boost Apple’s Services revenue without depending on the same cost structure as full-blown cloud AI providers. All things considered, you can look at it this way: instead of charging users to “rent” AI power, Apple bakes new AI features right into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, encouraging people to upgrade their devices rather than pay per use.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AAPL’s Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-17619179233533921_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1372\" data-height=\"440\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-17619179233533921_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AAPL's valuation metrics\" width=\"640\" height=\"205\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"205\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-17619179233533921_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-17619179233533921_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-17619179233533921_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-17619179233533921_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-17619179233533921_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-17619179233533921_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-17619179233533921_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47303334-17619179233533921_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FAST Graphs</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’m valuing Apple based on its earnings and how it compares to other companies in the same industry.

It also assumes Apple can handle the costs of investing in AI without hurting its free cash flow or the valuation investors give it.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'm keeping my Hold rating. I love the brand. It's all I use. It's all my family uses, and most everyone I know too. At its core, Apple’s brand and product ecosystem are second to none, and its growing Services business, along with new AI investments, should keep its cash flow strong over time.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, with AAPL stock trading at about 36x earnings and carrying higher valuation ratios than most of its peers, buying more shares now means paying a steep price for that strength. I’d rather stay patient and look to add on multiple compression or a reset.</p>",
