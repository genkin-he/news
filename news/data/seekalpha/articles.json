The 20-day EMA at 6,739 serves as immediate support, followed by the 50-day EMA near 6,622—both aligning with the channel’s midline and marking critical buffers against short-term corrections.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_69036cf718218.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1386\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_69036cf718218.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"866\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_69036cf718218.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_69036cf718218.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_69036cf718218.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_69036cf718218.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_69036cf718218.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_69036cf718218.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_69036cf718218.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_69036cf718218.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>S&amp;P 500 price dynamics (Source: TradingView)</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A decisive breakout above 6,920 could propel the index toward the symbolic 7,000 threshold, while a drop below 6,740–6,620 would risk triggering a deeper pullback toward 6,445, where the 100-day EMA and prior demand zone converge. The RSI remains elevated but not extreme, suggesting momentum is intact though vulnerable to fatigue if fresh catalysts fail to emerge.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings volatility and Fed tone shape sentiment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market’s tone was dominated by post-earnings swings in mega-cap stocks. Microsoft slipped 2% after disclosing a $3.1 billion charge linked to its OpenAI investment, while Meta plunged nearly 9% due to a $15.93 billion expense tied to President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act. In contrast, Alphabet rallied 8% on strong cloud and ad revenue growth, helping offset weakness in other sectors. Eli Lilly added 3.5% after raising full-year guidance, underscoring the continued rotation between growth and defensive names.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks at the post-meeting conference added a layer of caution. While the Fed delivered a 25-basis-point rate cut earlier this week, Powell emphasized that another cut in December was “not a foregone conclusion,” a statement that tempered risk appetite and nudged Treasury yields slightly higher. For equities already priced near record valuations, Powell’s language reinforced that monetary policy may not remain as supportive as markets anticipate.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Macro backdrop offers mild relief</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Geopolitical developments provided a modest tailwind. The Trump–Xi summit concluded with a partial trade truce that included a 10% reduction in U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, bringing the overall rate to 47%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In return, China agreed to curb fentanyl exports and expand purchases of American agricultural goods. While the deal lacked major breakthroughs, it helped ease global risk sentiment by lowering trade-related uncertainty at the margins.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook: Bulls hold control but watch key levels</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The S&amp;P 500 continues to trade within a well-defined bullish structure, though near-term gains may be harder to sustain as earnings and Fed policy expectations collide. Immediate resistance sits at 6,920, followed by the 7,000 level, while key supports remain at 6,740 and 6,620.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As previously discussed, the index’s broader trend remains upward, supported by robust earnings in parts of the tech and healthcare sectors. However, with monetary policy tightening expectations in flux and investor positioning stretched, traders should brace for volatility around upcoming earnings reports and macro data releases.

Last year, revenues improved by 13%, so this means that Alphabet not only is growing, but it is doing so even faster. This is impressive since this company has a market cap over $3 trillion and it grows like a small-medium cap company. At this point, I really don’t know what the limit is, it might even reach $10-20 trillion over the long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Google Search &amp; Other, which was supposed to be obsolete a couple of quarters ago, continue to grow by double digits (+15%) and reached $56.56 billions of revenues. In hindsight, we can definitely affirm that ChatGPT hasn't even scratched the Mountain View giant. Actually, Google Search is growing faster and Gemini reached 650 million monthly active users. The market is gradually understanding that AI is not a threat, but an opportunity to get the best out of every business segment of this company, including Google Search:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p><em>AI is driving an expansionary moment and transforming how people use Google Search. Our investments in new AI experiences, such as AI Overviews and AI Mode, continued to drive growth in overall queries, including commercial queries, creating more opportunities for monetization. These AI experiences are enhancing how people connect with businesses and shop on Search. We recently added shopping capabilities in AI Mode, which now help people shop conversationally in Search, and we expanded try-on capabilities to more clothing items, now available to anyone in the U.S.</em></p> <p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835072-alphabet-inc-googl-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\"> <em>Philipp Schindler, Senior Vice President &amp; Chief Business Officer of Google</em></a>.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Philipp Schindler described is basically the reason why Alphabet is among the best companies in the world: it constantly evolves to meet the changing needs of its users and it never gets stuck on what worked in the past. Successful long-term investments require a forward-looking approach, something that is embedded in the Google’s vision.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now let’s talk about YouTube, of which revenues reached $10.26 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year. In this case as well, the growth rate accelerated, and during the conference call, Philipp Schindler provided interesting insights about the future of this platform.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>So in other words, on average, a YouTube Music and Premium subscriber generates a meaningful higher gross profit than they were simply an ad-supported users. Fans come from all over the world. You know this and this engagement through ads and subscription generates YouTube's revenues and funds what I started with, these creators here and this then drives more viewership and engagement and so on. And that's the flywheel.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">YouTube initially started with an ad-based business model, but the main goal is making it a subscription-based model. The latter guarantees recurring revenues, regardless the business cycle, and these kinds of businesses tend to be trading at high price multiples. Furthermore, the gross profit on Premium subscribers is way higher than ad-supported users, and this means high profitability. Current paid subscriptions are over 300 million, mainly driven by Google One and YouTube Premium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The improvement in profitability is already visible in the operating margin, 42.53% (excluding the $3.50 billion EC fine) compared to 40.30% of Q3 2024. Clearly, besides YouTube Premium, much of this margin expansion has been led by the Google Cloud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318320974789_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"936\" data-height=\"451\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318320974789_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Alphabet Q3 2025\" width=\"640\" height=\"308\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318320974789_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318320974789_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318320974789_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318320974789_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318320974789_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318320974789_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318320974789_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318320974789_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Alphabet Q3 2025</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenues grew by 34%, but operating income has shot up by 85% since it is a highly scalable business. Alphabet will greatly benefit from the operating leverage of this business, and we are still in an early phase. Consider that a mature cloud like AWS can deliver an operating margin of about 40%, almost double than Google Cloud. Currently, Google Cloud makes up less than 10% of total operating income, but its share is bound to get much wider.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p><em>Our complete enterprise AI product portfolio is accelerating growth in revenue, operating margins and backlog. In Q3, customer demand strengthened in 3 ways. One, we are signing new customers faster. The number of new GCP customers increased by nearly 34% year-over-year. Two, we are signing larger deals. We have signed more deals over $1 billion through Q3 this year than we did in the previous 2 years combined. Third, we are deepening our relationships.

Initially, the whole business relied on Google Search &amp; Other, now we have YouTube Premium and Google Cloud that provide recurring revenues with a high profitability. Plus, they are both growing faster than Google Search.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A matter of valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As previously stated, Alphabet remains my #1 position in my portfolio, but its valuation is getting a bit overextended, that’s the reason behind the hold rating. I wouldn’t sell a single share since I plan to hold this great company for the long term (at least 10 years), but at the same time I wouldn’t buy at the current levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think investors had a pretty long-time span (multiple occasions over the last 3 years) to buy some shares, and now it might be too late to jump on the bandwagon. I understand that fundamentals are improving faster than expected, but at this point I think FOMO is starting to set in. Alphabet was traded at $200 just 2 months ago, most of the year even below that threshold. Now everyone wants Alphabet and it seems cheap at $300 per share. But what kind of growth rate the current valuation is pricing in?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318345899863_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"951\" data-height=\"313\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318345899863_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DCF made by the author\" width=\"640\" height=\"211\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318345899863_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318345899863_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318345899863_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318345899863_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318345899863_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318345899863_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318345899863_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318345899863_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DCF made by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Starting from the TTM free cash flow and considering a RRR of 12%, to justify the $300 per share, the company should deliver a 10Y CAGR of 23.50%. So, this means a $607 billion free cash flow by 2035, and a market cap of $12 trillion if we assume a 20x price multiple. Is it possible? Yes. Is it likely? It might be.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would never bet against Alphabet, but at the same time I would wait a drop before jumping in once again. The expectations are getting pretty high and we know how unpredictable the future is: the current valuation is not pricing in any unexpected event. Of course, I hope I am wrong and my unrealized profits keep spiking up.</p>",

Still, this was not enough to send shares higher. There was a -$0.05 impact from its annual review of actuarial performance in its insurance business, which I would not adjust out, meaning earnings were $9.87 per share, in my view. Still, this was up 22% from last year, when its actuarial review was a $0.73 headwind. Excluding this, operating earnings were up a solid 12%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aided by a stronger market, assets under management (“AUM”) grew by 8% to $1.7 trillion. Additionally, G&amp;A expenses were down 3% from last year, given ongoing efficiency efforts. Ameriprise also has a strong balance sheet. The company maintains $2.2 billion of excess capital, and it has $2.5 billion of holding company liquidity. As a reminder, it is the holding company that repurchases stock and pays the common dividend. As a result, AMP did $687 million of buybacks in the quarter, and it returned 87% of earnings to shareholders. Thanks to buybacks, its share count is down about 4.3% over the past year. AMP also pays a 1.3% dividend yield.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cash pressures are manageable</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking deeper into segment results, wealth management is the core of the business, and revenue grew 9% to $3 billion. Earnings were up a more modest 7% to $881 million, weighed down by lower cash earnings. The company is seeing strong AUM growth, primarily thanks to a rising market, as well as due to organic wins. With higher markets and strong sales activity, revenue per advisor rose 10% to $1.09 million. Advisor compensation was up 11%, maintaining advisory fee and commission growth (advisors are paid a share of their production). G&amp;A was up a comparatively modest 5% to $439 million, as the company generates solid operating leverage.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618396287233398.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A graph of money and a number AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"353\" height=\"462\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618396287233398.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618396287233398.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618396287233398.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618396287233398.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618396287233398.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618396287233398.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618396287233398.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618396287233398.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ameriprise</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A key source of profitability for Ameriprise is its cash sweep. Essentially, on cash it custodies in client accounts, it earns net interest revenue, and these earnings are closely tied to the Federal Reserve funds rate. With the Fed having cut interest rates 50bps since September, that will likely pressure cash yields. Still, cash yields are elevated, and with Chairman Jay Powell saying a December rate cut is not a foregone conclusion, I do expect only a moderate cutting cycle. I have been assuming 4-5 cuts over 2025-2026, and this remains my base case. I view this as a manageable headwind, especially given how strong the S&amp;P 500 has been.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net investment income (net of interest expense) was $383 million, down from $391 million last year. AMP has been able to offset much of the headwind from Fed rate cuts by cutting the amount of interest it pays clients. However, because it shares less than 25% of its interest income, cash sweep balances have faced sustained pressure as investors move into higher-yielding products, like money market funds. This pressure has existed for three years, and while I believe we are approaching the end, balances do not appear to have bottomed out just yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cash sweep balances were down $400 million from last year at $27.1 billion. This was also down by about $300 million sequentially, a slightly disappointing performance, as Q2 balances are often depressed by tax payments. As such, I was hoping to see stabilization this quarter. I do believe we are nearing a bottom here, and going forward, any pressure on cash sweep revenue is more likely to be tied to further Fed rate cuts than balances.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is also important to note that the wealth management unit is likely to see further benefits from the higher S&amp;P 500. Advisory fees are typically billed in arrears, so Q3 revenue was largely based on where asset levels were on June 30. With the S&amp;P up ~10% over the past few months, that will mechanistically boost revenue in Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While fears around the cash sweep have clearly weighed on the stock, it is important to note that this headwind has been less than 1% of EPS. No doubt, lower balances and lower rates reduce AMP’s earnings, all else equal. Ultimately, though, this pressure is one that is likely to slow earnings growth rather than actually cause a decline in earnings power. With further market tailwinds that have not hit results, this cash headwind is entirely manageable.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other units are broadly stable</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Elsewhere, asset management earnings rose 6% to $260 million, and operating margins were a strong 42%. Revenue was up 3% to $906 million, as fees were stable at 46bps. While a rising market lifts AUM, the company (like many traditional asset managers) has struggled with outflows as investors structurally shift towards lower-fee passive products. Outflows were $3.4 billion, with outflows from both retail and institutional clients. Still, this was a dramatic improvement from the $9 billion seen last quarter. Outflows largely offset market appreciation over the past year, with AUM up just 1% to $714 billion. I expect low-to-mid single-digit AUM growth over the medium term, as market appreciation is partially offset by structural outflows, given the ongoing shift to passive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ameriprise also has a comparatively small insurance unit. More than anything, this unit supports its wealth management business, giving its advisors proprietary annuities and insurance products to offer their clients. During the quarter, it earned $200 million; earnings were down about 4% from last year. Sales were strong at $1.4 billion, given ongoing demand for variable annuities in the fairly elevated rate environment. AMP’s insurance unit is extremely well capitalized with a risk-based capital (“RBC”) ratio of 533%, well above the 400+% level I like to see, enabling ongoing capital releases.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares are attractive at 11x earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, AMP continues to perform well, and while shares are being weighed down by softness in cash revenue, I see this headwind as manageable and factored into valuation. Back in July, I saw the company earning at least $38. I also saw earnings rising to at least $41 next year, while its $2.2 billion of excess capital was worth $25—these factors drove my $600 price target.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I now see EPS of at least $38.25 this year, and I expect EPS of at least $41.50, assuming the S&amp;P remains at or above 6,700. Shares are trading at just 11x forward earnings, without even giving credit for its meaningful excess capital position. As time goes on, and AMP continues to grow EPS, I believe investors will appreciate that cash headwinds are not thesis-undermining, and valuation pressure will dissipate. I view 11x for a fee-based business with a solid balance sheet and strong buybacks as attractive. I would use weakness to <span>\"B</span>uy\" AMP.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RCKY\" title=\"Rocky Brands, Inc.\">RCKY</a></span>) reported very good <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509732-rocky-brands-non-gaap-eps-of-1_03-beats-by-0_13-revenue-of-122_54m-misses-by-0_38m\">Q3 '25 results</a>, with revenues growing MSD and significant gross margin expansion.</p> <p>The growth is broad-based across all of the company's brands, in particular the two water-related boots (Muck<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and XTRATUF). The company's gross margin expansion is in a large part related to passing price increases but still recording \"cheaper\" inventory because of FIFO accounting. This will revert heavily in Q4 '25.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the name is performing well, but I do not believe it is attractively priced at about 10x earnings, given the outlook for U.S. macro and how growth is related to pricing. I <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4806130-rocky-brands-q2-probably-saw-the-benefits-but-not-the-costs-of-the-tariffs\">maintain</a> a Hold rating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Very positive quarter</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rocky's quarter showed positive developments across all brands and across all lines of the income statement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of revenues, the company continues to post MSD growth, particularly in wholesale at 6% (3/4 of revenues). Revenues were up 7.5% in Q2, and also in Q1, so it has been a very good year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4806130-rocky-brands-q2-probably-saw-the-benefits-but-not-the-costs-of-the-tariffs\">Last quarter</a>, I was worried this quarter might be worse because of earlier orders from wholesale due to tariffs, but so far, that has not happened.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of brands, the breadth is also improving. For the past year or so, the big performers have been Muck (muck boots) and XTRATUF (neoprene boots), two farming. In this quarter, these brands also performed very well, up double digits in wholesale, mainly from door expansion (they can be sold in farm &amp; ranch, fishing, hardware stores, regular sports shoe stores for XTRATUF, etc.). The company's more classical work boot brands, Rocky and Georgia, were in a worse position, but they are now both growing. The only name to call out is Durango, down, but in this case is where the earlier ordering from Q2 (+10% then) generated an effect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of gross profits, the company is pulling incredible numbers the whole year, with +390bps in Q1, 300bps in Q2, and now 200bps, all in wholesale. The reason for the gross margin improvement is a better mix (XTRATUF, Muck are better brands in terms of pricing power), lower promos from the recurrent challenges in wholesale post-2022, and, definitely, price increases from the tariffs that are not fully hitting the brands. In this case, the company said the tariff impact on COGS was already a 160bps headwind, meaning prices went up sensibly more.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operating expenses were probably the area where the company did worse, with OpEx as a percentage of sales growing between 100bps and 150bps (depending on the use of adjusted or not). Still, operating income grew almost 17%, and operating margins grew 70bps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With lower debt, as the company has been consistently using free cash flow to repay debt, interest also fell by 25% YoY.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tariffs ahead</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although the results were good, especially surrounding brand development, breadth, and pricing power, I continue to worry about the potential impact of tariffs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are some factors to consider.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, although the company posted 200bps+ gain in gross margins every quarter of 9M25, management reiterated during <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834387-rocky-brands-inc-rcky-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">the call</a> that they expect the company to post 70bps lower gross margins for FY25 than for FY24. Although the aggregate difference is not substantial for the year, the fact that it will be all concentrated in Q4 is relevant. Management also said that the gross margin impact will last at least into 1H25, although sequentially improving. Operating margins will also be lower for the year, despite gains of almost 1pp in 9M25.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, if the company's cost headwind is 160bps in this quarter, and has also gained about 200bps of gross margins, then that adds for at least half, if not more, of the growth. It indicates volumes are not growing that much. The company said that its order books look well into Spring 2026 (H1 '26), with no challenges for price, and that sell-through is good, but in these businesses, the channel can easily glut.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, the company's inventory rotation is not that fast, barely above 1x, meaning it takes almost a year to go through inventory. With FIFO accounting (see <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/9687851\">10-K</a> under Inventories), that means the company gets to expense the cheapest inventory (from maybe three/four quarters ago) first.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_78f6ee4d34b533221cb4c9213bd9b56b.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_78f6ee4d34b533221cb4c9213bd9b56b.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_78f6ee4d34b533221cb4c9213bd9b56b.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_78f6ee4d34b533221cb4c9213bd9b56b.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_78f6ee4d34b533221cb4c9213bd9b56b.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_78f6ee4d34b533221cb4c9213bd9b56b.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_78f6ee4d34b533221cb4c9213bd9b56b.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_78f6ee4d34b533221cb4c9213bd9b56b.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_78f6ee4d34b533221cb4c9213bd9b56b.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that the company has been raising prices to offset higher-priced tariffed inventories, this shows up as a gain in gross margins, even when the business does not have structurally higher gross margins. Part of it also shows up as higher sales, even when no more shoes have been sold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rocky is very affected by tariffs, as it has a facility in Suzhou, China, that produces up to 50% of its products in FY24 (see <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4762015-rocky-brands-inc-rcky-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript\">Q4 '24 call</a>). Some brands, like Durango (leather boots), probably have even more exposure (comments in the latest call).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is without considering the impact on sell-through when consumers face higher prices for many goods in general.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation is still unattractive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is expecting to generate about $2.8 in profits per share this year, 10% more than last year (see latest call for guidance). This comes with a decrease in operating margins, but higher sales and, mainly, lower interest expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Compared to this, a current share price of around $29 does not look particularly high. It can be considered fair or even potentially attractive in a more neutral context, especially with many brands growing, the company delevering, and gross margins growing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, at least one of those factors (gross margins) is going to revert by year-end. Growth will also be impacted next year as price surcharges are nonrecurring. It is probable that FY26 comes with lower gross margins in aggregate (working through this year's tariffed inventories), with slower growth (LSD maybe). In a more negative consumer-environment scenario, gross and operating margins could decrease significantly.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For this reason, I cannot consider Rocky as attractively priced. It could be considered fair, but not more than that. Therefore, I maintain a Hold rating on the name.</p>",

Sam Chai, Vice President, Active Fixed Income Portfolio Management at TD Asset Management, speaks with MoneyTalk’s Greg Bonnell about the unique challenges facing the Fed and the road ahead for rates.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-embed paywall-full-content\" data-id=\"30221\" data-category=\"video\" data-provider=\"Brightcove\"><iframe src=\"https://seekingalpha.com/embed/30221\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" class=\"sa-embed-iframe embed-responsive-item\" data-original-width=\"640\" data-original-height=\"360\" data-id=\"30221\" data-category=\"video\" data-provider=\"Brightcove\"></iframe></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Transcript</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> US Federal Reserve lowered its overnight borrowing rate to a range of 3 and 3/4 to 4%, its second straight interest rate cut. Sam Chai of TD Asset Management here to talk us through the implications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sam, great to have you here today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Sam Chai:</strong> Pleasure to be here, Greg.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> That first cut, it was called a risk management cut by the Fed. Are they starting to see where this cut in US economy that needs support from lower rates, or are they still just trying to head off any problems?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Sam Chai:</strong> I would agree. I think this is a risk management cut by the Fed. And by that I mean the Fed more trying to mitigate potential downside risk, and in particular, trying to risk manage and balance the risks on both sides of the mandate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So just talk a little bit in more details, on the labor market side, core inflation in recent months haven't been picking up, and cumulative inflation passthrough from the tariff side have actually been slightly lower than the Fed expected. So I would say that while upside inflation risk still remains, it is actually less than feared.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, for labor market, while we didn't get the September non-farm payrolls, private sector job data signals that the September labor data likely to be slightly, slightly, continue to be sluggish. And so that downside risk in labor market remains present. So when thinking about that, the upside inflation risk has receded somewhat, while downside labor market risk remains, and that the Fed current policy rate remains restrictive, I think there's a good base for the Fed to make risk management cut today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> When you think about risk management and them not being overly worried about the path forward, I think there was a moment when you and I were watching the press conference with Jerome Powell where he talked about the fact that they're not on a preset course. December is not a done deal. So seems like they're still willing to take it meeting by meeting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Sam Chai:</strong> Mm-hmm. And I don't find it to be particularly surprising because given that we're in this blackout period right now, it's tough for the Fed to pre-commit to a particular path. As we talked about earlier, this is a risk management cut, right? The Fed is not on a preset course to going back to neutral, to cut every meeting to 3%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And so I still think that the base case or the path of least resistance is for December cut to happen. But of course, that is not a done deal, like Chair Powell himself has said.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> So without that official government data going forward, and we don't seem to have a timeline for when they're going to start getting in, how is the Fed navigating? How is the Fed assessing the economy right now?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Sam Chai:</strong> So, admittedly, we are in this data fog right now, right? And it's definitely making the Fed's job more challenging. The Fed could be relying on more other type of data, that includes the regional Fed collected data, private sector data, or just their business contacts for qualitative information.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But aside from the federal government data, we still get a variety of other data. For instance, for job market side, we get the JOLTS data. We get state level initial jobless claims data, which, although not published at the federal level, still gives us timely insights into the labor market conditions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On inflation, we got the latest CPI data for September, but we still receive survey of inflation expectation data, too. And there's also no shortage of GDP nowcast models, which, for instance, the Atlanta Fed publishes. So all this information help to guide our understanding on the macro factor side. But of course, it's making the Fed's job somewhat more challenging.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> Now, they also told us today that, as was expected by the market, they will be ending quantitative tightening. I think it was the beginning of December is what they're aiming for there. In the run-up to that, people started talking about quantitative easing. Is it too quick just to go from the end of QT to start talking about QE?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Sam Chai:</strong> I think so. I think it is indeed too soon to talk about quantitative easing. I like to think about the Fed changing their policy direction like steering a ship. It's gradual and it's measured.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But taking a step back as to why the Fed is announcing the end of quantitative tightening today, so looking at indicator from money market, from funding market, we have seen that there's a signal that the US economy possibly has transitioned from the abundant reserve regime, which is how the Fed likes to term it, to now an ample reserve regime. So, less abundant.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And the Fed likes to still have ample reserves in the economy to ensure liquidity in the financial market, and also the effective transmission mechanism remain in place for policy rates. So the Fed is not looking to shrink their balance sheet further and reduce the reserve level, and hence why they're looking to end the QT program, as you mentioned, at the beginning of December.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I do think that for us to see quantitative easing, we need to really be in a place where it's very clear the economy needs more support from the policy in a very timely fashion, and that policy rate is likely not having more room to provide that accommodation. Obviously, that's not the case right now because policy rate remains relatively elevated. And so I think we're still quite some distance away from that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> Now one more decision before the end of this year. As we head into 2026, we know that Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term is coming to an end. How much should we be concerned about Fed independence?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Sam Chai:</strong> I think that will very much still be a theme going into next year. So Chair Powell's term will be ending next May. Months before that, Trump will be appointing the new Fed Chair. And needless to say, the White House prefers a new Fed Chair who possibly have a much more dovish take on where the monetary policy should be heading versus the current chair.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But to the extent that the market can see that the new Fed Chair decision may have been more politically motivated rather than purely on economic rationales, this could be eroding the market's confidence in the Fed independence, and more importantly, the Fed's ability to anchor inflation over the long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other thing is that earlier next year, we'll have the Supreme Court ruling on Governor Lisa Cook's case. And to the extent that that ruling could be favorable for the White House, that could exacerbate this concern reduced Fed independence.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And just to try to tie it back to the market somewhat, a common way for the market to express this loss of Fed independence theme is by placing a curve steepener bet on the market. In particular, it means that expecting the short end of the interest rate curve to move down on a very dovish Fed. At the same time, the longer end of the interest rate curve could move higher relative to the front end because of the investor being more concerned about long-term inflation and demanding higher term premium. So that will continue to be a theme I think is very interesting to watch next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> There's a lot there. You broke it down beautifully. How does it all play out for the fixed income markets?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Sam Chai:</strong> As we discussed earlier, I do still think that the path of least resistance remains to be a cut in December. Of course, that is not a guarantee. That's not a preset course. But I think the burden of the proof is really on the data to prove that another risk management cut is not warranted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think it's also interesting to talk about alternative scenario two, right? I think for the Fed to essentially skip a December cut, what they need to see is two things. One, a refirming of labor market, possibly an increase in pace of monthly job gains, and also a receleration of inflation as well, because the downside risk to labor market is unlikely to dissipate that quickly in a few months of time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, what would be needed for the Fed to deliver a 50 bps cut? Unlikely, but for that, I think the Fed really needs to see a major deterioration in labor market data. And in that scenario, inflation may actually come into second place in considerations. So while I think overall the risk/reward for fixed income security right now is quite balanced, I think it's important to pay attention to that skew in tail scenarios. In particular, pay more attention to labor market data.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.moneytalkgo.com/video/u-s-fed-cuts-rates-amid-economic-and-data-uncertainty/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p>",

Both companies also aim to tap the massive CapEx spending on AI data-centers that are being driven by the cash-rich hyperscalers (Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), and Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>)) as well as neo-cloud vendors and up-and-coming companies like META (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), Oracle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL\" title=\"Oracle Corporation\">ORCL</a>), and OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>), which are also arguably becoming hyperscalers in their own right.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see from the graphic below from <a href=\"https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/artificial-intelligence-chipset-market-237558655.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Markets-and-Markets</a> research, what's at stake here is literally $100's of billions of dollars in AI chip's revenue just over the next few years - a market that is expected to grow at a 20%+ CAGR through 2029:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617534605792446_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"909\" data-height=\"480\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617534605792446_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AI Chip Market Size\" width=\"640\" height=\"338\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"338\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617534605792446_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617534605792446_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617534605792446_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617534605792446_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617534605792446_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617534605792446_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617534605792446_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617534605792446_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Markets-and-Markets</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, these two companies arguably have different strategies. AMD has been focused on competing head-on with Nvidia in the high-end processor market typically used for training large language models, or LLMs, and making these processors available to most any company that wants to buy them. Broadcom, on the other hand, has taken a different path by focusing on developing partnerships with only a handful of high-volume hyperscalers to co-develop application and AI/ML algorithm optimized XPU designs that are sold only to those specific customers and which are typically more often used for inferencing (see <em><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4820577-broadcom-the-secret-sauce-behind-its-booming-xpu-business\">Broadcom: The 'Secret Sauce' Behind Its Booming XPU Business</a></em>). Some investors think I might be splitting hairs here, but these are important distinctions between AMD and Broadcom.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regardless of the strategy taken, both AMD and Broadcom hope to deliver strong total returns for shareholders by providing more cost-efficient solutions than can be provided by the more expensive GPUs sold by market-leading Nvidia. (As an aside, AMD CEO Lisa Su is a <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/12/18/lisa-su-amd-ceo-share-price-jensen-huang/\" rel=\"nofollow\">distant cousin</a> of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang). Both companies should also benefit from the fact that many customers often cannot get the volume of Nvidia GPUs that they would prefer to be allocated to them instead of to their competitors. From that perspective, both AMD &amp; Broadcom are well-positioned to benefit from both of these dynamics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that as background, let's compare the two companies on a financial metrics basis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Basic Investment Metrics Comparisons</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The table below compares some of the most important financial and stock metrics (courtesy of Yahoo Finance and Seeking Alpha) that most any investor would consider before investing in either AMD and/or Broadcom:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td> </td> <td><strong>AMD</strong></td> <td><strong>Broadcom</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Market-Cap</strong></td> <td>$418.0 billion</td> <td>$1.79 trillion</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>TTM P/E</strong></td> <td>153.3x</td> <td>96.6x</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Forward P/E</strong></td> <td>65.6x</td> <td>55.3x</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Dividend/Yield</strong></td> <td>N/A</td> <td>$2.36/0.63%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Q2 FY25 Revenue</strong></td> <td>$7.7 billion (+30% YOY)</td> <td>$15.0 billion (+20% YOY)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Q2 Gross Margin</strong></td> <td>40%</td> <td>68%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Q2 GAAP EPS</strong></td> <td>$0.54/share</td> <td>$1.03/share</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Q2 Net Margin</strong></td> <td>11.3%</td> <td>33.1%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Q2 Free-Cash-Flow</strong></td> <td>$1.18 billion (+169% YOY)</td> <td>$6.41 billion (+44% YOY)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Q2 FCF Margin</strong></td> <td>15.0%</td> <td>42.7%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Q2 Free-Cash-Flow/Share</strong></td> <td>$0.72/share</td> <td>$1.33/share</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>ROE (TTM)</strong></td> <td>4.70%</td> <td>27.08%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Total Cash</strong></td> <td>$5.87 billion</td> <td>$11.11 billion</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Debt-to-Equity</strong></td> <td>6.51%</td> <td>166.03%</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">References: <a href=\"https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1257/amd-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results\" rel=\"nofollow\">AMD Q2 Report</a>, <a href=\"https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-inc-announces-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial\" rel=\"nofollow\">Broadcom Q2 Report</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see from the chart, Broadcom is a member of the $1 trillion market-cap club and has a market capitalization of 4x+ that of AMD.

And while the current 0.63% yield might not be a consideration to invest in the company today, long-term Broadcom shareholders know that the yield is only \"low\" because of the stock's excellent price appreciation over the past decade. In addition, note that Broadcom easily covers its annual dividend obligation (and then some ...) with the FCF generated in only two quarters. My point here is that I fully expect Broadcom to announce another 10% (or possibly larger) dividend increase in December.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regardless, either way you look at it, Broadcom is superior to AMD when it comes to a paying a dividend &amp; dividend growth (AMD currently does not pay a dividend).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a financial basis, perhaps the biggest difference between the two companies is with respect to their margin and free-cash-flow profiles. As you can see in the chart above, in Q2, <em>Broadcom's gross margin was a full 28 percentage points higher than AMD</em>. This gets back to Broadcom CEO Hock Tan's vision and strategy to focus the company only on the best high-margin, high-growth opportunities. As I pointed out in one of my most highly read Seeking Alpha articles, Hock Tan would rather threaten to exit a business than operate one delivering puny margins (see <em><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4569543-broadcom-ceo-shakedown-apple-chips\">CEO Shakedown: Hock Tan Vs Tim Cook</a></em> - a Seeking Alpha Editor's Pick).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It may also be indicative of the difficulty AMD may be having when it comes to competing directly with Nvidia (or even Broadcom ...) and the relative discounting it may have to offer in order to close order flow on its processors. On the other hand, with greater adoption of its processors, AMD may turn out to be a margin expansion story, in which case I might change my outlook on the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The margin difference, of course, plays a dominant role in terms of the two companies' free-cash-flow profiles. AMD generated $1.18 billion of free cash flow in Q2, which was up nicely on a YOY basis (+169%). From a revenue perspective, that equates to a FCF margin of 15% and $0.72/share. Broadcom generated $6.41 billion of FCF in Q2 (5.4x that of AMD) with a FCF margin of 42.7%. And while Broadcom's FCF margin was almost 3x that of AMD, on a historical basis, a 42.7% FCF margin is actually quite low for Broadcom and has much to do with its relatively recent and large acquisition of VMWare ($69 billion of cash+debt), which closed in November of 2023. Once again, the advantage in financial returns goes to Broadcom, which has an TTM ROE of 27.1% as compared to AMD's ROE of 4.7%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance Sheet</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a balance sheet perspective, the advantage goes <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD/balance-sheet\">to AMD</a>, which has a debt-to-equity ratio of only 6.51% as compared <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO/balance-sheet\">to Broadcom's</a> 166.03%. Indeed, as of Q2, Broadcom, was still carrying $62.8 billion of long-term debt (to go with its $11.1 billion of cash), primarily as a result of the VMWare acquisition. Broadcom has traditionally paid down M&amp;A related debt faster than it has so far done with VMWare, but that is because Broadcom has been more focused on investing quite heavily to take advantage of the tremendous growth opportunities it has with its XPU business with the hyperscalers.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Diversity</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While it may be a stretch to call AMD a one-trick pony, it has clearly become a processor-centric company. On the other hand, and as I have been writing for years on Seeking Alpha, Broadcom is arguably the global-leader in high-speed networking and, in Q2, generated 44% of total revenue from its high-margin Infrastructure Software Segment:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617586470086644.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Broadcom Q2 Segment Results\" width=\"540\" height=\"203\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"540\" data-height=\"203\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617586470086644.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617586470086644.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617586470086644.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617586470086644.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617586470086644.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617586470086644.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617586470086644.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617586470086644.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Broadcom</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see, in Q2, Broadcom generated $6.6 billion in high-margin revenue from its Infrastructure (Enterprise) Software Segment. As compared to AMD, this is important for two different reasons:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Broadcom has a strategic partnership with Nvidia that enables its VMWare Cloud Foundation (\"VCF\") to offer full-stack support for Nvidia's GPUs. This was very likely a significant headwind for AMD processor adoption amongst potential customers that also want to use VCF. As a result, in August, AMD agreed to collaborate with Broadcom to enable VCF to support its processors as well (almost two years after Broadcom &amp; Nvidia inked its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4657569-broadcom-a-201-stock-split-is-quite-likely\">strategic partnership</a>). At this point, Broadcom's VMWare has excellent flexibility because it can support Nvidia GPUs, AMD's processors, and - of course - Broadcom's own hyperscaler XPUs.</li> <li>Broadcom's Infrastructure Software Segment generates strong annual recurring revenue (\"ARR\"). This lowers the risk of investing in Broadcom stock, while also increasing the market's valuation of the company as a whole.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Once again: the advantage on software clearly goes to Broadcom.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meantime, Broadcom's high-speed networking product-line offerings are arguably and consistently the highest-quality, highest-bandwidth, and lowest latency in the industry. Again: this is a huge advantage that Broadcom has over AMD.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I say that because note that <em>Broadcom's XPUs, Infrastructure Software, and high-speed networking business are synergistic.</em> That is, a customer can come to Broadcom and get a fully integrated package of AI data-center solutions across processing, networking, and software. Again: a huge advantage to Broadcom moving forward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AMD reports its Q3 earnings <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD/earnings\">on November 4th</a>, while Broadcom doesn't report until <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO/earnings\">December 11th</a>. December is very late to report Q3 results, but after years of owning AVGO stock, trust me when I say that it is always worth the wait for AVGO's earnings reports.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current consensus analysts' estimates per Yahoo Finance are:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>AMD: Q3 Revenue of $8.75 billion (+28.3% YOY), EPS=$1.17/share.</li> <li>Broadcom: Q3 Revenue of $17.45 billion (+24.2% YOY), EPS=$1.87/share.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see, both companies are expected to continue growing revenue at an impressive pace. On a sequential basis, if AMD hits consensus estimates, it would equate to EPS growth of +116.7% as compared to Q2, while for Broadcom, it would equate to 81.6% EPS growth QoQ. That being the case, in the near-term, it appears that AMD is growing a bit faster from a revenue and EPS perspective, but of course, it is starting from a significantly lower base (i.e. the law of large numbers). Regardless, investors should be keeping a keen eye out for margin: are AMD and Broadcom exhibiting margin expansion? Can AMD close the big gap between it and Broadcom when it comes to net-margin, and it's very different free-cash-flow profile? Time will tell, but I certainly have my doubts, and I am much more confident that Broadcom will, once again, deliver the goods.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meantime, and while there have been a plethora of much-reported orders, I am still waiting for Broadcom to announce that Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>) has placed an order for XPUs, adding another tier-1 hyperscaler to its stable of XPU customers - which already includes Google, META, Byte Dance, and <a href=\"https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/openai-and-broadcom-announce-strategic-collaboration-deploy-10\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenAI</a>. Note that all of these are significant Broadcom high-speed networking customers as well.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">OpenAI Deals &amp; CapEx Trends</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earlier this month, AMD and OpenAI inked a multi-year multi-generational strategic partnership to deploy <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/openai-amd-strategic-partnership/\" rel=\"nofollow\">6 GW of AMD GPUs</a>. The initial phase of the partnership will see 1 GW of AMD Instinct MI450 Series GPUs deployed starting in the 2H 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A week later, Broadcom <a href=\"https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/openai-and-broadcom-announce-strategic-collaboration-deploy-10\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> an even larger strategic collaboration with OpenAI that will deploy 10 GW of OpenAI designed XPUs. The multi-year deal will see the two companies working together to deliver combined accelerators and networking systems for large-scale next-generation AI clusters using Broadcom's Ethernet-based scale-up and scale-out technology. Broadcom's deliverables will start in the 2H of 2026 and will consist of racks of AI accelerator &amp; network systems. The deal is expected to complete by the end of 2029. This deal shows one of the inherent advantages Broadcom has over AMD: the ability to package high-speed networking gear along with XPU accelerators in order to own more of the entire AI data-center architecture.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regardless of which company you like better (AMD or Broadcom), one thing that both of them share with Nvidia is what company makes all these cutting-edge AI processor chips: Taiwan Semiconductor (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>). That being the case, and considering TSM currently trades at a significant valuation discount to both AMD &amp; Broadcom (TTM P/E=33.9x, forward P/E=29.1x), one could make a good argument that TSMC may be the better investment here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of earnings, Google and META just released their Q3 results (see <a href=\"https://s206.q4cdn.com/479360582/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/2025q3-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_news/Meta-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Results-2025.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, respectively). As I predicted in my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830520-alphabet-the-ai-leader-openai-is-still-chasing\">recent Seeking Alpha article</a> \"<em>Google: The AI Leader OpenAI Is Still Chasing (But Will Never Catch\")</em>, Google delivered a huge beat and its first $100 billion dollar quarter:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Google Advertising Revenue: $74.182 billion (+12.7% YOY).</li> <li>Google Cloud Revenue: $15.157 billion (+33.5% YOY).</li> <li>EPS of $2.87/share (+35.4% YOY).</li> <li>Free-cash-flow: $24.461 billion (despite a huge CapEx spend).</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Google Search, YouTube, Google subscriptions, and Google Cloud each delivered double-digit growth in Q3 - all driven by Google's Gemini and Infrastructure AI. So much for the popular narrative that OpenAI its ChatGPT chatbot would somehow \"kill Google Search.\" right? Why am I mentioning this here? Because Google is a major XPU customer of Broadcom (GOOG calls them \"TPUs\") and GOOG announced a further increase in FY25 CapEx from an estimated $85 billion in the <a href=\"https://s206.q4cdn.com/479360582/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/2025q2-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q2 report</a> to a mid-point of $92 billion, or an incremental increase of $7 billion, in the Q3 report released today. And you can bet that a significant chunk of that increase will likely be headed to Broadcom for TPUs and high-speed networking equipment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Likewise, META - another Broadcom XPU customer - had very strong Q3 results and also increased its FY25 CapEx guidance to a midpoint of $71 billion from the previous midpoint of $69 billion. META also <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510953-meta-anticipates-capex-dollar-growth-to-rise-notably-in-2026-with-ai-investments\">said</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>CapEx dollar growth will be notably larger in 2026 than 2025. We also anticipate total expenses will grow at a significantly faster percentage rate than 2025, with growth primarily driven by infrastructure costs.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My point here is that the hyperscalers that are Broadcom XPU and high-speed networking equipment customers are demonstrating strong growth, doing very well, and significantly increasing their CapEx budgets - of which a significantly allocation will quite likely be spent on Broadcom's XPU and high-speed networking products. This bodes very well for Broadcom's near-term upcoming earnings report on December 11th and the company's earnings well into 2026 and beyond.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Summary &amp; Conclusions</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both AMD and Broadcom are clearly operating in the right market at the right time. However, from a financial perspective, Broadcom's margin and free-cash-flow profiles are superior when compared to AMD's. In addition, Broadcom has two businesses (High-speed Networking &amp; Infrastructure Software) in which AMD is a relative no-show. That is a huge advantage to Broadcom when it comes to packaging all three of its offerings (i.e. XPU processor, high-speed networking equipment, and VMWare software) for customers who prefer to deal with one vendor when designing its AI data-center architecture.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When you also consider that <em>Broadcom stock is currently selling at a significant valuation discount to AMD</em>, Broadcom wins this showdown by a mile in my opinion. That being the case, if I owned AMD shares (I do not) I would probably SELL them and BUY more Broadcom (full-disclosure: I do own Broadcom stock).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'll end with a 5-year total returns chart of Broadcom versus AMD and add the broad market averages as represented by (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VOO\" title=\"Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF\">VOO</a>) and (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ\" title=\"Invesco QQQ Trust ETF\">QQQ</a>) for the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100, respectively:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_6b903b171a20d2bf0e927c3bf6c991eb.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_6b903b171a20d2bf0e927c3bf6c991eb.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_6b903b171a20d2bf0e927c3bf6c991eb.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_6b903b171a20d2bf0e927c3bf6c991eb.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_6b903b171a20d2bf0e927c3bf6c991eb.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_6b903b171a20d2bf0e927c3bf6c991eb.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_6b903b171a20d2bf0e927c3bf6c991eb.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_6b903b171a20d2bf0e927c3bf6c991eb.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_6b903b171a20d2bf0e927c3bf6c991eb.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see from the graphic, Broadcom has been the clear out-performer of the chosen companies and ETFs.

The common shares have dipped markedly from their 2025 highs, mirroring a broad BDC sell-off catalyzed by fears that the Fed's dovish pivot to cutting rates would spark widespread dividend cuts. This was overlaid with the dual collapse of First Brands Group and Tricolor to spark systemic credit fears that pulled private credit into its malaise and made selling BDCs into a tradable event.

The direction of this is down, with 50 basis points of rate cuts since September, and a likelihood of another 25 basis points rate cut at the upcoming December 10 rate-setting meeting.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617914954360106_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1584\" data-height=\"652\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617914954360106_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Ares Capital Fiscal 2025 Third Quarter Operating Results\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"263\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617914954360106_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617914954360106_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617914954360106_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617914954360106_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617914954360106_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617914954360106_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617914954360106_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617914954360106_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

This is lower than peers, and is somewhat of a plus in an environment where yields are being pulled down by the Fed. It comes as ARCC ramps up gross commitments to maintain investment portfolio growth. Gross commitments were <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509151-ares-capital-in-charts-interest-income-from-investments-dips-yy-dividend-income-drops\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509151-ares-capital-in-charts-interest-income-from-investments-dips-yy-dividend-income-drops\" target=\"_blank\">$3.92 billion</a> during the third quarter, up a material 53% sequentially and roughly flat versus gross commitments a year ago. It was set against exits of $2.63 billion for positive net commitments of $1.3 billion during the third quarter. ARCC is aligned with the BDC camp that has sped up originations to counter falling rates.

ARCC had 1% of its portfolio at fair value on non-accrual status as of the end of the third quarter. This was down 20 basis points sequentially but up from 0.6% a year ago. This is still well within a prudent historical range, which renders the selling off seen recently as relatively unhinged. This sell-off would drive the commons to the April \"Liberation Day\" tariff lows. However, it's becoming increasingly clear that the dual failures were isolated idiosyncratic risk events, and their extrapolation to the broader private credit space was unnecessary.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617919073456607_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1560\" data-height=\"1102\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617919073456607_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Ares Capital Fiscal 2025 Third Quarter Investment Backlog\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"452\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617919073456607_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617919073456607_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617919073456607_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617919073456607_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617919073456607_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617919073456607_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617919073456607_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617919073456607_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ares Capital Fiscal 2025 Third Quarter Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ARCC's investment backlog at the end of the third quarter was $3 billion, with the BDC now clearly pushing for a larger allocation to first lien credit, as this formed 85% of its backlog. NII per share is currently covering its dividend by 100%, an exact ratio that leaves very little room for NII to dip in future quarters. This coverage came as its net asset value per share of $20.01 grew by $0.12 versus its year-ago comp. ARCC is a hold at its current level.</p>",

Aside from McDonald’s Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD\" title=\"McDonald's Corporation\">MCD</a>), DoorDash, Inc.

And while I would still call Starbucks a great long-term investment, I see downside risk in the short term. Depending on the question if the United States will enter a recession and how steep the recession will be, a valuation multiple of 30 or higher might not be justified and Starbucks could decline rather steep (especially as earnings per share and free cash flow will also contract in such a scenario). Looking at the Great Financial Crisis is demonstrating how steep Starbucks could fall.</p> <p>But over the long run, Starbucks is probably fairly valued and can be seen as a solid investment at this point. It is not a bargain, but probably also not overvalued.“</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back then, I was already cautious and pointed out that we are still dealing with a great business and a potential long-term investment. But I also made clear we should not ignore the short-term risks. At this point, I would not only classify the risks as rather short-to-mid-term but also see the risks as the bigger issue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since my last article was published, Starbucks has declined about 14% (this was written before market open) and clearly underperformed the overall market and a declining stock price is in most cases shifting the risk-reward ratio towards a more bullish opinion. However, due to the continuous struggles of Starbucks (exemplified by the underwhelming quarterly results), the still high valuation multiples the stock is trading for and the risks looming on the horizon, I would be even more cautious about Starbucks as an investment. In the following article, I will explain why I actually sold my Starbucks position a few months ago and why I see the stock being a “Hold” at best.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Valuation Multiples</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest problem for Starbucks investors is still the high valuation multiples. At the time of writing, Starbucks is still trading for 36.4 times earnings per share and 42.5 times free cash flow. Without much doubt, these are extremely high valuation multiples.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a265fb98b99e43f3c12586be5d9b178f.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a265fb98b99e43f3c12586be5d9b178f.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a265fb98b99e43f3c12586be5d9b178f.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a265fb98b99e43f3c12586be5d9b178f.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a265fb98b99e43f3c12586be5d9b178f.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a265fb98b99e43f3c12586be5d9b178f.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a265fb98b99e43f3c12586be5d9b178f.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a265fb98b99e43f3c12586be5d9b178f.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a265fb98b99e43f3c12586be5d9b178f.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the case of Starbucks, we could argue that the stock always traded for high valuation multiples and therefore current valuation multiples seem in line with previous numbers. Hence, we can argue that Starbucks might be fairly valued and neither under- nor overvalued. However, valuation multiples can’t be justified by looking only at previous data or comparing a company to its industry peers. High valuation multiples can only be justified by high expected growth rates in the years to come.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Quarterly Results</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To answer the question of whether Starbucks deserves the high valuation multiples we can start by looking at the last quarter's results. While Starbucks<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510664-starbucks-non-gaap-eps-of-0_52-misses-by-0_03-revenue-of-9_6b-beats-by-250m\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510664-starbucks-non-gaap-eps-of-0_52-misses-by-0_03-revenue-of-9_6b-beats-by-250m\" target=\"_blank\"> did beat revenue estimates</a> by about $250 million, it did miss earnings per share expectations. Aside from beating expectations, total net revenue increased from $9,074 million in Q4/24 to $9,569 million in Q4/25 – resulting in 5.5% year-over-year growth for the top line.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-1761840643372864_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1387\" data-height=\"561\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-1761840643372864_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Starbucks is reporting fourth quarter results\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"259\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-1761840643372864_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-1761840643372864_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-1761840643372864_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-1761840643372864_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-1761840643372864_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-1761840643372864_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-1761840643372864_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-1761840643372864_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Starbucks Q4/25 FactSheet</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While revenue increased in the mid-single digits, operating income declined steeply (78.7% year-over-year) from $1,306.9 million in the same quarter last year to $278.2 million in this quarter.

Of course, we find some positive news in the last earnings report like global comparable store sales increased 1%, making this the first positive quarter in seven quarters. In the United States, comparable store sales were flat year-over-year with average ticket up 1% (reflecting fewer discount-driven offers in the current year).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Among the three segments, it was especially Channel Development that grew with a high pace (16.6% year-over-year growth), but the segment is only responsible for about 5.5% of total revenue and the company was unable to transfer high revenue growth for the segment into bottom-line growth as operating income increased only 0.2% year-over-year to $265.2 million.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Situation in China Improving</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the most important markets for Starbucks is still Mainland China as it offers huge growth potential for the business (in comparison to the United States, a market that is probably saturated already). And in the last few years because of China’s economy struggling, Starbucks also struggled. However, the situation in China is improving and net revenue increased 6.1% year-over-year from $783.7 million in Q4/24 to $831.6 million in Q4/25.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-17618406457335103_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2034\" data-height=\"704\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-17618406457335103_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Starbucks: Situation in China is improving a little bit\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"222\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-17618406457335103_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-17618406457335103_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-17618406457335103_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-17618406457335103_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-17618406457335103_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-17618406457335103_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-17618406457335103_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-17618406457335103_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Starbucks Q4/25 Earnings Release</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The store count continues to increase in China with Starbucks opening 415 stores during the last twelve months (net store openings) and having 8,011 stores in China at the end of Q4/25.

What makes me rather optimistic is the CSI 300 index, which might have found its bottom and is marching higher in the last few months. And the stock market usually being a leading indicator, this might be a slightly bullish sign.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>United States: Huge Question Marks</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China is certainly an important market and might contribute to growth for Starbucks, but we should also not ignore that China still generates only about 8.5% of total sales for Starbucks and the most important market is without doubt the United States (responsible for two-thirds of total revenue).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my last article I already talked about the risk of the United States entering a recession. And despite the stock market making new all-time highs and sentiment being extremely bullish, I see the picture slowly worsening. Of course, the following selection of indicators is certainly not perfect and is biased in some way, but aside from the treasury yield (visualized by the<a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y3M\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y3M\" target=\"_blank\"> T10Y3M</a> and<a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y\" target=\"_blank\"> T10Y2Y</a>), which inverted and “re-inverted” again and is a strong sign for a recession, there are other early warning indicators.

However, the economy is hardly adding jobs anymore and this is not a good sign. However, other leading indicators like the<a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SAHMREALTIME\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SAHMREALTIME\" target=\"_blank\"> Sahm Rule</a> are not indicating a recession so far.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And this is making me very cautious about Starbucks. On the other hand, the company can grow its delivery business in the United States by 30% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and is surpassing $1 billion in sales for the full year. Additionally, Starbucks is optimistic its “Back to Starbucks” strategy is working and CEO Brian Niccol stated<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835018-starbucks-corporation-sbux-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835018-starbucks-corporation-sbux-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\"> during the last earnings call</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>A year ago, we launched our Back to Starbucks strategy to get us back to the exceptional craft, connection and welcoming coffee houses that define the Starbucks Experience and set us apart. Since then, we've been focused on executing our plan and accelerating it where we've seen opportunity. We took the significant step of scaling several key pieces of work during the quarter, and it's clear from our results that our plan is working, and our turnaround is taking hold.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Part of this strategy is assessing stores and closing unprofitable stores. During the last earnings call, CFO Catherine Smith stated:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>This included the completion of our assessment of our coffee house portfolio and identified closures as well as a simplification of our broader support organization to one that is streamlined and more closely aligned to our future growth priorities. Let me walk through some of the impacts to our financials. In the fourth quarter, we had 107 net store closures globally as part of the restructuring we announced in September. These coffee houses were deemed unable to meet our standards for customer experience even through a potential uplift or for profitability.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aside from closing stores, Starbucks is also uplifting some of its stores and has a new coffee house prototype and has completed nearly 70 uplifts so far and is planning about 1,000 uplifted stores until the end of fiscal 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Weakening Moat</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another question is whether Starbucks still has a wide economic moat and therefore a strategic advantage that will lead to above-average growth in the years to come. Starbucks’ economic moat is built heavily around its brand name, which enables the company to charge premium prices to its customers. However, in the list of top 100 global brands (by<a href=\"https://interbrand.com/best-global-brands/global/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://interbrand.com/best-global-brands/global/\" target=\"_blank\"> Interbrand</a>), Starbucks is obviously not among the top 100 anymore. In previous years, Starbucks was usually listed somewhere around spot 50 and falling out of that list would indicate a steep decline in brand value.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a4e401b7f4d19f16cf8d14f4306fb023.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a4e401b7f4d19f16cf8d14f4306fb023.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a4e401b7f4d19f16cf8d14f4306fb023.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a4e401b7f4d19f16cf8d14f4306fb023.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a4e401b7f4d19f16cf8d14f4306fb023.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a4e401b7f4d19f16cf8d14f4306fb023.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a4e401b7f4d19f16cf8d14f4306fb023.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a4e401b7f4d19f16cf8d14f4306fb023.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a4e401b7f4d19f16cf8d14f4306fb023.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another red flag is the declining return on invested capital in the last five years.

However, we must be a little cautious and not only look at simple valuation multiples as they are sometimes misleading. Valuation multiples are using the results of the last four quarters, which can be an outlier leading to much higher or much lower valuation multiples.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Instead, we use a discounted cash flow calculation to determine an intrinsic value for Starbucks. As always, I calculate with a discount rate of 10% (the annual return I like to achieve at least from an investment) and 1.141 billion diluted shares outstanding. Now it is getting more difficult as we have to make assumptions for the years to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In an optimistic scenario we can assume that Starbucks will be able to grow with a high pace in line with analysts estimates, which see Starbucks growing at least in the low to mid-teens in the years to come. As basis we can take the free cash flow of the last four quarters, which was $2.442 billion and when assuming Starbucks will grow between 12% and 13% in the next ten years followed by 6% growth until perpetuity, the stock is fairly valued right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is difficult to assess how realistic these assumptions are. Over the last ten years, earnings per share actually declined, but when taking a different year, the picture is completely different and earnings per share are growing in the high single digits or even double digits due to the heavy fluctuations (see section above). Revenue grew with a CAGR of 6.42% in the last five years and a CAGR of 8.20% in the last ten years. Combining these revenue growth rates with improving margins, double-digit growth rates seem possible again. However, when assuming that Starbucks might only be able to grow in the mid-to-high single digits, we get an intrinsic value of $50 to $60, and the stock is still overvalued.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The problem for Starbucks can be summed up quite simply. Even when estimating that Starbucks’ situation can improve again and the company might grow with a higher pace, the stock is still trading for extremely high valuation multiples and high growth expectations are already reflected in the stock price. There is little upside for investors here: If Starbucks can actually improve its business again, it is good for investors and is making the stock fairly valued. If the situation for Starbucks is not improving, the stock is overvalued and might decline in the coming months and quarters. Maybe investors won’t lose any money, but there is not much upside potential at this point.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The combination of declining margins, low revenue growth rates, the risk of the United States (and many other countries around the world) entering a recession and the high valuation multiples for Starbucks makes me extremely cautious right now and the stock is still a “Hold” at best.</p>",

The company reported record Q3 revenue of $33.1 billion, which was up by a solid 40.8% year-over-year and 10.1% sequentially.</p> <p>Over the<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> last few months, the stock has surged as it’s up 50% since early June. At the time, we covered the stock in an article covering AI growth and geopolitical risk, providing a scenario that could take the stock toward the $300s:</span></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>If we see the next drop take the form of a 3-wave drop that holds over $146, then we could be setting up for a rally toward the $300s.” </em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At time of writing, the stock was at $203 and touched $304 on Oct. 15.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For Taiwan Semiconductor, the outlook is two-fold. On one hand, TSMC is deepening its moat with advanced nodes, such as N2 and A16. The company already powers tens of trillions in market cap on the stock market when you consider Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>), Broadcom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\" title=\"Broadcom Inc.\">AVGO</a>), Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), AMD (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>), and Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) are customers of TSMC. Essentially, all mega-cap stocks have an AI strategy spanning merchant GPUs and custom silicon, and of course, software—yet the common denominator to these strategies is they all funnel into TSMC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet, on the other hand, many pundits have been asking, are we in an AI bubble? While AI leaders, related suppliers, and strong R&amp;D teams march onward with exceptional earnings reports, ongoing deal announcements and provide strong commentary that AI demand greatly outstrips supply, investors are left wondering what the true value is for the outsized growth. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and TSMC’s valuation chart certainly fits that description:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPm_07pReVYa3lrQ_st.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1616\" data-height=\"1066\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPm_07pReVYa3lrQ_st.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TSMC’s forward price-to-sales ratio surges to 12.2x, its highest level since the start of the AI boom\" width=\"1280\" height=\"844\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPm_07pReVYa3lrQ_st.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPm_07pReVYa3lrQ_st.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPm_07pReVYa3lrQ_st.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPm_07pReVYa3lrQ_st.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPm_07pReVYa3lrQ_st.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPm_07pReVYa3lrQ_st.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPm_07pReVYa3lrQ_st.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPm_07pReVYa3lrQ_st.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Source: YCharts <span>(Tech Insider Network)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although no risk management strategy will be entirely error-free, we have a plan to handle the tech sector’s inevitable volatility, something we <span class=\"highlighted_text\">provide to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/checkout/mp_1326\">stock newsletter subscribers</a>.

This is up from the 30% growth provided in Q2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management sounded very optimistic during the Q3 earnings call about long-term AI growth opportunities. As discussed below, AI momentum is stronger than expected. The growing adoption of AI consumer models is driving strong demand for AI chips. Similarly, enterprise AI demand is strong, and the rising sovereign AI opportunity will become another strong growth driver.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">TSMC: AI Accelerator Growth to Hit Mid-40% CAGR by 2029</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management commentary suggested the chipmaker’s AI outlook through 2029 may be revised higher than the previously guided mid-40% CAGR, though TSMC declined to provide an updated figure, opting to hold off until early 2026:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p><em>AI demand actually continues to be very strong, (it's) stronger than we thought three months ago, OK? So in today's situation, we have talked to customers and then we talk to customers' customer.</em></p> <p><em>So the CAGR we previously we announced is about mid-40s. It's (still) a little bit better than that. We will update you probably in beginning of next year so we have a more clear picture. Today, the (numbers) are insane.”</em></p> </blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">TSMC Reports Softer HPC Growth After Historic Q2 Gains</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TSMC reported a softer QoQ increase in HPC revenue in Q3 after the chipmaker posted its largest sequential growth in Q2 at nearly $3 billion. Q3 saw sequential growth of just over ~$800 million in USD terms, or ~5% QoQ, versus over 20% QoQ growth seen in Q2. However, Q3’s USD-visible growth continued to be inflated by forex, as HPC revenue in NTD was approximately flat QoQ at ~NT$564 billion, versus over 13% growth in Q2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, looking closer, HPC also saw its percentage of total revenue decline three points from Q2 to Q3, from 60% of total revenue to 57%. Meanwhile, smartphone revenue came in quite strong, gaining three points in total revenue to 30% share as revenue surged nearly 23% QoQ to $9.9 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The softness in HPC revenue may stem from the upcoming platform shift to Nvidia’s Rubin architecture, which relies on a customized 3nm node, N3P, whereas Blackwell relies on TSMC’s N4P process, a customized 5nm node. As you can see in the chart below, TSMC reported a decline in HPC QoQ and YoY revenue at the time that Nvidia’s previous generation Hopper began to ship around Q1 2023. The decline persisted for a few quarters before TSMC resumed very strong QoQ growth in early 2024.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnCt7pReVYa3lrv_hpcrev.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1626\" data-height=\"700\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnCt7pReVYa3lrv_hpcrev.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TSMC’s high-performance computing revenue rose 57% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter in Q3 2025, easing from record Q2 gains as demand slows ahead of Nvidia’s Rubin launch\" width=\"1280\" height=\"551\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnCt7pReVYa3lrv_hpcrev.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnCt7pReVYa3lrv_hpcrev.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnCt7pReVYa3lrv_hpcrev.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnCt7pReVYa3lrv_hpcrev.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnCt7pReVYa3lrv_hpcrev.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnCt7pReVYa3lrv_hpcrev.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnCt7pReVYa3lrv_hpcrev.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnCt7pReVYa3lrv_hpcrev.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">HPC revenue grew 57% YoY and 5% QoQ in Q3 2025, easing from record sequential gains in Q2 as demand pauses ahead of Nvidia’s Rubin ramp. <span>(Tech Insider Network)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia’s upcoming Rubin generation is slated to be released in the second half of 2026, as six variations entered trial production in August.

As Tom’s Hardware estimates, it could take 9-12 months or longer for Rubin to enter production.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, TSMC will likely report a lull in the HPC segment between the Blackwell and Rubin generations, as Nvidia represents the lion’s share of this segment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">TSMC’s Q3 EPS Surges 50.5% Year-over-Year, Beating Estimates by Over 12%</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As much as TSMC is a top-line story, it's equally a bottom-line story. The company’s EPS grew by 50.5% YoY to $2.92, beating estimates by an impressive 12.3% with the strongest beat in the last two years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Analysts expect Q4 EPS to grow 26.8% YoY to $2.84 in Q4 and grow 25.5% in Q1. Looking forward, they expect EPS to grow 19.8% YoY to 12.34 in 2026 and 24.6% YoY to $15.48 in 2027.

For example, we see some stocks, such as Palantir (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR\" title=\"Palantir Technologies Inc.\">PLTR</a>), trading as high as 100 forward P/S, there are long-standing stocks like Broadcom trading higher than they ever have in their history, and it seems there are new deals being announced every day followed by 20%-plus pops.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding TSM, it’s up 290% since early 2023, while the Nasdaq is up 127% and market favorites like Apple are up 98%. There's no denying that TSMC has been a strong performer, as it’s the common denominator across the AI accelerator supply chain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Below we look at the following to determine how to approach the combination of a strong AI stock with a high valuation:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The top reason that TSMC has seen strong price action and what must happen for the strong price action to continue.</li> <li>How to weigh the United States providing more funding to Intel (to date) compared to TSMC.</li> <li>A new trade setup for TSM now that our original trade plan has played out as described last June.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">TSMC Strengthens Pricing Power as GPUs Transition to Advanced 3nm and 2nm Nodes</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TSMC’s impressive price performance reflects many factors, but at its core, it comes down to the company’s unmatched pricing power in the AI ecosystem. As we had discussed earlier, the chipmaker is the common denominator to essentially all mega-cap stocks’ AI strategies, and the company is deepening its moat with more advanced nodes, such as N2 and A16.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As chips progress to these more advanced nodes, such as Nvidia’s Rubin moving to 3nm and AMD now building CPUs on 2nm, TSMC stands to benefit from increased pricing power. This is because wafers at these new and upcoming nodes carry significant premiums versus the prior node, accounting for substantial increases in performance or power efficiency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pricing for TSMC’s 3nm node was originally <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmcs-wafer-pricing-now-usd18-000-for-a-3nm-wafer-increased-by-over-3x-in-10-years-analyst\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmcs-wafer-pricing-now-usd18-000-for-a-3nm-wafer-increased-by-over-3x-in-10-years-analyst\" target=\"_blank\">pegged</a> by analysts at ~$18,000 per wafer at the start of 2025, before rising just over 10% <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/09/05/news-tsmc-to-implement-a-significant-price-hike/\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/09/05/news-tsmc-to-implement-a-significant-price-hike/\" target=\"_blank\">to $20,000</a> by September, per reports. This would give the 2nm node a ~50% premium with its reported pricing at $30,000 per wafer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, reports claim that supply chain sources suggest 3nm pricing is <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/10/08/news-tsmc-2nm-reportedly-up-10-20-far-below-rumored-50-3-7nm-to-rise-single-digit-in-2026/\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/10/08/news-tsmc-2nm-reportedly-up-10-20-far-below-rumored-50-3-7nm-to-rise-single-digit-in-2026/\" target=\"_blank\">closer to $25,000</a> to $27,000 per wafer, a 50% uplift from the start of the year. This is important for TSMC, as this process underpins Nvidia’s Rubin, which is expected to see <a href=\"https://www.tweaktown.com/news/106116/nvidia-expected-to-ship-5-2m-blackwell-gpus-in-2025-1-8m-2026-and-7m-rubin/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.tweaktown.com/news/106116/nvidia-expected-to-ship-5-2m-blackwell-gpus-in-2025-1-8m-2026-and-7m-rubin/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">shipments of ~5.7 million</a> units next year, per JPMorgan. Assuming this pricing stands, this could provide a meaningful tailwind to TSMC’s AI revenue as Rubin ramps, though it would shrink the premium gap with 2nm to just 12-20%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">TSMC Strong Margins Support Strong Pricing Power</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Margins continue to expand due to cost controls, higher capacity utilization rates, economies of scale, and better price negotiation with customers and suppliers.</li> <li>Operating margin crosses 50% in Q3.</li> <li>Net income grew by 50.3% YoY.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TSMC’s ability to generate exceptionally strong profits showcases that the company is one of the best-managed companies in the world. Despite the rising inflation, tariff concerns, technological advancement, trade wars, overseas fab expansion, and geopolitical tensions, TSMC has overcome these challenges by continuing to generate superior profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s gross margins improved 170 basis points YoY and 90 basis points sequentially to 59.5%. Cost improvements, better capacity utilization, and better price negotiation with customers and suppliers primarily drove the strong margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, it was partially offset by dilution from overseas fabs and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Management expects gross margin to improve 50 basis points further sequentially and 100 basis points YoY in Q4 to 60% with a boost from favorable foreign exchange rates next quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operating profits grew by 50% YoY to $16.74 billion, with an operating margin of 50.6%, an improvement of 310 basis points YoY and 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by higher gross profits and operating leverage. TSMC beat its operating margin guidance by a solid 410 basis points. Management's Q4 guide is 50%.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnD_7pReVYa3lr4_TSMCQ3OperatingMarginRisesto50.6_25onAIDemandandCostControl.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1624\" data-height=\"1128\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnD_7pReVYa3lr4_TSMCQ3OperatingMarginRisesto50.6_25onAIDemandandCostControl.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TSMC’s Q3 2024 operating margin increased by 310 basis points year-over-year to 50.6%, driven by strong cost control, operating leverage, and sustained AI demand\" width=\"1280\" height=\"889\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnD_7pReVYa3lr4_TSMCQ3OperatingMarginRisesto50.6_25onAIDemandandCostControl.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnD_7pReVYa3lr4_TSMCQ3OperatingMarginRisesto50.6_25onAIDemandandCostControl.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnD_7pReVYa3lr4_TSMCQ3OperatingMarginRisesto50.6_25onAIDemandandCostControl.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnD_7pReVYa3lr4_TSMCQ3OperatingMarginRisesto50.6_25onAIDemandandCostControl.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnD_7pReVYa3lr4_TSMCQ3OperatingMarginRisesto50.6_25onAIDemandandCostControl.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnD_7pReVYa3lr4_TSMCQ3OperatingMarginRisesto50.6_25onAIDemandandCostControl.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnD_7pReVYa3lr4_TSMCQ3OperatingMarginRisesto50.6_25onAIDemandandCostControl.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnD_7pReVYa3lr4_TSMCQ3OperatingMarginRisesto50.6_25onAIDemandandCostControl.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">TSMC’s operating margin climbed to 50.6% in Q3 2024, up 310 basis points year-over-year, reflecting strong cost control, operating leverage, and continued AI-driven demand. <span>(Tech Insider Network)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite higher capex, cash was also strong, with operating cash flow at 43.9% compared to 51.6% in the same period last year.

The free cash flows were down due to higher capex, which grew by 51.6% YoY to $9.7 billion to support strong further growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks: China, Margins Following Onshoring, and Intel</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we look into the future, there are puts and takes to onshoring. Last Friday, TSM and Nvidia <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/10/16/news-tsmc-plans-faster-shift-to-n2-and-more-advanced-nodes-in-arizona-amid-soaring-ai-demand/\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/10/16/news-tsmc-plans-faster-shift-to-n2-and-more-advanced-nodes-in-arizona-amid-soaring-ai-demand/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that the first US-made Blackwell wafer was produced at TSM’s Phoenix fab, marking an important milestone in building domestic supply chains for advanced chip production. However, this will mark a new test for TSMC’s pricing power, as AMD CEO Lisa Su has stated that US-made chips will be between <a href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/first-us-made-nvidia-blackwell-wafer-manufactured-at-tsmcs-arizona-fab/\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/first-us-made-nvidia-blackwell-wafer-manufactured-at-tsmcs-arizona-fab/\" target=\"_blank\">5% and 20%</a> more expensive than Taiwan-made chips, with rumors that US chips could be as much as <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/processors/us-made-processor-prices-could-soar-if-the-rumour-that-tsmc-might-charge-as-much-as-30-percent-more-for-its-arizona-chips-pans-out/\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/processors/us-made-processor-prices-could-soar-if-the-rumour-that-tsmc-might-charge-as-much-as-30-percent-more-for-its-arizona-chips-pans-out/\" target=\"_blank\">30%</a> more expensive. While bringing this level of capacity to Arizona could provide a strong tailwind for revenue over the next handful of years, TSMC will have to prove it can maintain strong margins should US-made chips continue to command a premium versus Taiwanese chips.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although Intel has largely been written off, given it has nowhere near the IP as TSMC on advanced nodes, it’s important to note that Intel is seeing outsized support from the United States <a href=\"https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1748/intel-and-trump-administration-reach-historic-agreement-to?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=substack\" rel=\"noopener noopener\" title=\"https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1748/intel-and-trump-administration-reach-historic-agreement-to?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=substack\" target=\"_blank\">with</a> $11.1 billion in funding compared to TSMC’s $11.6 <a href=\"https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1748/intel-and-trump-administration-reach-historic-agreement-to?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=substack\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1748/intel-and-trump-administration-reach-historic-agreement-to?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=substack\" target=\"_blank\">billion</a> despite the company being the market leader in the manufacturing of most advanced chips (so far).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Broadly understood yet important to note, geopolitical tensions related to China could negatively affect the stock. The company has been reducing this risk by setting up fabs outside of Taiwan. However, it will dilute margins, since the cost of setting up fabs and operating fabs in the US is higher than in Taiwan.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">TSMC’s Technicals Overview:</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In our last report in June, we stated that:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>If we see the next drop take the form of a 3-wave drop that holds over $146, then we could be setting up for a rally toward the $300s.”</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is exactly what happened, as we only saw a dip that tested $224 in what was obviously a 3-wave move. TSM then pressed toward $309, and starting to turn lower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering that we saw TSM pushing toward our target zone on decelerating volume and momentum, it was apparent that we were in some type of 5th wave move, which is the final swing in a trend. There are two scenarios that make the most sense based solely on the price action.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPobTbpReVYa3mhc_tsmdailychart.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2022\" data-height=\"844\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPobTbpReVYa3mhc_tsmdailychart.png?io=w640\" alt=\"https://images.prismic.io/bethtechnology/aPobTbpReVYa3mhc_tsmdailychart.png?auto=format,compress\" width=\"1280\" height=\"534\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPobTbpReVYa3mhc_tsmdailychart.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPobTbpReVYa3mhc_tsmdailychart.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPobTbpReVYa3mhc_tsmdailychart.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPobTbpReVYa3mhc_tsmdailychart.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPobTbpReVYa3mhc_tsmdailychart.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPobTbpReVYa3mhc_tsmdailychart.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPobTbpReVYa3mhc_tsmdailychart.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPobTbpReVYa3mhc_tsmdailychart.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Tech Insider Network</span></p></figcaption></figure><ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Blue—We hit the lower bounds of a topping zone between $309-$340. If TSM can hold $264, we can see another swing into the upper regions of this topping zone in the coming weeks or months.

The S&amp;P 500® Index and the Nasdaq Composite hit multiple record highs. Even the<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> beleaguered small-cap asset class participated in the beta-induced rally. The Russell 2000® Index had its best quarter since 4Q23 and hit fresh all-time highs in September.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI remained the dominant market theme, with several high-profile deals announced between the key players. The spending spree has been unprecedented on so many levels, and segments of the economy linked to this pervasive theme have continued to benefit. However, some pushback began to emerge as the quarter progressed, which centered on the question of monetization. The intricate relationships between key players were also under the microscope, with particular focus on the “circularity” around funding in the AI ecosystem. This conjured up memories of “vendor financing” during the dot-com era.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The decision by the Federal Reserve (the “Fed”) to cut rates also helped fuel some of the risk-on sentiment. Some questioned the Fed’s decision to cut rates absent any meaningful weakness in the labor market and the overall economy. Nevertheless, the Fed delivered the cut that the market was cheering for. By quarter end, it was unclear whether the Fed will cut once or twice during the remainder of the year. Another tailwind for risk markets was the better-than-expected corporate earnings season with expectations that 3Q earnings could also surprise to the upside. While some companies alluded to tariff headwinds, most were able to offset some of the impact through mitigation measures. Consumer spending also remained resilient, as evidenced by positive retail sales growth and strong summer travel demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Heading into the final quarter of the year, there does not appear to be a major market theme potent enough to dramatically alter the current narrative. The AI spending frenzy is likely to continue unabated. With FOMO a pervasive force in the market, we believe risk-on sentiment is likely to prevail. Fundamental investors will have to live to fight another day in this momentum-driven and beta-induced market.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance By Size And Style</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Small-cap equities outpaced both large- and mid-cap equities during the third quarter of 2025. Small-cap equities, as measured by the Russell 2000® Index, returned 12.39% during the quarter. Large-cap equities, as measured by the S&amp;P 500® Index and the Russell 1000® Index, returned 8.12% and 7.99%, respectively, while mid-cap stocks, as measured by the Russell Midcap® Index, returned 5.33%. Broken down by style, growth outpaced value within the large-cap size segment, while value outpaced growth within the small- and mid-cap segments. Specifically, for small-caps, the Russell 2000® Value Index returned 12.60%, outpacing its growth counterpart, which returned 12.19%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618444322491384_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"757\" data-height=\"283\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618444322491384_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Returns and performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"239\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618444322491384_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618444322491384_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618444322491384_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618444322491384_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618444322491384_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618444322491384_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618444322491384_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618444322491384_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance Attribution Relative to the Russell 2000® Value Index – 3Q 2025</h2> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Positive Contributors</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Negative Contributors</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Stock Selection &amp; Overweight in Information Technology</p></td> <td><p>Stock Selection in Materials; <em>partially offset by overweight</em></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Underweight in Real Estate</p></td> <td><p>Stock Selection &amp; Underweight in Health Care</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>Stock Selection in Industrials</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>Stock Selection in Consumer Discretionary</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>Stock Selection in Financials</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>Stock Selection in Consumer Staples</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>Underweight &amp; Stock Selection in Communication Services</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Source: FactSet.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio Attribution – Third Quarter</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Victory Sycamore Small Company Opportunity Fund (A Shares without sales charge) underperformed the Russell 2000® Value Index (the “Index”) in the third quarter of 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the quarter, stock selection and sector allocation both detracted from relative return, with stock selection having a larger impact on relative underperformance for the period. Index returns were positive across each of the 11 major economic sectors and varied widely, with only six sectors outpacing the broader Russell 2000® Value Index. Communication Services was the top-performing sector, returning 32.42%. By contrast, Consumer Staples was the worst-performing sector for the quarter, posting a return of 4.77%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Specifically, for the portfolio, stock selection in Materials, Health Care, Financials, Consumer Discretionary, Industrials, Consumer Staples and Communication Services detracted from relative performance for the quarter. However, an overweight in Materials partially offset the unfavorable impact of selection in the sector. An underweight in Health Care and Communication Services (the top-performing sector) also detracted from relative return. Conversely, stock selection in Information Technology contributed to relative performance for the quarter. An underweight in Real Estate, as well as an overweight in Information Technology, also contributed to relative performance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top Contributors – Third Quarter</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Three of the top contributors in the quarter benefited from their association with the broader AI theme. Sandisk Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SNDK\" title=\"Sandisk Corporation\">SNDK</a>) recently spun out from Western Digital Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WDC\" title=\"Western Digital Corporation\">WDC</a>). SNDK became the only U.S.-listed pureplay NAND maker. The other key competitor is Kioxia in Japan. SNDK got caught up in the AI hype, and its share price reacted positively. It is important to highlight that share price appreciation was a function of a read-through from favorable industry data. Industry reports began to emerge highlighting supply shortages in the coming years, driven by strong demand for AI servers. Supply has tightened over the past few years, setting NAND up for strong demand and pricing amid constrained supply. We trimmed the position given the outsized move. Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSEM\" title=\"Tower Semiconductor Ltd.\">TSEM</a>) also got caught up in the AI hype. TSEM produces Silicon Photonics chips that are used in optical transceivers, which connect data center servers via optics rather than copper Ethernet. TSEM works with all the top non-China optical transceiver module manufacturers. Many of its peers had exited the Silicon Photonics channel, leaving TSEM as a key supplier. Strong demand for optical networking, coupled with limited suppliers, has benefited TSEM. We trimmed the position following the strong performance. NCR Atleos Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NATL\" title=\"NCR Atleos Corporation\">NATL</a>), which produces self-service banking (ATMs) and Networks (ATM network) assets, was another top contributor. Since its spin-off, the company has reinvented itself to partner with key financial institutions and retail clients. The company’s core growth engine, ATM as a Service (ATMaaS), posted a robust growth rate of 32% YoY and management is anticipating achieving 40% in 2H25. The ATMaaS offering is a full suite of products including hardware, software, cash management and transaction processing supported by the largest ATM fleet globally. Management has also prioritized deleveraging, as evidenced by reduced net leverage to 3.1x from 3.8x, with a target of 2.5x. Our thesis for NATL remains unchanged. Mercury Systems, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRCY\" title=\"Mercury Systems, Inc.\">MRCY</a>) is a leading technology provider that provides mission-critical components, modules and subsystems mainly to defense prime contractors. MRCY reported better-than-expected results in 2Q25 due to operational improvements and good execution. Demand remains strong, with current bookings at $1.4 billion—the highest level ever. MRCY could be a beneficiary of the Golden Dome build-out given the company’s leverage to antiballistic systems; however, timing remains unclear. We have reduced our weight following strong relative performance. Our thesis for MRCY remains unchanged at this time. Everus Construction Group, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ECG\" title=\"Everus Construction Group, Inc.\">ECG</a>), a commercial and utilities construction company, rounded out the list of top contributors. The company reported a solid 2Q25 earnings report driven by strong data center construction demand. Year- over-year backlog grew 24% on the back of strong data center demand. We believe ECG should continue to benefit from the build-out of data centers as well as other large construction projects. Shares were trimmed on relative valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top Detractors – Third Quarter</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Haemonetics Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAE\" title=\"Haemonetics Corporation\">HAE</a>), a medical technology company specializing in plasma, blood, and hospital-based automation systems, was the top detractor for the quarter. Shares declined as operational issues in the Interventional Technologies business (about 20% of sales) surfaced, driving weakness in the Hospital segment and reducing visibility into sales and earnings improvements. Confidence in management’s diversification strategy was under scrutiny after $1 billion of acquisitions over the last few years have failed to pay off. The thesis for HAE is under review. Interparfums, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IPAR\" title=\"Interparfums, Inc.\">IPAR</a>), a global manufacturer and marketer of fragrance products, was negatively impacted by uneven demand in Europe and retailer destocking in the U.S., which resulted in a top-line miss during the second quarter. Furthermore, IPAR is facing tariffs on the finished products and components it ships into the U.S. The company is addressing this challenge through supply chain modifications and selective pricing action. Despite these factors, IPAR reiterated its FY25 guidance. While management is historically viewed as providing conservative expectations for investors, the company noted lower visibility in this challenging environment. IPAR remains a disciplined operator with new launches and brand license additions that position it to benefit once macro and trade headwinds ease. As we do with all holdings, the thesis for IPAR is under review. Silgan Holdings, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SLGN\" title=\"Silgan Holdings Inc.\">SLGN</a>), a manufacturer of packaging solutions for consumer goods products, was another detractor. SLGN reported 2Q25 earnings that missed consensus estimates. The earnings shortfall was driven by: 1) unfavorable weather which impacted the Beverage segment; and 2) customer bankruptcy (Del Monte Foods). We believe that the reaction to the 2Q print was overdone and we view the 2Q earnings hiccup as transitory. Our thesis for SLGN remains unchanged at this time. Shares of WillScot Holdings Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WSC\" title=\"WillScot Holdings Corporation\">WSC</a>), a leading provider of modular space and portable storage rentals, were under pressure during the quarter. WSC is a recent addition to the portfolio. We initiated a position in the company following a period of significant underperformance as deterioration in non-residential construction markets negatively impacted rental volumes. While the company has continued to see disappointing results this year, it could see green shoots in a lower interest rate environment, which we believe should set the stock up well given negative sentiment and historical trough valuation. Bowhead Specialty Holdings, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BOW\" title=\"Bowhead Specialty Holdings Inc.\">BOW</a>), a specialty Property and Casualty (P&amp;C) insurer, rounded out the list of top detractors. The company reported a strong 2Q25 with positive forward comments; however, decelerating pricing trends for the industry weighed on the peer group. Despite near-term underperformance, BOW remains well- capitalized, with disciplined execution and differentiated premium growth. We trimmed the position on strong relative outperformance earlier and view the recent pullback as an opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618445293419316_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"739\" data-height=\"459\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618445293419316_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Small caps have outperformed large caps\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"398\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618445293419316_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618445293419316_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618445293419316_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618445293419316_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618445293419316_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618445293419316_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618445293419316_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618445293419316_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Market Overview</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Headwinds Mount With No End in Sight</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The third quarter was a continuation of the risk-on sentiment that has gripped the market since the April lows. The AI trade continued unabated. MEME stocks are back in vogue. Retail participation is at all-time highs. Trade baskets are ubiquitous—allowing market participants to trade any theme they fancy. Market concentration remains elevated, with a handful of themes (and associated stocks) driving the narrative. FOMO is pervasive, and missing out is not an option. Simply put, the market is more emotionally charged and less fundamentally driven. That’s the landscape that investors have had to navigate, and the results for active managers have not been favorable. The pervasiveness of the themes (e.g., AI, crypto, quantum computing, gold, etc.) dominating the market have created stiff headwinds for fundamental managers that have been difficult to overcome. The current market backdrop has become a story of the “haves” and “have nots.” Either a company is exposed to the prevailing market themes, or it is not. Price action has generally reflected this dynamic by rewarding companies that are exposed and neglecting ones that are not.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We’ve had numerous conversations with clients over the past several quarters, and many are equally puzzled by the current market backdrop. Top of mind for clients was a combination of topics, including underperformance, the market dynamics causing these stylistic headwinds, and the topic of AI. We will touch on some of these items below.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stylistic Headwinds Reflective of the Risk-On Sentiment</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There was an abundance of investor confidence heading into 2025. The S&amp;P 500® Index had posted back-to-back years of 20%+ returns, and the outlook for risk assets was promising. Then uncertainty plagued the market shortly after the presidential inauguration as a frenzy of policies out of Washington spooked investors. The subsequent sell-off lasted several weeks but eventually bottomed in early April.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since then, animal spirits have unleashed an impressive wave of risk-on sentiment that propelled equities higher. The S&amp;P 500® Index and the Nasdaq Composite hit multiple record highs during the third quarter. Even the beleaguered small-cap asset class has participated in the beta-induced rally. The Russell 2000® Index had its best quarter since 4Q23 and hit fresh all-time highs in September. It took the Russell 2000® Index over 970 days to surpass the prior all-time highs it reached in November 2021 (Illustration 1).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, the recent small-cap rally has been so pronounced that the Russell 2000® Index has outperformed the S&amp;P 500® Index since the April lows (Illustration 2), 39.3% versus 35.1%, respectively. As a dedicated small- and mid-cap value manager, small-caps’ outperformance is welcomed given that we have had to persevere through a long performance drought versus large-cap equities. However, the recent small-cap rally has been a double- edged sword.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The recent equity melt-up has been concentrated and low quality in nature, which has posed stiff headwinds for active managers. As Illustrations 3 and 4 highlight, the rally off the April lows has been dominated by risk factors. For example, the performance of stocks in the highest Beta quintile (Q1) for the Russell 2000® Value Index meaningfully outperformed (+77.4%) the quintile with the lowest Beta (Q5) stocks (+21.9%). The same conclusion can be observed for other factors such as Volatility, Short Interest and Profitability. Not only was this observed in the small-cap value universe, but also in the mid-cap value universe, as Illustration 4 shows. As a quality- biased fundamental manager, underexposure to some of these Risk factors has resulted in a notable performance drag.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also exacerbating the recent performance challenges has been the high concentration within the indices. Not only has this been observed in the S&amp;P 500® Index (Illustration 5), but this phenomenon has recently unfolded in the small-cap value and mid-cap value indices as well. As observed in Illustrations 6 and 7, the contribution of the top 50 stocks within these indices is high relative to history dating back to 1994. Not owning certain stocks that made up the top contributors within the indices has also been a performance headwind. The decision not to own some of these stocks varies. For some stocks—especially those linked to the AI trade—valuations are too lofty. For others, the balance sheet is less than ideal. Others, especially within the small-cap universe, do not meet our investment criteria. For example, 12 out of the top 25 contributors to the Russell 2000® Value Index during the third quarter were non-earners (Illustration 8).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In combination with the risk-on sentiment, Momentum continued to outperform as market participants’ preference for “what’s working” remains well cemented. Historically, Momentum regimes have generally faltered after an extended period. This one is getting long in the tooth, but there appears to be no end in sight given that investors continue to crowd into the major market themes. We did witness a Momentum unwind during the first quarter following the reveal of DeepSeek. However, that was short-lived. Illustrations 9 and 10 show year-to-date factor performance versus their long-term median since 2002 for the Russell Midcap® Value Index and Russell 2000® Value Index. Clearly, Risk and Momentum’s year-to-date performance has exceeded the long- term median. Quality and Value factors which have typically outperformed over the long term have lagged year-to-date. Furthermore, Illustration 11 highlights the divergence that has unfolded between momentum and fundamental stability within the broader S&amp;P 500® Index. This is reflective of a market that is less interested in fundamentals and valuation and more focused on broader themes. Being underweight to the Momentum and Beta factors has been penalizing. These observations highlight the challenges facing our bottom-up fundamental process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Illustration 3: Performance of Key Factors During Three Market Regimes in the Russell 2000® Value Index</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>Regime 1: Leading to Inauguration Day (1/1 – 1/17)</p></td> <td><p>Regime 2: Post-Inauguration to April Lows (1/21 – 4/8)</p></td> <td><p>Regime 3: Rebound off April Lows (4/9 – 9/30)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Beta Q1 (Highest)</p></td> <td><p>2.5%</p></td> <td><p>-32.3%</p></td> <td><p>77.4%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Beta Q5 (Lowest)</p></td> <td><p>0.3%</p></td> <td><p>-9.7%</p></td> <td><p>21.9%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Earners (Profitable)</p></td> <td><p>2.2%</p></td> <td><p>-18.6%</p></td> <td><p>28.2%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Non-Earners (Loss-Making)</p></td> <td><p>0.0%</p></td> <td><p>-27.7%</p></td> <td><p>62.3%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Short Interest Q1 (Highest)</p></td> <td><p>1.4%</p></td> <td><p>-31.2%</p></td> <td><p>72.6%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Short Interest Q5 (Lowest)</p></td> <td><p>1.0%</p></td> <td><p>-14.0%</p></td> <td><p>17.9%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Volatility Q1 (Highest)</p></td> <td><p>1.7%</p></td> <td><p>-28.2%</p></td> <td><p>125.4%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Volatility Q5 (Lowest)</p></td> <td><p>1.1%</p></td> <td><p>-14.1%</p></td> <td><p>15.3%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Source: FactSet.

Today, we find ourselves in a predicament. Our bottom-up fundamental approach that is centered on the risk/reward merits of individual securities is out of favor. Market participants have been eager to reward companies linked to the key prevailing themes in the market irrespective of fundamentals or valuations. Some of our holdings in the portfolio have benefited from their association with these themes; however, their valuation has forced us to de-risk the positions. In other words, selling Momentum as a result of our valuation-centric approach has adversely impacted relative performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Take Fabrinet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FN\" title=\"Fabrinet\">FN</a>), for example. FN is a leading global electronic manufacturing services (EMS) company focused on the optical communications market. We first initiated a position in FN in September 2020. The original investment thesis was based on the company’s leading market position in the optical networking market. We believed FN was well-positioned to benefit from the increase in demand for bandwidth and infrastructure build-out for 5G networks. Throughout our holding period, FN consistently met or beat expectations. In 2023, the company secured a large project with NVDA for its data center operations. As Illustration 12 highlights, shares have re-rated meaningfully higher and have continued to appreciate even after our sale.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Many of our clients have asked whether we can tweak the process to allow us to hold onto the winners longer. That is a valid question. However, if we chose to hold onto winners longer, how would we define our sell discipline? A key reason for the success we’ve had in delivering compelling risk-adjusted returns over the long run is centered on a well-defined sell discipline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Illustration 13 highlights the valuation framework for FN at the time of initiation and at the time of sale. At the time of initiation, FN was trading at a discount to its long-term average on multiple valuation metrics. Given that it is now widely acknowledged that FN is linked to the AI ecosystem, with Nvidia one of its largest clients, shares have re-rated meaningfully higher. Due to the elevated valuation, shares were divested.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In hindsight, an argument can be made that it was a poorly timed sale. Going back to the question of whether we can hold our winners (momentum stocks) longer—if we had held on to stocks like FN in the portfolio, could we even consider ourselves a value manager, given the elevated valuations?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The AI theme has been such a potent force in the market that it’s buoying the valuations of exposed companies higher, making it difficult for disciplined value managers to own some of these stocks. Unfortunately, not owning companies with AI exposure has adversely impacted performance. Fundamental value managers are caught between a rock and a hard place. Managers must decide whether to deviate from their process or remain committed and risk sacrificing performance. That’s the predicament that fundamental value investors have to grapple with in a market overwhelmed by broad themes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618447674556062_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"745\" data-height=\"236\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618447674556062_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"2025 factor returns vs. median since 2002 in Russell Midcap Value Index\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"203\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618447674556062_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618447674556062_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618447674556062_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618447674556062_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618447674556062_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618447674556062_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618447674556062_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618447674556062_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

However, when the market becomes one-dimensional and singularly focused, underlying risks can be underappreciated. The AI theme is so pervasive that it currently dominates every aspect of the market and the economy. Investors are plowing an unprecedented amount of capital into a potentially transformative technology that (as of now) has no proven path to profitability. But that does not seem to matter; the stampede to have a role in the AI ecosystem remains unabated. For the key players, missing out on the technology of the future is not an option. Therefore, a copious amount of capital is being pledged to help build out the infrastructure needed to satisfy the demand. And the web of capital chasing the AI narrative is becoming increasingly intertwined.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We cannot refute the potential benefits of AI and the role it will play in society in the future. However, a lot hinges on AI being able to deliver on its promises. Today, despite the euphoric response to this technology, many questions remain unanswered. For the most part, the market does not seem to be bothered by the unchecked spending bonanza. The lack of concern for the elusive return on investment is puzzling. A level of complacency has settled into the market where many investors are focused only on the upside while few are evaluating what could go wrong with the current narrative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s touch on a couple of interesting thoughts from some of AI’s Heads of State. On an episode of the “Access” podcast, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg had the following to say:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>“If we end up misspending a couple of hundred billion dollars, I think that that is going to be very unfortunate, obviously But what I’d</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>say is I actually think the risk is higher on the other side.”</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At a recent press conference, OpenAI’s Sam Altman alluded to “profitability” not being a top concern for the company’s leadership team, saying the following:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>“[Profitability is]........ not in my top 10 concerns, but we obviously</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>someday have to be very profitable.”</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here’s some additional food for thought on sell-side analyst ratings based on FactSet data as of October 11, 2025:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>AMZN: 96% of sell-side analysts have a “Buy” rating with no “Sell” ratings (72 analysts covering)</li> <li>GOOG: 82% of sell-side analysts have a “Buy” rating with no “Sell” ratings (74 analysts covering)</li> <li>META: 87% of sell-side analysts have a “Buy” rating with one “Sell” rating (71 analysts covering)</li> <li>NVDA: 89% of sell-side analysts have a “Buy” rating with one “Sell rating” (66 analysts covering)</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It has been our experience that when management teams don’t practice capital discipline, they are penalized by the investment community. It is somewhat bewildering how that is being dismissed today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Where is the healthy dose of skepticism that we would expect from Wall Street analysts? That’s the issue; there is essentially none. Groupthink has become an emblematic (and unfortunate) part of this market. Prudent investors should assess the downside risks especially when the consensus is so lopsided. While trying to call a market top is problematic, we will offer some observations below and leave it up to our readers to draw their own conclusions of whether or not we are in a bubble.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">If Comparing to the Dot-Com Era, There’s Room to Run</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The AI frenzy is often likened to the Tech Bubble of the 1990s; therefore, that period is typically used as a barometer to determine whether the AI- fueled market rally has room to run. As can be observed in Illustration 14, the Nasdaq Composite is following a similar path to the one taken during the 1990s. However, when the MAG-7 stocks are evaluated on their own, they are diverging higher at a quicker pace. Interestingly, the Nasdaq’s rise during the 1990s was not a smooth one. In fact, there were eight corrections of 10% or more before the index eventually peaked in 2000 (Illustration 15). In other words, the origin of the dot-com era bubble was not a linear one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448757744114_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"744\" data-height=\"239\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448757744114_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Tech performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"206\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448757744114_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448757744114_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448757744114_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448757744114_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448757744114_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448757744114_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448757744114_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448757744114_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448904172337_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"767\" data-height=\"433\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448904172337_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Declines in Nasdaq composite\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"361\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448904172337_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448904172337_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448904172337_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448904172337_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448904172337_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448904172337_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448904172337_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448904172337_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By contrast, during the current AI-fueled melt-up, there have been four such corrections since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even when comparing Nvidia to Cisco in the 1990s, Nvidia’s meteoric rise may not be over. As Illustration 16 highlights, Nvidia was trading at 27.7x price/sales at the end of the third quarter. Cisco peaked at 39.0x price/sales in 2000.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">An argument can be made that there is still some upside potential for the latest rally given that valuations have not reached the frothiness of the 1990s. As former Citi CEO Chuck Prince famously said in 2007, “…as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing.” There’s an unprecedented spending spree flowing into the AI ecosystem. As long as the spending bonanza continues, another leg up for equities is not out of the question.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI CapEx Is Unprecedented, but Is It Sustainable?</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OpenAI, the most valuable start-up in the world, has pledged $1 trillion in spending to build out the infrastructure needed to support its models. The scale of investment in AI infrastructure is unprecedented and is reminiscent of the dot-com investment craze in the 1990s. A September 24, 2025 Eye on the Market note from J.P. Morgan highlighted the impact that the AI-exposed stocks have had on the S&amp;P 500® Index. Per the note, AI-exposed stocks have accounted for 75% of the index returns, 80% of earnings growth and 90% of capital spending since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. At the end of the third quarter, the MAG-7 CapEx explained approximately 30% of total CapEx for the S&amp;P 500® Index (Illustration 17).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The meaningful jump in year-over-year (YoY) CapEx spend from 2023 to 2025 has helped fuel the rally in AI-exposed stocks (Illustration 18). U.S. hyperscaler CapEx growth jumped by 79% from 2023 to 2024. By some estimates, CapEx growth will peak in 2025 and fall sharply in 2026 and beyond. While CapEx growth will not go to zero, 2026 estimates call for 17% growth while 2027 estimates fall to 7%. The question is whether the market is prepared to digest a decline in the CapEx growth rate given that it’s been the central tenet to the market rally.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Is the Market Prepared for a Another “Bad” Data Point?</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recall what happened in January when a wrench was thrown into the AI narrative in the form of DeepSeek. As Illustration 19 highlights, stocks linked to the AI theme rapidly sold off after DeepSeek’s reveal. Trillions in market cap was erased from the U.S. equity market in a short time. While the sell- off was short-lived, it highlighted the fragility of the narrative given that few are thinking about what could go wrong. Therefore, when future hyperscaler CapEx growth figures begin to pale in comparison to the past two years, what sort of reaction will we get from the market?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuations for AI-exposed stocks are mostly pricing in positive news with little wiggle room for any disappointments. Illustration 20 shows how quickly the S&amp;P 500® Index de-rated following the release of DeepSeek. The question is what sort of response will we get from the market when/if future data points disappoint or AI fails to deliver on its Herculean promise?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618449404018123_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"736\" data-height=\"236\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618449404018123_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Rise of Cisco Systems\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"205\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618449404018123_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618449404018123_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618449404018123_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618449404018123_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618449404018123_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618449404018123_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618449404018123_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618449404018123_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

Aside from Nvidia, the FCF growth profile of the other MAG-7 stocks has deteriorated (Illustration 21). After all, the defining feature of “big tech” companies has been their unmatched free cash flow generation. As the hyperscalers jockey for a seat at the table in the AI arms race, their business models are being transformed from “asset light” to capital-intensive ones.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a recent research note, Empirical Research Partners made an interesting observation relating to CapEx worth sharing. Based on their findings, since the 1950s, stocks in the highest quintile of YoY CapEx growth have underperformed the market thereafter (Illustration 22). So far, the hyperscalers have bucked that trend during this cycle. We suspect that this is partly due to the significant FCF profile of these megacap tech companies. Hence, the spending spree can continue longer than in prior CapEx cycles before there’s any possible impact on their share price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regardless, history is littered with examples of how overzealous CapEx spending booms can end badly. Whether it was the railroads in the late- 1880s, the British Bicycle bubble in the 1890s, or the telecom and internet bubble in the 1990s, too much funding chasing a new innovation can result in a glut and misallocation of capital. AI profitability remains elusive, but that has not deterred massive investment. It remains to be seen whether this CapEx cycle will prove to be different from prior ones when too much capacity was brought online too fast and demand failed to keep up with the frantic pace of spending.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618450723474953.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MAG-7 YoverY FCF growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"372\" height=\"232\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618450723474953.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618450723474953.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618450723474953.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618450723474953.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618450723474953.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618450723474953.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618450723474953.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618450723474953.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

It seems that not a day goes by without some headlines describing how suppliers are funding customers, revenue is shared between customer and vendor, and off-balance-sheet partnerships are being forged. In a recent client note, Morgan Stanley provided a descriptive (but hard to follow) diagram of the convoluted nature of this dynamic (Illustration 23).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These close-knit arrangements put investors in a dilemma. It becomes increasingly more difficult to evaluate the underlying opportunities and risks as these arrangements become more complex, as they are concentrated among a few players and lack transparency. This could (if it has not already) result in information asymmetry, which puts investors at a disadvantage. Essentially, it forces investors to take management at their word. As bottom-up fundamental investors, we spend a considerable amount of time evaluating management teams. Over the years, it’s become evident that not all management teams have a favorable track record of being good stewards of capital. Without adequate disclosures, a system of checks and balances becomes elusive and identifying risks becomes very challenging.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Complacency Reminiscent of 2021</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The latest price action across U.S. equities is reminiscent of what we observed during the COVID pandemic. We detect a similar type of complacency—an attitude that the market will just continue to appreciate. Human psychology makes it very difficult to sit on the sidelines while animal spirits are on display. FOMO and trend-following are ubiquitous. If there’s any doubt, one only needs to look at the parabolic moves in some of the popular trading vehicles to grasp the current market environment. For example, just look at the performance divergence between some of the popular baskets and the S&amp;P 500® Index (Illustration 24). Or perhaps the performance divergence between the S&amp;P 500® Index and a popular ETF that tracks high-growth companies with positive social media sentiment (Illustration 25).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Clients often ask about the root cause of this phenomenon. It’s hard to pinpoint one thing. Some of it can be chalked up to the rise in retail investor participation. Take for example some interesting data from the Morgan Stanley Quantitative and Derivative Strategies team. In the month of September alone, retail investors bought over $100 billion of U.S. equities based on public data, which represented the largest one-month buying spree on record. Retail investor buying is on pace to hit $800 billion by year- end. Close to 30% of daily intraday trading volume is now explained by retail investors, which is the percentage reached in 2021 during the “meme” stock craze. As Illustration 26 highlights, U.S. households’ exposure to equities reached an all-time high this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We also suspect that the absence of a boom-bust cycle (e.g., Tech Bubble and GFC), which typically resets the narrative, is partly to blame. Market participants have become conditioned to anticipate accommodative policies at any signs of economic weakness. If expectations are that regulators will jump to the rescue, then what is there to lose? The Fed’s capitulation and the AI-induced spending binge have reignited the animal spirits driving the latest risk-on sentiment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451569752924.png?io=w640\" alt=\"1 year performance of S&amp;P 500 index vs. VanEck social sentiment ETF\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"371\" height=\"293\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451569752924.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451569752924.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451569752924.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451569752924.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451569752924.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451569752924.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451569752924.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451569752924.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451711937206.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Household &amp; nonprofit organizations\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"381\" height=\"297\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451711937206.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451711937206.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451711937206.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451711937206.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451711937206.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451711937206.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451711937206.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451711937206.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Concluding Remarks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The past two years have been a very challenging period for our team. After much self-reflection, we’ve realized that a mosaic of factors has driven the recent underperformance. Some of those have been self-inflicted wounds. We are addressing those that are generally under our control. Other factors are out of our control and are a result of market forces at play that have called into question whether a bottom-up fundamental value investment approach is viable anymore. A market that is one-dimensional and singularly focused is at odds with our investment approach, which is centered on building a diversified portfolio and being contrarian. Managers today have to decide whether to stick to their time-tested process or choose to bend the rules in an effort to limit the performance drag. We believe that overhauling our process in order to offset some of the market headwinds is a dangerous proposition. We are not certain when the market will broaden out or when market participants will pay attention to valuations. We suspect that as long as the AI-linked CapEx spending spree goes unchecked, it’s tough to imagine this trend reversing. If there is a silver lining for us, it’s that “trees don’t grow to the sky.” The band between the “haves” and “have nots” is going to get stretched to a point where something must break.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Going back to the question of whether we are in a bubble. Each cycle is different; however, they often rhyme. In conclusion, we thought that we would turn to a 2017 memo authored by Howard Marks to clients. In the memo, Mr. Marks lists several attributes that he believes form the foundation of a bull market, boom or bubble. Mr. Marks titled this section of his memo “The Seeds for a Boom.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, we’ll leave it to our readers to determine whether the current market narrative is captured by any of Mr. Marks’ observations:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>A benign environment – good results lull investors into complacency, as they get used to having their positive expectations rewarded.</li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gains in the recent past encourage the heated pursuit of further gains in the future (rather than suggest that past gains might have borrowed from future gains).</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>A grain of truth – the story supporting a boom isn’t created out of whole cloth; it generally coalesces around something real. The seed usually isn’t imaginary, just eventually overblown.</li> <li>Early success – the gains enjoyed by the “wise man in the beginning” – the first to seize upon the grain of truth – tends to attract “the fool in the end” who jumps in too late.</li> <li>More money than ideas – when capital is in oversupply, it is inevitable that risk aversion dries up, gullibility expands, and investment standards are relaxed.</li> <li>Willing suspension of disbelief – the quest for gain overcomes prudence and deference to history. Everyone concludes “this time it’s different.” No story is too good to be true.</li> <li>Rejection of valuation norms – all we hear is, “the asset is so great: there’s no price too high.” Buying into a fad regardless of price is the absolute hallmark of a bubble.</li> <li>The pursuit of the new – old timers fare worst in a boom, with the gains going disproportionately to those who are untrammeled by knowledge of the past and thus able to buy into an entirely new future.</li> <li>The virtuous circle – no one can see any end to the potential of the underlying truth or how high it can push the prices of related assets. It’s broadly accepted that trees can grow to the sky: “It can only go up. Nothing can stop it.” Certainly no one can picture things taking a turn for the worse.</li> <li>Fear of missing out – when all the above becomes widespread, optimism prevails and no one can imagine a glitch. That causes most people to conclude that the greatest potential error lies in failing to participate in the current market darling.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>On behalf of the Sycamore Capital team, we thank our clients for their long-term partnership and support.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>We are grateful for the trust you have placed in our Team to manage your assets.</em></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Top Contributors (%)</strong></p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Sandisk Corp.</p></td> <td><p>1.4</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Tower Semiconductor Ltd.</p></td> <td><p>0.7</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>NCR Atleos Corp.</p></td> <td><p>0.4</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Mercury Systems, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>0.4</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Everus Construction Group, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>0.3</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Top Detractors (%)</strong></p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Haemonetics Corp.</p></td> <td><p>-0.3</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Interparfums, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>-0.3</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Silgan Holdings, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>-0.2</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>WillScot Holdings Corp.</p></td> <td><p>-0.2</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Bowhead Specialty Holdings, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>-0.2</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><em>Source: FactSet.</em></p></td> <td> </td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Top Holdings (%)</strong></p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>United Bankshares, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>1.5</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Old National Bancorp</p></td> <td><p>1.5</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Renasant Corp.</p></td> <td><p>1.5</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>IDACORP, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>1.4</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>McGrath RentCorp</p></td> <td><p>1.4</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>UMB Financial Corp.</p></td> <td><p>1.4</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Tower Semiconductor Ltd.</p></td> <td><p>1.4</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>NCR Atleos Corp.</p></td> <td><p>1.4</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>MSC Industrial Direct Company, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>1.3</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>SouthState Bank Corp.</p></td> <td><p>1.3</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td><p><strong>Annualized </strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Returns</strong></p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td colspan=\"2\"> </td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan=\"2\"><p><strong>Investment Performance (%)</strong></p></td> <td rowspan=\"2\"><p><strong>QTR</strong></p></td> <td rowspan=\"2\"><p><strong>YTD</strong></p></td> <td rowspan=\"2\"><p><strong>1-YR</strong></p></td> <td rowspan=\"2\"> </td> <td rowspan=\"2\"><p><strong>3-</strong><strong>YR</strong></p></td> <td rowspan=\"2\"><p><strong>5-YR</strong></p></td> <td rowspan=\"2\"><p><strong>10-YR</strong></p></td> <td rowspan=\"2\"><p><strong>Since Inception*</strong></p></td> <td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>Expense Ratio</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Gross</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Net</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>A-Shares (without sales charge)</p></td> <td><p>6.98</p></td> <td><p>0.69</p></td> <td><p>1.32</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>9.71</p></td> <td><p>11.95</p></td> <td><p>9.40</p></td> <td><p>9.53</p></td> <td><p>1.26</p></td> <td><p>1.26</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>A-Shares (with max. sales charge 5.75%)</p></td> <td><p>0.82</p></td> <td><p>-5.10</p></td> <td><p>-4.50</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>7.57</p></td> <td><p>10.63</p></td> <td><p>8.76</p></td> <td><p>9.28</p></td> <td><p>1.26</p></td> <td><p>1.26</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Russell 2000® Value Index</p></td> <td><p>12.60</p></td> <td><p>9.04</p></td> <td><p>7.89</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>13.56</p></td> <td><p>14.59</p></td> <td><p>9.23</p></td> <td><p>—</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan=\"3\"> <p><em>Source: Citi.

Large shareholders, including other funds advised by the Adviser, may own a substantial amount of the Fund’s shares. The actions of large shareholders, including large inflows or outflows, may adversely affect other shareholders, including potentially increasing capital gains.
