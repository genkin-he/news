Being humble about your mistakes is how you learn and grow. A great<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> example of this involving myself relates to my </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4499516-cal-maine-foods-stock-showing-promise-shares-look-overpriced\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">decision</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">, back in April of 2022, to rate </span><strong class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cal-Maine Foods</strong><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> (</span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CALM\" title=\"Cal-Maine Foods, Inc.\">CALM</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) a 'sell.' Leading up to that point, declining sales, profits, and cash flows, had dominated the financial narrative. Admittedly, the company was low risk because of its strong balance sheet. But the stock looked drastically overpriced. I underestimated, quite frankly, just what would happen in the egg market that the company operates in. I did not foresee prices skyrocketing because of industry supply constraints. That ultimately pushed revenue, profits, and cash flows, drastically higher. And as a result, the company's stock price has risen 81.9% at a time when the S&amp;P 500 is up only 50.2%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was one of the biggest misses that I have had in the last couple of years. Looking at the picture today, I see a company that is continuing to benefit from elevated prices. But make no mistake that these price increases are likely temporary. Data from the USDA suggests that prices will drop throughout 2026. And in fact, for the 2026 fiscal year for the company, we have already seen a deleterious impact on the bottom line as a result. Having said that, the stock is incredibly cheap right now. And its balance sheet is remarkably robust. I wouldn't go so far as to upgrade the stock to a 'buy' because of worries over declining prices. But I do think that rating it a very solid 'hold' makes sense here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The picture is better than I thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some companies in the food industry are incredibly diverse from an <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/16160/000156276225000170/calm2025053110K.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">operational standpoint</a>. And others, such as Cal-Maine Foods, are much more concentrated. The company prides itself on being the largest producer and distributor of shell eggs in the US. Its operations consist of hatching chicks, growing and maintaining flocks of pullets, dealing with layers and breeders, producing feed, and ultimately producing and distributing eggs. The company is massive in this industry. According to management, the fleet as of the end of the most recent quarter consisted of 11.4 million pullets and breeders, as well as 49.3 million layers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892558618522_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2258\" data-height=\"868\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892558618522_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"246\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"246\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892558618522_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892558618522_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892558618522_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892558618522_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author - SEC EDGAR Data</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the last few years, financial performance for the business has been admittedly mixed. In the chart above, you can see financial results for the 2023 through 2025 fiscal years. Revenue has certainly been lumpy. And profits and cash flows have responded in kind. What matters most, however, is that in 2025, the company achieved significant revenue that far exceeded what it had achieved in prior fiscal years. In the chart below, you can see results for the first half of the 2026 fiscal year compared to the same time of 2025. In this case, revenue, profits, and most cash flow metrics, pulled back.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289303015264_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2168\" data-height=\"874\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289303015264_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"258\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"258\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289303015264_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289303015264_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289303015264_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289303015264_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author - SEC EDGAR Data</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These results have changed a lot, based primarily on changes in egg prices. You see, the vast majority of the company's revenue, approximately 85% for the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/16160/000156276226000004/calm-20251129.htm#a6234\" rel=\"nofollow\">first half of 2026</a>, came specifically from the sale of shell eggs. Normally when you see rapid revenue growth like what was experienced over the last couple of years, it's because of continued investments aimed at boosting output. Yes, the company has achieved some expansion on that front. From 2023 through 2025, the firm went from selling 1.15 billion dozens of eggs to selling 1.28 billion dozens of eggs. And for the first half of 2026, the 640.2 million dozens of eggs produced by the company exceeded the 639.8 million dozen reported the previous year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289347815117_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2026\" data-height=\"884\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289347815117_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"279\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"279\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289347815117_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289347815117_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289347815117_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289347815117_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author - SEC EDGAR Data</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bigger expansion for the company came from a hike in average prices for shell eggs. Back in 2023, prices averaged $2.62 per dozen. That dropped to $1.93 in 2024 before surging to $3.13 last year. Unfortunately, an outbreak of bird flu drastically slashed supplies of layers in the space. According to one source, since 2022, tens of millions of commercial egg layers have been impacted. This naturally caused a decline in overall supply, while demand remained robust. After all, eggs still remain a major source of protein at an affordable price. So when alternative options are still more expensive, demand remains resilient. We have started to see prices decline. In the first half of the 2026 fiscal year, they dropped to $2.25 per dozen. That's down from the $2.57 per dozen reported a year earlier.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company also continues to benefit from expansion elsewhere. Even though the production and sale of shell eggs represents the main source of revenue growth for the company, it is investing heavily into the egg products and prepared foods markets. Examples here include hard-cooked eggs, egg wraps, protein pancakes, crepes, and wrap-ups. In that vein, in September of 2024, the company made an investment in Crepini LLC, essentially establishing a new egg products and prepared foods joint venture. And in the 2025 fiscal year, the business acquired Echo Lake Foods in a deal valued at $258 million. That business, based out of Wisconsin, produces, packages, markets, and distributes, prepared foods such as waffles, pancakes, scrambled eggs, frozen cooked omelets, egg patties, toast, and diced eggs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892730805206_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2050\" data-height=\"866\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892730805206_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"270\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"270\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892730805206_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892730805206_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892730805206_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892730805206_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author - SEC EDGAR Data</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These activities have helped to boost revenue for the prepared foods and egg products spaces as of late. Prior to the 2026 fiscal year, management never broke out these two separate categories. In the chart above, you can see expansion in revenue for them combined over the last two fiscal years. And in the chart below, you can see revenue figures for them when it comes to the first half of 2026 compared to the first half of 2025. Although this is great to see, it's not going to represent the largest portion of the company and its health. A lot will still depend on shell egg production and prices associated with them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892839201732_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1980\" data-height=\"876\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892839201732_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"283\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"283\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892839201732_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892839201732_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892839201732_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892839201732_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author - SEC EDGAR Data</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we project out results for the company based on what was seen in the first half of 2026, we would expect net profits for the fiscal year to be around $998.8 million. Adjusted operating cash flow would be $1.25 billion, while EBITDA would amount to $1.38 billion. Using these estimates, and also the results that the company achieved for the 2025 fiscal year, we can see in the chart below how the stock is priced at the moment. Honestly, these are incredibly low multiples. And compared to other companies that are in the food space, which the chart below illustrates, the stock is definitely the cheapest of the group. Add on top of this the fact that it has a net cash position of $1.14 billion compared to a market capitalization of only $3.96 billion, and we are looking at an incredibly healthy company trading on the cheap.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289327995313_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2042\" data-height=\"878\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289327995313_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"275\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"275\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289327995313_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289327995313_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289327995313_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289327995313_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author - SEC EDGAR Data</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Normally in cases like this, I would be incredibly bullish.

Of course, even if profits and cash flows are cut by half, we are still looking at a company that is attractively priced. But because of the uncertainty that exists here, I think a more cautious approach to valuing the company is warranted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712893621353004_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2544\" data-height=\"1416\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712893621353004_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"356\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"356\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712893621353004_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712893621353004_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712893621353004_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712893621353004_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cal-Maine Foods</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One thing that will work in the company's favor as time goes on is that management continues to make <a href=\"https://irp.cdn-website.com/79e86203/files/uploaded/CALM+FY26Q2+-+Earnings+Call+Presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">investments</a> in transforming the operation. I already talked about its move into the egg products and prepared foods space. But that's not all. Within the shell egg category, for instance, the company continues to transition away from conventional eggs and towards specialty ones. In the second quarter of 2026, 44% of shell egg sales were specialty eggs. That's up from 32% a year earlier. This is important because, in addition to experiencing higher demand, specialty eggs also demand higher prices. Take the second quarter of the 2026 fiscal year as an example. During that quarter, conventional shell egg prices averaged $1.80 per dozen. That was down drastically from the $2.94 per dozen reported the previous year. But year over year, specialty egg prices dropped only slightly from $2.39 per dozen to $2.37 per dozen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management is making organic investments into the prepared foods side of the business also. In fact, the company recently launched a $15 million network optimization and capacity expansion project aimed at adding 17 million pounds annually of scrambled eggs production by the middle of the 2027 fiscal year. And on top of this, it's also investing $14.8 million into its high-speed pancake line. If everything goes according to plan, this should boost capacity for that product line by 12 million pounds through early fiscal 2027. When you add on top of this the fact that the aforementioned joint venture, Crepini Foods, will see the company invest $7 million through the 2028 fiscal year to add 18 million pounds of capacity, we are looking at significant capacity growth over the next couple of years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712894007856417_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2554\" data-height=\"1426\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712894007856417_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"357\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"357\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712894007856417_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712894007856417_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712894007856417_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712894007856417_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cal-Maine Foods</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management also continues to focus on returning capital to shareholders. In fact, the company is currently paying out about a third of all net profits to the investor base in the form of dividends. The company also has a $500 million share buyback program in place. And in the first half of the 2026 fiscal year, the company bought back 846,037 shares in exchange for $74.8 million. That leaves $375.2 million remaining under its buyback initiative.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on all the data provided, I must say that I am definitely intrigued by Cal-Maine Foods right now. The company is certainly a high-quality business with very little in the way of solvency or liquidity risk. In fact, it is remarkably stable. I like seeing the investments being made by management. Diversifying away from conventional eggs is certainly a wise idea, especially considering their commoditized nature and volatility. Because of how cheap the stock is, it's difficult not to be bullish. But I do think that, based on the picture and its totality, the company deserves a very solid 'hold' rating. It would be higher if not for worries over declining egg prices. But for now, a more cautious approach is justified.</p>",

However, the S&amp;P500 did cross the SPX7000 level briefly in January, but it has not done so in any meaningful<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> way. There have been so many developments in the last month or so, ranging from cooling inflation, the Fed holding interest rates steady, the tariff situation in light of the Supreme Court order, and the evolving geopolitical situation around Iran. On top of that, the AI overvaluations and overborrowing have gripped the markets for some time. Also, fear of the AI impacts on software stocks has resulted in brutal revaluations and may be overdone. The outperformance of the foreign markets (over the U.S. market) and rotation of big money from technology to industrial, materials, energy, and utility sectors is continuing.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The further progress and direction of the market may also depend on the actions of the Fed. You can see the current odds of the Fed's next rate cut here on the <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\" target=\"_blank\">CME FedWatchTool</a> website.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All that being said, it is always hard to find anything that has both the quality and the low valuation, so buying the best of the income investments regularly in small quantities is the key. As always, investors have to tread carefully amid all the uncertainties.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Why CEFs?</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The broader market, as represented by the S&amp;P500, provides a dismal level of yield of less than 1.10%. Income investors and retirees can't survive on that level of income unless they have a very large pool of capital. Also, the method of raising income by selling shares is generally very stressful and full of pitfalls, and that's why it is not recommended. Alternatively, one can find solid blue-chip individual dividend stocks that pay much higher dividends than the S&amp;P 500. They can also provide market-matching growth on a longer-term basis. To identify such stocks, we also publish a monthly article on the '5 Best DGI stocks'. You can find the most recent one <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4792303-5-relatively-secure-and-cheap-dividend-stocks-yields-up-to-10-percent-june-2025\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4792303-5-relatively-secure-and-cheap-dividend-stocks-yields-up-to-10-percent-june-2025\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, with CEFs, we can take the income to the next level. That said, they generally come with higher risks (discussed later), so we believe that an allocation of 20% to 30% to a diversified CEF portfolio should be good enough for most income investors. In summary, these investments should be used primarily for income, not growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We publish this monthly article on CEFs (Closed-end funds) to provide our readers with a select list of 10 CEFs that, as a group, provide wide diversification in terms of underlying assets, solid long-term performance at least on a relative basis, and are trading at decent valuations. Above all, the income goal for the group is to provide a yield of at least 8% or higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This month, as a group, the selected 10 best funds are offering an average distribution rate of 8.70% (as of 01/16/2026). Besides excellent distributions, these funds have had an excellent record over the long term and collectively returned 17.7%, 12.2%, and 13.3% (annualized) in the last three, five years, and 10 years, respectively. The average discount (to NAV) is attractive, at -7.5%. Since this is a monthly series, some selections may overlap from month to month.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Why Is It Important To Have A Diversified CEF Portfolio?</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We believe a well-diversified CEF portfolio should contain at least 10 CEFs, preferably from different <strong>asset classes</strong>. It's also advisable to build the portfolio over a period rather than invest in one lump sum. If you were to invest in one CEF every month for a year, you would have a well-diversified CEF portfolio by the year's end. What we provide here every month is a list of ten probable candidates for further research. A CEF portfolio can be an important component of the overall portfolio strategy. One should preferably have a DGI portfolio as the foundation, and the CEF portfolio could be used to boost the income level to the desired level. How much should one allocate to CEFs? Each investor needs to answer this question himself/herself based on their personal situation and factors like the size of the portfolio, income needs, risk appetite, or risk tolerance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Criteria to Shortlist:</strong></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p>Criteria</p></td> <td><p>Brings down the number of funds to...</p></td> <td><p>Reason for the Criteria</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Baseline expense &lt; 2.5% and Avg.

From here on, we apply our other criteria to narrow the list.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Note: All tables in this article have been created by the author (unless explicitly specified). Most of the data in this article is sourced from <a href=\"https://cefconnect.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://cefconnect.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cefconnect.com</a>, <a href=\"https://cefa.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://cefa.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cefa.com</a>, and <a href=\"https://morningstar.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://morningstar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Morningstar.com</a>.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Narrowing Down To 50 Funds:</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To narrow down the number of funds to a more manageable count, we will shortlist ten funds based on each of the following criteria. Thereafter, we will apply certain qualitative criteria to each fund and rank them to select the top five.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At this stage, we also eliminate certain funds with substantially negative NAV returns for both three-year and five-year periods.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Seven Broad Criteria:</strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Excess discount/premium (explained below).</li> <li>Distribution rate.</li> <li>Return on NAV, last three years (medium-term).</li> <li>Return on NAV, last five years (long term).</li> <li>Coverage ratio.</li> <li>Excess return over distributions.</li> <li>The total weight (calculated up to this point).</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Excess Discount/Premium</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We certainly like funds that are offering large discounts (not premiums) to their NAVs. But what's important is to look at the \"excess discount/premium\" and not the absolute value. We want to see the discount (or premium) relative to their past record, say, a 52-week average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Excess Discount/Premium = Current Discount/Premium (Minus) 52-Wk Avg. Discount/ Premium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>For more explanation of the excess discount and z-scores, please refer to our blog post (link provided at the beginning of the article).</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We sort our list (of approx. 250 funds) on the \"excess discount/premium\" in descending order. For this criterion, the lower the value, the better it is. So, we select the top 10 funds (with the most negative values) from this sorted list.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(All data as of 02/20/2026)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Table 1:</strong></p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475955414321_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1514\" data-height=\"384\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475955414321_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"T1\" width=\"640\" height=\"162\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475955414321_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475955414321_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475955414321_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475955414321_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>High Current Distribution Rate</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After all, most investors invest in CEF funds for their juicy distributions.

Earnings)</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The coverage ratio is derived by dividing the earnings per share by the distribution amount for a specific period. Please note that in some cases, the coverage ratio may be a bit inaccurate since the \"earnings per share\" may be three to six months old. But in most cases, it's fairly accurate. Furthermore, the coverage ratio is not critical for pure equity funds as they generate very little dividend income, and they cover most of their distributions from capital gains. However, we sorted our list by coverage ratio and selected the top 10 funds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Table 5:</strong></p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475956237562_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1514\" data-height=\"384\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475956237562_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"T5\" width=\"640\" height=\"162\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475956237562_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475956237562_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475956237562_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475956237562_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Excess Return Over Distribution</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If a fund provides a very high distribution but low returns over 3, 5, or 10-year periods, it does not help the long-term interests of the investor. In simple terms, the fund is just overpaying the distributions and hurting the NAV in the long term. That is why we calculate a factor we like to call \"excess return.\" This excess return is what is provided by the fund over and above the distribution rate over a specified time period. We calculate it by subtracting the distribution rate from the average of the three-year and five-year NAV returns. In this list, we included the top 10 funds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Table 6:</strong></p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475956785493_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1514\" data-height=\"384\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475956785493_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"T6\" width=\"640\" height=\"162\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475956785493_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475956785493_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475956785493_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475956785493_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Total Weight (Quality Score) Calculated Up to This Point</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Note: The Total Weight calculation is not fully completed at this point since we have not considered the 10-year NAV return.

In our current list of 75 funds, there were 26 duplicates, meaning there are funds that appeared more than once. The following names appear twice (or more):</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Appeared twice: AIO, BANX, BGR, BRW, EDF, EMF, EOD, JCE, PDT, SRV, UTF, and XFLT (12 duplicates).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Appeared three times: CSQ, EMO, EOS, GAM, PDX, and TWN (12 duplicates).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Appeared four times: EIC, GGN (6 duplicates).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Once we remove 30 duplicate rows, we are left with 45 (75- 30) funds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Note: It may be worthwhile to mention here that just because a fund has appeared multiple times does not necessarily make it an attractive candidate. Sometimes, a fund may appear multiple times simply for the wrong reasons, like a high current discount, a high excess discount, or a very high distribution rate that may not be sustainable. However, during the second filtering stage, it may not score well on the overall quality score due to other factors, like a poor track record. That said, if a fund has appeared four times or more, it may be worth a second look.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Narrowing Down to Just 10 Funds:</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In our list of funds, we may already have some of the best probable candidates. However, so far, they have been selected based on one (or two) criteria that each may be good at. That's not nearly enough. So, we will apply a combination of criteria by applying weights to eight factors to calculate the total quality score and filter out the best ones.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We will apply weights to each of the eight criteria:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p>Criteria</p></td> <td><p>Max.

So, we sorted our table based on the sector and then the quality score. Furthermore, in this round of selections, we mostly pick one or two top funds from each sector (based on quality score). There is a bit of subjective judgment, as we tend to prioritize funds that pay regular and consistent distributions on a monthly or quarterly basis. We also weed out any fund that may have a very poor track record in terms of NAV performance. Funds that may have inconsistent dividends (even if they are high) generally do not make it to our top list. Furthermore, be aware that many times, single-country funds score high in our rankings, but most of them pay variable dividends on an annual or semi-annual basis. In addition, being single-country funds, they can be inherently riskier since their future returns are tied to just one country, be it economic, regulatory, or geopolitical factors. For these reasons, they generally do not make it to our top 5 lists, but they do appear on our list of 20. Individual investors could consider them based on their goals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Here's the list of the top 20 selections (from different asset classes) in the order of sector:</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Table 8:</strong></p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475974241562_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1742\" data-height=\"703\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475974241562_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"T8\" width=\"640\" height=\"258\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475974241562_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475974241562_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475974241562_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/434815-17720475974241562_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>10-Best-CEFs of the Month</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the end, if we only want to select ten funds, we will need to apply our subjective judgment to some degree.

Since there are 10 of them, we will not be providing a very detailed analysis of them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here are some details on many of our selections:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EOS\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>EOS</strong></a><strong>) Eaton Vance Enhanced Equity Income II:</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to covered call funds, it is hard to beat Eaton Vance funds. Also, EOS is one of the best funds in its category. Its high exposure to the technology sector has definitely helped the fund to shine in the last 10 years. It currently holds only about 50 companies and overwrites (sells options) on roughly 50% of its portfolio to generate income and reduce volatility. The distribution yield is attractive at 8.3%, and currently offers a decent discount of -6%. The fund uses no leverage, and its expenses are comparable to those of its competitors. The past performance record is solid, and it has returned 22%, 11%, and 14% (annualized) over the last 3, 5, and 10-year periods.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCD\" title=\"LMP Capital and Income Fund Inc\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>SCD</strong></a><strong>) LMP Capital and Income</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SCD is a fairly diversified fund invested in equity as well as fixed-income securities from many sectors. However, nearly 73% of the assets are in equity stocks from many sectors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund is categorized under \"Global Allocation,\" but over 85% is invested in U.S. securities. Broadly, the current allocation is as follows:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>73% Common Stocks, mostly US-based, with 16% Financials, 14% Technology, 12% Industrial, 12% Energy, and 8% Healthcare</li> <li>7.6% MLPs</li> <li>7% Preferred/Convertible</li> <li>6% Equity REITs</li> <li>3.5% Bonds.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The yield is attractive at 9% plus, and the current discount is -8%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JRI\" title=\"Nuveen Real Asset Income and Growth Fund\">JRI</a>) Nuveen Real Asset Income &amp; Growth Fund</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund JRI is a global fund offered by the Nuveen group. It invests in real asset-related companies, including equity stocks, preferred, and debt securities. Real asset-related investments could include companies that are engaged in owning, developing, or operating infrastructure projects or facilities, as well as REITs. Nearly 50-55% of the assets are invested in the U.S.-based companies. The fund uses a significant amount of leverage (roughly 30%) and is very well diversified with nearly 450 holdings. The investments are roughly 45%:55% in real estate vs infrastructure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund has just announced a rights offering, and that is one reason that the discount has widened to nearly -8%. The yield is attractive at 12% plus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AIO\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>AIO</strong></a><strong>) Virtus AI &amp; Tech Opp Fund:</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a fund focused on AI (Artificial Intelligence) and technology companies. But it comes with a unique flavor of combining both the equity and convertible securities, as well as some bonds, based on market conditions. The fund also uses modest leverage of roughly 12% and has performed very well in the last three years. It provides a decent distribution yield of just under 8% and is currently trading at an attractive discount of roughly -10%. This fund was included in December/January as well, but recently the price has come under pressure, and the discount has widened somewhat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EIC\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>EIC</strong></a><strong>) Eagle Point Income Co:</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EIC is probably the riskiest fund in this selection of 10 funds. The fund uses high leverage of 32% in the form of preferred stock. The fund primarily invests in junior debt tranches of CLOs (Collateralized Loan Obligations). In addition, it may invest up to 35% of total assets in CLO equity securities and related securities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Due to the decline in interest rates, similar to its peers, the fund has been reducing its distribution amount. The monthly distribution has come down from $0.20 a share to $0.11, a 45% reduction. This has caused the price to fall during most of 2025, and that has continued in 2026, but the pace has slowed down. So, it has been brutal for someone who acquired the shares prior to 2024. However, the yield is still very attractive for the new buyers at 13.2%, in spite of the lower distribution amount. The discount has widened to very high levels at -24%. With reduced distribution, the current distribution is fully covered by the NII (net investment income). However, on a full nine-month basis (January to September), it only covered to the extent of 75%, as the distribution was much higher at the beginning of last year. We think that after significant correction, the price and yield are attractive. However, it is quite likely that the distribution amount may further fall if the interest rates decline further, so this fund should only be accumulated in multiple lots on a dollar-cost-average basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EOD\" title=\"Allspring Global Dividend Opportunity Fund\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>EOD</strong></a><strong>) Allspring Global Dividend Opportunity Fund:</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The international funds of all types have done well during the year 2025, and that trend is continuing in 2026. This fund is selected to provide exposure to global equity as well as fixed income. The fund is invested roughly 80% in global equities with a focus on dividends, and the rest in fixed income (18%) and cash equivalents (2%). The equity portion is invested in 70-80 companies spread across many sectors and segments. The fund also employs an options strategy on a portion of the equity portfolio to enhance income and to generate gains on call options. The fund also uses a modest leverage of just under 15%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The allocation to the U.S. is roughly 65% of the total, and the rest is invested in countries such as the U.K., France, Japan, China, Germany, Italy, Canada, Taiwan, and Brazil. The largest sector is information Technology at 25%, followed by Financials and Communications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The yield is decent at 8.5%, and the discount is close to -8%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UTF\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>UTF</strong></a><strong>) Cohen &amp; Steers Infrastructure Fund:</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is one of the most popular Utility and Infrastructure funds out there in the CEF space, besides the Reaves Utility Income fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UTG\" title=\"Reaves Utility Income Fund\">UTG</a>). However, UTF appears to offer better value currently compared to UTG, even though both have appreciated quite a bit in the last 12 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund invests in infrastructure companies, which consist of utilities, pipelines, toll roads, airports, railroads, ports, and telecommunications companies. The fund offers a close to 7% yield and a discount of roughly -7%. The fund offers a very reliable distribution payout as it has paid consistent and growing distributions since its inception.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PEO\" title=\"Adams Natural Resources Fund\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>PEO</strong></a><strong>)</strong> <strong>Adams Natural Resources Fund:</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you like to own some of the large-cap energy majors at a discount, you can't beat the PEO fund offered by the Adams group. It is a very nice fund to hold the energy majors, and that too at good discounts (currently hovering around -9%). This fund provides a diversified exposure to large energy companies. At the same time, there is some over-concentration at the top, given the fact that the two oil majors, Exxon Mobil (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>) and Chevron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX\" title=\"Chevron Corporation\">CVX</a>), together represent nearly 38% of the total assets. The yield has come down somewhat in recent months, but it is still attractive at it 7.5%. Please keep in mind that this is an energy sector-specific fund, and hence, one should allocate accordingly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HQL\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>HQL</strong></a><strong>) abrdn Life Sciences Investors</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund had not done too well in recent years, from 2022 to 2024. However, the fund has recovered in the last year and gained roughly 23% in the previous 12 months, excluding nearly 13% dividends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund recently increased the distribution amounts, and the distribution yield is very attractive at 13.35%. It also offers a discount of -8.7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund uses almost zero leverage and invests in well-known names from the biotechnology sector. This fund has managed to pay a consistent distribution, but mostly from the capital gains and, to some extent, ROC (return of capital).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some of the top holdings are Amgen (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMGN\" title=\"Amgen Inc.\">AMGN</a>), Vaxcyte (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PCVX\" title=\"Vaxcyte, Inc.\">PCVX</a>), UniQure NV (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QURE\" title=\"uniQure N.V.\">QURE</a>), Insmed Inc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INSM\" title=\"Insmed Incorporated\">INSM</a>), Regeneron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/REGN\" title=\"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\">REGN</a>), Gilead (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GILD\" target=\"_blank\">GILD)</a>, Vertex (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VRTX\" title=\"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\">VRTX</a>), and BioMarin (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BMRN\" title=\"BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.\">BMRN</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GAM\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>GAM</strong></a><strong>) General American Investors:</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">GAM is our selection for the core U.S. equity fund for this month. It should be noted that the fund pays annually in the month of December, and the payment is variable from one year to another. Based on the distribution paid in December 2025, the yield is quite attractive at over 10%. The current discount is close to -11%. Income investors who like to have regular quarterly (or monthly) distributions should look elsewhere.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The primary investment objective of the fund is to seek capital appreciation, with income only a secondary objective. The fund invests in equity securities with growth potential at reasonable valuations. The fund also uses a modest leverage in the form of preferred stock.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>CEF-Specific Investment Risks:</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It goes without saying that CEFs generally have some additional risks. This section is specifically relevant for investors who are new to CEF investing, but in general, all CEF investors should be aware of it. For more details on these specific risks, please read our <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/434815-financially-free-investor/6032806-selection-process-outline-5-best-cefs-every-month-monthly-series\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/434815-financially-free-investor/6032806-selection-process-outline-5-best-cefs-every-month-monthly-series\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> on CEFs.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Use of high leverage and high fees</li></ul> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>High volatility (compared to the broader market)</li></ul> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Premium over NAVs (market price higher than the NAV)</li></ul> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Asset-specific concentration risk.</li></ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Concluding Thoughts:</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The broader market, as represented by the S&amp;P500, provides a dismal yield of less than 1.20%. Many income investors and retirees can't survive on that kind of income. For income investors, we recommend building a core bucket of DGI (Dividend growth) stocks and supplementing it with a basket of CEFs to increase the overall income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We use our screening process to highlight the best closed-end funds for investment each month. Our filtering process demands that our selections have an above-average long-term performance record, offer an average of roughly 8% distributions, and are relatively cheaper with reasonable discounts. We have also provided a larger list of ten CEFs from many different asset classes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This month, as a group, the selected 10 best funds are offering an average distribution rate of 8.70% (as of 01/16/2026). Besides excellent distributions, these funds have had an excellent record over the long term and collectively returned 17.7%, 12.2%, and 13.3% (annualized) in the last three, five years, and 10 years, respectively. The average discount (to NAV) is attractive, at -7.5%. Since this is a monthly series, some selections may overlap from month to month.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Please note that these selections are based on our proprietary rating system and are dynamic in nature. So, they can change from month to month (or even week to week). At the same time, some funds can repeat from one month to the next if they remain attractive over an extended period. Furthermore, note that if a fund has not made it to our list, it does not mean it is not good. It could be because they may not be attractively priced at this time or trading at a premium while running our filtering process.</p>",

Jones Soda, for example, is a smaller brand that's not publicly traded. However, big brands often devour or buy out smaller brands, bringing them into their larger portfolio. This can cause concentration in sectors into some large names, even though they may have hundreds of smaller names that feed revenue upwards to the mothership. For years, you could buy Canada Dry or Schweppes Ginger Ale, and you were supporting a local brand versus a much larger one. However, Keurig Dr. Pepper (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KDP\" title=\"Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">KDP</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) bought both of these companies in the past few decades.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other sectors remain highly segmented as well.

MRSH is an insurance broker and advisory company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For an idea of its size, the company's total revenue in 2025 was <a href=\"https://www.corporate.marsh.com/web-assets/files-for-download/investors/2026/pdf-2025-marsh-investors-4q-news-release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">nearly $27 billion</a>, and it advised clients in approximately 130 countries. MRSH closed out 2025 with strong momentum, too.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its revenue grew by 8.7% year-over-year to $6.60 billion in the fourth quarter. That beat Seeking Alpha's analyst consensus by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4544113-marsh-and-mclennan-non-gaap-eps-of-2_12-beats-by-0_15-revenue-of-6_6b-beats-by-50m\">$50 million</a> for the period. Much of this growth was powered by its acquisition of McGriff Insurance Services, with its underlying businesses delivering the remaining 4% of topline growth during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MRSH's adjusted EPS rose by 9.8% over the year-ago period to $2.12 in the fourth quarter. This topped the analyst consensus for the quarter by $0.15. Because the company gained leverage from its revenue growth, adjusted operating margin expanded by about 40 basis points to 23.7% during the quarter. That's how adjusted EPS growth outpaced revenue growth in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, MRSH has a few levers to pull to keep growing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For one, the company should be able to maintain a mid-single-digit annual organic revenue growth rate. This is because, as the economy grows, businesses have more assets to insure. As an insurance broker, MRSH's cut also grows over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, the company is a frequent player in the M&amp;A space. MRSH's A- S&amp;P credit rating with a stable outlook provides it with the low cost of capital and flexibility to further consolidate a very fragmented industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, the deployment of agentic AI and productivity tools can automate high-volume tasks, like policy checking and Certificates of Insurance. This is how MRSH can grow its revenue at a faster rate than expenses, which produces margin expansion over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For these reasons, the FAST Graphs analyst consensus is for adjusted EPS to grow by 7.7% annually through 2028, off a 2025 base of $9.75.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MRSH offers a 2% dividend yield. Considering that the adjusted EPS payout ratio is set to be in the mid-30% range for 2026, the payout appears to be quite sustainable. That positions it to build on its 16-year dividend growth streak with more annual dividend growth in the 9% to 10% range. This would work out to a respectable Chowder number in the range of 11 to 12.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48716285-1772120519499533_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1685\" data-height=\"869\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48716285-1772120519499533_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FAST Graphs, FactSet\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"330\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48716285-1772120519499533_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48716285-1772120519499533_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48716285-1772120519499533_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48716285-1772120519499533_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FAST Graphs, FactSet</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MRSH is a compelling value. At the current $181 share price, the stock is trading at a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 18.39. This is far less than the FAST Graphs 10-year average P/E ratio of 21.9.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, we believe that a realistic fair value P/E ratio for MRSH in the coming years is closer to 20. That's because its high single-digit annual percentage adjusted EPS growth consensus is somewhat lower than the 10-year CAGR of 12.3%. This produces a fair value per share estimate of $210, which indicates MRSH's shares are priced at a 19% discount to fair value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If it meets growth forecasts and reverts to fair value, it could log a 16% total return through 2026. By the end of 2031, the insurance brokerage firm could have a path to 11% annual total returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key risks facing MRSH include AI disruption in the insurance brokerage space and property catastrophe pricing headwinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4549671-top-quant-rated-insurance-brokers-amid-ai-disruption-fears\">launch of a new AI tool</a> by Insurify recently caused a further selloff in insurance brokerage stocks. The fear is that AI could automate the middleman roles in insurance, which could compress the margins of MRSH.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While this is a very real long-term risk, we believe that it's somewhat mitigated by the complex nature of MRSH's policies that require more subjective negotiations. Still, it's worth watching for future developments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk to MRSH is that President and CEO John Doyle flagged softening in the property cat market as reinsurers are pursuing growth by deploying more capital on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4863905-marsh-and-mclennan-companies-inc-mrsh-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q4 2025 Earnings Call</a>. After years of strength in this market, pricing declines could somewhat reduce MRSH's growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MRSH offers the opportunity to investors to own shares of a strong company that is actively expanding its market share through organic growth and acquisitions. It can effectively leverage its size and credit rating to tap into inexpensive debt, which helps fuel higher returns on their actions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The insurance sector has been heavily sold off over AI fears, while much of the rest of the market has been selling off AI companies over the fear that they're not going to be able to produce strong returns from the massive amount of capital that they're spending on development.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This has created deep value opportunities all over the sector, and MRSH is one of them.</p>",

And we look at it in aggregate, and we look at it via cohorts. I think the perspective we have is that it can stay where it is. (Duolingo CFO, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875922-duolingo-inc-duol-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q4 2025 Earnings Call</a>)</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, paid subscriber growth remains strong (28% growth in their latest quarter), and the DAU/MAU ratio (a measure of user engagement) hit an all-time high of 40% in 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third, marketing spend as a percentage of revenue remained stable at 12% from 2024 to 2025, which suggests no deterioration in customer acquisition efficiency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If AI were meaningfully disrupting Duolingo, it would show up in churn, engagement, or marketing efficiency metrics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More importantly, the AI disruption bear narrative misunderstands Duolingo’s core value proposition. Duolingo is not simply a content provider—their edge lies in their behavioural engagement. Effective skill acquisition (e.g., learning a language or chess) requires:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Structured progression</li> <li>Reinforcement loops</li> <li>Habit formation</li> <li>Accountability mechanisms</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Duolingo's core competitive advantage is consumer engagement using tools like daily streaks, leagues, gamification loops, and humorous avatars. Generic AI chat interfaces do not replicate these behavioural tools.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Real-time language translation via earphones could have an impact over the medium-to-long term, but such devices have been available for years with minimal discernible impact on Duolingo’s business. The CEO addressed this exact concern in their latest earnings call:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>So AI translation isn’t – people talk about it, but it is not something that we are worried internally about. AI translation has been essentially perfect among the largest languages for like more than 10 years. I mean between Spanish and English, it’s essentially been perfect. Our users use Duolingo for 2 main reasons: one, as a hobby, they actually want to learn. And those people, whether there’s AI translation, it doesn’t matter, it’s a hobby for them. And then the other group of people is learning English. They want to learn English, and they actually want to learn English. We know also that we ask users why they leave Duolingo. We have this churn user surveys. This [AI translation] does not come up. (Duolingo CEO, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875922-duolingo-inc-duol-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q4 2025 Earnings Call</a>)</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My view is that AI enhances Duolingo’s competitive position via:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Lower marginal cost of content creation</li> <li>Faster expansion into new languages and subjects</li> <li>Improved user personalisation</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With 133m MAUs and more than a decade of proprietary longitudinal data, Duolingo is much better positioned than competitors to integrate AI into their app at scale. Smaller competitors simply lack the user base, longitudinal data, and balance sheet to deploy AI as efficiently as Duolingo.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>2 – Duolingo is Not Ex-Growth</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second bear narrative is myopically focused on the recent growth slowdown and 2026 guidance. Bookings and MAU growth undeniably moderated in H2 2025 – bookings growth decelerated from 38% in Q1 2025 to 24% in Q4 2025, while MAU growth decelerated from 33% in Q1 2025 to 14% in Q4 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management's 2026 guidance implies:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>DAU growth of 20% (vs. 30% in 2025)</li> <li>Revenue growth of 15-18% (vs. 39% in 2025)</li> <li>Adjusted EBITDA margin of 25% (vs. 30% in 2025)</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market has extrapolated management's 2026 guidance as evidence of structural deceleration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the market is missing a few factors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, 15-18% revenue growth on a $1b+ revenue base, combined with 25% EBITDA margins and 30%+ free cash flow margins, remains exceptional in the public markets. This context is needed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, the slowdown is partially self-inflicted. Management is intentionally devoting more attention in 2026 to reinvesting in product and user experience after a period of aggressive revenue optimisation, taking a long-term view on the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Similar to Spotify (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPOT\" title=\"Spotify Technology S.A.\">SPOT</a>), Duolingo’s management constantly walks a fine line between balancing product investment and free user growth with revenue optimisation of paid subscribers. From 2022-2023, Spotify prioritised product investments and free user growth at the expense of subscriber revenue optimisation and the stock was severely punished. However, from 2024-2025, management shifted from this investment phase and began to better optimise near-term revenue and profitability (by raising subscription prices, layoffs, etc.), leading to EBIT margins reaching 15% in Q4 2025 (after being loss making for some periods during 2022-2023). Concurrent with the near-term boost in profitability, shares jumped over 10x from the 2022 lows to 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_03730914522988ace97e6b75ae667525.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_03730914522988ace97e6b75ae667525.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_03730914522988ace97e6b75ae667525.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_03730914522988ace97e6b75ae667525.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe a similar pattern is unfolding here with Duolingo. Management admittedly over-optimised for short-term subscriber growth and revenue from 2024-2025, which came at the expense of free user growth (evidenced by MAU deceleration). In 2026, management is shifting their focus to product development and improving the free/lower-tier paid subscription offering, setting the foundations for strong MAU growth in 2027 and 2028. While this move weakens revenue growth and profitability in the short term, it is the right approach for long-term value creation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third, management’s guidance for 100m DAUs in 2028 implies a 24% CAGR from their latest MAU count of 53m. If we take their latest 2026 DAU forecast of 20%, this implies material acceleration in 2027 and 2028, supporting the thesis that this growth slowdown is a short-term blip.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some readers might be considering whether management forecasts should be trusted. To me, this management team has a lot of credibility. From 2022-2025, management outperformed their annual revenue guidance by 3-10% and adjusted EBITDA guidance by 15-73%. In short, this is a management team that consistently underpromises and overdelivers.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p><strong>2022</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2023</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2024</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>2025</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Revenue guidance midpoint at end of prior year</p></td> <td><p>$337.0m</p></td> <td><p>$492.0m</p></td> <td><p>$723.5m</p></td> <td><p>$970.5m</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Actual revenue delivered</p></td> <td><p>$369.5m</p></td> <td><p>$531.1m</p></td> <td><p>$748.0m</p></td> <td><p>$1,037.6m</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Revenue beat</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>10%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>8%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>3%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>7%</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint at end of prior year</p></td> <td><p>($3.0m)</p></td> <td><p>$54.2m</p></td> <td><p>$162.9m</p></td> <td><p>$266.0m</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Actual adjusted EBITDA delivered</p></td> <td><p>$15.5m</p></td> <td><p>$93.7m</p></td> <td><p>$191.9m</p></td> <td><p>$305.9m</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Adjusted EBITDA beat</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>n/a</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>73%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>18%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>15%</strong></p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>3 – Market Saturation Concerns Are Not Supported by Data</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CEO Luis von Ahn explicitly addressed the concern that Duolingo’s growth slowdown is a result of saturating their core markets in the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875922-duolingo-inc-duol-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q4 2025 earnings call</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>In the United States, 2% of all Internet users on a given day use Duolingo. So 2% penetration in the US for daily users. In the UK, that’s 3%. In Germany, that’s 4%. And Germany is not the highest country we have. We actually think we can get much higher than that. But even if we only assume that every country got to 2%, which is the US penetration, we would more than double our daily active users. So I just don’t think we’re near saturation at all.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Online estimates suggest that somewhere between 30% and 50% of Spotify and Netflix users in established markets use those apps daily. This implies material upside from the 2-4% for Duolingo.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>4 – Strong Balance Sheet Eliminates Existential Risk</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Duolingo ended 2025 with:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>$1.04b in cash and short-term investments</li> <li>No debt</li> <li>$360m in annual free cash flow</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management guided to at least $350m of free cash flow in 2026 in their <a href=\"https://investors.duolingo.com/static-files/961ce633-3cee-49d0-bd7a-2c63731d45fb\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q4 2025 shareholder letter</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Duolingo is a self-funding, high-margin business with a strong net cash balance sheet. Bankruptcy risk under those circumstances is effectively non-existent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The board recently authorised a $400m share repurchase program to be deployed in 2026, which reflects disciplined capital allocation and confidence that shares are underpriced at their current levels.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Multiple Acts: From Language App to Learning Platform</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Duolingo is evolving from a sole language learning app into a broad learning platform. Since its IPO, Duolingo has added a range of new products, including music, maths, and chess. With AI reducing the cost of new content creation, I would expect additional verticals over the coming years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chess in particular has rapidly become the second biggest chess app in the world.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>As I said in our shareholder letter, we have about 7 million daily active users in chess and this is less than a year after we launched. At this point, we believe we’re the second largest chess thing in the world, which is, by the way, incredible because if you search for chess on the App Store, we don’t appear in the results. (Duolingo CEO, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875922-duolingo-inc-duol-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q4 2025 Earnings Call</a>)</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Few consumer companies successfully execute second and third acts. Spotify has demonstrated successful expansion into podcasts and audiobooks, while Netflix is seeing promise with their ad-supported plan, but these remain outliers in the consumer subscription space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The early evidence suggests that Duolingo can diversify outside of their core language learning app, further reducing AI disruption risk.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Valuation: Priced for Decline</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Public markets frequently misprice high-quality compounders during periods of narrative uncertainty.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At a $4.67b market cap and with a $1.04b net cash position, Duolingo's enterprise value is $3.63b.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using management’s 2026 guidance, Duolingo trades at:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>3x forward revenue (assuming 18% revenue growth)</li> <li>10% forward free cash flow yield (assuming $350m in annual free cash flow)</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are valuation multiples generally seen in mature, low-growth, or structurally declining assets, not a technology business growing double digits with strong profit margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To estimate three year forward returns, I created a range of scenarios:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Bear case</strong> - assumes that revenue growth rates continue to decelerate after 2026 and free cash flow margins compress from 35% to 20%</li> <li> <strong>Base case</strong> - assumes that management is able to re-accelerate growth after 2026 and free cash flow margins compress from 35% to 30%</li> <li> <strong>Bull case</strong> - assumes that management materially accelerates revenue growth from 2027-2028 and maintains their 35% free cash flow margins</li> </ul> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p><strong>Bear case</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Base case</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Bull case</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>3Y forward revenue growth rate</p></td> <td><p>10%</p></td> <td><p>20%</p></td> <td><p>25%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>2028 revenue</p></td> <td><p>$1.4b</p></td> <td><p>$1.8b</p></td> <td><p>$2.0b</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Exit trailing revenue multiple</p></td> <td><p>2x</p></td> <td><p>4x</p></td> <td><p>6x</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Exit EV</p></td> <td><p>$2.8b</p></td> <td><p>$7.2b</p></td> <td><p>$12.2b</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>IRR (using revenue methodology)</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>(9%)</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>25%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>50%</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>2028 free cash flow margin</p></td> <td><p>20%</p></td> <td><p>30%</p></td> <td><p>35%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>2028 free cash flow</p></td> <td><p>$276m</p></td> <td><p>$538m</p></td> <td><p>$709m</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Exit FCF yield</p></td> <td><p>10%</p></td> <td><p>7%</p></td> <td><p>4%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Exit EV</p></td> <td><p>$2.8b</p></td> <td><p>$7.7b</p></td> <td><p>$17.7b</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>IRR (using free cash flow methodology)</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>(9%)</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>28%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>70%</strong></p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even under conservative assumptions, the downside appears limited (-9% IRR) relative to the upside potential in the base case (25-28% IRR) and bull case (50-70% IRR).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Duolingo is a global market leader with a capital-light business model that has demonstrated premium metrics since their IPO in 2021 - revenue has grown at a 43% CAGR, gross margins have remained above 70%, and free cash flow margins have expanded from 5% to 35%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares are down more than 80% from their 2025 high due to investor concerns around AI disruption risk and near-term growth moderation. I believe both concerns are overstated. Duolingo is well placed to integrate AI into their platform and is making appropriate long-term decisions needed to sustain user growth to 2028.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When high-quality compounders temporarily fall out of favour due to short-term factors, long-term investors are paid to be patient. After selling a third of my position in Duolingo in June 2025 at a share price of over $510, I am adding aggressively to my Duolingo position during this sell-off.</p>",

Impacted by the high-interest rate environment, OMC has been going through massive changes, which I think will benefit the company long-term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the price rally after their buyback announcement, the advertising giant still trades at less than 8x earnings, presenting an attractive buying opportunity for long-term investors. You also get paid an attractive yield of over 4% while you wait.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the current price, I believe Omnicom Group is a great value play that's likely to see at least $100 per share by the end of 2026. In this article, I discuss their latest earnings, fundamentals, and why I believe this stock is a bargain at the current price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Previous Buy Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I last covered Omnicom Group back in October in an article titled: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831764-omnicom-group-a-cheap-ai-beneficiary-with-a-4-percent-plus-yield-and-massive-upside-potential\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831764-omnicom-group-a-cheap-ai-beneficiary-with-a-4-percent-plus-yield-and-massive-upside-potential\" target=\"_blank\"><em>A Cheap, AI Beneficiary With A 4%+ Yield &amp; Massive Upside Potential.</em></a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At a multiple of less than 10x and a yield over 4%, OMC offered strong upside to their price target of $148.65 at the end of 2027. Since then, the stock has been somewhat volatile but is up modestly since my last coverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span class=\"highlighted_text\">The S&amp;P (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" class=\"ticker-link\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" target=\"_blank\">SP500</a>) has also been volatile but is</span> up close to 2%, compared to 1.56% for OMC. During their Q3 earnings, OMC reported mixed results with a revenue miss due to declines in some of their segments. But their anticipated merger, expected to create synergies, strong balance sheet, and a well-covered dividend, were reasons I remained bullish.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-1771518878826368_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2063\" data-height=\"908\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-1771518878826368_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"282\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-1771518878826368_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-1771518878826368_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-1771518878826368_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-1771518878826368_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another Mixed Report, But Solid YoY Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Omnicom Group reported their <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4871773-omnicom-group-inc-omc-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4871773-omnicom-group-inc-omc-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">Q4 earnings</a> and saw a sizable miss on their bottom line. EPS amounted to $2.59, missing analysts' estimates by $0.35. Revenue amounted to $5.53 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the sizable miss, both EPS &amp; revenue managed to see growth year-over-year. EPS grew from $2.41 the year prior, while revenue was up from $4.32 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In total, EPS grew from $8.06 to $8.65, while their top line increased from approximately $15.7 billion to $17.3 billion. Their performance was driven by higher organic growth from the prior year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Organic growth totaled 9.3%, up from 5.2% in 2024. This was led by higher growth in their Media &amp; Advertising segment, up 14.9% compared to 7.8%. Experiential growth was up 19% compared to 15.4% last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Precision Marketing was up from 3.8% to 8.6%. Healthcare turned positive, up 2.5% vs being down 0.4% in 2025. It's likely lower base rates also played a role in OMC's performance.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715197403887718_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1026\" data-height=\"556\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715197403887718_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"347\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715197403887718_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715197403887718_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715197403887718_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715197403887718_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>OMC IP</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Omnicom also likely benefitted from the successful closing of their Interpublic Group acquisition. As part of the portfolio repositioning, OMC's management exited non-performing assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These were identified as having approximately $2.5 billion in annual revenue. And management stated they plan to exit the remaining underperforming assets in the next 12 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of the IPG acquisition, OMC closed on this 3 months ago. And previously, management stated this was expected to be accretive to their bottom line in the first year. They also mentioned this was expected to save $750 million in costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After earnings, management <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4553701-omnicom-doubles-synergy-target-to-1_5b-and-launches-2_5b-share-repurchase-following-ipg\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4553701-omnicom-doubles-synergy-target-to-1_5b-and-launches-2_5b-share-repurchase-following-ipg\" target=\"_blank\">doubled this to $1.5 billion</a> and announced a $5 billion share repurchase program. And this caused the share price to rally. Synergies are expected over the course of the next 30 months. For 2026, they are expected to realize $900 million in cost savings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OMC also announced a $2.5 billion accelerated buyback program. And I expect management to take advantage of the share price and exhaust this in the coming quarters. As a result, this should lead to strong earnings growth, thus positively impacting the share price long-term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well-Covered 3.5% Yield</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Besides lowering costs, lower base rates should also benefit OMC as investors rotate back into the market looking for higher yields. Back in November, Omnicom Group announced a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4526383-omnicom-raises-dividend-by-143-to-080-a-share\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4526383-omnicom-raises-dividend-by-143-to-080-a-share\" target=\"_blank\">14.3% dividend increase</a> to $0.80 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was the first dividend increase since 2021. This, and their buyback program, should give investors confidence in their ability to see solid growth going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The dividend was also well-covered by cash flows. For 2025, free cash flow grew from $1.96 billion to $2.23 billion. Net free cash flow amounted to $1.677 billion, while dividends for the year amounted to roughly $550 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This gives OMC a very conservative payout ratio of 33%, and plenty of room for future acquisitions, buybacks, and dividend increases. Going forward, I suspect dividend increases to continue, likely in the high single-digit to double-digit range.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strong Balance Sheet</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because of the IPG acquisition, debt increased from $6 billion to $9.1 billion. As a result, leverage increased from 0.7x to 3.1x. For comparison, this was higher than both peers WPP plc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WPP\" title=\"WPP plc\">WPP</a>) and Publicis Groupe S.A. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PUBGY\" title=\"Publicis Groupe S.A.\">PUBGY</a>), whose leverage ratios were 2.0x and 1.0x, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Omnicom's net debt stood at $2.23 billion. But liquidity was robust with roughly $6.9 billion in cash &amp; cash equivalents and $3.5 billion undrawn on their revolver.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The upcoming debt was solidly staggered, with $1.4 billion due this year and a weighted-average interest rate of 3.6%. The rest of their debt was very manageable until 2030.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because of their strong financial position, I anticipate management aggressively deleveraging in 2026 and beyond. So, for those worried about the IPG acquisition and how it impacts OMC's balance sheet, the advertising giant remains in a comfortable position.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715208980456731_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"973\" data-height=\"604\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715208980456731_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"397\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715208980456731_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715208980456731_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715208980456731_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715208980456731_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>OMC IP</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Solid Growth Expected Going Forward</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Analysts anticipate solid earnings growth going forward for OMC, with a CAGR of 14% over the next 5 years.

This is also significantly below their <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OMC/valuation/metrics\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OMC/valuation/metrics\" target=\"_blank\">5-year average</a> of 11.86x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another indicator that they could be massively undervalued is their PEG ratio of just 0.47x. If the advertising giant manages to see high single-digit to double-digit growth as I expect, I see them potentially re-rating higher, likely in the 12x-15x range in the next 2 to 3 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Wall Street currently has a price target of $100.50, more than 21% upside from the current price. If interest rates decline as expected and we manage to dodge a recession, I see the share price above $100 potentially by the end of the year.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/54869375-1772073020243167_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1618\" data-height=\"622\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/54869375-1772073020243167_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"246\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/54869375-1772073020243167_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/54869375-1772073020243167_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/54869375-1772073020243167_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/54869375-1772073020243167_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to F.A.S.T.

The labor market has been experiencing weakening in recent months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Due to most of their revenue coming from media &amp; advertising, the stock is highly susceptible to businesses cutting costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This makes them riskier. But at a forward P/E of less than 8x, I believe downside is minimal unless the economy takes a turn for the worse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They could also see impacts from AI down the line as businesses may use this to do their own advertising.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But Omnicom's bright outlook, well-covered 3.5% yield, robust cash flows, and suppressed share price make them a potential bargain with massive capital appreciation.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

This includes SaaS, professional services, trucking, white-collar infrastructure, and lots of cyclical consumer-facing businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But guess what sector is resilient to the ravages caused by AI:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Real estate investment trusts, or REITs (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VNQ\" title=\"Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund ETF\">VNQ</a>) in short.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/15/saupload_91324a5d90d589bfc8c99e5636a43029.png?io=w640\" alt=\"REITs outperform 2026\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"635\" height=\"592\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/15/saupload_91324a5d90d589bfc8c99e5636a43029.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/15/saupload_91324a5d90d589bfc8c99e5636a43029.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/15/saupload_91324a5d90d589bfc8c99e5636a43029.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YCHARTS</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Real asset-based businesses are the exception.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They are the ultimate anti-AI asset class because most of them cannot be disrupted. You simply cannot replicate more land, building permits, financing, or construction materials with an AI model. You also cannot replace having a roof over your head.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, I expect AI to be highly deflationary and eventually bring much lower interest rates, potentially even a return to near-0% rates, which would be very bullish for REITs, given that they're today trading at historically low valuations due to the surge in interest rates of 2022/2023.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/28/47644028-17643078481165764_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"REIT valuations vs. equities\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"392\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/28/47644028-17643078481165764_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/28/47644028-17643078481165764_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/28/47644028-17643078481165764_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/28/47644028-17643078481165764_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Principal</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So overall, I'm very bullish on REITs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, this does not mean that I like every single one of them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">REITs, like other asset classes, include some good, some bad, and some truly ugly companies. Being selective is key if you want to maximize your risk-adjusted returns, and that starts by avoiding REITs that are likely to cut their dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In what follows, I'm going to highlight three popular high-yielding REITs that I would avoid because they're at high risk of cutting their dividend in the near term:</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chiron Real Estate: Heavy Leverage and Short Debt Maturities</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chiron Real Estate (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XRN\" title=\"Chiron Real Estate Inc.\">XRN</a>) is popular among high-yield-seeking individual investors, and it's easy to understand why.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The REIT focuses on healthcare properties like medical office buildings, which benefit from the rapidly aging population and generate recession-resistant cash flows.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720988514208872_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1214\" data-height=\"598\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720988514208872_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chiron Real Estate property\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720988514208872_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720988514208872_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720988514208872_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720988514208872_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Chiron Real Estate</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It also has five years left on its leases on average, and its tenants enjoy a 4.4x rent coverage ratio, which seems to indicate that its tenants are profitable and can easily cover rent payments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even then, it offers an 8.3% dividend yield, which is fully covered by FFO with a 73% payout ratio.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720991447310858_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1251\" data-height=\"608\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720991447310858_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chiron Real Estate property\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"311\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720991447310858_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720991447310858_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720991447310858_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720991447310858_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Chiron Real Estate</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The REIT also already reduced its dividend once in 2025, and this appears to be reassuring many investors, who then conclude that they already cut the dividend and are therefore unlikely to cut it again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet, that's exactly what I expect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I actually predicted the divided cut of 2025 in a separate article that you can read by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4773460-3-reits-to-sell-before-they-cut-their-dividend\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4773460-3-reits-to-sell-before-they-cut-their-dividend\" target=\"_blank\">clicking here. </a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Most of it remains relevant today. They gained some time by reducing the dividend, but I think that they didn't cut it enough.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The problem is that the REIT has a lot of leverage. Its debt-to-EBITDA is 6.2x, and they still have some preferred equity on top of that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, their average debt term is only about four years, on average, so they will face major near-term refinancing needs, and given that their current interest rate is only about 3.7%, they will face much higher interest expense.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This will then pressure their cash flow and lead to a surge in their payout ratio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If everything goes perfectly to plan and interest rates decline from here, they may get lucky and still avoid a cut.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But what investors need to remember here is that Chiron Real Estate focuses primarily on riskier, higher cap rate healthcare properties, often located in secondary or tertiary markets with non-credit tenants. It has historically gotten a near 8% cap rate on average on its acquisitions, and you just don't get such high cap rates without taking risks. The REIT has suffered some tenant bankruptcies and likely will again in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And given the state of its balance sheet, I think that it would take only a small setback for it to be forced to cut its dividend once again. There's little room for error when you operate with so much leverage and short debt maturities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, I would note that the REIT just recently completed a <span class=\"highlighted_text\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4546200-global-medical-reit-to-rebrand-to-chiron-real-estate\">rebranding</a></span>, changing its name from Global Medical REIT to Chiron Real Estate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This, on its own, of course, does not suggest a dividend cut, but companies will often push for major strategy and capital allocation changes before rebranding to mark a new, fresh start.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that a dividend cut is a high risk here, and for this reason, we prefer to invest in some of its peers, like Sila Realty Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SILA\" title=\"Sila Realty Trust, Inc.\">SILA</a>) at High-Yield Landlord.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global Net Lease: Poor Track Record and Heavy Exposure to Troubled Assets</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global Net Lease (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GNL\" title=\"Global Net Lease, Inc.\">GNL</a>) has surged a lot lately, and it has bulls celebrating.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/saupload_5cf9c14f0f9627e9a3f69f6ae121991c.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/saupload_5cf9c14f0f9627e9a3f69f6ae121991c.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/saupload_5cf9c14f0f9627e9a3f69f6ae121991c.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/saupload_5cf9c14f0f9627e9a3f69f6ae121991c.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw -

When you include its preferred equity, it rises closer to 8x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, its debt maturities are short at just about three years, with significant maturities coming its way in 2027 and 2028.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, the REIT still generates today about a quarter of its rental revenue from net lease office buildings, and those properties only have about 4.5 years left on their leases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have previously <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4477592-orion-office-reit-dont-get-caught-holding\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4477592-orion-office-reit-dont-get-caught-holding\" target=\"_blank\">explained</a> why I think that these properties are a disaster.

It would be prudent for them to do it as soon as possible to retain more cash flow for deleveraging and to accelerate their transformation away from these troubled assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, I want to remind you that this is the track record of the REIT: It's one of the most challenged in the entire REIT sector, repeatedly diluting shareholders with ill-timed capital raises, which later led to many dividend cuts:</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/saupload_99d2386b8b5d5b1f24bf523af119ed08.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/saupload_99d2386b8b5d5b1f24bf523af119ed08.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/saupload_99d2386b8b5d5b1f24bf523af119ed08.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/saupload_99d2386b8b5d5b1f24bf523af119ed08.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw -

As such, when tech stocks (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLK\" title=\"State Street Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF\">XLK</a>) are soaring, QQQ outperforms QQQI. However, in a market where they flounder, QQQI tends to outperform QQQ. Given that recently increasing caution has been put on mega-cap tech stocks due to their massive AI CapEx commitments this year with uncertain return profiles, and there are major concerns about valuations and AI disruption of the software industry, QQQ has been floundering, which means that the covered calls that QQQI employs are helping it to outperform by giving it additional cash flow without having to forfeit much, if anything, in the way of upside so far this year. This is exactly the type of environment where covered call strategies shine.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, what about moving forward? Should investors continue to play QQQI, or should they switch back to QQQ, or perhaps should they avoid mega-cap tech altogether? In this article, I will break down QQQI in more detail and share my take on the stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Structural Flaws That Could Undermine Long-Term Returns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I last wrote about QQQI back in December, when I highlighted how the yield looks great, and the performance looks great, yet there are some <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855991-qqqi-13-percent-yield-looks-perfect-until-you-dig-into-details\">structural flaws</a> that will lead to long-term total return underperformance. These include the relatively high expense ratio of 0.68%, the fact that its performance looks artificially good, given that, since its inception, its underlying index has performed very well, and it has only been in business a little over two years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, while its monthly distributions and its high annual yield of over 1% per month in payouts look extremely attractive, its SEC yield is microscopic, which means that it is generating virtually all of its yield from premiums that it earns from writing covered calls against its underlying holdings. This means that nearly all of its distributions amount to a return of capital. Additionally, even while much is made of the active management and its ability to dynamically manage the portfolio to preserve upside during bull markets to keep the ETF from falling too far behind, even year to date with a relatively sideways to even declining QQQ, QQQI has still seen its principal decline by more than QQQ has, showing that even in a relatively ideal scenario, it can still see its NAV erode more than its underlying index. This shows that its options-writing strategy does consistently eat into the NAV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_d8a636eb89095ed49ac399d2d39789f0.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_d8a636eb89095ed49ac399d2d39789f0.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_d8a636eb89095ed49ac399d2d39789f0.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_d8a636eb89095ed49ac399d2d39789f0.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, you will need a long-term bull market in QQQ and avoid too much sharp volatility for QQQI to preserve and grow NAV over time on top of its attractive distributions. This is especially true given that its top holdings and its general portfolio construction closely mirror QQQ’s, so that gives it an underlying equity risk and overweight tech exposure that is essentially the same.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/52820996-17722315454511085_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1150\" data-height=\"796\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/52820996-17722315454511085_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"QQQI Holdings\" width=\"640\" height=\"443\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"443\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/52820996-17722315454511085_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/52820996-17722315454511085_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/52820996-17722315454511085_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/52820996-17722315454511085_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">QQQI Holdings <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI CapEx, Valuations, And The Shifting Macro Backdrop</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The macro factors that have driven QQQI’s strong total return performance over time are bullish for tech, which has also led to it underperforming QQQ. However, recently, it has outperformed QQQ because some of these factors have shifted, namely that AI enthusiasm is tempered somewhat, investors are now looking more closely at valuations as well as returns on massive AI CapEx investments, and software is increasingly being viewed through a critical lens as a likely candidate for disruption from AI innovations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This means that QQQ has seen its performance weakened considerably relative to dividend stocks, as evidenced by the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHD\" title=\"Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF\">SCHD</a>)’s significant outperformance of QQQ over the past three months, while QQQI has only moderately tempered that weakness through its options-writing strategy and has still trailed SCHD by a huge margin over that time period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bf1aead3ed1fc3c876785779d1da7671.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bf1aead3ed1fc3c876785779d1da7671.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bf1aead3ed1fc3c876785779d1da7671.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bf1aead3ed1fc3c876785779d1da7671.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that tech valuations remain far from what I would consider bargain territory and we are still early on in the AI CapEx cycle, as well as the potential for software disruption, I do not think that QQQ is at all appealing relative to QQQI right now. And so, therefore, if presented with the two and trying to gain things over a relatively short- to medium-term horizon, I would continue to favor QQQI and other NASDAQ-focused covered call ETFs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, there are important trade-offs that need to be kept in mind. First of all, if we were to see a material pullback of QQQ into correction territory, I would probably switch from QQQI to QQQ to avoid missing out on a strong bounce back, since covered calls would temper that and potentially lock in long-term losses.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Better Income Alternatives With Stronger Risk-Reward Profiles</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, it is worth questioning whether you should have much exposure to any tech fund at all right now, given the valuations and macro factors already mentioned, especially since you can also buy dividend-paying stocks on a value basis that are enjoying macro tailwinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, you can buy <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4876562-the-ultimate-8-percent-yielding-sleep-well-at-night-retirement-income-machine\">several high-quality, investment-grade midstreams</a> that are benefiting from AI CapEx and do not suffer from uncertain AI return risks as the mega-cap techs do, while generating, in some cases, up to a 9% yield and enjoying inflation-beating growth, while also trading at single-digit valuation multiples. Even in ETF format, you can buy the Alerian MLP ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMLP\" title=\"Alerian MLP ETF\">AMLP</a>) with a near 8% yield and a strong recent dividend growth history.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, you can buy <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4853261-7-8-percent-yielding-utf-one-of-best-infrastructure-income-opportunities-upgrade\">high-yield funds</a> like the Cohen &amp; Steers Infrastructure Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UTF\" title=\"Cohen &amp; Steers Infrastructure Fund Inc\">UTF</a>) that offer mid- to high-single-digit yields and even broader diversification across AI-related infrastructure. Moreover, you can buy high-quality, conservative, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4873260-saaspocalypse-created-one-of-best-11-percent-plus-yielding-opportunities\">senior secured software lenders</a> at deep discounts to NAV and dividend yields that compare very nicely with QQQI’s while enjoying a steep discount to NAV and a more conservative profile in terms of exposure to software given their senior secured lending stance at loan-to-values of between the mid-teens and the 30s rather than having straight-up equity exposure to richly valued software companies that occupy a substantial portion of QQQ and QQQI’s portfolios. Not only that, but you get these yields without the covered call caps on upside potential.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, while I think that QQQI is a better play than QQQ in the current environment, I am steering clear of both in favor of much more attractively valued and risk-positioned opportunities in the midstream and software lending space in my 7-8% yielding, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/52820996-high-yield-investor/6260770-our-portfolio-track-record-results-through-february-14-2026\">total return outperforming,</a> and below-market beta portfolios at <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/1369-high-yield-investor\">High Yield Investor</a>.</p>",

ODD’s portfolio includes its own brands, Il Makiage, SpoiledChild, and the newer telehealth concept MethodIQ. Recently, the company has faced challenges with an abnormal spike in user acquisition costs tied to changes<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> in Meta Platforms’ (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">META</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) ad delivery algorithms.

ODD sells beauty products through its digital platform, and most of its revenue is from online DTC sales. Other revenue streams represent a minor contribution, such as selling through a local Israeli channel and marketing affiliates. ODD’s platform operates the company’s own brands. And they’re also responsible for the development of these in-house brands for consumers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Similarly, ODD’s physical products are manufactured for third parties under contract. In that sense, their <a href=\"https://investors.oddity.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oddity-launches-methodiq-telehealth-platform-reimagining-medical/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.oddity.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oddity-launches-methodiq-telehealth-platform-reimagining-medical/\" target=\"_blank\">brand portfolio</a> includes Il Makiage, SpoiledChild, and MethodIQ. Il Makiage is a beauty brand, best known for online shade-matching and complexion products. SpoiledChild is a brand focused on skin and hair, which is built around personalization. Lastly, MethodIQ is a newer brand concept described as a telehealth platform offering customized treatments in dermatology areas, such as acne, hyperpigmentation, and eczema.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277897212162_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"858\" data-height=\"477\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277897212162_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Earnings Presentation.

It has an internal brand incubator called <a href=\"https://www.oddity.com/about\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.oddity.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">New Ventures</a>, launched in 2019, created to develop and test new product categories using ODD’s technology, which includes data science for customer segmentation and product strategy. Likewise, this pipeline optimizes for responsive digital marketing for testing of ads and offers with creative iterations, as well as molecular discovery for screening potential ingredients. In fact, ODD’s incubator also predicts the product’s properties and uses hyperspectral vision for capturing images to make more precise skin analysis for improved diagnostics.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277894232457_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"861\" data-height=\"478\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277894232457_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Earnings Presentation.

These tools improve product matching, marketing efficiency, and product development. Plus, they use a layer of <a href=\"https://investors.oddity.com/static-files/fb1c708c-a78b-49d7-87f5-9cc3629fc147\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.oddity.com/static-files/fb1c708c-a78b-49d7-87f5-9cc3629fc147\" target=\"_blank\">shared data</a> that feeds across their platforms. The company states that they’ve so far collected over 2 billion individual signals from 68 million users, like quiz answers, shade and skin inputs, browsing behavior, purchases, and others. And ODD flags this as a competitive advantage because, as more users generate data, this loops back into their machine learning models for better conversion, retention, and efficiency, which is at the core of their growth flywheel.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation And Risk Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, from a valuation perspective, ODD currently trades at a $790.7 million market cap. Its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/19181317\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/19181317\" target=\"_blank\">latest 6-K</a> shows they ended 2025 with $402.2 million in cash and $373.7 million in marketable securities (short and long term). That amounts to approximately $775.9 million in liquid resources against $584.4 million in financial debt (exchangeable note). Using those figures, I estimate ODD’s EV at roughly $599.2 million. And if we compare it to its Q4 revenues of $152.7 million (annualized $610.8 million), it implies a quite cheap EV/S of 1.0. For comparison, their sector’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ODD/valuation/metrics\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ODD/valuation/metrics\" target=\"_blank\">median EV/S</a> is much closer to 1.5, so it would appear that investors are likely pricing in a major contraction in their topline or margin deterioration.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277894641037_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1061\" data-height=\"572\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277894641037_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Earnings Presentation.

For a digital-first DTC company, paid ads are a core growth lever. If UAC spikes unexpectedly, growth can slow, and margins can compress. ODD also stated that the dislocation was tied to META’s changes related to its ad delivery and targeting algorithm. And naturally, this now casts doubts about ODD’s <a href=\"https://dkeithwilson.com/research/zynga-case-study/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://dkeithwilson.com/research/zynga-case-study/\" target=\"_blank\">platform risk</a> and its dependence on META. After all, a good example of platform risk was Zynga, which was another rapidly growing company that relied heavily on META. Yet, after META implemented changes to its mobile gaming policies, Zynga’s business quickly dwindled.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So it’s unsurprising to see that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557790-oddity-tech-falls-again-after-bull-ratings-are-pulled-on-wall-street\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557790-oddity-tech-falls-again-after-bull-ratings-are-pulled-on-wall-street\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street downgraded</a> ODD, and Bank of America warned that the problem is widespread, affecting acquisitions broadly across brands. Beauty is competitive, and if online acquisition becomes less efficient, brands with a strong retail presence may gain the upper hand in acquiring customers physically relative to online discovery. For example, companies like Sephora and Ulta, among others, don't rely as heavily on online channels.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277895320947_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1278\" data-height=\"719\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277895320947_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Earnings Presentation.

February 2026.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, ODD could be at risk of losing considerable market share if it can’t adapt and acquire new customers. But, <a href=\"https://investors.oddity.com/static-files/fb1c708c-a78b-49d7-87f5-9cc3629fc147\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.oddity.com/static-files/fb1c708c-a78b-49d7-87f5-9cc3629fc147\" target=\"_blank\">historically</a>, ODD’s revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth have been consistent. And even if it were to level off at where it is today, it would suggest that ODD may be a viable contrarian “<em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"853036071\">buy</em>” despite the prevailing pessimistic sentiment. However, if I instead add their <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/19181317\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/19181317\" target=\"_blank\">2025 cash flows</a> from operations and CAPEX (a cash burn proxy), it would appear ODD remains cash flow positive, but to a lesser extent. Using this approach, I estimate ODD generated approximately $83.6 million in 2025, which showcases they’re not in a death spiral stage just yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But it’s worth mentioning that, so far, Meta hasn’t published a note explaining what they have changed in detail, which could help explain ODD’s current conversion issues. ODD said that the <a href=\"https://investors.oddity.com/static-files/2f1638d6-7525-448b-aacf-da1fae2879b6\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.oddity.com/static-files/2f1638d6-7525-448b-aacf-da1fae2879b6\" target=\"_blank\">algorithm</a> diverted it to lower-quality auctions at abnormally high costs, meaning that ad placements convert less because they are directed to audiences that are less likely to <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"853036071\">buy</em>. Moreover, auctions are not only less productive but also more expensive compared to historical performance.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772227791258213_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1316\" data-height=\"747\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772227791258213_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Earnings Presentation.

February 2026.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, ODD may need to diversify across channels with ads through Google, TikTok, affiliates, influencers, and partnerships to reduce its dependence on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874828-oddity-tech-ltd-odd-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874828-oddity-tech-ltd-odd-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">Meta</a>. However, as you might imagine, these types of changes are structural and will likely require a longer repair cycle. ODD may even need to rethink its whole marketing strategy, as ads on Google work differently from ads on <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"facebook\" htloopnumber=\"853036071\">Facebook</em> or Instagram. Also, according to Bank of America, a more concrete solution for ODD’s marketing issues may take at least until 2027 to show results.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Cautious Contrarian “<em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"853036071\">Buy</em>”</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I feel ODD’s business is now definitely challenged. The reality is that we don’t know yet the true extent of their problems that may arise from Meta’s recent policy changes. If we later learn that ODD can make a few tweaks and continue operating as usual, then I think the stock would bounce very quickly. On the other hand, if Meta’s changes are structural and require a fundamental pivot in the way ODD conducts its marketing strategy, then this contrarian “<em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"853036071\">Buy</em>” may take much longer to fully play out. However, at such a deep discount, I feel ODD is now worth speculating with a small bullish position at these levels. Just make sure you keep your position sizing under control.</p>",

After thinking over the issue for a few days, we felt that the analysis could use a follow-up. That analysis focused more on pointing out the flaws of common indicators such as high P/E without really offering alternative ideas to diagnose the market.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With this background, our goal in this article is quite simple. I will explain why and how I use junk bond rates as a leading signal for the equity market. I’ve been experimenting with this idea for more than a decade by now, and my winning odds are good. The ideas apply to all major equity indices I’ve experimented with (such as the <span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJI\" title=\"Dow Jones Industrial Average Index\">DJI</a></span>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\">SP500</a>, and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COMP:IND\">NASDAQ</a>, and also small cap (RTY)). But for the sake of brevity, this article will use the SP500 index as the primary example.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I assume most investors can agree on the close relationship between corporate bonds and stocks. There are simply the two sides of the same coin. As such, I will focus my attention on explaining why I particularly like to use junk bonds but no other bonds (say, investment-grade bonds). In a nutshell, I am more interested in junk bond rates because A) they change more sensitively to corporate fundamentals, and B) they serve as a more effective depth indicator than bonds with better investment grades. In our experience, many (probably most) investors hold sizable bond positions of treasury and investment grade bonds regardless of market conditions. But due to their weaker credit ratings, junk bond rates change sensitivity to investors’ risk appetite. When junk bond yields are unusually low, it indicates to me that investors’ risk appetite has expanded to include assets with questionable financial strength. I am not usually too worried about assets with high quality (like the Mag 7) trading at high multiples. But when assets of sub-par qualities are also trading with a premium, I begin to be concerned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the above understanding, let’s examine the current status of junk bond rates and analyze the implications for the SP500.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Historical perspective</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To provide the perspective needed in this article, I first need to find junk rates data for a sufficiently long period of time. For the purpose, the chart below displays the dividend yield from the Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Fund Investor Shares (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VWEHX\" title=\"Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Fund Investor\">VWEHX</a>). The VWEHX mutual fund is the oldest junk bond fund I can find, with data dating back to 1978, as seen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087769289606_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1554\" data-height=\"509\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087769289606_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"210\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087769289606_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087769289606_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087769289606_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087769289606_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Per the fund's latest discourse as of Dec 31, 2025 (see the next chart below), VWEHX’s exposure is heavily concentrated in below-investment-grade corporate bonds. Its largest exposure is corporate bonds with BB credit ratings, which account for more than half of its total assets (51.5%). The second largest exposure is toward bonds with a B- credit rating, representing about 1/3 of its total assets (31.5%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the long term, the historical average of the fund’s yield is around 7.76%, as shown. The yield has dipped to as low as about 4.1% amid the epic easing during the COVID pandemic. The yield has climbed up substantially since then and is currently hovering around 6.18%. It is thus lower than the historical average, but not to an alarming degree. And we will further explore the implications next.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-1772208776999011_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1645\" data-height=\"826\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-1772208776999011_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"321\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-1772208776999011_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-1772208776999011_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-1772208776999011_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-1772208776999011_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Vanguard</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Junk bond yield as a leading signal</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To explore the long-term effectiveness of junk bond yields as a leading signal for the equity market, I will need the long-term performance of an equity index fund. On this front, the oldest fund I can find is the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VFIAX\" title=\"Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral\">VFIAX</a>). As a fun fact, when John Bogle first launched the fund in 1976, the fund was mocked as \"Bogle's Folly\" because critics couldn't believe investors would settle for a fund that \"only\" provides average market returns by design.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, the top panel of the next chart shows the price movement of VFIAX in terms of price corrections off high. The bottom panel shows the yield spread of VWEHX relative to fed fund rates approximated by 3-month treasury rates. A quite clear correlation (that is, an inverse correlation) can be seen even from a visual examination between these two panels. The green and red arrows highlighted a few key market events that played a definitive role in the SP500’s returns in the past 50 years or so. These key events included the formation and burst of the dot-com bubble, the 2008 financial crisis, the 2010 European bank crisis, the monetary easing following the COVID-19 breakout, and the subsequent tightening. As seen, amid all key junctures, when the junk bond rates are unusually low relative to risk-free rates, as indicated by the green arrows, the SP500 index suffered a sharp correction shortly afterward due to the fundamental dynamics mentioned in the first section. Such unusually low junk bond rates suggest that the market’s risk appetite has swung too far to the greedy extreme. And the opposite is also true, as highlighted by the red arrows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087772304945_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2419\" data-height=\"1579\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087772304945_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"418\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087772304945_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087772304945_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087772304945_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087772304945_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other risks and final thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If history does rhyme, you can see why I am not too alarmed by the current market conditions. As mentioned earlier, junk bond rates are currently below average but not alarmingly so. The current spread between VWEHX and 3-month treasury rates gave me a very similar assessment. As seen, the current yield spread sits at 2.492%. The bad news for equity investors is that it is below the historical average of 4.83%. The good news is that the spread has thickened considerably from its recent trough and is no longer alarmingly thin. Furthermore, the latest dot plot, announced by the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/money/federal-open-market-committee\" rel=\"nofollow\">Federal Open Market Committee</a> in Dec 2025, shows a path of continued cuts to the fed fund rates in the near future. As you can see from the following screenshot, the dot plot suggests the median expectation of the fed funds rate to decrease from the current level of around 3.6% to around 3.0% in 2027. With everything else being equal, such a decrease could further thicken the yield spread between VWEHX and 3-month treasury rates to about 3.1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To close, the goal of this article is mainly twofold. First, I want to offer an alternative idea, the use of junk bond rates, for investors to diagnose the equity (beyond P/E ratios and rolling-returns in past years). Second, I want to apply this idea to the current market conditions. My diagnosis is that current junk bond rates certainly are on the lower end and worth closely monitoring. But I do not believe it is to an alarming degree to trigger a dramatic departure from the SP500 or other equity index.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087770125518_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087770125518_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087770125518_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087770125518_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087770125518_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087770125518_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FOMC</span></p></figcaption></figure></p>",
