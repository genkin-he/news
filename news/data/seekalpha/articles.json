This would mark the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, a stretch not seen since<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the 2021-2022 emergence from COVID-induced economic shutdowns. Revenue growth was the highest recorded for the index since Q2 2022.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The makeup of the quarter’s results was familiar: The “magnificent” mega-cap stocks led the charge once again, with estimated earnings per share (EPS) growth of 30%. From a sector perspective, technology posted the hottest earnings growth (30%), followed by industrials (26%) and communication services (13%). At the opposite end of the spectrum, consumer discretionary, energy and healthcare showed flat to slightly negative EPS growth in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In another familiar pattern, an impressive 80% of companies beat their EPS estimates, though market reaction was muted relative to history. And as these solid earnings rolled in, S&amp;P 500 Index performance was largely unchanged, with some strong drawdowns countered by equally robust rebounds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why the disconnect between solid earnings and volatile markets? It’s nuanced, but three things keep us optimistic as we look ahead to the start of 2026 earnings:</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>1. Data supports strong 2026 earnings</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings momentum does not appear to be slowing, as indicated by four key factors:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Analyst earnings estimates are climbing.</strong> Data from FactSet suggests another round of double-digit earnings growth in each of the four quarters of 2026, with current estimates placing growth at 14% for the year.</li> <li> <strong>Corporate sentiment is at a record high</strong>, according to a Bank of America analysis that parses positive and negative language in earnings calls.<sup>1</sup> </li> <li> <strong>AI’s impact is broadening</strong>. Earnings calls and surveys show AI-related productivity gains are touching more industries.<sup>2</sup> This could mean further upside to margins, which are already at historic highs (13% in Q4).</li> <li> <strong>More companies are raising guidance</strong> than lowering guidance.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>2. Fundamentals shine across time</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">History has shown that fundamentals drive stock returns over longer time horizons. Yet short-term market action can be fickle and diverge from current fundamentals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at Q4 earnings alongside year-to-date stock returns shows two notable dislocations:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Despite reporting flat year-over-year earnings, <em>energy </em>is the best-performing sector so far this year, as shown in the chart below. This is in response to non-fundamental events, including recent geopolitical developments in Venezuela that could open up this large market to U.S. companies. Stocks of oilfield service and equipment companies rose in reaction. We also saw stock prices react to the cold snap across the U.S. A more than 20% uptick in natural gas prices in a matter of days boosted related stock prices. This illustrates that recent events can trigger transitory price moves that seem divorced from reported earnings.</li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The great divide</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Top- and bottom-performing S&amp;P 500 sectors, YTD total return and Q4 EPS growth</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-1772263921402366_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"907\" data-height=\"560\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-1772263921402366_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Top- and bottom-performing S&amp;P 500 sectors, YTD total return and Q4 EPS growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"395\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-1772263921402366_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-1772263921402366_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-1772263921402366_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-1772263921402366_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: BlackRock Fundamental Equities with data from FactSet as of Feb. 10, 2026.

While earnings were positive across subsectors, dispersion in stock price performance has been outsized. Only <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/insights/the-future-of-semiconductors\" rel=\"noopener\">semiconductors</a> and companies leveraged to the <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/insights/investing-in-ai-infrastructure\" rel=\"noopener\">AI infrastructure buildout</a> are outperforming the broad market year-to-date. Meanwhile, software companies posted earnings results that were double expectations (30% vs. an outlook for 15%) but have undergone the largest 12-month non-recessionary drawdown in 30 years.<sup>3</sup> Even the AI hyperscalers, after delivering stellar Q4 earnings results, are underperforming as larger-than-expected capex spending comes under further scrutiny.</li></ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>3. Dislocations can create opportunities</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Much ink has been spilled on the fear of AI disrupting the business models of software companies. The debate rages on and we are watchful on an individual stock basis. At the same time, we are focused on the <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/insights/insight-on-ai-and-technology-stocks\" rel=\"noopener\">opportunities created by AI</a>. Early-year selling in tech stocks has been indiscriminate in some areas, providing ample opportunity to look for spots where the baby has been thrown out with the bathwater.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One thing seems relatively clear: AI will speed up coding and result in the creation of more content. This has us setting our sights on companies that observe, store and secure data as a potentially misunderstood opportunity. Our view is for AI to continue powering market returns in 2026, even as the complexion of leaders and laggards may change ― a topic we discuss in <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/insights/equity-investors-guide-2026\" rel=\"noopener\">An equity investor’s guide to 2026</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our key takeaway after parsing Q4 2025 earnings and coincident 2026 YTD stock price performance: There will always be worries that move the markets and defy fundamentals. As <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/investment-ideas/fundamental-equities\" rel=\"noopener\">active stock investors</a>, we embrace this as an opportunity to identify mispricings and establish or add to positions in fundamentally sound companies.

For the S&amp;P 500 Index, earnings growth tracked close to 15% year-over-year, marking<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> a fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Management guidance looking ahead to the first quarter of 2026 reflects the strongest tone since 2021, reinforcing the durability of the earnings cycle.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite that strength, price performance has been more restrained. U.S. large cap equities have largely treaded water so far this year, even as fundamentals improved. Beneath the surface, single-stock dispersion has been elevated as markets reassess how AI could <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875174-q1-active-management-pulse-positioning-broadens-beyond-ai-leaders\">reshape business models</a> and influence terminal values over the medium to longer term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This repricing dynamic has been particularly visible in parts of the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4876228-software-selloff-raises-stakes-active-managers\">software sector</a>, where investors are differentiating more deliberately across companies based on perceived competitive positioning and earnings durability.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Diversification regains traction</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another theme this week was the continued benefit of diversification within equity markets. So far this year, market leadership has widened, with both non-U.S. stocks and U.S. small-cap stocks outperforming U.S. large caps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This shift aligns with one of the themes in our <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4858283-2026-global-market-outlook-great-inflection-point\" rel=\"noopener\">2026 Global Market Outlook</a>, which is that market leadership is likely to broaden out this year. Case in point: Through Thursday’s market close, the MSCI All Country World Index excluding the U.S. has gained 11%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, U.S. small-cap equities have risen approximately 8%, while their large-cap counterparts have advanced only 1%. This widening gap suggests participation is expanding beyond the narrow group of mega-cap companies that drove returns in prior years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Curious Move in U.S. Treasuries</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, in the U.S. Treasury market, bond yields have moved lower even as the economic backdrop remains firm. This economic resilience is evident in the latest data. Recent reports have generally surprised to the upside, growth indicators are holding up, and the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4870390-us-jobs-report-tops-expectations\">labor market</a> - which led the Federal Reserve to lower rates late last year - appears to have stabilized.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Under those conditions, Treasury yields would typically move higher. Instead, over the past month, they’ve declined by more than 20 basis points. The yield curve has also “bull-flattened” - meaning longer-term yields have fallen more than shorter-term rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is not the usual pattern when economic data is resilient, and it suggests investors are placing greater emphasis on managing risk. Ultimately, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4868078-market-signals-separating-wheat-from-chaff\">elevated equity volatility</a> and uncertainty around how AI may alter parts of the market have likely contributed to flows into Treasuries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>These views are subject to change at any time based upon market or other conditions and are current as of the date at the top of the page.

This<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> made exploration of mid-sized gas fields very uneconomical, and for developing countries, investing billions of dollars upfront was also a big problem.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Floating LNG changes that equation. Placing liquefaction directly offshore reduces capital intensity, shortens the time to first export to only a few years, and avoids political and environmental friction of onshore plants. For developing nations that cannot put billions of dollars in upfront capex and need export revenue quickly, that is often the only monetization route. This structural advantage is the reason FLNGs have been steadily expanding across West Africa and South America, and why we believe credible operators like Golar are ideally positioned to secure additional long-term contracts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-17721899090426042_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"758\" data-height=\"386\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-17721899090426042_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FLNG Competitive Advantage\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"326\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-17721899090426042_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-17721899090426042_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-17721899090426042_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-17721899090426042_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The economics of the contract are equally important. Golar’s vessels have secured long-term 20-year take-or-pay contracts, where the customer carries much of the operational and commodity risk, while Golar receives relatively stable liquefaction fees. Under these contracts, Golar has downside protection, but it shares in the upside above a specified LNG price. There is also partial CPI indexation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As global demand for flexible LNG infrastructure grows and management actively seeks to secure additional contracts, each additional long-term deployment has the potential to materially expand the cash flow and serve as a natural catalyst for the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just as critical, today’s Golar is much simpler. Previously the company operated across LNG shipping, FSRUs, downstream gas infrastructure, and multiple affiliated entities, which complicated the core economics of the business. All of the businesses except a focused FLNG platform have been sold off. This FLNG platform is currently centered on vessels such as Hilli, Gimi, and MKII, each backed by long-term contracts. New build decisions are linked to securing contracts first, protecting from speculative expansion. This makes the business easier to understand and closer in nature to the contracted infrastructure model. As this cleaner structure becomes more visible through operating cash flows, the valuation multiple applied by the market has room to shift accordingly.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Golar Past, Present &amp; Future</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For a long time, Golar was difficult to understand and even harder to value. The company operated across multiple sectors that included LNG shipping, floating storage and regasification units (FSRUs), downstream gas infrastructure, and a web of affiliated entities and joint ventures. Cash flows moved between structures, assets were periodically dropped down, and the balance sheet reflected a mix of project financing, guarantees, and legacy obligations. None of this was unusual for the LNG world, but it created a level of complexity that kept many long-term investors on the sidelines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This structure also made the business cyclical and unpredictable. Shipping exposure introduced sensitivity to charter rates and capital markets, while downstream and affiliate investments added execution and financing risks that were difficult to model from outside. Even when individual assets performed well, the overall story lacked clarity. Investors were left trying to analyze different businesses with different economics and risk profiles, which led to a discounted valuation multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the past few years this structure has been <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/02/13/3025971/0/en/Sale-of-LNGC-Golar-Arctic-Marks-Golar-s-Exit-From-LNG-Shipping-Segment.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">wound down</a>. LNG carriers were separated, FSRU and downstream positions were sold, and various affiliated interests were simplified or exited. What remained was a singles business centered around liquification vessels. Many investors still anchor to the older, complicated version of Golar rather than the streamlined platform that exists today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Understanding this history is important because it explains the starting point of the current opportunity. The valuation discounts attached to complexity don't disappear immediately after simplification. It usually fades when the new structure starts to produce consistent visible cash flows. Golar is entering this phase where the past will matter less and the economics of the remaining FLNG business will start to dominate the story.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The remaining FLNG business, being fundamentally different from the business Golar used to run, is now far less cyclical and depends less on the charter rates or trading style exposure; revenue now is tied to multiyear leasing agreements with large energy counterparties. Each vessel effectively behaves like a standalone infrastructure project with high upfront capital but, once operational, capable of producing dollar denominated EBITDA for decades. The variability that once defined a company’s earning profile is steadily being replaced by duration and contract visibility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just as important is the <a href=\"https://www.golarlng.com/investors/press-releases/pr-story.aspx?ResultPageURL=https://rss.globenewswire.com/HexMLItem/Content/FullText/Attachments/All/Identifier/3244404/language/en\" rel=\"nofollow\">discipline</a> around growth. Management is no longer pursuing uncontracted asset accumulation and complex structures. New vessels are only sanctioned when a new contract is secured. This “contract first, build second” approach slows the growth but increases the quality of each incremental dollar invested. Over time this produces a cleaner equity story with fewer surprises and more predictable cash flows and clear valuation anchors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-17721899092364728.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FLNG Asset Portfolio\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"577\" height=\"326\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-17721899092364728.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-17721899092364728.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-17721899092364728.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to the FLNG vessels, Golar owns a 10% equity stake in <a href=\"https://www.offshore-energy.biz/golar-secures-flng-charter-as-lng-momentum-in-argentina-builds/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Southern Energy S.A.</a> (SESA). SESA is a newly formed company to unlock LNG exports in Argentina. SESA is owned by Pan American Energy (30%), YPF (25%), Pampa Energia (20%), Harbour Energy (15%), and Golar (10%). Effectively, SESA is a public-private partnership to incentivize LNG production by aligning state interests (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/YPF\" title=\"YPF Sociedad Anónima\">YPF</a>) with private sector operators (Golar, etc.).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Misunderstood Mechanic</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For many investors, Golar is still mentally grouped with LNG producers, shippers, or other energy names whose earnings rise and fall with commodity prices. This framing feels intuitive because the company trades in the gas value chain. But economically it is inaccurate, as once the FLNG vessel is operational, the majority of Golar's revenue is not tied to the commodity price itself but to fixed long-term leasing agreements that pay for liquefaction capacity rather than the commodity being sold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This distinction matters more than it first appears. Commodity businesses are valued on cycles, margins, and forward price curves. Infrastructure assets are valued on duration, contract quality, and cash flow visibility. As Golar’s portfolio shifted towards FLNG, the lens through which the company is valued should change as well. Yet market perception often lags structural reality, leaving the shares trading closer to cyclical energy multiples than long-duration infrastructure ones.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is a second layer of misunderstanding. Since FLNG projects require years of construction before generating cash, the income statement can look stagnant before a major step in change in earnings. When a vessel moves from redevelopment into full operation, the EBITDA doesn’t grow gradually; it resets in discrete jumps tied to contract commencement. Investors focused on near-term reported numbers may miss this timing dynamic, even though it is precisely how value is created in project-based infrastructures.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taken together, these two mechanics, commodity insulation &amp; step change cash generation, help explain why Golar can appear optically cyclical while becoming economically stable. The market often recognizes that shift only when cash flows are actually visible, not while they are still forming.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">FLNG Contract Details</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The easiest way to understand Golar is to focus only on the three vessels that define the company’s future economics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-17721899090288253_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"770\" data-height=\"402\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-17721899090288253_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Contract Details\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"334\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-17721899090288253_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-17721899090288253_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-17721899090288253_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-17721899090288253_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.golarlng.com/~/media/Files/G/Golar-Lng/documents/annual-reports/2024-annual-report-form-20-f-golar-lng.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">FLNG Gimi</a>, a vessel of 2.5 mtpa, is located at the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim project offshore Mauritania &amp; Senegal. The vessel runs under a 20-year agreement with BP extending into 2045. Golar’s effective economic interest is about 70%, while the remainder is owned by BP, translating into roughly $150 million of annual EBITDA for Golar generated primarily through fixed lease payments. This translates into roughly $3 billion dollars of EBITDA backlog over the contract term. There is no commodity linkage, and the CPI indexation was not explicitly disclosed. The absence of commodity linkage makes the contract completely indifferent to the LNG prices. The heavy conversion capex is already spent, leaving only maintenance capex requirements going forward. Gimi is functioning as the company’s first long-duration cash flow anchor, establishing a stable earnings base.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.golarlng.com/~/media/Files/G/Golar-Lng/documents/annual-reports/2024-annual-report-form-20-f-golar-lng.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">FLNG Hilli</a>, a 2.45 mtpa vessel, is still operating under a legacy contract in Cameroon, which expires in mid-2026. Its economic relevance lies in the redeployment to Argentina under a new 20-year charter with Southern Energy S.A. expected to begin around 2027. Under this contract, base income alone implies roughly $285 million of annual EBITDA, materially higher than the current contract. This base income translates into a backlog of $5.7 billion covering the contract term running till 2047. The agreement also incorporates a balanced commodity participation framework. Golar receives about 25% of LNG prices above $8/MMBtu, while downside exposure is limited by a floor of $6/MMBtu. If LNG prices go down to $6 and Golar earns less than the base income for a period of time, then there is a provision in the contract that allows them to recoup that lost revenue when LNG prices go back above $7.5. After year 6 there is also a partial CPI indexation that provides real return protection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.golarlng.com/~/media/Files/G/Golar-Lng/documents/annual-reports/2024-annual-report-form-20-f-golar-lng.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">MKII FLNG</a>, a 3.5 mtpa vessel, is currently under conversion for Argentina. There is roughly $2.2 billion in conversion capex ahead of the expected start-up around 2028. The 20-year SESA charter implies approximately $400 million of annual base EBITDA, and a total backlog of $8 billion over the contract period. All of the other contract dynamics are the same as FLNG Hilli.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-1772190329217416_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1523\" data-height=\"625\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-1772190329217416_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Golar contract details\" width=\"640\" height=\"263\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"263\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-1772190329217416_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-1772190329217416_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-1772190329217416_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-1772190329217416_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Moat Investing</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Argentina naturally sounds like the part of the story that should worry investors, and operating there does come with real political risks and regulatory uncertainty. Both SESA and Golar have been given strong protections and guarantees that significantly de-risk the venture. The agreements are governed by <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GLNG/earnings/GLNG-Q4-2025-earnings_call-399363.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">English law,</a> with disputes handled through International Chamber of Commerce arbitration, and payments are made entirely in USD, which removes local currency exposure. SESA has also secured a 30-year uninterrupted LNG export license. On top of that, Argentina has introduced the RIGI framework, which effectively fixes the regulatory and tax regime for the duration of the investment. None of this makes the jurisdiction risk-free, but it does suggest a structure that was designed to limit the risks that concern the investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One detail that is important to highlight the relationship between the stakeholders is how closely the stakeholders are connected with each other. FLNG Gimi is contracted to BP which also owns a 30% economic interest. BP is not just paying a fee to use the vessel but is also exposed to the same long-term cash flows. The other two vessels, Hilli and MKII, are contracted to SESA, where Golar owns a 10% stake in SESA. These kinds of relations don’t eliminate risks but are reassuring nonetheless, as they suggest a relationship that is more anchored than a typical service contract.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management is actively marketing a 4<sup>th</sup> vessel contract. They were in the <a href=\"https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/09f4c5d2-f034-4720-986d-342907f92174\" rel=\"nofollow\">process of ordering</a> long lead items in Q4 2025. They have started to look for and identify donor vessels, and the construction times for all three new designs have been confirmed.

The right way to think about the business is not through next year’s earnings but through the NPV of these long-dated contracts that define the business now. Our valuation, therefore, is based on contract by-contract NPV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I want to touch on a less complicated part of valuation first, which is valuing Golar's stake in SESA. Currently LNG is trading around $11/MMBtu; as per the company’s own estimates, SESA would contribute around $90 million in EBITDA at this price. We will use $10 of LNG price as reference, which translates to an EBITDA of $70 million, applying an 8x multiple, which is consistent with publicly traded E&amp;Ps; Golar's stake is valued at $460 million. This translates to a per-share value of $4.5.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-177218990901781_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1397\" data-height=\"754\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-177218990901781_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Contracted EBITDA\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"345\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-177218990901781_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-177218990901781_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-177218990901781_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-177218990901781_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We will value the current contracts in two parts: first, the NPV of the current cash flows at base prices, and second, the NPV of the commodity upside part.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The effective tax used for the NPV is 7.5%, as the tax burden on the company is structurally low. Key cash flows are generated through offshore Mauritania/Senegal and Argentina’s RIGI investment regime, both of which provide stability and reduced taxation for foreign capital. In addition, large depreciation shields from vessel conversion capex further reduce taxable income in early years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Once vessels are operating, the business becomes light on recurring capital needs. Ongoing requirements are largely limited to modest maintenance capex typical of maritime infrastructures. We are going to use a modest number for this in our NPV calculations. There is still redeployment capex on Hilli and conversion capex on the MKII and these should be accounted for in NPV. I have estimated that the redeployment capex is around $400 million and the conversion capex to be $1.2 billion, and these are spread into the next three years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly, the discount rate used is 7%. This reflects the hybrid risk profile of the assets: not sovereign risk-free but also far removed from the commodity-exposed upstream LNG. With 20-year take-or-pay contracts, strong counterparties, and infrastructure like visibility once operational, the economics sit closely to contracted energy infrastructure. A mid-single-digit discount rate is therefore appropriate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using these assumptions and excluding inflation indexation and commodity upside, the NPV of the current contracts falls in the range of $40 and $45 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving onto the commodity upside part. As per the company’s estimates, the commodity link part will add $30 million in EBITDA for Hilli and $40 million for MKII for every $1 increase achieved in FOB price above the reference price of $8/MMBtu. Assuming this increase is sustained over the contract term and using the same tax and WACC, this incremental EBITDA would translate into $5.74 per share. The purpose of keeping this potential upside separate from the base cash flows is that everyone has different views on the prices of LNG and we won’t make the mistake of trying to model LNG prices 20 years into the future. This has given an estimate of how much incremental EBITDA per $1 increase in LNG prices would be worth per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We don’t have to make an attempt to value the CPI indexation and new FLNG contracts, as they are not baked into the price. From the valuation analysis, we can conclude that the current share price largely reflects the value of existing contracts alone, without credit for commodity-linked upside, value of the stake in SESA, new FLNG contracts that management is actively pursuing, and CPI indexation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, investors are not paying for any growth. Yet the structural advantages of FLNGs—lower capital intensity, faster deployment, and strong global demand for gas monetization—suggest additional contracts are more likely than not over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another thing that gets overlooked is Golar's continued focus on returning capital to shareholders. In the last 5 years, the company has repurchased $228 million in shares, paid $261 million in dividends, and bought back assets worth $323 million. In June 2025, the company purchased an additional 2.5 million shares in connection with a convertible bond offering, and in November 2025, the board authorized a new $150 million buyback program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-1772189909056559_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1220\" data-height=\"619\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-1772189909056559_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shareholder Returns\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"325\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-1772189909056559_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-1772189909056559_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-1772189909056559_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53049850-1772189909056559_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As with any business, Golar doesn’t come without any risks. This is not a business exposed to daily commodity swings or short-cycle demand shifts. Instead, the real risks lie in a smaller number of high-impact variables.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest risk is execution, Hilli redeployment, and MKII conversion still require capital, timing discipline, and technical delivery. Delays or cost overruns would not permanently impair the business, but they would shift cash flow timing and postpone the step change the market is waiting to see.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second is jurisdictional and counterparty risk. FLNG projects operate in emerging and politically complex regions. Contracts are long-term and structured for durability, but over multidecade periods, regulatory change, fiscal pressure, or political instability can never be ruled out entirely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is also a macro risk. Even though contracted FLNG cash flows are largely insulated from LNG spot prices, the shares can still move with broader energy sentiment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capital allocation discipline is very critical in capital-intensive industries. Although the management has vowed not to develop another vessel without getting the contract first, the long-term outcome still depends on management maintaining this restraint when new opportunities emerge. In capital-intensive sectors, value is often determined less by the first project than by the decisions that follow that early success.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market appears to be roughly valuing Golar in line with the NPV of the current contracted vessels at base prices. In other words, investors are only paying for what is already signed and largely visible.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What does not seem to be reflected is the value of the SESA stake, the commodity-linked upside in the Argentina contracts, and the probability of additional FLNG contracts. None of these require aggressive modelling. They simply require time and execution. The base contracts already exist, the equity participation is already funded, and the management is actively marketing new MKI &amp; MKIII vessels under the same contract-backed framework.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That asymmetry is what makes the setup interesting. The downside is being anchored to the long-term contracts. The upside comes from elements that are either contractual but unpriced or structural and likely to emerge over time.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The story does not depend on blind hope. It depends on the market gradually realizing the existing base is real and anything layered on top of it is incremental.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASH\" title=\"Ashland Inc.\">ASH</a></span>) is a specialty chemicals company that over time has realigned its business away from commodity chemicals in order to focus more on specialised products to serve a wide range<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> of pharmaceutical, personal care, and additives markets. These tend to be higher-value products, often with patent protection, where performance is more important to customers than price alone and any cyclicality is much less pronounced. While Ashland still retains some exposure to such end markets, following the spin-off of Valvoline in 2017, company-level EBIT margins have improved from under 7% in FY17 (the year to September 2017) to over 9% in FY25.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that despite a recent jump in the shares following the news that an activist investor has taken a stake, the shares still present an investment opportunity given an apparent discount valuation, despite the undoubted remaining volatility in certain markets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Where the company is now</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a significant amount of portfolio right-sizing and reconfiguration, Ashland has changed significantly even within the last five years, although the most recent major disposal was nearly a year ago, with the March 2025 sale of underperforming Avoca (fragrance fixatives and botanical extracts). The company currently reports results under the following four divisions:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Life sciences (around 36% of sales at 1Q26 and 42% of pre-corporate cost EBITDA). This supplies excipients and tablet coating systems to the pharmaceutical and nutrition industries, as well as a variety of crop care and agricultural products.

It sells to Life Sciences, Personal Care and Specialty Additives, as well as a variety of external customers. It is not today a major profit center.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is growth, though Ashland won’t be a greyhound</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 2025 <a href=\"https://investor.ashland.com/static-files/c79f4254-f8c1-422c-80a4-32e84ac37507\" rel=\"nofollow\">Innovation Day presentation</a> made the case for a number of significant opportunities across the platforms. Notable highlights include:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Bioresorbable polymers and other injectables, the $750m market for which is growing at 7%. Ashland is targeting a share of 15-20%.</li> <li>Tablet coatings, a $360m market growing at 3%, where they believe they can target second place at 15-25% share.</li> <li>Super wetting agents for coatings, a $280m market growing at 3-4%, where the company currently has no material presence but expects to get to at least a 10% share in time</li> <li>TVO metalworking fluids, a $400m market with mid-single digit growth and a potential share of 10-30%</li> <li>TVO dielectric EV battery coatings, currently a $550m market growing at 9%, with a targeted share of 10-30%.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I don't believe that any of these opportunities is going to individually transform Ashland into a high-multiple growth stock, they do illustrate that the company has a runway for growth across a range of disciplines.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ashland is arguably a more coherent entity than a few years ago, although some cyclicality remains</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, one of the striking things from this presentation was the extent to which today’s Ashland has a degree of integration right across the company. For example, all three of the main divisions sell products based on Cellulosics (39% of total company sales in FY25) and PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidones, 25% of total sales). Furthermore, these two categories now amount to a combined <a href=\"https://investor.ashland.com/static-files/6915b9d4-9fac-4f1e-97f9-a2a6d78b5c18\" rel=\"nofollow\">64% of total sales</a>, whereas as recently as FY20, this was <a href=\"https://investor.ashland.com/static-files/5ff618dd-3f13-48e8-a39f-b962eb2e592e\" rel=\"nofollow\">only 51%</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another illustration of this phenomenon is this slide showing three highlighted areas of new product development: transformed vegetable oil (TVO), wetting agents, and neutralizers:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772121735706115_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1221\" data-height=\"659\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772121735706115_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Ashland technology performance and breadth across segments\" width=\"640\" height=\"345\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"345\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772121735706115_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772121735706115_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772121735706115_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772121735706115_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ashland Innovation Day</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, it is noteworthy that all management expects all three main divisions to benefit from innovation in these areas (CASE is Coatings, Adhesive, Sealings and Elastomers which is primarily within Speciality Additives).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, there is no escaping the fact that there are still areas that periodically suffer from cyclical weakness, such as the Specialty Additives exposure to the Chinese coatings and construction market, which has been weighing on results in recent quarters. Plant outages both at Ashland and its customers also rather muddied the waters in the most recent quarter. Also worth noting is that the presentation acknowledges that the construction part of Specialty Additives is merely <a href=\"https://investor.ashland.com/static-files/c79f4254-f8c1-422c-80a4-32e84ac37507\" rel=\"nofollow\">an area to ‘optimize’</a>, rather than grow (discussed later).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cost discipline is helpful, but not a complete game-changer</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the <a href=\"https://investor.ashland.com/static-files/07e96564-e37b-4298-9c80-f969d66be3f9\" rel=\"nofollow\">December 2024 strategy day</a>, management outlined a program of $90 million of cost savings to be executed from FY25 to FY27. The first $30 million tranche was exceeded in FY25 and the progress so far for FY26 is essentially on target, with $50-55 million of savings from cellulosic and PVV plant optimization and potential for around $5 million of upside if Chinese markets modestly recover. Although not transformative, in the context of consensus EBITDA of $405 million for FY26 (with updated guidance at 1Q26 of a range of $400-420 million), clearly these amounts are material.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These ongoing capital efficiency efforts predate the building by an activist investor of a significant position, although it remains to be seen if this becomes a bone of contention.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">There’s a new shareholder in town</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Standard Investments, the investment arm of privately held Standard Industries, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4526973-ashland-gains-as-standard-investments-discloses-stake-of-57\">emerged on 1 December 2025</a> as a shareholder with economic exposure to Ashland of 9.9% of the shares in December. Shares rose sharply on the day and are now up around 19% from the close the day before the announcement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, the share price response is principally due to Standard Investments’ recent track record as an activist in the sector, for example, the prolonged engagement with the UK’s Johnson Matthey plc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JMPLY\" title=\"Johnson Matthey Plc\">JMPLY</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JMPLF\" title=\"Johnson Matthey Plc\">JMPLF</a>), which started in 2022. This culminated in a public and frank exchange of views over the company’s strategy from December 2024, which was followed a few months later by Johnson Matthey’s <a href=\"https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/uk/johnson_matthey/rns/regulatory-story.aspx?cid=289&amp;newsid=1946537\" rel=\"nofollow\">sale of its leading catalytic converter business</a> to Honeywell (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HON\" title=\"Honeywell International Inc.\">HON</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">News of the Johnson Matthey/Honeywell deal prompted a 30% rise in the former’s share price in one day, with sustained strength since then (at least until the announcement a few days ago that the agreement may founder without a much lower sale price).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors should also be aware that another arm of Standard Industries made the <a href=\"https://www.standardindustries.com/standard-industries-holdings-to-acquire-grace/\" rel=\"nofollow\">outright cash purchase</a> of catalyst and materials technologies specialist W.R. Grace at a steep premium of 59%, having held a 14.9% stake prior to that takeover deal. And so clearly Standard Industries is a very serious participant in the specialty chemicals space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this overall context, it isn’t surprising that Ashland’s shares rose sharply on the news of the activist investor’s stake. Some caution is warranted, however. Following a sustained period of disposals of non-core businesses and other portfolio pruning and expansion, it’s arguably not entirely obvious what major, comparable shake-up (to that of Johnson Matthey) Standard Industries might be able to persuade or pressurize management into pursuing. A possible candidate is the disposal or wind-down of the construction business, given its apparent non-core status, as mentioned earlier.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The valuation is still intriguing</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the recent jump in the shares, in my view, the shares still look somewhat attractively valued.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In absolute terms, at $62.42 and with consensus EPS for FY26 at $3.92, Ashland trades at around 16x 2026 earnings and 15.2x 12m forward earnings, slightly towards the lower end of its post-Valvoline range (spin-off completed in 2017). This is despite the company still experiencing what may be trough earnings in parts of the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772123305241823_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2400\" data-height=\"1240\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772123305241823_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Ashland fwd P/E since Valvoline spin\" width=\"640\" height=\"331\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"331\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772123305241823_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772123305241823_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772123305241823_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772123305241823_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Ashland forward 12m P/E <span>(Koyfin)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a peer-group relative basis, the shares again look potentially interesting. While Ashland has no exact rival with a truly similar set of businesses, in the following table, I’ve selected a group that I believe collectively provides some useful perspective:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-17721243001821003_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"896\" data-height=\"284\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-17721243001821003_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Comparison table of Ashland versus chemicals peers\" width=\"640\" height=\"203\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"203\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-17721243001821003_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-17721243001821003_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-17721243001821003_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-17721243001821003_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Ashland comparison versus peers <span>(Koyfin)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This selected peer group is ranked by EBITDA margin from highest to lowest. As you can see, specialty chemical peers that achieve mid-teens to low 20% EBITDA margins tend to be awarded double-digit EV/EBITDA multiples. The exceptions are Axalta Coating Systems (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXTA\" title=\"Axalta Coating Systems Ltd.\">AXTA</a>), currently the subject of a merger proposal with Akzo Nobel NV (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AKZOF\" title=\"Akzo Nobel N.V.\">AKZOF</a>), (AXZOY), and Ashland.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If the market were to change its mind and reward Ashland with, say, an 11x EBITDA multiple, the potential upside is to $73.30, around a 17% return.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Most intriguingly, forward estimates for Free Cash Flow suggest a significant valuation anomaly. Here are consensus estimates for the group on a forward-looking basis:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-17721252924710388_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1051\" data-height=\"322\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-17721252924710388_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Ashland and peers free cash flow forecasts\" width=\"640\" height=\"196\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"196\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-17721252924710388_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-17721252924710388_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-17721252924710388_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-17721252924710388_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Ashland and peers forecast free cash flow yield <span>(Koyfin)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notably, Ashland has the highest FCF yield. This is based on a consensus conversion of EBITDA to FCF of over 60%. Even if this proves a little optimistic given <a href=\"https://investor.ashland.com/static-files/cabde9a4-037e-4be5-beba-c9c275cec552\" rel=\"nofollow\">management guidance</a> for a target of over 50% conversion, it is still rather a high yield compared to peers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a tightening to an FCF yield of perhaps 5.5%, the implied share price is $76.46, or 22% upside from current levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks</strong>: Risks include the economic cycle, geopolitical uncertainty, trade policies, raw material cost volatility, and foreign exchange fluctuations.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ashland has continued to skew its business lines towards more attractive markets, but some challenges remain. I believe that the market is overly discounting the shares and that there is scope for material upside from here.</p>",

Despite the GenAI wave starting around 2022, the <strong class=\"paywall-full-content\">overall growth</strong><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> of the tech world has not changed significantly over the past 3 years or so, as will be shown later in this article. A similar growth trajectory has been the case for Microsoft's total sales growth. Even though the last quarter's earnings reported by MSFT in late January have been more positive than I expected at my </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824614-microsoft-no-big-catalyst-in-sight-amid-ai-bubbling\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">last coverage</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">, the revenue growth average has been at a similar level in the mid-14 for the past 3 and 5 years. I will continue to keep the HOLD rating for now, but the stock price looks more interesting for the long-term investors who still have faith in US technology dominance for the reasons explained below.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Company Recent Update</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a predominant industry leader in enterprise IT, Microsoft has maintained its formidable market leadership for a long time, thanks largely to the cloud offerings, which have been strengthened by the AI infrastructure arms race since 2023. Microsoft reported a cloud revenue of $51.5 billion in the last quarter (Q2 of fiscal year 2026), which represented a rapid 26% year-over-year increase. Azure in particular reported an astonishing 39% revenue spike in 2026, driven by huge AI cloud demand for both inference and training workloads.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we look at the overall cloud landscape, Azure has jumped from a distant second public cloud service provider behind Amazon's AWS to a very close second. Azure now holds about 23-28% of the <a href=\"https://turbo360.com/blog/azure-market-share\" rel=\"nofollow\">global cloud market</a>, compared to AWS at 29-31%. I suspect it could surpass AWS in 2026 if a similar growth rate as we have seen in the last quarter can be maintained for a few more quarters down the road.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Organic overall growth in the IT space could be slightly better than I expected. The most recent 17% growth in revenue and the outlook of around mid-teens are still within the range of the updated estimates for the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the heavy investment in AI infrastructure is now at three times the revenue growth rate. The most recent quarterly CapEx spending reached $37.5 billion, a 66% increase year-over-year. Such CapEx spending will continue to eat into its margin in the long run. The current gross margin stands at 68.59%, which is not too bad but is at the lower end of a high-margin software-centric company, which typically stays above 70%. For example, Salesforce is at 77%, while META is at an amazing 82% as a comparison. The year 2026 might be a make-or-break year for Microsoft's Enterprise AI growth push. The \"break\" case will be such that the AI's stuff would not make much of a difference in the long-term IT technology growth, as hyped.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>What's happening in the IT space?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, Microsoft's record spending still demonstrates the company's confidence in future AI growth in the enterprise IT space. This is largely backed by its strong financial results achieved in the past quarters. In fact, the gross margin has remained at a respectable level of 68%, close to 70%, as indicated earlier. As long as such a margin can be maintained, the record CapEx spending should be viewed as a positive sign for growth in the enterprise IT space, at least for one or two years</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gartner has recently forecasted the worldwide<a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-10-22-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-it-spending-to-grow-9-point-8-percent-in-2026-exceeding-6-trillion-dollars-for-the-first-time#:~:text=Gartner%20Forecasts%20Worldwide%20IT%20Spending,Trillion%20For%20the%20First%20Time\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\"> IT spending</a> to be $6.08 trillion in 2026, which represents a growth of 9.8% from 2025. Under such IT spending conditions, I believe MSFT should be able to keep its growth momentum in 2026 and possibly 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There has been a significant growth scare in the IT (software) space due to the so-called AI disruption. I think that the enterprise AI adoption cycle may not show a big difference from the previous upgrade cycles, such as cloud computing or big data, etc., although AI may sound much more \"exotically\" disruptive. Gartner's <strong>9.8%</strong> growth in IT spending in 2026, as indicated in the above link, shows a more progressive growth landscape for all the key IT players in this space, including Microsoft. I see AI as going to be a different but just a <em><strong>normal</strong> </em>IT growth cycle that's driven by new technology, as always. The corresponding stock market will ultimately reflect it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Microsoft's recent growth estimates have been updated slightly upwards, above 15%, as shown below</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/44152406-17717521912976093.png?io=w640\" alt=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"307\" height=\"119\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/44152406-17717521912976093.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>MSFT <span></span></span>earnings projections<span> (SA)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This represents a similar growth increase (around 9%) from the previous update and is in line with Gartner's enterprise software spending (15.2%) increase forecast in 2026. On the surface, I believe the estimates appear to be pretty low (or reasonable) bars to beat if we still believe the AI tailwinds. On the other hand, we may see the AI capex spending will start to drop rather significantly sometime in 2026 for Microsoft. In other words, AI software applications and use cases have to step up the growth pace to the next level to justify the infrastructure built out. Unfortunately, this has not been the case for all existing key players in the software space. And the stock market has taken big notice of it recently.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The valuation is more reasonable but still not attractive.</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The growth has been pretty much at a similar level as shown earlier. The stock price itself was pretty much overvalued at above 500; see the history of my coverages in MSFT below:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/44152406-17721793417804246.png?io=w640\" alt=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824614-microsoft-no-big-catalyst-in-sight-amid-ai-bubbling\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"217\" height=\"352\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's MSFT coverages (SA)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now it is at the level of two years ago, around $400, which was roughly where I started my first HOLD rating on MSFT. I am not surprised to see such pricing actions in the market from the longer-term perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, from the short-term perspective, many investors may think that the stock price could have been harshly penalized due to the recent software growth scare. However, with the two-year growth factored in, I think the price is at a more reasonable level, with the PEG ratio representing a much smaller premium (17.54%) over the IT sector mean:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/44152406-17721800362676578_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"680\" data-height=\"238\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/44152406-17721800362676578_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA MSFT data\" width=\"640\" height=\"224\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/44152406-17721800362676578_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/44152406-17721800362676578_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/44152406-17721800362676578_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/44152406-17721800362676578_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>MSFT <span></span></span>Valuation<span> Metrics (SA)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If I use the 5-year average as a reference, the premium has dropped by over 29%. This is perhaps one of the reasons why an insider has purchased shares. Insider buys have typically been rare events for growth stocks such as MSFT.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, given the recent sharp pullback of the technology stocks, many software companies represent a deep PEG discount. Salesforce, mentioned earlier, has a PEG discount of -42.96%. Some of the other names will be covered soon by my future writing-up. I would still rate MSFT as a HOLD at the current level. It may perform as the market in 2026 when the market sentiment on the technology improves. I would recommend looking for other, more promising price recovery opportunities in this space.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risk Analysis</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the case of the slowing IT spending, MSFT's price would suffer much more than the current pullback. Keep in mind that Gartner's software spending growth was slightly reduced for 2026 in the IT estimation mentioned earlier. Whether this would form a trend of much slowing to happen remains to be seen. But it is not a good start.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, the key risk in the IT space at the moment has been the AI infrastructure build-up. The record CapEx spending could eat up the margin very quickly, and the whole AI investing story could be crushed in a hurry if the software side has not shown in 2026 the accelerated growth to catch up with the AI cycle expectations. So far Microsoft has done well with the earnings numbers. The company is required to keep the growth momentum going at least in the next 12 months.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Closing</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite leading the AI technology cycle, Microsoft's stock price has not shown much in the last two years, at around $400. It has a clear advantage in building AI cloud infrastructure to start with, as Microsoft Azure is still seeing 39% growth at the moment. But the main area of enterprise IT software has not shown any obvious sign yet of meaningful, accelerated growth from the AI tailwind. MSFT could serve as a solid long-term hold for typical technology growth at the mid-teens level. The overheated AI hype, on the other hand, may serve as a headwind for the stock price to recover in 2026. I will keep the HOLD rating on MSFT and watch the stock price closely in 2026.</p>",

While some insurers may have worked inflationary concerns into their revised rates post-tariffs, consumers are unlikely to see related rates lowered now, Newsome said.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"I don't think any insurer really changed prices because of the tariff, and I don't think if [the tariffs] go away, you'll see much of an impact as well,\" Newsome said. \"I think the insurance industry will just kind of keep trucking along, and you won't see much of an impact either way.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944718.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shares In U.S. Insurers Make Light Of Supreme Court Tariff Ruling\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"660\" height=\"462\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944718.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944718.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944718.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944718.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Tariff ruling</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a 6-3 ruling <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/24-1287_4gcj.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">released Feb. 20</a>, the Supreme Court held that the Trump administration exceeded its authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose wide-ranging global tariffs, calling much of the administration's economic policy into question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the ruling, Trump has doubled down on the tariffs, signing Feb. 20 an executive order that imposes the 10% tariffs under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. Those went into effect Feb. 24, and Trump has subsequently threatened to raise the tariffs to 15%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some companies in the retail and imports sectors have filed lawsuits seeking reimbursements for tariffs paid to the US government. While those lawsuits remain ongoing, if refunds materialize, insurers are unlikely to be recipients, according to Newsome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"Companies have to show how they were directly impacted, and because insurers are not actually importing or exporting anything, I would be surprised if any saw refunds,\" Newsome said.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Impacts vary by sector</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insurance and insurance-adjacent sectors such as healthcare and asset management reacted differently to the Supreme Court decision, but after a few days, there were only a couple of percentage points difference in terms of overall performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the insurance sector has been largely insulated against the tariffs, the property and casualty sector has some more exposure due to its reliance on imported parts for home and vehicle repairs, among other things susceptible to inflationary pressures, Newsome said.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"When you start looking at where tariffs would potentially create inflation, it's there, but it's just proportionally not as big as other [financial sectors],\" Newsome said.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even with the unpredictable ups and downs, Newsome expects insurers to emerge from this period of volatility in a good position. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944720.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shares In U.S. Insurers Make Light Of Supreme Court Tariff Ruling\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"660\" height=\"462\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944720.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944720.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944720.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944720.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2026/2/shares-in-us-insurers-make-light-of-supreme-court-tariff-ruling-99108701\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

Japan, by contrast, was an isolated feudal backwater, intentionally cut off from the<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> rest of the world since the beginning of the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1603.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Faced with the obvious technical superiority of the West as they stared down the cannon barrels of Perry’s Black Ships, Japan’s leaders realized that nothing short of a far-reaching transformation away from the ossified practices of the ruling samurai class was going to be required.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Via the Meiji Restoration that began in 1868, they succeeded. By the end of the nineteenth century, Japan was a modernized industrial power carving out its own empire to compete with those of its Western peers. In 1905 it defeated one of those peers, the czarist empire of Russia, in the Russo-Japanese War and thus firmly established itself as a player in the great-power politics of the age.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Takaichi Trade</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The point of that little history lesson is that one should never count out Japan and its ability to reinvent itself. For the past thirty-odd years it has been easy to dismiss Japan as a once-strong economy whose time has come and gone. The Nikkei 225 stock index failed to regain its 1989 high point until 2024, 35 years later.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demography, deflation and debt summed up an economy listlessly drifting its way into senescence, stubbornly clinging to a shopworn model while the rest of the world raced ahead with successive generations of game-changing technologies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But recently, the country seems to have shaken off the malaise of these so-called lost decades. That long-suffering Nikkei 225 index has gone from also-ran to world-beating over the past twelve months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_chart_02_27_26.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nikkei 225\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"927\" height=\"572\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_chart_02_27_26.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_chart_02_27_26.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_chart_02_27_26.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_chart_02_27_26.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_chart_02_27_26.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A good portion of this outperformance can be attributed to the emergence of a new political star. Sanae Takaichi is a rarity in the world of Japanese politics in two ways: first, she is a woman, the first of her gender to attain the office of prime minister; and, second, that she is wildly popular.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Her initial victory last October sent the Nikkei surging, even as the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that she heads struggled to piece together a coalition government. It surged again earlier this month when a snap election audaciously called by Takaichi resulted in an LDP victory of historic proportions and a clear green light for the new government to move ahead with its mandate for sweeping economic reform.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Takaichi Trap</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That mandate, though, is not without some potential headwinds. The Takaichi government seeks to implement a major stimulus program to reinvigorate industry, catalyze consumer spending (for example, by eliminating a consumption tax on food products) and establish a stronger geopolitical presence in the region.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This last item, which implies a big investment in Japan’s defense industry, has already created some waves after Takaichi made some supportive remarks in favor of Taiwan, remarks that provoked pointed criticism from China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for the stimulus measures, they are going to have to contend with the Bank of Japan’s attempts to normalize monetary policy and keep a lid on inflation, which has made a somewhat surprising return in the past couple of years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Japanese bond yields have experienced some wobbles of late, as investors try to figure out how the BoJ and the Takaichi government are going to harmonize their respective agendas.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Remembering Shimonoseki</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is, of course, possible that the best-laid plans of the Takaichi government will fail in its attempts to re-establish Japan as a highly productive and energetic economy with world-class products and services. But, as we noted above, it is never wise to count the country out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reaching even farther back into the annals of history, in the late thirteenth century Japan was besieged by the superpower of the day, the Mongol empire of Kublai Khan. After a first encounter in which the Mongols gained some territory but then backed off to regroup, the Japanese built fortified protections strong enough to withstand future assaults.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Attack again the Mongol fleet did, but it failed to penetrate the fortifications, and while the fleet was stranded in the straits of Shimonoseki trying to advance, it was destroyed by a great typhoon – the “divine wind” the Japanese translation of which is “kamikaze.” The Mongols never attacked again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Japan is a highly conservative society with a pronounced resistance to change. But when it puts its mind to it, the country has shown in the past that it is capable of remarkable change in a very short period of time. As nations around the world grope for position in the changing global order, it may be time to give Japan another, closer look.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><a href=\"https://mvfinancial.com/news/mv-weekly-market-flash-japan-rises-again/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Original Post</a></em></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",
