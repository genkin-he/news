It still has a lot of room to grow, few stores, but they have already proven profitable, a large addressable market, everything you want to see from a company in the<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> QSR industry. The valuation isn't that bad either, but still close to my last </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4812980-cava-group-stock-falls-after-despite-q2-eps-beat-but-still-only-a-hold-rating-upgrade\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">article</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">, where I assigned a hold rating precisely because of the price.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And now, <span></span>CAVA Group has just reported its Q4 earnings, which the market liked very much and made the stock jump about 8%. But even so, with this valuation, I would have liked to have seen a better result, especially regarding same-store sales for the quarter and for the outlook. So I'm downgrading CAVA stock to a sell rating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 Earnings: Not Worth 8% Gains</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span></span>CAVA's Q4 results were interesting, with non-GAAP EPS <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556209-cava-group-non-gaap-eps-of-0_04-beats-by-0_01-revenue-of-272_8m-beats-by-4_4m\">beating expectation</a>s by $0.01, which is very significant given that the market was only expecting $0.03, and the top line also positively exceeded market expectations by around $4.4 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The full year was also very solid. Same restaurant sales were up <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874157-cava-group-inc-2025-q4-results-earnings-call-presentation\">4%</a>, which is great considering that industry giants like Chipotle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMG\" title=\"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\">CMG</a>) are struggling. Over 70 new stores were opened, and restaurant margins also remained at an interesting level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733413418236_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"855\" data-height=\"753\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733413418236_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cava FY 2025 highlights\" width=\"640\" height=\"564\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733413418236_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733413418236_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733413418236_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733413418236_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>CAVA<span> Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But Q4, specifically, was not so interesting. Okay, revenue grew 21% with the new openings, but same restaurant sales were only 0.5%. Even though the other quarters had been suffering, this was a worse quarter than the average for the year. The company's explanation was mainly that there was a decrease in guest traffic, which seems quite negative to me, even though the <span></span>CAVA Group managed to sustain a higher price and better mix.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The same occurred with the profit margin at the restaurant level, which fell to 21.4%, and again, seasonally it is also a worse quarter, but note in the image below that in Q4 last year the margin was also slightly higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733412001095_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"964\" data-height=\"797\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733412001095_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q4 2025 Cava Group Highlights\" width=\"640\" height=\"529\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733412001095_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733412001095_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733412001095_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733412001095_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>CAVA<span> Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I did not find anything worrying in terms of margin. Basically, there was an increase in costs related to deliveries and technology, in addition to some costs related to tariffs. So, given the company's momentum, I do not think it is something structurally bad. In addition, moving from the restaurant level to <span></span>CAVA as a company, G&amp;A expenses decreased in relation to revenue, which is very good and shows that the company is able to capture this operational leverage that will be crucial to unlocking value in a few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would even say that this quarter was good for the <span></span>CAVA Group, but if the outlook had been a little better. Management mentioned that it expects to open about 75 stores in 2026, and the profit margin at the restaurant level also has a very reasonable expectation, but my problem was with same-restaurant sales. <span></span>CAVA mentioned that it expects something between 3% and 5%. I know that the momentum is not yet the best, but for the market to have given this “re-rating” to the stock, I expected a much clearer turning point, for example, some mention of a potential return to high single digits, especially since the company is still in a stage of maturation, has several initiatives to undertake, such as digitalization to grow even more, offering new items on the menu, increasing customer loyalty so that they order more often, etc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So overall, I found it to be a quarter that was just reasonable, far from me being sure that <span></span>CAVA will deliver super value to shareholders in the coming years, and as the market cap increased by ~8% in one day, it becomes more difficult to be bullish on the case.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <span></span>CAVA Group Valuation: Not Good Enough Anymore</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The way this quarter impacts valuation, in my view, is more negative than positive. My previous expectation was that <span></span>CAVA Group would reach ~1,000 units in 2032, and it should still achieve this, as it is opening ~75 per year, and if it accelerates to 80 halfway through, it can reach around 995 without too many problems.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But the problem was with revenue per restaurant. Before, I expected something closer to high single-digit growth per year, on average, so the bad momentum would pass and <span></span>CAVA would return to better numbers. But with an outlook between 3% and 5%, it is difficult to be convinced that revenue per restaurant will reach such a high CAGR.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So I changed my assumption to 5% per year revenue per restaurant, and that's considering that they will deliver the top of the guidance and the next few years will be stable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, we are talking about revenue of ~$3.8 billion in 2032. It seems quite feasible to me that <span></span>CAVA will be able to achieve this, but the market cap is at $8.4 billion after today's rise in CAVA stock. The price-to-sales ratio would be 2.2x, and that's after waiting until 2032. For comparison purposes, Dutch Bros (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BROS\" title=\"Dutch Bros Inc.\">BROS</a>), which is not exactly in the same sector but is also a company in the growth phase of the QSR industry, is currently trading at a P/S of 3.6x. Chipotle, which is already more mature, is also trading at a forward P/S of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMG/valuation/metrics\">3.6x</a>. So it seems like a very expensive multiple to me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But let's move on to net income, which is what really matters. If <span></span>CAVA continues to capture margin and reaches something closer to 13.5%, the same assumption as in the last article, we are talking about a net income of $513 million. The implied P/E is 16.4x, and that's after waiting until 2032.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733409797635_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"722\" data-height=\"297\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733409797635_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CAVA assumptions - 2032\" width=\"640\" height=\"263\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733409797635_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733409797635_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733409797635_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/57960026-17719733409797635_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author (Kenio Fontes)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To illustrate how bad this could be, if the market assumes a fair forward P/E of 25x in 2032, we are talking about a total return of 53% in about 6 years. The total return per year would be ~7%, and that is considering that <span></span>CAVA would deliver all of this without many obstacles along the way. Of course, if the momentum is much better than expected and the market assigns some premium, then the valuation makes sense again with an implied total return closer to double digits.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main point for my downgrade is not because I think <span></span>CAVA Group is a bad company. In fact, I agree with the market on the qualitative side; it really is an interesting case. But the reason I see CAVA stock as a sell is mainly my disagreement with the market on valuation. I don't think there is a large margin of safety here, and Q4 earnings brought me more doubts than clarity in terms of revenue compounding over the next few years.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TREX\" title=\"Trex Company, Inc.\">TREX</a></span>) has already lost 27% of its value, justifying my hold and cautious stance before. Now, we are seeing some rebound attempts, driven by its better-than-expected Q4 2025 performance. Its fundamentals are<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> still intact, which ensures sustainability and longevity. However, valuation still shows little upside potential despite the selloff. Technicals have improved, but caution is still advised.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">TREX Q4 2025</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The combined effect of inflationary headwinds and housing market volatility continues to hammer housing-related industries like home furnishings and building products. Trex Company, Inc. is no exception as its sales contraction continues. Yet, its size and domestic market reach still help protect its profitability. This was evident in its most recent performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q4 2025, its sales amounted to <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260224569700/en/Trex-Company-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260224569700/en/Trex-Company-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results\" target=\"_blank\">$161.1M</a>, down by 3.9% YoY from $167.6M. This still spoke a lot about unfavorable market conditions amid weaker purchasing power and demand. It also halted the supposed comeback of the company. If you remember, its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TREX/income-statement\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TREX/income-statement\" target=\"_blank\">Q2 and Q3 2025 performance</a> showed sales recovery. With that, it may still take time to rebound. On a lighter note, TREX beat consensus expectations of $144.7M, which means that the actual sales were 11% higher than expected. It was even above the midpoint guidance range by the company of only $140-150M. It is also worth noting that the most recent YoY sales drop was already more manageable than in my previous coverage at 9.0%. This can tell us that TREX appears to be more adaptable to current market dynamics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But again, it is still having a hard time coping with inflation. Despite its sales contraction, mounting cost pressures continued to take their toll. The operating costs and expenses still increased. As a result, the operating margin was only 2.2%, which was far lower than 18.9% YoY. The only consolation is that TREX sales were still enough to cover all its costs and expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788043086615_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1358\" data-height=\"821\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788043086615_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Income Statement\" width=\"640\" height=\"387\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788043086615_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788043086615_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788043086615_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788043086615_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Income <span></span>Statement (TREX Q4 2025 Release<span></span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Challenges</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stubborn inflation remains a challenge for TREX. At <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi\" target=\"_blank\">2.7%</a>, it is still higher than the Fed's target of 2.0% and close to the 16-month high of 3.0%. We must also understand that positive inflation means rising prices. So, weaker purchasing power and higher cost pressures must also be considered. New tariffs may exacerbate this situation since they typically raise domestic prices. On top of that, TREX has some tariff exposure considering its raw materials for composite decking, like aluminum and steel, sourced outside the US.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Elevated house prices may also have negative spillovers into its business since lower housing demand may affect demand for its products and services. Currently, median prices are experiencing downward pressures. In Q4 2025, the median price was <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS\" target=\"_blank\">$405,300</a>. This was already 8.4% lower than its all-time high of $442,600 in Q4 2022. However, it remains above $400,000 and way higher than pre-pandemic levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788964015026_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1792\" data-height=\"672\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788964015026_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Median Home Price\" width=\"640\" height=\"240\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788964015026_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788964015026_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788964015026_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720788964015026_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Median Home Price (ST.

Because its operations remain profitable, its operating cash flow remains enough to cover capex and buybacks. Its timely debt repayments and issuances also support its cash flow. With that, its cash and cash equivalents nearly tripled in just a year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772078934196727_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"774\" data-height=\"765\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772078934196727_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cash Flow\" width=\"640\" height=\"633\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772078934196727_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772078934196727_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772078934196727_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772078934196727_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cash Flo (TREX Q4 2025 Release<span></span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking into its balance sheet, you can see a little improvement in its inventory management. Meanwhile, borrowings appear to be a concern at first glance since the whole amount will mature within a year. But if you look at its Net Debt/EBITDA Ratio of 0.4x (($133.5M - $3.8M) / $336.0M), the company only needs 0.4x years, or about five months, to repay the whole amount even if it doesn't have to. Even if it uses only 50% of EBITDA, the ratio will still be low at 0.7x. Either way, it needs less than a year to cover the whole borrowing. Hence, its liquidity remains safe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790238457685_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"681\" data-height=\"738\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790238457685_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cash Flow\" width=\"640\" height=\"694\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790238457685_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790238457685_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790238457685_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790238457685_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cash Flow (Author's Computation<span></span>)</p></figcaption></figure> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790616203408_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"656\" data-height=\"731\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790616203408_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Balance Sheet\" width=\"640\" height=\"713\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790616203408_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790616203408_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790616203408_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-17720790616203408_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Balance Sheet (TREX Q4 2025 Release<span></span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you look at external factors, there were some aspects to support TREX. For instance, existing home sales improved by <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/14/existing-home-sales-end-2025-stronger-than-expected.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/14/existing-home-sales-end-2025-stronger-than-expected.html\" target=\"_blank\">5.1%</a> YoY last December. This shows that consumer spending was still resilient despite skyrocketing prices. I think the decrease in the median price helped. More importantly, the recent policy easing cycle encouraged and would encourage more homebuyers. After all, this can also lower mortgage rates in the US. Moreover, lower interest rates can boost economic activity as well as employment and wages to support consumption. Loans and credit cards may become more affordable, so discretionary spending on composite decking may be supported.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To reassess its TREX's valuation, I made updates on the DCF model. As you can see, its FCFF increased a bit in line with the higher-than-expected revenues and earnings. This was crucial since I used the revenue model to estimate it. Meanwhile, I still set its perpetual growth rate at 2.0% to be consistent with the Fed's target inflation. Lastly, I estimated WACC using the capital asset pricing model. Note that I increased its risk premium to 6.0% to price in more risks. I just input 1.00 as its beta, assuming that it will be consistent with the S&amp;P 500. With that, I derived a TP or target price, of $46.47. If I add a 5% risk consideration, it will be $44.15. At its current price, TREX already has some upside potential. However, their actual gap remains narrow. Growth prospects are still too limited to justify any upside beyond my TP.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079140402062_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1343\" data-height=\"545\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079140402062_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DCF Model\" width=\"640\" height=\"260\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079140402062_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079140402062_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079140402062_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079140402062_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">DCF Model (Author's Computation<span></span>)</p></figcaption></figure> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079199485573.png?io=w640\" alt=\"WACC\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"372\" height=\"443\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079199485573.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/61361597-1772079199485573.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">WACC (Authors Computation<span></span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Technicals</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TREX's technicals are starting to become bullish as the price increases with a more pronounced trend. It has also exceeded the 50-day SMA, showing that the current momentum is stronger than the average in the past 50 days. The 50-day SMA has also shifted upwards, which means that recent market sentiments have become more optimistic. The concern is that the most recent dip last Monday, broke below the dip last January 29.

But its sound and intact fundamentals allow it to sustain its operations and take advantage of the recent interest rate cuts. Still, valuation is still not attractive enough to require an upgrade due to limited upside. Technicals have improved but still warrant caution as some indicators remain unfavorable. With that, I'm reiterating my hold rating.</p>",

AI positioning remains crowded, rate<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> cycles are diverging across regions, and dispersion within cyclicals is increasing. At the same time, industrial capex is reaccelerating and fiscal measures are beginning to pull forward demand.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the first quarter progresses, we examine where active managers are expressing optimism, where they are reducing risk, and where they see new opportunity. The message is consistent: conviction in core themes remains intact, but implementation is more disciplined. Managers are refining exposures rather than expanding them.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI remains core, but exposure is shifting</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Managers remain comfortable underwriting a longer-duration AI investment cycle. Industrial and manufacturing spending continues to rise, supported by automation upgrades and deferred investment returning to the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positioning reflects a deliberate effort to manage crowding risk. Oversized positions in hyperscalers and some infrastructure names have been trimmed, alongside profit-taking in prior leaders. Early-stage AI and SaaS names that rallied sharply in 2025 remain underweight across many portfolios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capital is being redirected toward more targeted exposures:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Global memory producers, where allocations rose meaningfully into year-end</li> <li>Semiconductor and hardware supply chains in Asia, tied to processing, electrification, and advanced compute</li> <li>Enterprise adopters and service integrators with visible returns on AI spend</li> <li>Peripheral beneficiaries across electronic components, materials, machinery, and construction</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Among long-short managers, gross AI exposure was seasonally reduced into year-end, though net exposure remained constructive. Rotation, not broad deleveraging, marked the shift.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, managers remain committed to the AI cycle, but with tighter underwriting and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4868078-market-signals-separating-wheat-from-chaff\" rel=\"noopener\">greater sensitivity to earnings durability</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cyclicals advance with valuation discipline</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sentiment across financials and industrials continues to improve. Several value managers believe an upgrade and replacement cycle is forming after years of deferred capital spending. Still, valuation discipline remains central for such participants.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">European banks and U.S. industrial leaders that drove much of the rebound are being selectively trimmed as multiples approach upper ranges. Managers remain constructive on the cycle, though position sizes are being recalibrated, and capital is being recycled into less extended names.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Germany’s fiscal expansion is viewed as highly structural, driving allocations into defense, infrastructure, and niche industrial and technology firms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conversely, the UK has emerged as a contrarian opportunity. Wide valuation dispersion and limited mega-cap AI concentration are creating differentiated opportunities in domestic and SMID-cap stocks. Managers are seeking alternative ideas in a market less dominated by narrow technology stocks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revisiting quality and income</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After prolonged underperformance, selective bottom-up investors are quietly picking up <a href=\"https://russellinvestments.com/content/ri/us/en/insights/russell-research/2026/01/january-global-equity-brief.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">quality defensives</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These managers have added exposure to consumer staples, healthcare, and property and casualty insurers, many of which are trading near multi-year lows. Dividend support and lower-beta characteristics are attractive risk/rewards, playing a role as portfolios balance cyclical exposure with fundamental resilience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Durable growth franchises are also screening well. Diversified financials, niche equipment companies, and scaled consumer brands serving higher-income cohorts are favored for their earnings durability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Among those consumer names, exposure is becoming segmented. Companies tied to travel, retirement living, and premium brands are preferred. Businesses reliant on middle- and lower-income consumers require deeper valuation support before becoming more appealing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Emerging markets show clear divergence</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Emerging markets positioning has become more selective as dispersion widens.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Brazil has moved firmly into overweight territory following severe deratings. Both growth and value managers are adding exposure, favoring financials and industrials, supported by an easing rate cycle and improving real incomes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Asia, allocations to South Korea remain high as managers seek out critical AI bottlenecks, particularly in memory and advanced processing supply chains. Taiwan also has a central role here in terms of next-generation compute and electrification.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Managers remain highly selective on China, focusing on companies with earnings recovery or those with competitive strengths in automation and advanced manufacturing. However, property oversupply and fragmentation limit broader conviction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ASEAN markets face headwinds. Indonesia and the Philippines, for example, continue to struggle with high real rates and slow policy transmission, prompting managers to remain patient and valuation-sensitive.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investor implications</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we move deeper into 2026, equity managers are cautiously confident. Core themes remain intact, but implementation is more refined.

In fact, this story has continued as 2026 has gotten underway. Since my last <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855452-cef-another-fresh-high-and-further-gains-likely-to-follow\">review</a> a few months ago, CEF has performed strongly. It has outpaced equities and risen higher along with the surge in precious metals more broadly:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719472353862948.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Fund Performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"267\" height=\"205\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719472353862948.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Fund Performance <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rapid gains always make me a little hesitant, so I figured I should take another look at CEF as we push deeper into the new year. Of course, this rise is actually small compared to how well the fund has performed over a longer stretch. The fact is that precious metals (gold and especially silver) have been on a strong bull run, and this momentum has continued. There was a sharp sell-off a few weeks ago, but we have mostly seen a resumption in gains since then.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For multiple reasons, momentum being one of them, I still see a path higher for CEF. I think the fund's valuation, exposure to what central banks are buying, and the continued weakening of the USD are all supporting factors. I will take a turn discussing each in detail below and use them to support my \"buy\" rating on the fund.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Opportunity For Emerging Markets \"Catch-Up\"</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps the primary reason I started buying gold years ago - and continue to buy it today - has to do with my desire to \"copy\" the central banks. I believe retail investors can benefit from a similar \"don't fight the central banks\" mantra in the same way we used to say \"don't fight the Fed\".</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason I say this is because central banks have become large buyers of gold globally. This has been a consistent theme and has accelerated in the past couple of years. Notable reasons have to do with the Russian invasion of Ukraine (which resulted in Russian assets being frozen and prompted other nations to hedge against this through buying metals), the decline of the US dollar in value, and rising trade and geopolitical risks globally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of note, it isn't just developed nations buying gold either. China has become a major player, and so too have other emerging markets (EMs). This, to me, is really where the opportunity lies. If China and other EMs decide to mirror the developed world in terms of their percentage of gold as a reserve, that will mean a substantial amount of buying in the future:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-17718632620169106_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"689\" data-height=\"445\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-17718632620169106_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Gold Reserves (As A Percent of Total)\" width=\"640\" height=\"413\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-17718632620169106_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-17718632620169106_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-17718632620169106_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-17718632620169106_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Gold Reserves (As A Percent of Total) <span>(World Gold Council)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I emphasize this for two reasons. One, this is a tremendous amount of buying pressure that I think will set gold up nicely for a prolonged multi-year run. Two, central banks are largely price agnostic. What I mean is, they aren't necessarily buying gold to turn a profit. As I noted, their objectives could be to protect their government assets from seizure, to hedge against inflation, to use it as a bargaining tool against the US government, among other reasons.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is important because even as gold rises, I don't necessarily see demand slowing down the way it might if the demand was being driven by retail investors (think Bitcoin). While I recognize that CEF is both gold <em>and silver</em>, this is a bigger play on the yellow metal since it makes up almost 59% of total fund assets, as shown below:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-1771969279828551.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CEF's Gold &amp; Silver Holdings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"288\" height=\"160\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-1771969279828551.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">CEF's Gold &amp; Silver Holdings <span>(Sprott)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will get to why I like silver as well, but understand this is a big play on gold, and I view that positively. This supports my \"buy\" rating on CEF going forward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Discount Has Actually Widened</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A second attribute that supports a bull call for CEF in particular is the fund's valuation. Surprisingly, after a 14% pop in market price, CEF is actually <em>cheaper </em>than it was two months ago. Obviously the share price is higher, but in terms of paying below net asset value (NAV), that opportunity has persisted. Back in December, CEF sat with a discount around 3%. Today, that has widened to over 4.5%:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719693510302315_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"841\" data-height=\"108\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719693510302315_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CEF: Quick Stats\" width=\"640\" height=\"82\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719693510302315_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719693510302315_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719693510302315_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719693510302315_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">CEF: Quick Stats <span>(Sprott)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To be fair, that isn't a massive shift. But it is notable given how strongly CEF's market price has performed. This really speaks to the run in both gold and silver and tells me that those who may be lacking in this exposure can still find some relative value in this space by selecting this option.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Silver Demand Should Continue, But It Is More Volatile</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As noted above, CEF has a large exposure to silver. So being a gold bug isn't enough if one decides to buy this fund - you should be excited about silver exposure too!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I myself am in that camp. The reasons are multifold. The case as a hedge against the decline in the USD is intact because silver is indeed a precious metal, as good is. While different, they will both benefit as the USD declines (which I expect), and that suggests I want this exposure long-term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further, silver is also an industrial metal. The demand that comes from their inclusion in industrial applications sets them apart from gold to some degree. That is key to why I think owning <em>both </em>has plenty of merit. There is some overlap in this thesis, to be sure, but the industrial side of things for silver makes it a more diverse asset than gold. As solar panels, electric vehicles, personal electronics, and many other products continue to demand silver as an input, that is going to provide price support for years to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I could go on and on about this theme, but the truth is a photo is worth much more than my words:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719852960415702_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"650\" data-height=\"393\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719852960415702_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Silver Demand Has Been Rising (By Product / Industry)\" width=\"640\" height=\"387\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719852960415702_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719852960415702_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719852960415702_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719852960415702_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Silver Demand Has Been Rising (By Product / Industry) <span>(CME Group)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond just the demand story and the usefulness as a hedge, there is one other key reason I like silver right <strong>now</strong>. While this may sound counterintuitive, I view the sell-off we saw a few weeks back as a sign that a good bit of excess was taken out of the market. While painful in the short run, that can set the stage nicely for a more sustainable rally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But let me be clear. Silver is more volatile than gold (and plenty of other assets). So make sure you understand this and can handle it because it may not be for everyone. To emphasize this point, silver did drop roughly 30% in one day - and that is not something we should ignore:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719837100412354.png?io=w640\" alt=\"YTD Chart (&lt;a href='https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SLV' title='iShares Silver Trust ETF'&gt;SLV&lt;/a&gt;)\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"561\" height=\"351\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719837100412354.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719837100412354.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719837100412354.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">YTD Chart (SLV) <span>(Google Finance)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Many may not see this chart and think it is that great, but I would focus on the fact that silver is up 23% year-to-date, and, again, the shaking out of some loose hands can be a positive for a more stable rally going forward. I don't really want to see another 30% drop, but it has already happened, and I am looking to the future with brighter eyes.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bitcoin Losing Its Flare</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another reason I remain a buyer of CEF is because of what it <em>isn't. </em>What I mean by that is this is a hedge I use against volatility and equity drawdowns. But it didn't used to be my only hedge. A few years ago I had a position in Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC\" title=\"Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF\">BTC</a>) and the reason was I saw it becoming a momentum play; it was meant to be an inflation/currency hedge, and institutional interest was growing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, fast forward to today, and BTC is 50% off its high, and its popularity has begun to wane. I am not surprised by this, and I had exited my position in BTC a while back because it simply no longer met my objectives. It has begun to move with the market and other risk-on sectors so that it wasn't really protecting my portfolio in any way. I was fortunate to get out when I did, as many other retail investors have not been so lucky. At last check, quite a few BTC owners are in the red, and the path forward is murkier than it used to be:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-1771863420307838.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Many Retail Buyers Have Losses\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"525\" height=\"274\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-1771863420307838.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-1771863420307838.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-1771863420307838.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Many Retail Buyers Have Losses <span>(Bloomberg)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My point here is that I used to lump BTC along with my precious metals in terms of using them for a similar reason: to hedge against currency debasement and other geopolitical risks. This dynamic is not really the case anymore. Could that change for BTC in the future? Sure. But I'm simply not willing to bank on it for now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I put that money that used to be in BTC to work in precious metals over a year ago, and my fresh cash is going to go to precious metals and not BTC going forward. While this isn't directly tied to CEF, it hopefully explains my thought process and portfolio structure for my followers so they can understand where I am coming from here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CEF and my other metal holdings have been big winners thus far, and I see additional profits headed my way. I see industrial and investment demand remaining high for silver, and gold continues to be hoarded by central banks. Further, CEF has a nice discount to NAV and its stability compared to other options like BTC is exactly what I am looking for. I am therefore keeping my \"buy\" rating on this fund in place, and I would suggest my followers give the idea some consideration at this time.</p>",

Over the last year, it’s shifted into something broader, a business that’s making real money from AI, Cloud and subscriptions, not just clicks on Google. The company’s stock was at $241.03 when I last<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> called it a </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829304-alphabet-has-nailed-ai-but-investors-may-want-to-wait-for-a-pullback\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829304-alphabet-has-nailed-ai-but-investors-may-want-to-wait-for-a-pullback\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hold</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">. Now it’s at $311.7, after hitting $350.15, up more than 30% since the prior Hold rating. That jump was driven by faster growth in Cloud, actual dollars rolling in from AI and more people paying for subscriptions. But the fast run-up in the share price has already priced in a lot of the upside. The numbers now look fair, not cheap, the stock trades at roughly 27 times its expected earnings, putting it right in the middle of the big tech pack, not obviously undervalued, not outrageously expensive either.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If there’s anywhere the market might be missing something, it’s in how much investors assume the recent momentum in AI and Cloud can last, especially with how much Alphabet is spending on new tech and the ongoing risk of regulators stepping in. For 2025, Alphabet’s total revenue hit $403 billion, up 15% from last year. Search grew 17%. Cloud was up a massive 48%, now running at more than $70 billion a year. Net income in 2025 was $34.5 billion, with earnings per share at $2.82 for the quarter and an operating margin of 31.6%, even after taking a $2.1 billion hit from Waymo. The Cloud backlog has more than doubled from last year to $240 billion. Over 325 million people now pay for some Alphabet subscription. The Gemini AI app has north of 750 million monthly active users. These aren’t just flashy stats, they’re steady revenue and show people are actually using the products, with Gemini and other AI tools getting baked into how both consumers and businesses work.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-1771941564748133_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2335\" data-height=\"1205\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-1771941564748133_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Earnings Highlights: Annual revenues exceeded $400B for the first time\" width=\"640\" height=\"330\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"330\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-1771941564748133_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-1771941564748133_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-1771941564748133_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-1771941564748133_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>GOOG</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sundar Pichai’s comments back this up.

This quarter, Search continued to accelerate with revenues growing 17%. YouTube’s annual revenues surpassed $60 billion across ads and subscriptions. Cloud significantly accelerated with revenues growing 48%, now on an annual run rate of over $70 billion. Backlog grew by 55% quarter-over-quarter to $240 billion, representing a wide breadth of customers driven by demand for AI products. We have over 325 million paid subscriptions across consumer services with strong adoption for Google One and YouTube Premium. In addition, we have sold more than 8 million paid seats of Gemini Enterprise, which we launched just 4 months ago. And our Gemini app now has over 750 million monthly active users. We are also seeing significantly higher engagement per user, especially since the launch of Gemini 3 in December. Overall, we are seeing our AI investments and infrastructure drive revenue and growth across the board.”</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company isn’t flailing around trying to figure out how to make AI pay off. It’s already making serious money from it. Cloud operating income jumped to $5.3 billion, more than double what it was a year ago. Margins went up too, from 17.5% to 30.1%. So it looks like AI is starting to really change how Alphabet makes money. They’re not just spending to build stuff, they’re getting more out of what they’ve already set up, especially as they sell more higher-margin enterprise AI services on top of existing infrastructure. If Cloud margins keep inching up and Search profits don’t slip, then every extra dollar coming in should end up turning into more operating income and free cash flow. That could help balance out higher depreciation costs from all the AI infrastructure and backs up the idea that future free cash flow will have more to do with running things better, not just from big jumps in revenue.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719426095288694_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2335\" data-height=\"1204\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719426095288694_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Google Cloud Revenues and Operating Income\" width=\"640\" height=\"330\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"330\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719426095288694_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719426095288694_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719426095288694_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719426095288694_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>GOOG</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financial Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG/earnings/estimates\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG/earnings/estimates\" target=\"_blank\">Consensus</a> estimates call for EPS of $13.41 in 2027 and $15.48 in 2028, with revenue projected to reach $540.3 billion and $615.4 billion, respectively.

Search still brings in most of the cash, but YouTube’s pulling in $60 billion and Cloud is running at $70 billion a year. Both are big enough now to matter for profits, not just revenue. Cloud’s backlog has jumped to $240 billion, which is more than double last year, so that pipeline is looking solid. The Cloud segment is finally making good money too, operating margin is up to 30.1%. Paid subscriptions stand at 325 million and the new Gemini product is catching on quickly with both regular users and businesses. These help protect Alphabet from the ups and downs in ad spending and they give the company more predictable, recurring revenue.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719453838869302_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2335\" data-height=\"1206\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719453838869302_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Google Services Revenue Breakdown\" width=\"640\" height=\"331\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"331\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719453838869302_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719453838869302_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719453838869302_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719453838869302_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>GOOG</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cost Pressures</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But costs are climbing fast. R&amp;D spending jumped 42% in 2025. Depreciation shot up by almost $6 billion, or 38% more than last year, all because it takes a ton of money to build out the AI infrastructure. Management said, “The significant increase in our investments in technical infrastructure will continue to put pressure on the P&amp;L in the form of higher depreciation expense and related data centers operations costs such as energy.” That’s a real problem, not just a minor bump. If revenue growth slows down, margins could shrink quickly, especially with labor costs still climbing and the company spending big before it actually sees the returns.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719432834811184_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2335\" data-height=\"1206\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719432834811184_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Operating Expenses Breakdown\" width=\"640\" height=\"331\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"331\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719432834811184_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719432834811184_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719432834811184_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719432834811184_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>GOOG</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regulation is still the big thing hanging over Alphabet right now. In Search, the DOJ and state attorneys general already won a ruling and got a final judgment. That means Google has to change how it distributes its services, share some search data and offer syndication services to a few competitors. Both sides are now appealing. On the ad tech side, Alphabet is still waiting for a final judgment in the DOJ’s advertising tech case. The DOJ is talking about possible structural fixes and Alphabet says those could seriously hurt its business. Europe’s also on them. The Commission handed down a €3 billion ad tech decision over “self-preferencing” and told Alphabet to make changes. Alphabet’s appealing that too. With AI now getting pushed more into Search, ads and Cloud, Alphabet says the scrutiny is only going up especially around AI and competition and that regulators can force the company to change its products or business models.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alphabet’s stock sits at $311 now. Looking out to 2026, that puts the forward P/E at about 27. PEG ratio comes in around 1.75. Free cash flow yield is right at 2%. Not much of a bargain anymore. Microsoft’s forward P/E is about 23. Meta’s is around 21. Nvidia? Way up there at 41. So Alphabet is on the pricier side among the big tech names. Investors are already pricing in some AI upside for Alphabet. For the stock to move up a lot from here, Alphabet actually has to show real growth and get those margins higher. Just more excitement won’t cut it. If regulators get involved or if the AI hype drops off, the shares could take a big hit. On the flip side, if regulators step in or the AI story loses steam, the stock could fall a lot.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Take</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alphabet’s setup looks strong, just not without headaches. Their official forecasts and the numbers analysts expect seem fair and the company’s in a good spot to benefit as more businesses move to AI and Cloud. Key stuff to watch: is Cloud still signing up lots of new business; are more people actually using Gemini; and is all this spending on AI systems showing up in profits instead of just making depreciation go up? Regulation is still the wildcard. If things go Alphabet’s way, the stock could get a boost. If not, it could drop fast.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom line: I’m sticking with Hold. Alphabet is running well and the AI and Cloud businesses are making real progress, but the price already reflects most of that future growth. There’s not much room for mistakes, especially around regulation or costs. I’d need to see the stock fall closer to $250, which would imply a P/E multiple more in line with its five-year average, or see clear signs Alphabet’s making more money from AI than anyone expects, before calling it a Buy. Right now, the risk and reward are about even. It’s worth owning, but there’s no need to chase it at this price.</p>",

Well, joining us now to discuss is Michael Brown. He's Vice President, Director, and Portfolio Manager with TD Asset Management.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Michael, great to have you back on the show.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> Thank you for having me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> Alright, so we've heard that the US Supreme Court has struck down some of those tariffs, and that Washington responded by enacting a new 10% global tariff. So, what does that mean for Europe and Asia going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> Well, firstly, 10% is better than the 15% he talked on the weekend. I mean, right now, it would be modestly positive. I mean, uncertainty still continues with the tariffs, particularly in Asia, countries like China and India. This is a significant, at least temporary, reduction in the tariffs they're paying.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But I mean, the outlook is, as we all know, this administration has talked quite regularly about tariffs being part of their policy agenda, and so, they will likely find another way to bring them into the discussions. But it is a temporary reprieve for particularly China and India as it drops to 10%. Other uncertainty would be for countries like Japan and Korea, who have made tentative deals. What happens to the status of those deals done under the framework that the Supreme Court has ruled out? So really, continued uncertainty, but at least temporarily, it's a bit-- 10% is lower than what they were paying, or what was being paid previously.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> OK, so let's talk about something else that also made headlines. Japan, they just recently had an election that's created a lot of headlines. Explain to us what happened there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> Well, basically, the LDP has won a supermajority. So it's the largest, led by Sanae Takaichi.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> You said that very well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> Pardon me. It has won the largest majority, really, in the post-war era in Japan, so even larger than Shinzo Abe's major wins in the early 2010s. And so, it's very positive in terms of they have a clear agenda that they can get passed. They can focus on return on their policy as opposed to necessarily, say, buying votes through policy, which is good. There's no concerns the budget will easily pass.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are all positive for Japan going forward. It removes an element of uncertainty in terms of the fiscal agenda, which is great.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> OK, so you said it removes some of the uncertainty and there are benefits to that. But talk about some of the risks of this supermajority.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> I mean, with the ability to change the constitution, I would say that as investors, the biggest risk would be choosing nationalistic interests over economic interests. Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, also known as the pacifist clause, has gotten a lot of headlines as several prior prime ministers have tried to change it. Essentially, it creates an ambiguity around Japan's right to defend themselves. And with the supermajority, they have the ability to change the constitution. This will likely lead to increased tensions with China. I think we saw a symptom of this last night when China released, I think it was 20 companies in Japan with export restrictions. So...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> OK. And now what about the potential opportunities for investors going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> I mean, the upside right now, I'd say one of the biggest ones, they've talked about consumption tax going to zero on food. This would be positive for overall consumption. I doubt people are going to spend more on food. They're just going to have more money to spend on other things besides food, so that should be positive for consumption.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There's also positives with the infrastructure rollout. She's talked about nuclear restarts. Cheaper power is good for economic growth. So that would be positive for, say, construction engineering names. Kajima (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KAJMY\" title=\"Kajima Corporation\">KAJMY</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KAJMF\" title=\"Kajima Corporation\">KAJMF</a>) would be an example. There's four or five of them that are quite similar. There's also-- it will be positive for defense companies, the same list that was listed, the release from China last night.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> Are there any names that specifically stand out for you?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> Mitsubishi Heavy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MHVYF\" title=\"Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.\">MHVYF</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MHVIY\" title=\"Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.\">MHVIY</a>) would be a name. IHI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IHICY\" title=\"IHI Corporation\">IHICY</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IHICF\" title=\"IHI Corporation\">IHICF</a>) would be another name. And those would be two of the larger defense names within Japan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> And in terms of the sectors that you're focused on, would they be-- you said defense. Is there any other sectors that you'd be focused on?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> Largely in industrial space. And then, of course, part of the fiscal stimulus would be the technology sector in Japan. That's led by semiconductor capital equipment. Tokyo Electron would be a prime beneficiary of that there. But there are other names, whether it be Disco Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DSCSY\" title=\"Disco Corporation\">DSCSY</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DISPF\" title=\"Disco Corporation\">DISPF</a>), Lasertec (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LSRCF\" title=\"Lasertec Corporation\">LSRCF</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LSRCY\" title=\"Lasertec Corporation\">LSRCY</a>). Many of them have fancy names. So...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> Some names we'll be focused on going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> Yeah, it would be technology, industrials. And hopefully some relief in consumer, but that's not an area that we're focused in.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.moneytalkgo.com/video/a-global-view-on-investing-as-new-tariffs-come-into-effect/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p>",

Since then, the company’s share price has increased by approximately 15% -and<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> about 115% since my </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4799663-nebius-explosive-growth-but-zero-profits\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">first coverage</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">-but it has demonstrated high volatility.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This article examines NBIS’ hidden asset, given that it benefits not only from AI infrastructure solutions but also from its software solutions of Aether, Token Factory, and Tavily. In my view, NBIS aims to be a “one-stop shop” for AI solutions for large- and mid-sized companies and startups.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I remain bullish on Nebius, and I believe that it is still undervalued based on its growth potential and sticky business model. The recent price volatility was a result of profit-taking and macroeconomic uncertainty.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hardware Solutions Still Appear Impressive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nebius continues to report impressive <a href=\"https://assets.nebius.com/assets/e59fb92e-9027-473a-8cac-04f9d2e9ea9a/Shareholder%20Letter%20Q4%202025.pdf?cache-buster=2026-02-12T11:43:13.446Z&amp;_gl=1*1b82ge3*_gcl_au*MTA4MzAxNjY3Ni4xNzcxNjAzMjEx\" rel=\"nofollow\">results</a> and continues to show high demand for its AI hardware solutions. Notably, the company’s management <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869424-nebius-group-n-v-nbis-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">stated</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Demand remains robust, and our pipeline continues to grow substantially. We sold out of capacity in Q3 and Q4 last year, and we're already now in Q1 of 2026 also sold out. In Q4, we delivered group revenue of $228 million, representing year-over-year growth of 547%. Revenue grew 56% from Q3 to Q4. Annualized run rate revenue for the core business stood at $1.2 billion at the end of December, exceeding the high end of our Q3 guidance range of $1.1 billion. The results of our core AI cloud business were even more impressive. Revenue grew 830% year-over-year and 63% quarter-over-quarter. This was driven by high utilization, strong pricing, and strong execution.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I want to highlight some major insights from the above statement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">1. Demand for NBIS’ hardware solutions - such as GPUs and full-rack systems—remains impressive, as capacity was sold out in Q3 and Q4 of FY25 and is already sold out for Q1<span></span> '26.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. The company achieved positive adjusted EBITDA for the first time, which is a key milestone, supporting my view from the last article that NBIS is balancing growth and profitability to drive long-term value. Also, the company reported Q4<span></span> '25 revenue of $228 million, up 547% YoY and 56% QoQ, with its core AI business increasing by 830% YoY and 63% QoQ.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730917986746_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"872\" data-height=\"282\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730917986746_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q4’25 highlights\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"207\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730917986746_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730917986746_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730917986746_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730917986746_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Letter to shareholders Q4<span></span></span> '2<span>5</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">3. Due to the high demand and the fact that its capacity is continually sold out, NBIS announced the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869424-nebius-group-n-v-nbis-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">development</a> of 9 new data center sites, aiming to reach a total of 16 sites globally. Furthermore, NBIS’s pipeline for Q1<span></span> '26 revenue exceeds $4B, which explains why the company increased its ARR guidance to $7-$9 billion and raised its capacity guidance to over 3 GW for 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-1771973092277709_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"877\" data-height=\"522\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-1771973092277709_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ARR analysis and new sites\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"381\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-1771973092277709_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-1771973092277709_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-1771973092277709_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-1771973092277709_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Letter to shareholders Q4<span></span></span> '2<span>5</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">4. Before moving to the last major insights, let me highlight the company’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869424-nebius-group-n-v-nbis-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">statement below</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>In terms of deal trends, they're all moving in the right direction. Deal terms are getting longer and average deal sizes are increasing. In Q4, we saw nearly twice as many transactions completed over 12 months in duration over what we succeeded with in Q3, while average selling prices increased by more than 50%.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, NBIS almost doubled its contract with a duration of over 12 months in Q4<span></span> '25, compared to Q3<span></span> '25. Also, average selling prices (ASP) increased by more than 50% in the same period, in combination with higher average deal sizes. This means longer-duration contracts, with more GPUs and general hardware per client, at higher prices, reflecting the company’s pricing power and strong growth trajectory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, Nebius maintains impressive momentum, driven by its expanding data center and AI infrastructure business, which continues to run at full capacity; therefore, I expect Nebius’ revenue growth to remain strong.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond Hardware, NBIS’ Software Could Be the Main Growth Catalyst</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s main revenue comes from building full-stack infrastructure services. However, many investors believe that Nebius only develops and leases its own data centers, but the truth is that it also offers full software solutions and not only bare metal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Specifically, the company’s management <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869424-nebius-group-n-v-nbis-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">stated</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>At this stage, 100% of our AI cloud customers are utilizing our AI cloud software, obviously. So we have a 100% attach rate. We're very excited, by the way, about the new products that we've launched like Token Factory and the Aether releases, which have opened up TAM and give us an opportunity to expand into enterprise. Our new acquisition of Tavily also extends our platform capabilities by providing agentic search for AI developers, creating more routes into accounts… We're really in the early stages of our monetization journey, but our software and services make our platform sticky, which enables us to charge more on a relative per GPU hour. We are exploring other monetization models, including consumption based such as per token pricing with Token Factory.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let me break down the above statements:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>NBIS, in combination with its AI hardware infrastructure, offers AI cloud software solutions through Aether, which helps orchestrate and manage AI workloads. The important point is that all of its clients use Aether.</li> <li>With <a href=\"https://nebius.com/services/token-factory\" rel=\"nofollow\">Token Factory</a>, NBIS expands its TAM, in my view, as small and mid-sized enterprises and startups can leverage the platform to customize, deploy, and optimize open-source AI models. The company monetizes Token Factory under a consumption-based model.

Still, bare-metal solutions remain the company’s main growth driver; however, it is well positioned to leverage its AI software products. With a 100% attach rate in AI cloud software solutions, increasing selling prices, and longer contract durations, NBIS appears to have a very sticky business model, which I believe is under the radar of Wall Street’s analysts.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation and Risk Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nebius seems undervalued compared to its main competitor, CoreWeave (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWV\" title=\"CoreWeave, Inc.\">CRWV</a>), based on FWD EV/Sales and EV/EBITDA ratios, while it seems slightly overvalued based on FWD P/S ratios. These mixed valuation signals do not reflect the fact that NBIS expects significantly higher triple-digit growth over the next two years compared to CRWV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-1771973359793738.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Key metrics comparison with major peer\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"410\" height=\"294\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-1771973359793738.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-1771973359793738.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Analysis’ Results</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors need to understand NBIS’s business model to assess the company’s risks and valuation position. Analysts have an average price target of about $147, which means a potential 44% upside from the current stock price. In my opinion, this target price reflects only the company’s hardware solutions. Therefore, considering its AI software cross-selling opportunities, I believe a fair target price should be closer to $200.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730919735312_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1062\" data-height=\"328\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730919735312_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Target price\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"198\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730919735312_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730919735312_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730919735312_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730919735312_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding risk assessment, as I already mentioned in my last coverage, NBIS continues to minimize execution risks significantly, given that it has already <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869424-nebius-group-n-v-nbis-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">serviced</a> its contract with Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) and delivered the first tranche of its commitment to Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) on time.

Output growth in many emerging economies continues to outpace that of developed markets, whether inflation trends are disinflationary – as in China – or remain relatively sticky – as in Brazil. Higher economic growth and elevated country risk typically translate into higher interest rates, and the prospect of stronger returns attracted significant capital inflows. At the same time, volatility in developed markets - driven partly by fluctuations in US tariff rates – altered risk profiles and added to concerns around slower growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>msci em and crude oil price</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"868\" data-height=\"570\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"msci em and crude oil price\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"420\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, investors in search of safe-haven assets moved towards gold, while more risk-tolerant investors favoured emerging market equities.

A weaker dollar can make higher-yielding currencies more attractive, increasing the appeal of emerging markets. The markets also offer geographical diversification at a time when tariff exposure and geopolitical tensions remain significant. Emerging economies with limited trade surpluses with the US may be particularly well placed to help hedge against geopolitical risks.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">geopolitical risk and volatility index</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"894\" data-height=\"563\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"geopolitical risk and volatility index\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"403\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Export-driven economies – such as South Korea, Taiwan, and China – are still exposed to potential tariff changes as the US administration continues to focus on reducing its trade deficit. However, these economies hold competitive positions in advanced manufacturing. Recent earnings from SK Hynix (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HXSC.F\" title=\"SK hynix Inc.\">HXSC.F</a>) illustrate the continued strength of Korean semiconductor demand. Similar momentum is evident in China and Taiwan, where the semiconductors, telecommunications and AI-related sectors remain important contributors to market performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In December, Chinese policymakers met at the annual Central Economic Work Conference to outline the economic agenda for 2026. Key priorities included stimulating consumption and investment to support growth of around 5%. One challenge highlighted was the imbalance between strong domestic supply and weak domestic demand. Despite a record trade surplus in 2025, internal demand remains subdued. Authorities aim to revive investment following a slowdown in the second half of the year, with an emphasis on strengthening domestic-focused activity rather than prioritising the export-oriented manufacturing sector, which has remained resilient. China’s budget deficit target is expected to stay close to last year's record 4% of GDP, reflecting sustained public spending to support demand during the ongoing residential property downturn. Liquidity injections through lower reserve-requirement ratios and targeted interest rate reductions are likely, although any monetary easing is expected to be incremental.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chinese equity indices</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"873\" data-height=\"565\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chinese equity indices\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"414\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Shanghai Composite Index rose 18% last year, its strongest annual performance since 2020. Between 2021 and 2025, technology companies represented over 90% of new listings in China, and the sector now accounts for more than a quarter of total market capitalisation. In 2025, the MSCI China gained 28%, while the CSI 300 rose 18%. Forecasts suggest further gains in 2026, supported by AI and technology-driven momentum, even though household confidence remains muted. Chinese equities continue to offer diversification benefits, with a reasonably generally constructive macroeconomic backdrop. Chinese sovereign yields are expected to stay range-bound, constrained by disinflationary forces on the upside and a less accommodative monetary stance on the downside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In South Korea, a significant share of equities continues to trade below book value. Ongoing efforts to improve corporate governance could help unlock value, with Japan’s experience offering potential guide for attracting foreign investment. China’s actions to curb disorderly price competition and address inefficiencies among producers may also support market performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Elsewhere in Asia, Indonesia and Thailand could see further gains in 2026, supported by policies aimed at strengthening domestic demand. Handouts to low-income households and expansionary fiscal measures are expected to bolster consumption and underpin growth in Indonesia. India has also introduced measures to support household spending, including reforms to goods and services taxes. However, Indian equities underperformed other emerging markets in 2025. High valuations, higher-than-expected tariffs, and pressures on the software sector could delay a broader recovery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For Saudi Arabia, despite expectations of softer oil prices, equities may benefit from the potential relaxation of foreign-ownership limits on listed companies. This reform could generate passive inflows estimated at up to $10 billion and may help lift a market that, like India, lagged broader emerging market performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, emerging markets are well positioned for 2026. Volatility in developed markets is likely to remain above historical norms, and geopolitical tensions – particularly in the run-up to the US mid-term elections – are expected to persist. Structural trends, including the central role of key Asian economies in global supply chains and the favourable outlook for selected commodities, should continue to support emerging-market performance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Legal Disclaimer</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Republication or redistribution of LSE Group content is prohibited without our prior written consent.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>The content of this publication is for informational purposes only and has no legal effect, does not form part of any contract, does not, and does not seek to constitute advice of any nature and no reliance should be placed upon statements contained herein.

By design, these companies have to depend on external capital to develop (since they have to pay most of what they make as dividends), while the SOFR takes into account much more than just what the <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"fed\" htloopnumber=\"354047045\">Fed</em> does.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we can see in GLPI's case, their latest debt issuance from back in August 2025 came with coupons of 5.25% ($600 million 2033 notes) and 5.75% ($700 million 2037 notes), and although this pushed their maturities significantly, these are still relatively high yields, while issuing stock still costs about 6.5% nowadays, which limits their ability to deliver significant accretion through investments, with an 8.51% weighted average cap rate they expect on their future pipeline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although we’re talking about a theoretically much more limited and slower growth environment (especially due to the rise of online and potential regulatory limitations), the industry is also facing the trends seen in the country’s general real estate, with the post-pandemic boom in construction now reverting due to weak occupancy rates and rising costs seen all across the board, from workforce and materials to debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, GLPI continues to have a very strong pipeline with attractive cap rates, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872978-gaming-and-leisure-properties-inc-glpi-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872978-gaming-and-leisure-properties-inc-glpi-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">recently highlighting</a> their “$2.6 billion of future capital commitments poised for deployment over the next 24 months,” with mega-projects such as Bally's Lincoln and Chicago, Live!

Jokes aside, iGaming can be a way for traditional operators to not only attract new people and diversify (especially the big players), but also promote their physical operations as needed, although I continue to believe that these companies should focus especially on the experience as a whole. Similarly, GLPI can also expand more into the leisure side, having the capital, size, and experience to develop there as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another potential issue comes from the weak travel data, with <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4539192-online-travel-stocks-slide-on-weak-international-tourism-data\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4539192-online-travel-stocks-slide-on-weak-international-tourism-data\" target=\"_blank\">recent <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"us\" htloopnumber=\"354047045\">US</em> tourism data</a> highlighting that even though global tourism spending grew by 6.7% in 2025, the <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"us\" htloopnumber=\"354047045\">US</em> actually fell by 6% in terms of foreign visitors and 7% in international tourist spending, likely caused by all the uncertainty around politics, visas, budget issues, etc., although at the same time, <a href=\"https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/bed/domestic-trips-by-us-residents/3672/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/bed/domestic-trips-by-us-residents/3672/\" target=\"_blank\">domestic travel continued to recover</a> to a new record based on recent data.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks Reiterated</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite their solid position and strong growth pipeline, GLPI will always depend on the economy, and the current environment has plenty of room to get even worse, potentially affecting the company’s tenants, and worsening their ratings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, a higher-for-longer rate environment remains a significant threat for GLPI, potentially limiting the results of their investments and ultimately their valuation, as the market can still find a very solid risk-adjusted yield through treasuries and “tax” the stock price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/60669497-17719480331821375_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"728\" data-height=\"338\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/60669497-17719480331821375_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Gaming and Leisure Properties IR GLPI stock analysis seekingalpha valuation 2026 best reit stocks to buy vici stock\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"297\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/60669497-17719480331821375_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/60669497-17719480331821375_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/60669497-17719480331821375_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/60669497-17719480331821375_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw -
