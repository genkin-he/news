Morgan, Apollo, and Citi are using Avalanche for real-world asset tokenization and backend infrastructure.</li> <li> <strong>Strategic pricing shift drives network activity:</strong> Recent fee reductions have successfully sparked growth in daily active users and transaction volume, positioning the network for broader mainstream adoption.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Introduction to Avalanche</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Avalanche (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVAX-USD\" title=\"Avalanche\">AVAX-USD</a>) is a high-performance platform that powers a network of interconnected, customizable blockchains. It has attracted both crypto-native users and enterprises, with Avalanche L1s processing about 40M transactions per day and supporting roughly 38M daily active users across 81 active blockchains. Avalanche has also brought $1.4B of real-world asset value onchain through institutions such as BlackRock, Janus Henderson, Franklin Templeton, and Republic. These teams are drawn to Avalanche’s predictable performance and scaling model built to support tens of millions of future users.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From the start, Avalanche was built around different priorities than many legacy blockchains. Rather than centering the “digital gold” narrative, Avalanche focused on performance and scale, pioneering a novel consensus design and a multi-chain architecture. After launching in 2020, early adoption came from crypto-native users who wanted a faster alternative to Ethereum (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ETH-USD\" title=\"Ethereum USD\">ETH-USD</a>). Avalanche still maintains meaningful activity in DeFi and gaming, but it has increasingly evolved into a leading platform for custom Layer 1 blockchains, real-world asset tokenization, and enterprise deployment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, Avalanche focuses on enterprise, financial institution, and public sector use cases through its “AvaCloud” offering. The goal is to operate as a scalable, reliable backend infrastructure while preserving the core benefits of blockchain: transparency, fast settlement, and interoperability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We believe Avalanche’s long-term opportunity depends on whether it can convert enterprise interest into sustained production deployments. Progress to date is encouraging, even if broad adoption is still in its early stages. Overall, Avalanche offers investors differentiated exposure to a “suit and tie” platform that is working to bring large organizations onchain.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Avalanche Stablecoin Transfer Volume Up 330% Y/Y in 2025</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/9f01899823304e249d57473def77b38e/6756_avalanche-201-blog_chart-1_2026-2_v1.svg\" alt=\"Avalanche Stablecoin Transfer Volume Up 330% Y/Y in 2025\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Source: Artemis XYZ as of 2/06/2026. <strong>Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein.</strong></em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Avalanche Design for Rapid Consensus: Snowman</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Avalanche offers a key breakthrough called the “Snowman Consensus.” Consensus is the method by which a chain agrees on blocks, and Avalanche’s innovation is to implement a more efficient, faster polling technique between validators. This allows it to produce blocks at a faster rate with more transaction capacity in each block than Ethereum.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On legacy blockchains, this means far more communication than necessary, slowing block processing time. By contrast, Avalanche does not have a fixed “leader,” and instead allows any validator to propose blocks from the transactions they observe. Avalanche validators then ping one another in small, randomly selected groups to conduct repeated polls on the correct ledger and its content. Validators repeat these small-group polls until they have enough mathematical confidence that their view has finalized, and the network will converge on the same ledger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The result of this process is that Avalanche can process a block every 1.2 seconds, and the transactions within each block are considered “final” almost instantly. Avalanche competitor Ethereum produces blocks every 12 seconds while finality takes around 12.8 minutes. This allows Avalanche users to recognize settlement of their transactions within a few seconds, giving the chain significant practical advantages for financial use cases.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Avalanche’s Multi-Chain Architecture</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Avalanche is not a single blockchain but a system composed of many blockchains built using Avalanche’s software. There are 81 live blockchains in the ecosystem, with hundreds more in development. Each Avalanche L1 can bootstrap its own validators or use core validators operating on Avalanche’s primary chains. Many L1s also modify Avalanche’s core software to tailor performance, governance, and functionality, including cross-chain connections to other Avalanche L1s and to the Avalanche C-Chain. Some L1s are public while others are private and permissioned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Avalanche Primary Network comprises the three original Avalanche chains. These are the C, P, and X chains. While the C-Chain is the epicenter of Avalanche’s crypto activity, the P-Chain is the network that coordinates Avalanche’s validators. The X-chain is currently only used to mint inflationary AVAX tokens. Each of these chains uses AVAX as the native token for payments and usage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Avalanche C-Chain is the most economically valuable blockchain in the Avalanche ecosystem and, on average, processes $528M in economic activity each day. It uses the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows Avalanche developers to use the same smart contract language and tooling used to build Ethereum applications. Thus, Ethereum developers can quickly deploy their applications to Avalanche with only a few tweaks. In practice, this opened the aperture for new entrants to the Avalanche ecosystem by tapping into a huge pool of potential builders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The C-Chain offers economic and scaling advantages over Ethereum. It can process (+88%) more transaction throughput (measured by gas) while pricing transactions at 1/50<sup>th</sup>the cost of Ethereum’s fees. Avalanche also has the unique ability to rapidly increase its block size during periods of high demand, meaning that Avalanche’s throughput advantage grows during stressful periods.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Avalanche Prices Transaction Fees are Lower Than Competitors</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/9f01899823304e249d57473def77b38e/6756_avalanche-201-blog_chart-2_2026-2_v1.svg\" alt=\"Avalanche Prices Transaction Fees are Lower Than Competitors\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Source: Artemis XYZ as of 1/28/2026. <strong>Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein.</strong></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outside of the Primary Network, an L1 with notable traction is Binary Holdings, which runs a rewards and loyalty program for South Asian telecommunications firms. It reports 36M daily active addresses and roughly 40M transactions per day, reflecting a “blockchain-as-infrastructure” thesis where end users may not even realize they are interacting with a blockchain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another is Dexalot L1, designed to provide centralized-exchange-like speed and capacity while preserving onchain transparency. Dexalot operates a dual-chain setup: users bridge and deposit via Avalanche C-Chain and execute trades on a customized L1 optimized for large trading volumes.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Enterprise Adoption for Traditional Finance and Tokenization</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Avalanche has launched public pilots for private markets tokenization with well-known traditional finance participants. For example, Apollo tokenized a $50M credit fund on Avalanche in January 2026. Avalanche has also pursued distribution-oriented partnerships aligned with enterprise requirements, including AWS support for government-oriented deployment and compliance pathways.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Deloitte has used Avalanche to create a platform intended to improve the speed, security, and accuracy of FEMA reimbursements following disasters. These examples highlight the direction of travel: Avalanche is positioning itself as infrastructure that can plug into real workflows, not just crypto-native applications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Avalanche has key advantages over competing blockchains, but a practical question is: “Why would someone want to deploy an Avalanche L1 instead of an Ethereum L2?”</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Service and accountability</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Avalanche offers builders a dedicated, for-profit engineering organization, Ava Labs, that can provide direct support, implementation assistance, and customization in a way that feels closer to a SaaS vendor relationship. Ethereum has excellent vendors and L2 teams, but creating an L2 on Ethereum typically requires a builder to choose a team with an opinionated framework. In some cases, those Ethereum L2 consultants may also push design decisions that benefit their own economic model rather than the builder’s.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sovereign chain design</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">An Avalanche L1 is a sovereign network where the deployer can set rules, define execution, and choose the virtual machine. That flexibility matters when an application or use case cannot be implemented within the EVM's limits, or when the builder needs to tune governance and performance for a specific workflow.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operational and compliance flexibility</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Avalanche offers SOC 2 certified infrastructure that supports enterprise-grade security, with options for compliant operations in regulated sectors. An enterprise can define validator requirements, including hardware standards and participation restrictions tied to governance or compliance. In practice, this can be harder to replicate on Ethereum L2s without adding extra trust assumptions around sequencers, committees, or bespoke bridging.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Enterprise-friendly economics</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Avalanche L1s can define their own fee markets and use the token of their choice, meaning they do not need to use AVAX for gas. Operating costs are also easier for enterprises to budget because they are tied more directly to the validator footprint than to fluctuating usage. Avalanche’s L1 validator fee model is structured as an ongoing charge to run validators, whereas Ethereum is closer to a pay-as-you-go business arrangement. As a result, Avalanche L1s can feel more like SaaS licensing models with costs that scale with deployment requirements rather than short-term demand spikes. This makes the costs for Avalanche L1 operators more predictable.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk and performance isolation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ethereum L2s ultimately inherit key constraints from Ethereum, especially around settlement back to L1 and the specific rollup's design choices. For example, optimistic rollup L2s have built-in delay periods for withdrawals that would prevent L2 users from quickly withdrawing funds. Additionally, Ethereum L2 can still experience congestion if Ethereum Mainnet is overloaded with activity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because Avalanche L1s isolate performance and fees from other chains, enterprises can avoid congestion problems caused by unrelated activity. Also, Avalanche L1s can adjust throughput, latency, and governance to fit the needs of the application.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Simplicity of deployment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Avalanche has built the tooling and support to allow potential developers to quickly create Avalanche blockchains. In fact, builders without deep coding experience can create an Avalanche L1 without code and deploy it within minutes. Because Avalanche offers cross-chain support out of the box, sophisticated developers can create dozens of blockchains that act in concert to meet their needs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key partnerships</h2> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Cloud and infrastructure partners for lowering the operational friction of operating Avalanche blockchains or using Avalanche blockchains,</li></ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Partners:</strong> Amazon Web Services (AWS), Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud.</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Public sector and government process partners modernizing heavy workflows, improving auditability, and reducing fraud and administrative overhead in government adjacent processes.</li></ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Partners:</strong> Deloitte and the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Payments and onboarding partners that reduce the adoption bottleneck for users and mainstream applications, allowing them to quickly get funds onchain while abiding by compliance rules.</li></ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Partners:</strong> Stripe, Mastercard, Visa</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Capital markets, banking, and institutional tokenization partners to prove Avalanche’s potential to operate backend infrastructure for major financial institutions, including tokenization, fund operations, and credit market infrastructure.</li></ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Partners:</strong> Sumitomo Corporation, FIS and Intain, Citi and Wellington Management and WisdomTree and ABN AMRO and DTCC Digital Assets and Tokeny, J.P.

Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein.</strong></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The AVAX token is the “native token” of all Avalanche blockchains but is most used on Avalanche’s C-Chain. This means that all transactions on that network necessitate AVAX to be processed. Because the C-Chain’s capacity for transactions is limited, as the level of activity increases, the amount of AVAX needed to transact rises as well. Like Ethereum, Avalanche also implements an economic policy that burns base fees to offset inflation. As Avalanche transaction velocity increases, more AVAX tokens are burned, and the total can be enormous during times of high activity. To date, 4.9M AVAX has been permanently removed from circulation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current supply of AVAX is 431M, while the maximum supply of the token is 720M. To reach the maximum supply of AVAX, Avalanche mints new tokens to reward validators and stakers for running and securing the network. The current inflation rate for new AVAX tokens is (~3.5%) per year, and the number of new tokens emitted fluctuates based on the number of AVAX staked and their staking duration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because Avalanche is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, AVAX is used to back validators who run and secure Avalanche’s C-Chain. Each validator must be backed by a minimum of 2,000 AVAX “bond” to operate on the blockchain, but in practice, validator stakes are often much larger because larger validators can receive more rewards (up to 3M AVAX). To satisfy the bonding requirement, validators often source AVAX bonds from tokenholders seeking to earn rewards on their AVAX holdings. However, validators who are dishonest or who demonstrate poor uptime can lose their access to rewards or even be booted from the network. This economic incentive drives stakers to seek high-quality validators.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current reward rate for Avalanche stakers is (&gt;7%), which is greater than the rate of inflation because not all AVAX tokens on Avalanche are staked. To stake on Avalanche, someone must bond a minimum of 25 AVAX and choose the duration of their lock-up. Those who choose to delegate their AVAX to a validator for longer periods receive higher rewards than those who opt for shorter bonding periods.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outside of Avalanche C-Chain, validators of other Avalanche L1s must pay a per-validator fee of 1.33 AVAX per month. These fees are burned. With ~850 L1 validators, this amounts to $160k in annual revenue.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bear and Bull Case for AVAX</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Bear Case: Declining Metrics and Competitive Pressures</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently, Avalanche is at a crossroads, making some bearish about its future. Once a member of the “SOLUNAVAX” triad meme spawned by immense returns in the summer of 2021 (&gt;+1000% returns in 4 months), AVAX has lost (-62%) of its value in the past year. Aside from broad, weak alt-token performance (<a href=\"https://www.marketvector.com/indexes/digital-assets/marketvector-smart-contract-leaders\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"MVSCLE - MarketVector Smart Contract Leaders Index\"><strong>MarketVector Smart Contract Leaders Index</strong></a>: -37% y/y), competitive pressures have driven Avalanche to reduce its transaction pricing on the C-Chain by (-96%). This has led to a (-42%) y/y reduction in revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Avalanche onchain metrics have also generally lagged those of its competitors. Revenue has fallen to 13<sup>th </sup>in the 30-day trailing period, down from 8<sup>th </sup>place 2 years ago and 4<sup>th </sup>place 4 years ago. In TVL, over the past four years, it has dropped from the 3<sup>rd</sup>-ranked blockchain to the 7<sup>th</sup>-ranked blockchain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, there is concern that Avalanche L1s do not remit enough value to AVAX because they have little use in their frameworks. This is due to the lack of requirement to use AVAX as a native token on Avalanche L1s. Previously, Avalanche L1s (formerly 'Subnets') were required to stake 2,000 AVAX per validator, but this requirement was nixed, removing a major token sink for AVAX.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Potential risks </strong></p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Competition from other blockchains</li> <li>Value of blockchain technologies accruing to existing financial institutions</li> <li>Emerging blockchains offering better technology</li> <li>Regulation of DeFi</li> <li>Increase in the inflation rate or expansion of the token supply</li> <li>Technical risks and hacking attacks</li> <li>Potential risks related to team dynamics and strategic priorities of core developers</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Bull Case: Pivot to Enterprise and Ecosystem Growth</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, it is important to remember that investors valuing tokens like AVAX must look to the future, not Avalanche’s past identity. Avalanche technology was initially used to facilitate speculation, and it was presumed that this would evolve towards more sustainable financial products and services. However, the speculative narrative has evaporated as systematically overvalued cryptocurrencies failed to mature into more sustainable use cases. At the same time, existing financial institutions began adopting the most promising components of crypto to navigate many blockchain ecosystems effectively. As a result, Avalanche is moving towards enterprise use cases and real-world assets to build the products that can attract corporate interest. In this enterprise-centric new vision, Avalanche is an absolute leader compared to most other crypto projects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Avalanche’s new approach to long-term token holder value is to bring as many users as possible into its network of blockchains. This includes substantial price decreases alongside marketing focus on Avalanche L1s. Thus, one can view its price decreases as an opportunity to attract new users and expand use cases. Once Avalanche has proved its value to a large user base, it is presumed to be able to capture more value from its blockchain’s activity. Thus far, some of the steps to attract new activity have been working.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The deliberate choice to reduce C-Chain fees has led to transactions growing (+370%) and (DAA<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/S\" title=\"SentinelOne, Inc.\">S</a>) surging (+368%) y/y. Likewise, Avalanche L1 outreach has attracted nearly 4M DAAs to Avalanche’s L1s (2-3x more DAUs than Ethereum’s ecosystem), collectively generating ~$25k in fees per day. At the same time, tokenization efforts have led to $1.4B in assets on Avalanche through partnerships with some of the world’s most important financial institutions. If Avalanche can continue to prove itself as an important backend financial infrastructure, it stands to benefit greatly from tokenization.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Potential catalysts</strong></p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Tokenization is increasing usership and usage of the Avalanche blockchains</li> <li>Re-institution Avalanche L1 validator AVAX holding requirements</li> <li>AVAX native token being adopted by Avalanche L1s</li> <li>Avalanche’s growing gaming system is driving wallet growth</li> <li>The launch of high-velocity financial products</li> <li>Additional Avalanche L1 launches</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Token vs Contributor Interests Debate</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A key consideration for AVAX, as with many smart contract platforms, is the relationship between the token and the organizations that materially contribute to the ecosystem’s development and commercialization. Ava Labs is a major contributor to Avalanche’s core software and provides services to teams building on Avalanche technology. As a for-profit company, Ava Labs will make business decisions around resourcing, pricing, partnerships, and product focus based on its own operational needs and stakeholder obligations, which may not always align perfectly with the preferences of AVAX holders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, the linkage is indirect. Ava Labs does not control AVAX’s market price, and Avalanche’s open-source ecosystem includes many independent developers and participants. Over time, successful ecosystem growth, whether through C-Chain activity or application-specific L1s, can support network usage and broader awareness, which may be constructive for the asset.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a risk perspective, the main issues are practical rather than mechanical. If key ecosystem contributors were to face operational disruption, such as funding constraints, strategic shifts, or other business pressures, the pace of development, ecosystem support, or market confidence could be affected. Conversely, a well-capitalized, execution-oriented contributor base can help Avalanche remain competitive. We therefore view Ava Labs as a net positive for Avalanche today, while recognizing that AVAX’s long-term outcome ultimately depends on adoption and the broader ecosystem, not any single company.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Avalanche Blockchain Fundamental Metrics</h3> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td>Metric</td> <td>30D Average</td> <td>Ranking Out of Top 21 Blockchains</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Daily Revenue</td> <td>$8,094</td> <td>13</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Daily Active Users</td> <td>324,667</td> <td>9</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Total Value Locked</td> <td>$1,229,944,070</td> <td>7</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Daily Transactions</td> <td>2,322,136</td> <td>9</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Stablecoin Supply</td> <td>$1,703,767,118</td> <td>7</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Daily DEX Volume</td> <td>$169,839,958</td> <td>6</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Daily Stablecoin Transfer Volume</td> <td>$2,397,119,748</td> <td>7</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Daily Economic Activity</td> <td>$528,572,767</td> <td>5</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Twitter Followers</td> <td>1,121,086</td> <td>6</td> </tr> <tr> <td>MAUs</td> <td>1,051,674</td> <td>6</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Daily New Users</td> <td>49,838</td> <td>7</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Total Onchain Lending</td> <td>$1,339,098,882</td> <td>5</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Average Transaction Cost</td> <td>$0.004</td> <td>3</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Staked Value</td> <td>$2,698,841,179</td> <td>4</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Source: Artemis XYZ as of 1/28/2026. <strong>Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

SIVR, which belongs to Aberdeen Group PLC (a<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> UK-based investment manager), is issued by the latter’s wholly-owned subsidiary- abrdn ETFs Sponsor LLC [AESL]. To procure a stake in SIVR, investors will need to pay an expense ratio of 0.3%. SIVR does not make any dividends.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>What Does SIVR Do?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SIVR’s chief purpose it to serve as an accessible and cost-efficient vehicle for those who want to profit from the movement of physical silver prices (and not silver futures). SIVR, is basically the owner of<a href=\"https://www.aberdeeninvestments.com/docs?editionId=7690ff0f-7aed-44f1-b573-3146cc0d5c1e\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.aberdeeninvestments.com/docs?editionId=7690ff0f-7aed-44f1-b573-3146cc0d5c1e\" target=\"_blank\"> 75.4m</a> troy ounces of physical silver bullion bars, which are stored and maintained in secured vaults in the UK.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also consider that rather than being set up as an investment company that resorts to active management strategies to generate returns, SIVR is structured as a grantor trust. This means the onus here is to just hold the physical silver and issue shares against it (which investors buy, giving them fractional ownership of the entire silver held), rather than selling the metal when it goes higher, or purchasing it when it dips, or enhancing returns through the use of derivative contracts, etc.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Who Are the Main Parties Within SIVR’s Setup?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Behind SIVR’s successful operations there are a number of key parties that are worth noting:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <em>Sponsor</em>: As covered in the initial section of this article, this role is carried out by AESL, whose responsibility is to create and register shares of SIVR on the NYSE Arca, and issue new shares when required. AESL can be construed to be the general manager of this set-up and is also responsible for picking other key parties (as described below) that are essential to the running of SIVR.</li> <li> <em>Custodian:</em> The silver bars that SIVR holds aren’t held by the sponsor, but by a custodian called ICBC Standard Bank PLC [ISBP]. Interestingly ISBP only took over custodianship responsibilities of SIVR in May 2024 [before that custodianship duties were carried out by JP Morgan Chase] who parks them in their London vaults.</li> <li> <em>Trustee:</em> Trusteeship is carried out by the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BK\" title=\"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\">BK</a>) that looks into the day-to-day administrative work (calculation of the daily NAV, accounting entries, creating grantor trust tax information, etc.)</li> <li> <em>Metal inspector:</em> To ensure that the quality of the bullion bars held in the vaults doesn’t disintegrate, the services of Bureau Veritas Commodities UK Ltd (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BVRDF\" title=\"Bureau Veritas SA\">BVRDF</a>), is also tapped twice a year. Besides a standard inspection at the end of the year, the first inspection takes place on a random date during the year.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>What Are the Risks Associated With SIVR?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since SIVR is established as a grantor trust that holds physical metal, it exhibits some tax inefficiencies that may be seen as cumbersome to a fair few. For instance, long-term capital gains [LTCG] are taxed at a higher collectibles rate of 28% rather than 20% LTCG rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to that, because SIVR is a grantor trust, it does not pay any income tax, with all tax liabilities flowing through to its investors. Also, we know this trust has various expenses to incur, but because there’s no income coming in to cover those expenses, a fraction of the silver owned needs to be sold every month to meet those expenses (also existing holders of SIVR own less silver every month, as a pro-rate share of their holdings been cashed in every month to meet those expenses). Also, even though there is some disposition of investors’ assets every month, the proceeds don’t come to investors’ accounts, yet they are charged with a capital gain or loss and don’t receive a tax break for the same either. This facet could prove to be particularly troubling to those who own SIVR in taxable brokerage accounts (as opposed to IRA or 401(k)s)).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While silver does exhibit shades of a safe haven when risk sentiment in the markets dip or <span id=\"jS$705\" class=\"j3\">geo</span>political risks spike, this defensive trait certainly isn’t as pronounced as gold. Also, silver’s prospects are closely tied to the health of global industrials, making this quite a risky bet that could face some pressure during global cyclical downswings. Investors should also consider that unlike diversified ETFs, SIVR is a single-commodity ETF, which certainly elevates its risk profile. This can be validated even further by SIVR’s standard deviation and volatility readings which are roughly 3x more than a standard ETF, making this product unsuitable for investors with conservative risk appetite.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9658941-17721113303487551_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"905\" data-height=\"293\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9658941-17721113303487551_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Risk\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"207\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9658941-17721113303487551_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9658941-17721113303487551_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9658941-17721113303487551_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9658941-17721113303487551_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Silver has an inverse relationship with the US Dollar, so if the latter witnesses meaningful appreciation, this could be detrimental for SIVR.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Silver has benefited through multi-year deficits (including 2026, we will see will be six straight years of deficits), but investors should also note that these deficits are shrinking by the year (for instance FY25’s estimated deficit of<a href=\"https://www.canadianminingreport.com/blog/is-silver-s-rally-being-driven-by-emotions-or-real-supply-demand\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.canadianminingreport.com/blog/is-silver-s-rally-being-driven-by-emotions-or-real-supply-demand\" target=\"_blank\"> 95-149Moz</a>, is poised to shrink to 68Moz this year) and in a few years, there’s potential for the market position to normalize, which ultimately won’t reflect well on prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If investors are thinking of pursuing SIVR with the intention of also procuring a quarterly, semi-annual or annual dividend bonus (which is standard practice with most ETFs today), then this isn’t the right product. The holdings (equities, bonds, derivative contracts) in most ETFs usually generate some form of income, or are sometimes lent out, to earn additional income, which is then passed on to these shareholders by way of distributions, but in SIVR’s case, it just plainly holds physical silver, and its returns are just a function of the price movements of silver (and nothing more) after accounting for trust expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors should also note that SIVR hasn’t taken out an insurance policy to cover its silver holdings; insurance support if any, only comes in the form of the insurance that the custodian-ISBP, has taken for its entire operation (and not just the silver it holds for SIVR).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Who Is SIVR For?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SIVR is meant for those who want a cost-efficient and transparent route to owning physical silver. For further context note that, SIVR’s expense ratio of 0.3% is already 20bps lower than the median expense ratio of all ETFs.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9658941-17721113309633725_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"903\" data-height=\"290\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9658941-17721113309633725_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Expense\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"206\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9658941-17721113309633725_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9658941-17721113309633725_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9658941-17721113309633725_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9658941-17721113309633725_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Facilitating such a low expense ratio in the silver space is not easy to come by, with competing products priced at a much higher range of <a href=\"https://etfdb.com/etfs/commodity/silver/#etfs__expenses&amp;sort_name=expense_ratio&amp;sort_order=desc&amp;page=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://etfdb.com/etfs/commodity/silver/#etfs__expenses&amp;sort_name=expense_ratio&amp;sort_order=desc&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\">0.5-0.95%</a> (admittedly, some of these products are leveraged ETFs which will understandably cost more, but even against the unleveraged ETFs SIVR has a strong edge).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SIVR also scores high on transparency, with its custodian- ISBP, providing a<a href=\"https://phoenix.icbcstandard.com/assets/public/barlists/Abrdn%20ETF%20Silver%20Bar%20List.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://phoenix.icbcstandard.com/assets/public/barlists/Abrdn%20ETF%20Silver%20Bar%20List.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> bar list</a> which is updated every day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors <span>attracted to </span>SIVR are typically also those who are likely feeling emboldened about the long-term health and the buoyancy of the global industrial landscape; after all, roughly 60% of silver demand comes from the industrial sector.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9658941-17721113316040163_origin.jpeg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"679\" data-height=\"252\" title=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9658941-17721113316040163_origin.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9658941-17721113316040163_origin.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"Silver demand sources\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"238\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9658941-17721113316040163_origin.jpeg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9658941-17721113316040163_origin.jpeg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9658941-17721113316040163_origin.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9658941-17721113316040163_origin.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Sprott</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Within industrials, those who expect the solar wave to gain traction will like this product, as modern solar cells are increasingly seeing higher silver paste per cells than older models.

Relative longevity certainly appears to have played a part in the respective AUMs of these products, although SLV is well ahead of the other two at nearly $50B of AUM. SLV’s strong drawing power can also be felt through the liquidity it attracts every day (around $8B of dollar volumes, whereas the other two see less than half a billion dollars).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">PSLV, which is the priciest out of the lot (expense ratio of 0.57%), is meant for those also want the option of redeeming their stake through physical silver (and not just cash). Both SLV and SIVR don’t have this useful redemption option. It must also be said that for the degree of AUM it has accumulated, PSLV sees<a href=\"https://www.cefconnect.com/fund/PSLV\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.cefconnect.com/fund/PSLV\" target=\"_blank\"> very strong daily liquidity</a> (almost half its total AUM). In addition to that, PSLV is set up as a Canadian trust, and thus the IRS recognizes it as a Passive Foreign Investment Corporation (PFIC).

The rental car company has been looking to turn around its business after a failed bet on electric vehicles led to significant losses. The<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> latest results indicated that things are improving, but the company still faces a number of headwinds as we progress through 2026.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Previous Coverage of the Name</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It was nearly a year ago that I last covered the company, right as the overall market was getting worried over President Trump's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4771645-hertz-global-stock-sell-tariff-rally\">global tariff strategy</a>. Hertz shares had jumped on hopes that rising used car prices would lower the company's depreciation expenses and lead to better resale values. However, things haven't worked out totally as expected, as since then, the stock has only risen about 6.7%, compared to a more than 24% surge in the S&amp;P 500.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Look at the Q4 Results and Recent News</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the final period of 2025, Hertz reported revenues of $2.028 billion. While this number was down $12 million over the prior year period, it did beat street estimates by about $100 million. The company reported a small increase in average rentable vehicles, but it had a slightly lower revenue per unit figure. While the International segment showed about 10% top-line growth, the much larger Americas division showed a 3% decline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hertz was able to narrow its losses quite a bit in the quarter, mainly due to a 21% drop in monthly depreciation per vehicle. The company also reduced its direct vehicle and operating expenses while also showing a decline in interest costs. However, the company still lost nearly $200 million, and this figure included a significant benefit from the reduction in the fair value of its public warrants. For the year, the net loss was $747 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the current quarter, management expects a mid-single-digit revenue increase, well above the street's estimate for less than 2%. The company believes its commercial strategy is paying off, and it is focused on its off-airport and mobility business this year. I'll be curious to see if this progress continues later in 2026 as electric vehicle giant Tesla (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA\" title=\"Tesla, Inc.\">TSLA</a>) expands its robo-taxi network, which could be a headwind for the overall rental car industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other major piece of news recently was a big loss for the company. The U.S. Supreme Court <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4538539-hertz-global-slips-after-the-supreme-court-declines-to-hear-bond-payout-case\">declined to hear a case</a> regarding the company's bond payouts related to its Chapter 11 bankruptcy. As a result of this, the lower court's ruling stayed in place, so the company made a $346 million payment in January as detailed in its <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000047129/000165785326000008/htz-20251231.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">10-K filing</a>. The Delaware Bankruptcy Court will determine whether any additional amounts are due.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Update</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hertz finished 2025 with $565 million in cash on the balance sheet. However, due to the capital-intensive nature of the business, it also had over $17 billion in total debt. At nearly $16.5 billion, the net debt total worsened by almost three quarters of a billion dollars last year and is up more than $3.56 billion in the last three years alone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The problem for Hertz right now is that it's not generating enough cash to cover the net costs of its capital expenditures. In 2025, total operating cash flow was $1.625 billion, down about $600 million from the year before. However, the company's net vehicle expenditures after disposals were about $2.1 billion, so true free cash flow was deeply negative. If things continue as is, Hertz will need to raise further capital through either debt or equity.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Current Valuation Picture</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With Hertz losing money currently, there is no price-to-earnings ratio to calculate here. On a price-to-sales basis, Hertz goes for about 0.18 times its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HTZ/earnings/estimates\">currently expected revenues</a> for this year. That's less than half the roughly 0.39 times that competitor Avis Budget Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAR\" title=\"Avis Budget Group, Inc.\">CAR</a>) goes for. Hertz is projected to show more revenue growth in 2026, but Avis didn't lose as much money last year (after impairment charges).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the analyst side of things, it's a mixed picture. Of the 9 analysts who have covered the stock in the past three months, there were six hold ratings and three sells. The current <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HTZ/ratings/sell-side-ratings#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\">average price target</a> is $4.75, implying more than 7% upside from current levels. That average has risen from $3.39 a year ago, but three years ago it was nearly $25.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts and Recommendation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As Hertz continues its turnaround efforts, Q4 revenues came in better than street estimates on Thursday. The quarter's decline wasn't nearly as bad as expected, and things are looking even better in the current period. The only problem here is that the business is very capital intensive, and the company isn't generating enough operating cash flow to cover its vehicle purchases, leading to a large and growing net debt pile.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the valuation seems very depressed now compared to a key industry peer, I'm upgrading the stock today from \"Sell\" to \"Neutral.\" While I don't like the overall financial situation here, some progress has been made recently, and management did paint a pretty rosy picture for the start of this year. I'm not ready yet to fully buy in, given an ever-changing mobility industry, so I'd like to see another quarter or two of major progress here.</p>",

Salesforce, Inc. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRM\" title=\"Salesforce, Inc.\">CRM</a></span>) just posted a blowout <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557100-salesforce-non-gaap-eps-of-3_81-beats-by-0_76-revenue-of-11_2b-in-line\">quarter</a>, with Q4 revenue growing<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the most (12.1%) since the January 2023 quarter.

I mean, we have a clear disconnect between fundamentals and price action. Do we?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, at 14.6x next year's earnings, I don't think the market is discontent with the valuation. Despite some bottom-line pressure due to token costs, fundamentals, guidance, and the Street's revenue models for the next few years are intact, but that doesn't mean the stock will recover in a V-shape form.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My concern is the lack of a clear catalyst to turn around the pessimism in the software space.

Here is an excerpt from the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874911-salesforce-inc-crm-q4-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">last Q&amp;A</a> on the CFO's comments on margins (emphasis added):</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>I think you were asking specifically, Gabriela, about what does it do to gross margins? And as we think about margins in the short run, we think we're pretty neutral. Patrick talked about this differentiation between tokens and AWUs. Well, tokens, those prices, we're working with our various partners. <em>Those are going to start to go down over time and commoditize.</em><strong> </strong></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I considered highlighting the last phrase. Let me explain why.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The demand for Agentforce is stronger than I initially expected. In its first 15 months, the company closed 29,000 deals for <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/uk/agentforce/\" rel=\"noopener\">Agentforce</a> (an AI-driven platform for building, deploying, and managing autonomous agents), with customers in production up 50% in Q4. On top of Agentforce, SlackBot is likely consuming a good amount of tokens as well, given that Slack hosts about 1 billion messages a day. I strongly believe the token usage is pressuring the bottom line of the company, as I don't believe Salesforce is passing through the entire cost of the tokens. As seen below, tokens are quite expensive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17721121563172674_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1074\" data-height=\"517\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17721121563172674_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Anthropic\" width=\"640\" height=\"308\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17721121563172674_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17721121563172674_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17721121563172674_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-17721121563172674_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Anthropic</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I used Anthropic's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANTHRO\" title=\"Anthropic\">ANTHRO</a>) API pricing model, as management seems to have a very good relationship with the AI startup.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>One of those partners is in Great Anthropic, we love Anthropic, we love Dario, Daniela, I tweeted about what they did yesterday, incredible demo.</p> <p>Just yesterday, Dario demonstrated how he is doing something amazing with Salesforce in the enterprise......

Using the Opus 4.6 model, I get $47.5M in input costs and 237.5M in output costs. Again, these numbers are conservative, as I'm assuming no cached inputs. The bottom line is that these costs are unlikely to be fully passed to customers. This may be the reason behind the small sequential decline in margins last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving on to another metric that busts the AI disruption fears, the CRPO in Q4 was $35.1B, up 16% YOY. In fact, if we look at the total RPO (which came in at $72B), the growth last quarter was the highest since the July 2024 quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-1772113213767965_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1376\" data-height=\"489\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-1772113213767965_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Author Compilation\" width=\"640\" height=\"227\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-1772113213767965_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-1772113213767965_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-1772113213767965_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60524232-1772113213767965_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author Compilation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Call me crazy, but I don't see any AI disruptions.

FY27 subscription and support growth guidance was slightly under 12% y/y on a nominal basis. On the bottom line, management expects a FY27 non-GAAP operating margin guidance of 34.3% (+20 bps) and GAAP operating margin of 20.9% (+80 bps).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking further ahead, management reiterated that it remains on track to hit the Rule of 50 by FY 2030. In fact, they are targeting a FY30 revenue target of $63B, which implies 11% CAGR between 2026 and 2030.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's double-digit growth in the next 4 years.

The unemployment rate dropped below 4.0 percent again, and although the rate has risen somewhat in the past year, it remains around the 4.0 percent level. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Many experts believe that this 4.0 percent rate can be assumed to be the \"full\" employment rate of unemployment. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, employment seems to be holding its own in this period. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Inflation</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-17720513701371567_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1900\" data-height=\"1042\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-17720513701371567_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"GDP: Explicit Price Deflator\" width=\"640\" height=\"351\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-17720513701371567_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-17720513701371567_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-17720513701371567_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-17720513701371567_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">GDP: Implicit Price Deflator <span>(Federal Reserve)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here we see the inflation rate as given by the Implicit Price Deflator coming from the Gross Domestic Product accounts. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As can be seen, the implicit prices have been rising at a relatively steady rate during this whole period, again the exception coming in the period of economic disturbance...2020-2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What can be seen in this chart is that during the time that the Federal Reserve followed the Bernanke approach to monetary policy, prices remained relatively stable, breaking out only during the period of economic disturbance. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> We would like the rate of inflation to come lower. That is the goal of the Federal Reserve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We need to keep our watch out on the Fed to see that it continues to exert itself to bring the rate of inflation down a little lower. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, in the range of these three measures, the economy of the United States seems to be doing fairly well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Economic growth...OK, around 2.5 percent.

The investment thesis is contingent upon margin improvement and a shift in mix towards more value-infused infrastructure solutions.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue is Real but Quality is More Important</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is no question about the revenue growth. Q2 revenue was <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4865500-super-micro-computer-inc-smci-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4865500-super-micro-computer-inc-smci-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">$12.68 billion</a>, significantly above guidance, and the company guided to at least $40 billion in revenue for the upcoming fiscal year. AI GPU platforms accounted for more than 90% of revenue, highlighting the company’s strong alignment with the Nvidia and AMD roadmaps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the nature of the company’s revenue composition does require more scrutiny. For example, the company had one large data center customer that comprised <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001375365/603e5882-b841-4776-a351-353b2005cdd1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001375365/603e5882-b841-4776-a351-353b2005cdd1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">about 63%</a> of the company’s total revenue in the second quarter. This type of concentration, by itself, already poses considerable volatility risk. Although the company did signal that diversification efforts are underway, such high levels of concentration mean that the deployment timing of one single customer can already cause considerable volatility in the company’s results.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856686559982_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1858\" data-height=\"388\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856686559982_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SMCI\" width=\"640\" height=\"134\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856686559982_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856686559982_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856686559982_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856686559982_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SMCI 10Q</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of geographic dispersion, the company derived 86% of its revenue from the US, although Europe also declined considerably on a year-over-year basis. This also means that the company is likely seeing considerable hyperscale data center build-outs in the US, which are currently the primary drivers of the company’s business. However, if sovereign AI rollouts are undertaken in Europe and the Middle East, the company’s expanded manufacturing footprint in Malaysia, Taiwan, and the Netherlands also provides considerable leverage. However, the company’s primary source of revenue remains the large data center rollouts in the US.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What I find more interesting, however, is the company’s shift to Rack Scale Systems and the emergence of Data Center Building Block Solutions. Although not discussed in the company’s earnings call, the company did reveal that Data Center Building Block Solutions comprised about 4% of the company’s profit in the first half of FY2026, which could increase to double-digit profit contribution by the end of 2026. With the company’s gross margins on <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/818/120818/original.pdf\" title=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/818/120818/original.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">DCBBS</a> already exceeding 20%, compared to the company’s mid-single-digit average, this is where the company’s business model really begins to change from one that is merely reselling hardware to one that is more integrated. However, this remains prospective and not actual.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856694124396_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1730\" data-height=\"966\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856694124396_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SMCI\" width=\"640\" height=\"357\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856694124396_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856694124396_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856694124396_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856694124396_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FQ2 2026 Results</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Margin Compression: Temporary Friction or Structural Reality?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The major challenge in this quarter has been margin compression. The company has seen a decrease in its non-GAAP gross margin, now standing at 6.4%. The company has cited this as a result of customer mix, expedited transport costs, component shortages, and tariff effects. Some of these effects are likely cyclical in nature. The expedited transport cost for initial GP300 shipments will normalize over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, the customer mix is not entirely temporary. Large model builders and hyperscalers have enormous price leverage. When 63% of revenue comes from one customer, the bargaining dynamics are not symmetrical. Such structural pressure is exerted on the company’s margins unless there is substantial differentiation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operating expenses were impressively managed at 1.9% of revenue in the most recent quarter on a non-GAAP basis. This is indicative of substantial operating leverage. The company’s non-GAAP operating margins were at 4.5%, down from 5.4% in the prior quarter’s Q1. Nevertheless, such substantial scale is indicative of economies of scale. The pertinent question is whether these economies would be sufficient to offset the company’s gross margins in the mid-range.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_6f0a350279ada8b1cd88c0e42f3b6fa0.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_6f0a350279ada8b1cd88c0e42f3b6fa0.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_6f0a350279ada8b1cd88c0e42f3b6fa0.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_6f0a350279ada8b1cd88c0e42f3b6fa0.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s free cash flow came in at negative $45 million due to the build-up in inventory to $10.6 billion and increased receivables. The cash conversion cycle has come down dramatically from 123 days to 54 days. Nevertheless, this is aided by the long payables cycle. The company’s net debt has increased to $787 million. Nevertheless, the company has secured multiple credit facilities aggregating to nearly $4 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, the company is in the land-grab phase. The company is deliberately accepting lower margins to acquire market share in the unprecedented AI infrastructure cycle. Such a strategy is workable provided the company’s higher-margin DCBBS and diversification into the enterprise segment are achieved quickly.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Platform Transition and Competitive Positioning</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the coming days, SMCI is gearing up to support Nvidia’s Vera Rubin platform as well as AMD’s Helios platform. The company is seeing strong visibility with customers for the second half. Historically, the company has prided itself on delivering total solutions to the marketplace several months before the reference architecture is available.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The underlying question is differentiation. Nvidia provides the underlying compute. SMCI provides the integration of compute, cooling, power, and rack-scale solutions. DCBBS is a natural extension of this, providing cooling distribution units, power shelves, battery backup, and data center management software.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a very strategically intelligent move for SMCI. Time to online is a very important factor for data center customers, and the same goes for increasing efficiencies around power consumption. If SMCI can successfully position itself as a one-stop shop for AI factory builders, not simply a server vendor, then its margin structure could improve significantly.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation: Cheap for the Growth, Expensive for the Margins</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At current multiples, SMCI is trading at a significant discount to its peers for FY2027 earnings, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMCI/earnings\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMCI/earnings\" target=\"_blank\">around 11x</a>. On a forward P/S multiple, SMCI is also attractive at just 0.45x 2026 revenues, especially given its exposure to the AI trend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the way to think about this name is not in isolation from its underlying margin structure. A 6% to 7% gross margin business deserves a very different multiple than a 20% to 30% infrastructure business. If the gross margin improves to the high single digits and DCBBS grows to a double-digit profit contribution, there could be significant earnings potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see the valuation as fair. It assumes strong growth but not explosive margin growth. There is upside if DCBBS ramps up faster than expected. There is risk if hyperscaler pricing pressure continues.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_187d9515f3ebbd09f9fe61c7ed3af01a.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_187d9515f3ebbd09f9fe61c7ed3af01a.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_187d9515f3ebbd09f9fe61c7ed3af01a.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_187d9515f3ebbd09f9fe61c7ed3af01a.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks: When Hypergrowth Meets Hidden Fragility</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What I see as the biggest risk is customer concentration. A change in deployment schedules by the 63% customer could introduce volatility in revenue and working capital. In a period with this much growth, visibility can change quickly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Margin pressure could be more persistent than management expects. If component shortages continue or hyperscalers continue to pressure pricing, gross margin recovery could be slower than expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The inventory position of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4865500-super-micro-computer-inc-smci-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4865500-super-micro-computer-inc-smci-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">$10.6 billion</a> is large. Management points to this as a position to take advantage of in the Q3 upswing. Any slowdown in demand could stress the company's working capital position. They have been proactive in increasing credit lines, and leverage is increasing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, the DOJ risk and corporate governance risk continue as an overhang. While the company is performing well operationally, investors could demand a risk premium until the corporate governance situation improves.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Super Micro is executing in the middle of the most powerful AI infrastructure in decades. They are growing revenue. They have excellent visibility in demand. However, I see margin risk and customer concentration risk. I see this as a Hold. I consider buying in at the insider levels provides speculative upside.</p>",

One of these is margin compression, since intense competition in the chosen segment is pushing net margins down to 3.1% from 6.9% a year earlier. This means SMCI's stock is dealing with what you might call a \"growth quality crisis.\" In addition to analyzing Super Micro's growth drivers, competition, and financial profile, the purpose of this article is to assess its potential value and analyze key business risks in 2026. In spite of the challenges it faces, it has the potential to improve the operational and economic efficiency of its core business, allowing it to offset the loss of its previous margin and increase its market value. Meanwhile, its rapidly growing market and offering of more unique solutions for servers and data center cooling allow us to give SMCI shares a \"Buy\" rating.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">SMCI's Strategy and Growth Drivers</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As one of the global leaders in the high-performance server and data storage segment, Super Micro's role is growing in line with the ongoing AI supercycle and the development of related infrastructure. Its business portfolio includes three key areas: AI server solutions, liquid cooling technologies, and Building Block Solutions. AI servers are a key area for generating cash flow for SMCI, with the company developing and assembling server equipment optimized for use with graphics processing units, notably from NVIDIA (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Within the first area, we have developed the Building Block Solutions concept, using a modular approach to building AI server architecture. An advantage of this product is the high speed of assembly of servers tailored to the individual configurations of each customer, ensuring the proper efficiency of the equipment in the future. DLC emerged separately from the development of AI servers; however, growing demand for the company's solutions is precisely due to the construction of new data centers. Operating chips in their infrastructure generates a huge amount of heat, which SMCI's liquid cooling systems allow centers to operate more efficiently and without unexpected shutdowns and failures. Furthermore, implementation of the company's DLC reduces energy costs for the cooling system itself and enables more chips and computing power to be placed in a smaller data center footprint.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In analyzing the catalysts for SMCI's strategic growth in 2026, we should point out the main short-term driver related to NVIDIA's Blackwell update. <a href=\"https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/finterra-2026-1-28-the-liquid-cooled-titan-a-deep-dive-into-super-micro-computers-smci-2026-recovery-and-ai-dominance\" rel=\"nofollow\">The data shows that at the beginning of 2026, its order book for these systems is around $13 billion.</a> That's thanks to Building Block Solutions, where it can get ready-made servers based on these chips up and running about a month faster than its competitors, and that's a key thing in the race between hyperscalers. In addition to the driver from the Blackwell update, another important growth catalyst for SMCI is the increasing demand for highly efficient liquid cooling systems. It is because chips are becoming more powerful than 1000 W, and traditional cooling mechanisms are physically unable to cope with this. Right now, this <a href=\"https://www.supermicro.com/en/pressreleases/supermicro-begins-volume-shipments-max-performance-servers-optimized-ai-hpc\" rel=\"nofollow\">company has set up the world's largest production of liquid-cooled racks (with up to 5000 racks per month)</a>, allowing it to keep up with growing demand. The global cooling systems market is expected to reach $21 billion in revenue by 2026, growing to $54 billion by 2034, estimates Fortune Business. Around 35% of all spending on cooling components is related to AI computing infrastructure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that SMCI's main challenge is the contraction of its marginal business, investments in the launch of more cost-effective production facilities are emerging as key growth drivers. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4809193-super-micro-computer-inc-smci-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">This includes the launch of a new plant in Malaysia, expected to take place in the second half of 2026.</a> Economic benefits of the project will be reflected in lower costs, particularly labor and taxes (when compared to the US and Taiwan). Moreover, SMCI's management expects the launch of this plant to boost revenue to $40 billion in 2026. The increase in revenue will be accompanied by economies of scale, with even a minimal improvement in operating efficiency from lower costs significantly improving EPS.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Competition for SMCI</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Analyzing SMCI's competitive environment, we should understand that the company faces competition in the production of servers for AI infrastructure and liquid cooling systems. The competition can be classified into 3 key groups: global technology giants, Asian players, and indirect competitors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Groups of global technology giants are SMCI's most direct competitors, since they are all fighting for orders from large enterprises and government agencies. Dell Technologies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DELL\" title=\"Dell Technologies Inc.\">DELL</a>) will be the main competitor, currently pursuing an aggressive policy to capture an increasing share of the AI server market. For this purpose, the company is leveraging its huge corporate customer base and the best global supply chain. The other global competitor from the US is Hewlett Packard Enterprise (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HPE\" title=\"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company\">HPE</a>), with competitive advantages in the high-performance computing segment. By acquiring Juniper Networks, it strengthened its position in AI networking solutions, which allows it to offer data centers more comprehensive infrastructure packages.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A group of Asian players is led by technology giant Lenovo Group. The company focuses on hybrid cloud solutions and offers more flexible pricing, one of the main reasons for the decline in margins for SMCI and other US companies. Asian competitors also include Inspur (the largest server manufacturer in China, which dominates the domestic market) and Giga Computing (providing solutions for custom GPU servers and developing solutions to support new NVIDIA and AMD chips). ASUS and Foxconn are also worth mentioning among Asian players, however, as they often act as contract manufacturers. Their main target audience is the lower and middle price segments. Generally speaking, the common characteristic of all Asian competitors is their cheaper offerings, due to lower production costs resulting from economies of scale.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Indirect competitors include hyperscalers, such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, that are not only major customers for SMCI's AI servers and cooling systems but also engage in their own internal development. In fact, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are developing their own server architectures for their own chips (Trainium, Inferentia, TPU, and Maia). Their goal is to make hyperscalers less dependent on outside contractors, particularly since most of the manufacturers are in Asia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the future of competition, the <a href=\"https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS54034325\" rel=\"nofollow\">total revenue for the server market hit another record high of $112.4 billion in Q3 2025</a>. Plus, suppliers' revenue went up 61% compared to Q3 2024. The US remains the main server market, growing by 79.1%, compared to China's more modest growth of 37.6%. Analyzing the structure of the competition, note that Dell remains the main player in the server market, accounting for 8.3% of the market, compared to 9.7% a year earlier. Meanwhile, SMCI is the second-largest company in the world in terms of sales of OEM products for servers, with revenue falling by 13.2%, reflecting the impact of margin compression. While SMCI's share was 7.4% a year earlier, today it is only 4.0%. Moreover, previously, the top 5 companies accounted for 33.3% of the server market, and now they account for 22.6%. The decline in the concentration of key manufacturers in the market is caused by the emergence of an increasing number of local competitors and newcomers from Asia, as well as the internal developments of hyperscalers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-1772061511553959_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1004\" data-height=\"430\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-1772061511553959_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Top 5 Companies, Worldwide Server Market, Third Quarter of 2025\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"274\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-1772061511553959_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-1772061511553959_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-1772061511553959_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-1772061511553959_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Top 5 Companies, Worldwide Server Market, Third Quarter of 2025</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">SMCI's Financial Profile</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The financial profile of SMCI's business appeals to me because the company is showing positive momentum in revenue and EPS, which proves that it is capable of not only spending investors' capital but also generating profits. SMCI's status as a key partner of NVIDIA (63% of total revenue) allows it to scale its business, expand production, and move towards supplying individual servers with higher added value. About 84% of the company's total revenue comes from the US domestic market. Nevertheless, even with solid revenue growth, they're dealing with shrinking business margins. As of now, <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/818/120818/original.pdf\">net margins have dropped to 3.1% and gross margins to 6.4%</a>. By comparison, the latter was 11.8% a year earlier. Operating cash flow was negative at $24 million, down $240 million from the same period a year earlier.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-17720616615274801_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1004\" data-height=\"334\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-17720616615274801_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q2 FY2026 Highlights\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"213\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-17720616615274801_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-17720616615274801_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-17720616615274801_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-17720616615274801_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Q2 FY2026 Highlights</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260203844970/en/Supermicro-Announces-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-Year-2026-Financial-Results\" rel=\"nofollow\">Looking at the company's latest financial repor</a>t, we should point out that non-GAAP EPS was $0.69, up $0.20 from the consensus forecast, and revenue was $2.36 billion higher than expected, coming in at $12.7 billion. That's up 122.8% from the same period a year earlier, leading to an increase in the company's forecasts for 2026. Around 90% of SMCI's revenue will continue to come from sales of AI cluster solutions, allowing it to achieve an annual revenue of $36-40 billion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">SMCI Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In order to assess the potential value of SMCI shares, we must take into account that using only traditional P/E multiples is unreasonable, given the company's high CAPEX costs. It is therefore worth looking at other multiples, among which are EV/Sales and EV/EBITDA. To analyze the multiples of other companies, let's take a look at SMCI's direct competitors: Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Name</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Enterprise Value</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>P/E</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>EV/Sales</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>EV/EBITDA</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>SMCI</strong></p></td> <td><p>$19.80В</p></td> <td><p>16.98х</p></td> <td><p>0.48х</p></td> <td><p>10.02х</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>DELL</strong></p></td> <td><p>$101.84В</p></td> <td><p>14.36х</p></td> <td><p>0.91х</p></td> <td><p>8.29х</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>HPE</strong></p></td> <td><p>$46.01В</p></td> <td><p>26.13х</p></td> <td><p>1.13х</p></td> <td><p>6.77х</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Median</strong></p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>19.15х</p></td> <td><p>0.84х</p></td> <td><p>8.36х</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on our assessment, our median P/E ratio is 19.15x, EV/Sales is 0.84x, and EV/EBITDA is 8.36x. These first two SMCI multiples have a discount of 11.3% and 42.9%, respectively, with EV/EBITDA having a premium of 19.8%. This means that if we take the average value, then we get a discount on shares of 11.5%, meaning that SMCI shares have the potential to grow in market value over the next 12 months from $33.20 to $37.00.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">SMCI Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main risks to Super Micro's market value growth are still structural issues within the company. Let's break them down into three categories:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The critical concentration of customers in the revenue structure, with approximately 63% of all revenue coming from one major customer. Therefore, anything that changes the customer's CAPEX carries catastrophic risks for SMCI's future orders. Also, there's the potential risk that DELL or HPE could lure the customer away.</li> <li>Marginal business compression, resulting in significantly lower potential net profit growth. To shareholders, net margins of 3.1% mean that SMCI has no safety cushion in the event of market shocks or internal crises. Reasons for this compression of business margins include dumping to compete with DELL and HPE, upscaling of production by Asian competitors, and an increase in SMCI's logistics and procurement costs.</li> <li>A negative operating cash flow of $24 million in the second fiscal quarter of 2026. This is due to a squeeze on business margins, as a result of which the company may face a free cash flow deficit. As of now, the company's cash reserves have reached $10.6 billion, slowing down the turnover of working capital and forcing the company to take out new loans and issue convertible bonds to replenish its working capital. For example, on January 6, 2026, SMCI concluded a new agreement with JPMorgan Chase (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM\" title=\"JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.\">JPM</a>) to provide a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4537154-super-micro-computer-enters-2-bln-revolving-credit-facility\">revolving credit line in the amount of $2 billion</a>. As of now, its total debt is $5.263 billion, compared to $1.957 billion a year earlier.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on my fundamental analysis of Super Micro, I would confirm the high investment attractiveness of its shares. Results for 2025 were not easy due to a decline in market share in the global AI server market and margin compression. This is a classic \"growth quality crisis\" situation, in which phenomenal revenue growth is accompanied by a decline in operating efficiency. That said, factors like building a new factory, a 42.9% discount on the EV/Sales multiple, and the Building Block Solutions offering will help the company be more competitive by improving quality instead of dumping prices. To sum up, SMCI represents a unique opportunity to invest in undervalued stocks that will benefit from the transition of data centers to Blackwell chips. My target price of around $37 per share is for the next 6 months and does not take into account the additional benefits of a continued bull market in the AI segment. And if the economic situation turns out to be positive, then I think we could see SMCI return to its 2025 high of $62.36, or even higher.</p>",

The deal will almost entirely be paid for in cash, except for a $5 million stock payment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based in Atlanta, Royston has five manufacturing sites across the country that provide custom store fixtures, signage, and both refrigerated and heated case displays. The company is fully integrated, offering solutions that range from design to engineering, fabrication, distribution, and installation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Typical end market applications involve refueling/C-stores, grocery stores, and quick-service restaurants. On a trailing basis, that is, until September of last year, Royston generated $272 million in sales and $38 million in EBITDA. That works down to a 1.2 times sales multiple and an 8.5 times EBITDA multiple, respectively. That latter multiple drops to 8.1 times if and once tax synergies are considered. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the company sees strong potential for shared manufacturing and cross-selling, such benefits are not quantified. Based on the pro forma numbers (again for the period ending in September), pro forma sales are seen at $864 million, with EBITDA seen around $95 million.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Leading Lighting &amp; Display Solutions</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The paragraph header, in essence, describes the business <a href=\"https://s24.q4cdn.com/769247122/files/doc_presentations/2026/Jan/23/LYTS-Investor-Presentation-Fast-Forward-January-2026.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://s24.q4cdn.com/769247122/files/doc_presentations/2026/Jan/23/LYTS-Investor-Presentation-Fast-Forward-January-2026.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">activities</a> of LSI to the extent not known, as the acquisition of Royston fits perfectly within that. The company is a vertically integrated commercial indoor/outdoor lighting and display solutions company. The company over time has been focusing on higher-value solutions, driven by internal advancements and certain M&amp;A activities over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lighting solutions focus on various indoor, outdoor, and control settings, including high-bays, linear, decorative, canopy, floors, bollards, Bluetooth, dimmers, motion detection, etc. These are used in automotive stores, c-stores, quick-service restaurants, retail and grocery outlets, parking, and sports venues. Other solutions include display solutions, which include menus, for instance, all accompanied by various services offered. Besides offering lighting, such solutions are key for branding and marketing, as well as providing a sense of security, among others.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company operates nearly 20 manufacturing sites across the country, serving big names like Walmart, Starbucks, Burger King, Chevron, BP, 7-Eleven, and many more, just to name a few.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company posted sales in the low $300 million in the second half of the 2010s. Some organic improvements and M&amp;A made that share nearly double over the past five years to $600 million. The dealmaking efforts include a 2021 purchase of JSI Store, adding $72 million in sales. This was followed by the 2024 purchase of EMI Technologies to add $87 million in sales, while the company announced a $25 million sales contribution from its fiscal 2026 purchase of Canada's Best Holdings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this was accompanied by operating margins moving up from the mid single-digits to the high single-digits, although they have come down a point or two in recent years. These improvements, both organic and inorganic, made it so that shares rose from the low single digits pre-pandemic to levels in the low twenties. Truth be told, shares traded at these levels pre the Great Financial Crisis.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Game</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last summer, LSI <a href=\"https://s24.q4cdn.com/769247122/files/doc_news/2025/Aug/21/LYTS-PR-4th-Quarter-FY-2025-8-20-25-Final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://s24.q4cdn.com/769247122/files/doc_news/2025/Aug/21/LYTS-PR-4th-Quarter-FY-2025-8-20-25-Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> its 2025 results, with revenues reported up 22% to $573 million. Adjusted EBITDA was reported at $55 million, for margins of 9.6%. These margins are actually down 140 basis points on the year before. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">GAAP earnings fell four cents to $0.79 per share, with adjusted earnings reported dead flat at $1.07 per share. Excluding about $0.13 per share in stock-based compensation expense, realistic earnings are seen around $0.95 per share. Leverage ratios were reported just shy of 1x, and while the company did not provide formal 2026 guidance, it entered the year with a healthy backlog and strong production outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was driven by a strong end to the year, with organic sales reported up 11% in the final quarter, with margins reported as relatively strong as well. Extrapolating these results, realistic earnings power trended closer to $1.25 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we look at the reported pro forma numbers, sales are seen up to $864 million, with EBITDA seen around $95 million. As of the second quarter of this year, the company operated with about 32 million shares outstanding, with net debt <a href=\"https://investors.lsicorp.com/news/news-details/2026/LSI-Industries-Reports-Fiscal-2026-Second-Quarter-Results-and-Declares-Quarterly-Cash-Dividend/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.lsicorp.com/news/news-details/2026/LSI-Industries-Reports-Fiscal-2026-Second-Quarter-Results-and-Declares-Quarterly-Cash-Dividend/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> at $22 million. Based on the purchase price and the news that a $90 million stock <a href=\"https://investors.lsicorp.com/news/news-details/2026/LSI-Industries-Announces-Proposed-90-Million-Public-Offering-of-Common-Stock/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.lsicorp.com/news/news-details/2026/LSI-Industries-Announces-Proposed-90-Million-Public-Offering-of-Common-Stock/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">issuance</a> is announced in connection with the Royston deal, we can construct some pro forma implications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trading around $22 per share, the equity issuance involves about 4 million shares to be issued, pushing up the pro forma share count to about 36 million. Net debt of $22 million will jump to just over $300 million, for a leverage ratio in the low 3s.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Actual depreciation expenses of the business trend at just $6-$7 million, and even if I use a $10 million number for the combination, pro forma EBIT is seen around $85 million. Factoring in a 6% cost of debt on just over $300 million in net debt and applying statutory tax rates, net earnings potential is seen around $50 million, close to $1.40 per share, which looks to be quite accretive. That, however, is ahead of stock-based compensation, all of which could impact earnings by around $0.15 per share here.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Now?</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ahead of the Royston deal, LSI commanded an enterprise valuation in the low $700 million at $22 per share, valuing the business at just over 1 times sales, but around 12-13 times trailing EBITDA of $57 million. With largely a similar sales multiple applied to Royston, the big benefit is that it acquired 14% EBITDA margin activities, while its own business posts margins just shy of 10%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This makes for real earnings accretion but comes at the expense of some leverage taken on here. This is noteworthy after second quarter sales of the organic business at $147 million were mostly flat compared to last year, as some organic growth and/or execution seem lacking here in recent times.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So in between the situation ahead and after the deal, the company will likely see roughly 20 cents in earnings accretion from buying a higher-margin business at similar sales multiples, but it jacks up leverage as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One thing is certain: The deal helps in achieving 2028 targets, described under the Fast Forward plan. Under this, the company targets $800 million in sales and 12.5% EBITDA margins, for EBITDA around a hundred million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I furthermore like the fact that Royston provides a one-stop solution and that no synergetic estimates are considered to justify the deal, which takes place at very reasonable multiples. This makes both the financial and strategic considerations behind the deal very sound.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All of this makes me genuinely interested in the business, although I recognize its period of sluggish operating performance in the past. Potential dips in the share price action in response to this deal will be used as a potential buying opportunity. I really like the deal but still feel a bit uneasy given the debt employed and softer recent organic performance.</p>",

The fund commands a 5% dividend yield, as the market environment in recent years has been quite favorable to the fund’s investors, where the yield<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> picked up significantly due to the elevated interest rate environment. The yield is also enhanced by the option trading strategy on the SPX index, which generates additional income to the underlying ultra-short T-bill exposure. As a result, the fund delivers superior returns in its segment and appears as an attractive tool for income investors amid the ongoing macro uncertainty. I am bullish on CSHI ETF shares, as my calculations indicate that the fund could deliver up to a 5% return over the next 12-month horizon.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NEOS Enhanced Income 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF is <a href=\"https://neosfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/CSHI-Summary-Prospectus.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://neosfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/CSHI-Summary-Prospectus.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">established</a> to invests in a portfolio of very short-term US Treasury bonds with maturities between 1 and 3 months.

CSHI generates a high dividend yield for its investors, which conforms to the elevated benchmark interest rate environment in recent years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund distributed $2.50 per share over the last 12-month period, which indicates a 5% dividend yield. The fund also provides the highest dividend yield among the ultra-short-term ETFs, where iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SGOV\" title=\"iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF\">SGOV</a>) and State Street SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIL\" title=\"State Street SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF\">BIL</a>) generate 4% yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, the option strategy is delivering prominent benefits, which makes CSHI an attractive position compared to other ETFs. The option strategy is designed to enhance the return that the fund earns from T-bills by trading put credit spreads (or bull put spreads). The strategy generates positive returns in rising and flat equity markets and may generate a positive return in equity markets that are modestly declining, assuming the net premium collected from the options sold and purchased exceeds the net cost to close the positions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the fund’s portfolio, the total assets amount to $928 million, with 99% of it allocated to treasury bills. The fund also holds eight option positions with maturity on 03/05/2026 with strike prices ranging between 5875 and 6250 for the long put options and 6150 to 6425 for the short put options.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179278356473_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"945\" data-height=\"502\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179278356473_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Portfolio holdings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"340\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179278356473_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179278356473_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179278356473_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179278356473_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Portfolio holdings <span>(fund manager)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that the S&amp;P 500 value is around 6890 points, the options are well out of the money. Note that the bull put spread builds upon a bullish narrative by initiating a short put option on a higher strike to maximize the received premium and a long put option on a lower strike to protect from adverse movement in the S&amp;P 500 index. Hence, the maximum profit of the strategy is the net premium received, achieved when options expire OTM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking into the above table, we can notice that the fund received $16.36 per unit in the contract (paid $11.04 and received $27.40). This brings the total net premium proceeds to $553k, given that there are 338 contracts for each position and 100 units per contract. Compared to the total AUM of close to $1 billion, it doesn’t seem like a big gain from the option strategy, but keep in mind that the option contracts are with a weekly expiration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, the main part of the dividend distribution is generated through the T-bills portfolio. So forecasting the future return requires an assumption about the level and the dynamics of the benchmark dollar interest rate over the investment horizon. During the January meeting, the Federal Reserve kept its interest rate unchanged for the first time since September of last year, or in the range of 3.50%-3.75%. The central bank officials seem hesitant to rush with further rate cuts. However, the futures suggest that the main scenario remains further rate cuts. In particular, CME futures currently imply a rate cut of approximately 50 basis points from the current level down to 3.00-3.25% over the next 12-month horizon. However, it should be noted that the change in the Fed chair has increased the uncertainty surrounding the rate outlook.

This creates additional macroeconomic uncertainty, where the quantitative tightening would be combined with interest rate cuts.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179600802166_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"945\" data-height=\"410\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179600802166_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Target rate probabilities for March 2027\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"278\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179600802166_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179600802166_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179600802166_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179600802166_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Target rate probabilities for March 2027 <span>(cmegroup)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's assume that the fund generates a 3.5% return over the next 12 months. Given inflation expectations, such an investment should generate a positive real return. Let's note another important point. CSHI returns are driven predominantly by interest rates and are virtually independent of their movements. The average duration of the securities in its portfolio is close to zero due to the ultra-short T-bills. This essentially excludes interest rate risk, meaning the fund provides an excellent hedge against market volatility.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk factors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund gives exposure to T-bills, which are deemed to be reasonably safe assets. However, due to the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and in case of a recession, the US central bank could resort to sharper interest rate cuts, which could decrease the investment return of the fund’s investors. In addition, the negative macro development and bearish sentiment could disrupt the fund’s option strategy, which is not effective during stock market downturns.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taking the current market expectation regarding the interest rates over the next 12-month horizon, the average rate is still around 3.50%. In addition, the fund could generate good profits from the option strategy. However, it’s hard to make any assumptions regarding the strategy return, but if we annualize the current net premium income, the option overlay could deliver up to a 2.86% return. As a result, I will initiate a Buy recommendation on CSHI, which has the potential to deliver up to a 5% return over the next one-year investment horizon. I find the NEOS Enhanced Income 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF as an attractive investment opportunity, as the fund provides virtually risk-free returns to its holders generated from investing in a portfolio of ultra-short T-bills and enhanced by a low-risk profile put option strategy. As a result, CHSI provides a good opportunity to earn up to a 5% return and hedge market volatility caused by macro and geopolitical uncertainty, an unclear monetary policy path, and record tech valuation. In addition, the fund could be a valuable tool for income investors trying to hedge the purchase of long-term bonds, which are the main beneficiaries of monetary policy normalization, by opening a position in securities with low interest rate risk.</p>",

While retail investors were panicking due to the collapse in the price of gold, COMEX data indicates that investors are accumulating gold options with strike prices of $15,000 and $20,000, and what is most interesting is that this occurred while prices plummeted from $5,600 to less than $5,000. There are more than 11,000 contracts.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59387725-17720423078542852_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"886\" data-height=\"549\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59387725-17720423078542852_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Open Interest\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"397\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59387725-17720423078542852_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59387725-17720423078542852_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59387725-17720423078542852_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59387725-17720423078542852_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Open Interest <span>(Comex, CME, Bloomberg)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In parallel, gold stocks on the Shanghai exchange soared to a record 104 tons.

This week, I bring a new insight, as BofA's survey of fund managers showed for the second month in a row that buying gold is the most crowded investment on the market. It is worth remembering that the great returns in the market usually come from investment theses that are not consensus.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59387725-17720423214836445_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"886\" data-height=\"506\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59387725-17720423214836445_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FMS Survey\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59387725-17720423214836445_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59387725-17720423214836445_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59387725-17720423214836445_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59387725-17720423214836445_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">FMS Survey <span>(BOfa)</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </h2> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the last week, we have seen an additional boost to hard assets due to the US Supreme Court's decision to suspend IEEPA-based tariffs. Gold erased the decline in prices and silver showed a good recovery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this article, I intended to show two very relevant insights about gold. It is interesting to note that robust investors took advantage of the decline in gold prices to bet on extremely high price levels. This occurs as China increases its physical gold stocks to unimaginable levels.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on this analysis, I reiterate the recommendation to buy assets that track the main hard assets, especially gold, as explained in this article. The risk-return ratio of the thesis is still quite attractive, in my opinion.</p>",
